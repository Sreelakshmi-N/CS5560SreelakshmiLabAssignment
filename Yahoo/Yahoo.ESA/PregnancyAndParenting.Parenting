my daughter is mt whenever we go out in public places she screams a lot how can we stop her screaming the best thing to do is not to pay attention to her when she is screaming explain to her that that is bad behavior calmly when she isn't screaming tell her that you will not talk to her if she does that again seriously don't talk to her don't just scare her she is a little more than a year now and is capable of understanding do not underestimate her this is also partly your fault children need exposure to all kinds of places and you have to provide her with that exposure do not put her at home all the time and frequent the outdoors it will help her blossom more beautifully  Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Milton H.

how young is too young to start a childen in ballet or tap classes just so you know she is not quite three and she got the idea in her head a few months ago that she was going to grow up to be a famous dancer so we took her to a day camp thing for little kids and she learned a really easy dance and just fell in love with it but i am just not sure if she is ready to commit to an on going thing like a dance class i got to take a mommy and me class where you take your child as young as years old mom or dad gets to stay and they teach basic moves the kids do it because mom dad is doing it and they just mimic but it is exercise and flexibility plus little girls get to wear their cute tutu's i'd say younger than that and they probably wouldn't sit still focus or understand and if you sent them by themselves at it wouldn't be too productive but if mom dad goes it is usually fun and an intro to dance  The Adventures of Pete & Pete Lindy Hop Irish dance Aerial (dance move) Pok__mon Live!

when you have a baby toddler and you have to go to the bathroom or take a shower do you take them with you or what do you do i was just thinking about this today while i was watching my friends little kid when you have a baby say in one of those slings on you or one of those front pack carriers do you take it off and set them down or take them too or what if you have a crazy toddler who gets into everything i am not a parent yet in case anyone asks i'm and am getting ready to plan a family common sense tells me when you have a baby youd just put them in the swing or something or go while they're sleeping but i dunno about the rest just being curious hahahaha i love this question because i am a sahm and i wish i could go to the bathroom without a toddler banging on the door there are a few things i do i will put him in his crib and give him a book and a toy this usually buys me about minutes for a shower and then i blow dry with him in the room with me i figure if he hates it crying for minutes will not kill him and i can get some privacy while i am washing my ahem never mind i wait until he sleeps when he was younger he would take a morning nap for minutes everyday at a m that was my getting ready time too bad for me he is down to one nap a day when i go the the bathroom i just close the door i am so rude and he cries because he can't be in there with me but again seconds is not going to kill him and he learns that everyone needs some time when all else fails i put him in his highchair turn on his baby einstein and get ready then he really really loves those shows who knew i have heard of people telling their kids to sing them a song through the door while they go to the bathroom my son isn't quite there but i thought that was kind of a creative answer they have something to keep them occupied and you get your time alone  Shaggy dog story Friends Phoebe Buffay's songs Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart The Shining (film) Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Catcher in the Rye 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Columbine High School massacre The Star Wars Holiday Special Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

did i make a parenting error with my year old my dad was over for supper i told him that my daughter had this old friend who wouldn't share her and was putting guit trips and leaving messages on our phone full of drama and how she needed my daughter to call her because she has this huge problem and doesn't my duaghter want to be her friend and she misses my daughter so much and all this very manipulative for a little year old she would ask my daughter so many questions when they talked about where she was going and for how long and on and on so my daughter called her back after many months and said i can't be your friend anymore i have a mom and a borhter and a dog and i just dont' have time and i dont' have to answer your questions ' i told my dad about this and said how proud i was of my daughter my dad looked at me like i was crazy and teaching my daughter to be rude i though i was teaching my daughter to speak her mind and not allow herself to be treated that way am i wrong to be proud of that hey my daughter is not a bitch that is uncalled for and rude from your description it sounds as if this little girl the friend has some problems and needs some support but that is not your child's or your obligation that's an uncomfortable situation for an adult let alone a little girl considering that this friend would most likely not have taken a subtle hint from your daughter i think the direct route was fine and perhaps even necessary you did the right thing supporting your daughter just make sure that she knows that she should always be kind when she is being direct and otherwise i'm not saying she wasn't i'm just saying its a great thing to teach your kids i'm a child and family therapist so for whatever its worth it was a much healthier response for your daughter to tell the little friend she couldn't be there for her this would not have been a healthy friendship she could not really have helped her friend with her extreme needs and it would have drained her and you had she tried having said that if you had any relationship at all with the mother i would encourage you to talk with her about her daughter in a helpful way the likelihood however is that the mom is just an acquaintance which in that case it would be an insult if you said something you and your daughter did the right thing  Social rule Shaggy dog story Friends EastEnders Kodocha About a Boy Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy W.I.T.C.H.

back school question does fathers who pay child support are also responsible to buy clothes or uniforms good brand shoes back pack school supplies my hubby's ex told him that he has to buy all this things i mentioned so the kid yrs can take them home this weekend he is going back home after months in an airplaine but i know that child support is to pay the kids needs hubby send per month i receive chilld support for my daugther but i have never ask for extras besides i don t even use her monye unless it is really necessary most of the money is in her savings account for college or who knows it can be need it in the future i work full time so as my hubby we hace other kids thank god we do good kids have what they need a little more but i don't think this is a must at least i will not ask my daugthers father for more i receive the same amount per month is this a must or no any advices thanks in advance if you are able to put the support you receive for your daughter then it sounds as if you are a fairly well off family that is good because you know your kids are getting what they need for school and they will be able to go to college etc etc so even though your stepson lives elsewhere it sounds as though you could afford a little extra to make sure he has what he needs for school as well don't get me wrong but i am the full time parent of my son and he goes to visit dad over the summer as well and i have a minimal income right now so if my ex can afford the school supplies i won't complain however it is not a requirement unless it was part of the court ruling which is possible because when my current hubby got his divorce that judge had him paying for everything have your hubby look over the divorce papers to make sure and then decide as a family if helping with the extra costs of back to school is more a benefit to your stepson or to his mother and i say don't send cash but you could shop online and have it shipped directly to your stepsons home because that is probably a lot cheaper than sending extra items on the airplane  Child support Divorce About a Boy Life insurance Credit card FairTax Laura Schlessinger Money Social Security (United States) Friends Sears Holdings Corporation Fathers' rights Student loan Internet fraud Flat tax Wal-Mart Personal finance Theory of conduct The Amazing Race Craps United Kingdom corporation tax Babylonian law Episodes of Lost (Season 1) MapleStory Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Microeconomics Saved by the Bell Annuity Doug Humphrey Bogart 1957 World Series Neighbours Gross domestic product Neopets Daylight saving time Monetary policy Health insurance Back to the Future Fathers' rights movement in the UK Appeal SCO-Linux controversies Politics of Canada Betting (poker) CPU cache Bond Poker jargon School choice RuneScape economy Boy Scouts of America The Apprentice 2 Ethical consumerism British monarchy The Catcher in the Rye GSM services Shaggy dog story Mortgage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sweatshop Public transport Boston and Lowell Railroad The Family from One End Street Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China 613 mitzvot Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Productive and unproductive labour Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Mary Astor Tesco Wedding Crashers Santa Claus Stock Animal Crossing Kyoto Protocol $ale of the Century Commodity Hyperinflation Crew Exploration Vehicle Good Times Customs and etiquette of Japan Surveillance Commodity markets Externality Unemployment Education in Germany Hybrid vehicle Charles Ponzi Final Fantasy XI Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Anarchism and capitalism Miss Saigon Luke Skywalker Status of religious freedom in Malaysia The Legend of Zelda series characters Economics

why do parents respect and treat better the son that cheats uses and lies to them the one that brings pregnant tramps home neither and i can assure you none of mine would turn out that way and if they did they'd be living on the street and ellie i'm sorry your life turned out that you were the neglected child but when you have kids of your own you will understand why they try so much to save the bad apple a teacher once said to me that he was only as good as his worst student meaning i think that reaching that one student is more worthwhile than the ones who can fend for themselves and make it i think your parents knew you would be ok in life but it was heartbreaking to them to not be able to save your brother it's sad they became totally absorbed in him and neglected you and i try to explain to my kids too sometimes why my focus may be more on one of them than the other it's not that i don't love one less it's that another needs me more but i try to spend my time equally with them all and make sure they all get what they need it isn't always easy  Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Boston Public One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Catechism Infantilism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Life and Times of Juniper Lee EastEnders Polyamory Knots Landing The Fairly OddParents Son Gohan Child abuse True Crime: Streets of LA The Isley Brothers Current teachings of Prem Rawat For Better or For Worse Phoebe Halliwell Hey Arnold!

question for parent of or more kids i have a yr old daughter and i just found out last week were expecting again we have been trying to have another baby my question is how did all of you make the transition from child to how hard and stressful was it how did your first child react and how long did it take for everything to settle down and to get things in a schedule id like to hear everyones stories and advice im due april th so my daughter will be about months old then it is good to have the first two close together that way there is minimal jealousy get things ready practice with a doll so your little one is included make sure she holds feeds changes and reads to the doll just like you will to your new baby when s he comes when the baby arrives make sure your daughter is included while you nurse she can nurse her doll when you bathe the baby she can bathe the doll etc and above all make sure she gets some one on one time with you and your husband different times as well as all together so she knows she is still special teach her that she is the big girl not a baby she can help by fetching diapers bath accessories etc if you do all of this your transition won't be too hard because although two little ones is a bit more work everyone will have positive feelings instead of the negative ones that come when mom is too tired to pay any attention at all to the older child except to say no and feed and change her when i transitioned to two children my older child was already three he was not so easy to bring onboard he wanted his sister to be returned from wherever we got her animosity reigned between the two as they grew up too with lots of fights all because of jealousy well she adored him but he would do a lot of hitting and teasing and when his two other siblings came along he continued to terrorize them i think three years is too long to allow a child to think the world revolves around him the earlier you have the second one the better and don't do what i did allow the older one a lot more independence so you can focus all of your attention on the new one i did it all wrong and would not do it that way again as far as schedules they work themselves out with baby number just as easy as with baby number two babies are a lot to handle all day every day plan some time to get away for a weekend if you can and during the day take those babies to mommy and me classes so you can have some adult conversation sure it's all about child rearing but it is adult conversation  Breastfeeding Infantilism EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Social rule Urinary incontinence Kodocha Jon Secada The Adventures of Pete & Pete Spice Girls Infant Child sexuality Rugrats Craps Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series My Little Pony Mary Cassatt Avenue Q Hollyoaks Romulus and Remus Knots Landing Characters in the Smurfs Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Another World (TV series) Transactional analysis Kimi Finster Pitaten Neighbours School bus Second language acquisition 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Family from One End Street Childbirth Britney Spears Shaggy dog story Laura Schlessinger Guiding Light Hilary Duff Billboard Hot 100 Cindy Sheehan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Love Hina main characters Slow Train Coming Comanche Ayyavazhi mythology Hermione Granger W.I.T.C.H.

daughter acting do u think it's ok to let my year old daughter act in plays that don't associate with school my daughter really loves to be in musicals she was in the play olvier and she was also in the wizard of oz and she really wanted to be in grease but was to young so she was sorta sad about that but she was also in the play of the sound of music and she said it was her favorite one to be in but my mom doesn't aggree with this she says that it could make her life horrible one day which i don't get sure if it's not interfering with her school or any other obligations then i think it's a great creative way for her to spend her time who knows she might end up being the next meryl streep or insert whatever actress is your favorite  Meryl Streep Adaptation.

i have sons ages years and months i also have an year old step son the year old is visiting for the next month and my boys haven't seen each other for about a year due to us living a significant distance from his mother before he came to visit my boys were really close and now that he is here my year old ditches my baby to play with his brother i understand that that is probably natural seeing as though they are pretty close and a lot closer in age and to have a little year old hanging around isn't cool but my year old is really upset by this i honestly think that he considers himself to be a big kid usually he follows older kids around and just doesn't play like a baby he wants to be a big boy but like i was saying my baby is really upset everytime they go to ride bikes or whatever and he can't go because he doesn't have a bike but even when they are in the house they will go in their room and close the baby out even though that is his room too and i am just looking for some advice on how to deal with this situation how can i get them all to play yes i do get upset because my baby is upset when they go outside he tries to follow them out of the door and he's screaming and crying and having a tempertantrum everytime they leave them i know they aren't going to be the best of friends but my year old was really close to my year old before and now that the year old came on friday my year old gives him no attention at all i have been trying to spend extra time with him but it's not the same he doesn't want me he wants his brother i'm looking for some suggestions of things that they can all do together so my year old can cope with this a little better my husband and i have a lot of family nights we all sit down at the table and play games we have a lot of games that are for ages four and up and two and up and the older kids can play them and the younger ones sit in our laps and help us play but it's time that we're all spending together as a family also if they want to ride bikes together i think that's ok they are older and they shouldn't have to suffer their play time just because they have a baby sibling but when they go in the bed room the door needs to stay open especially because the bedroom is the younger kids' too  Friends EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Silent Night, Deadly Night The Lovely Bones Social rule Kyle Broflovski Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

what do you think when you see a child or a teenager cuss drink and smoke in the presence of their parents i wonder how a parent would allow their child to cuss drink and smoke in their presence not only that they allow them to have their girlfriends and boyfriends spend the night also they have the nerve to tell their parents what they ain't going to do i am over and to this day when my parents tell me to do something i do it no back talk or anything i would never form my mouth to cuss in front of my parents i would still be wearing the handprint accross my bottom then you see the gross disrespect for adults i could not act up in school because the teacher would get my butt then i would get it again when i got home before anyone says that i don't know what it is to be a parent i am a parent of a year old and we do not tolerate disrespect in our home or to other adults what goes through your mind when you see all that parents are letting their kids get away with nowadays i'm and pregnant with my first my two younger brothers and i would have never done that stuff growing up my husband and i won't tolerate it out of our child yes my brothers and i fought like any siblings will but we respected adults and generally did what we were supposed to occasionally if we back talked we go in big trouble we knew not to mess with mom or dad or there would be consequences we are now and and none of us has ever been in any real trouble my parents have even told me that they feel lucky and blessed to have had such good kids i think it's irresponsible to let your kids drink smoke and excessively cuss in front of you if they get away with doing that in front of their parents imagine what they do when alone with friends and no supervision parents need to be the ones to step up and teach their kids what is right and what is wrong because no one else is going to do it for them i've heard parents say i'd rather them do that with me then where i have no idea what's going on but if you allow them to do it with you they will just do worse when you are not there but of course what do i know i'm just a year old i know there are people who won't agree with me but this is my opinion  Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q Friends Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Recurring South Park characters About a Boy The Adventures of Pete & Pete 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Infantilism Boston Public The Catcher in the Rye The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Great Teacher Onizuka EastEnders Kodocha Calvin and Hobbes The Smoking Room The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Hollyoaks The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Witches (Discworld) My Life as a Teenage Robot Once and Again FLCL Springfield Elementary School Malcolm in the Middle For Better or For Worse Teachers (film) Doug George Costanza Raisins (South Park episode) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Milton H.

i'm in need of serious advise my daughter will be next month and when i get with my husband she was months old we have never told her that she was adopted by him but in the last few weeks this lady that we know has mentioned it to her a few times now she hasn't questioned us about it but i feel we should tell her before she hears it from someone else my husband is upset that i want to tell her because he said he sees her as his own child and doesnt want to tell her i've made the decision to tell her and i just dont know how to go about doing it has anyone had any situations like this or did this happen to you and how did you handle it my reasoning for telling her is that if she does find out from someone else i think it'll be better she hears it from us and with her being so young i dont think it'll affect as much if she was in her teens i just realized i can't spell advice lol ok first off this woman had no right in the world to tell your daughter that kind of stuff what the heck was she thinking people need to worry about their own selves and not everyone else secondly your daughter is a very smart mature person im sure but you have to look at it this way shes still young if your worried about how she'd feel about the situation then talk to her about it let her continue to grow up and help her learn that a father isnt always about genetics teach her that if she were to ever find out like if she needed blood or medical wise it would be a very bad time for her to find out if she grows up thinking she is related to him by blood it will be harder to understand the truth if she were to find out which would really make her confused and i dont think you'd want her to go through that just be honest at first it takes a great person to step in as a father to someone elses child your hubby has a kind heart that she already knows but teach her how great of a father he really is by telling the truth theres no worries theres no lies theres just trust and love even though it doesnt start out that way at first your daughter is young and i promise you its the best thing to do show her just how much she and you are loved  One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Infantilism Theory of conduct Kodocha Social rule Milton H.

goals and dreams but no available help what are some soloutions i am working on graduating with my bachlors two more semseters attending grad school right after i graduate w bachlors paying down debt only owe thousand and becoming a home owner which shouldn't be hard after meeting the above goals however my biggest problem leading up to competing all of these is lack of safe affordable and reliable child care my kids are and the more i work help food stamps childcare payments is taken away or unaffordable b c they are income based making my goal less of a reality childcare is a major barrier and i have no help of any kind from anyone my family lives hrs aways and everyone else i know knows that i could use the help but since i look ok on the outside they do not offer and if they do it is because i beg i just want to be happy and self suffient why can't i just get the help i need why are people so mean when it comes to helping out if someone volunteered to help it would make so much of a difference in my life if childcare is not within your budget as a single parent there should be some kind of state help available there the government usually wants to encourage people into work not make it financially impossible the only way to achieve your dream is to pay for childcare you could wait until your youngest is in school so that then all you are paying for is pre and after school care rather than full time daycare for your youngest you can't just rely on other people to volunteer to help it doesn't work like that no one ever volunteered to help me i have just had to tough it out and find a way  Childcare Day care Philosophical skepticism Unemployment Division of labour Graduate school Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China Credit card Alcoholics Anonymous Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Freeters Tax Economy of the United States Education in Japan Economy of Russia Divorce Life insurance Child support Israeli Arab Economic inequality Anarchism and society Fathers' rights Psychoanalysis Insurance Pitaten Education in the United States Bretton Woods system Avenue Q Abortion in the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton Rudolf Steiner Weimar Republic Adoption American Red Cross Annuity Great Depression Gold standard Canadian and American economies compared Teenage pregnancy Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kibbutz Capitalism Salary cap Keynesian economics Food Stamp Program Miss Saigon Sento Health insurance FairTax May 2005 in Canada AIDS in Africa Personal finance Mortgage Altruism Transactional analysis Poverty Fiat money Anthroposophy W.I.T.C.H.

don't know who the biological father is and i wanna adopt my stepson i been with my girl since my step son was months old he is now and we plan on getting married later this year for her birthday how do i go about adopting him if there's no biological father at all do i got to get a lawyer for this and are there cheap lawyers for stuff like this where in texas minutes outside houston my step son was months old when i meet my girl he is years old now my husband adopted my two children so i know the laws here fairly well they vary from state to state but in general you will need to get a lawyer to file all the papers for you usually this will require that you make a good faith effort and the judge decides if you have met this obligation to find the child's biological father to get permission if you do find the father chances are he will sign off his rights immediately and you won't have a problem there even if he refuses to do so since he hasn't been in the child's life he won't have a leg to stand on in the eyes of the court if you can't discover the real father's identity you will have to pay for an attorney ad lidum to represent his interests in the court and of course that is significantly more expensive you will also have to wait for at least a year after you are married before you can start the process the court may also order that social services investigate your home and your relationship with the child but since you have been in the child's life this long you may be able to skip this step the process took months for us but if you can't find the father it will probably take longer for you it cost us about good luck getting all this done email if you have any other questions  Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Lawyer Marriage Supreme Court of the United States Fathers' rights Child support Abortion debate Legal aspects of transsexualism Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Law of the People's Republic of China 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Roe v.

what is your opinion on the madd proposal to make it mandatory to equip all cars with breathalizers that won't let the car start until you have taken it and passed i don't know how any parent can object to this idea i personally love it i cannot believe people are saying things like there are ways to get around it of course there are going to be ways around it but isn't that the case with everything that is like saying we might as well legalize drugs because there will always be people who get away with using drugs without getting caught i think that some people know that they're driving drunk and do it anyway but i also think that there are many people who think that may be just be buzzed and not realize that they are in fact drunk this device can show the person that he she is indeed drunk and keep that person from driving true people can have their friends blow in it for them i don't think most people realize how drunk that person that they're getting into the car with actually is maybe if they driver asks the passenger in the car to blow in it for him her it will make the passenger realize how drunk the driver is and offer to drive instead who knows but why not give it a chance i am willing to support anything that can reduce the number of alcohol related deaths in our country if a person does not drink and drive then i have no idea why they would have a problem with a device like this  Mothers Against Drunk Driving Drunk driving (United States) Driver's license Bus accident at Carrollton, Kentucky in 1988 Knots Landing Automobile Alcoholics Anonymous Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bluetooth Speed limit Drug test Social rule Consensual crime Driving under the influence Alcoholism Floppy disk Road traffic accident Taxicab About a Boy Sin City Suicide methods Seat belt Manual transmission Chris Amon The Critic Mach kernel Airbag Ontological argument Personal rapid transit Initial D Indianapolis 500 Harm reduction Ayrton Senna Rules of the road Transsexuality Carburetor Drag racing Blood alcohol content Intelligent design Seat belt legislation The Human Stain Abortion debate Formula One regulations Jacky Ickx Hard disk Brian Griffin Expert system Driving Grandview, U.S.A.

what good does it do what are we teaching our children by bickering about which way to discipline a child is correct or which parent is wrong by doing different things its a debate that has been going on for many decades now and will continue to go on regardless of what we think isnt the whole point to get advice on problems and talk to other parents on how to be more responsible and caring parents instead of pointing fingers about who is doing bad and who is doing good i think that the whole parenting world would be different if we could stop pointing fingers and start working together it sounds so cliche to say we should all work together and support each other and all that but in some ways that is what should be happening if all we do is point fingers and place blame then we will never grow however there are some instances where a parent needs to be called out immediately because they are doing something bad this is probably a lot less frequent but unfortunately this will never change  Theory of conduct Milton H.

to all parents who think it's ok to spank please read the link http www cnn com health nfm spanking index html there are many many others like this available for all to read yet still people cannot see the truth there's no point trying to talk about a difference between spankings and abuse the results of all these studies talk about spanking not physical abuse although some may argue that spanking is in fact abuse my it is genuinely sad the way people are unable to understand such an easy concept i guess it goes to prove the theory that spanking children really does harm them as all the answers from spankers shows an ignorance and sadly a determination to keep on abusing their children and not learning how to be a proper parent oh and yes i have children all together only is still at home all of them are doing excellently well as they were brought up correctly i am obviously unable to choose a best answer as none of them speak any sense but i will add a link to parenting without spanking and hopefully at least some people will read it and learn from it http wwwparenting ivillage com tp tpbehavior r html me you're very defensive and spending a lot of time revising your answer for someone who is so sure that what they're doing is right remember i'm only putting the question out there you are choosing to respond to it over and over again that's fine i welcome your input but is it me who's shoving my opinion down everyone elses throat 'olschoolmom' i would expect nothing more from you i've read your views on spanking before i pity your children and only hope someone reports you before it's too late for them okay glenda i don't listen to all these studies in which try to force people to believe what they believe i definitely don't listen to people like you who try to force others to think the same way you do you probably don't even have kids yourself all those studies and articals say the same thing over and over kids who are spanked are anti social violent little bullies who don't care about their actions when truly it's the exact opposite the kids who don't have any discipline and have best friends for parents rather than just parents first then best friends next are the ones who are that way why do you think so many kids and teenagers run around screaming at their parents disrepecting them and not being afraid of any consequences which leads them to not care about their actions are you blind enough not to see that there are so many people who look down on spanking today not just spanking is the problem everything besides talking time outs and grounding is considered child abuse so do you think this is just a coincidence i compare myself to me and my friend i was spanked rarely but spanked and my friend was not i respect my elders never got in real trouble with the law or at school never been suspended have lots of friends a happy person never been in a fist fight never went as far as a lot of kids have gone where people just throw it off as a phase wheras my friend was never spanked has hit his mother cussed her out on a daily basis tells her to shut up a very violent person who has even hit me and other friends he has has been in trouble with the police numerous of times even went as far as to bribe a police officer and got in trouble for that when you tell him to do better he just says i'm not scared of nobody and where do you think he got that idea because i know for a fact she even told me and wishes she has done differently that his mother didn't want him to fear the consequences and respect out of being his mommy's best friend evidently it doesn't work like that yet so many people want to try that and they end up with a devil on their hands so are you interested in spouting more of your little studies and articals at me kids were spanked for years and years and there was no time outs and groundings and all that stuff are you saying that every kid in the world turned out to be violent anti social little bullies how about you raise your kids who are probably nonexistant the way you want to see where they end up good for you if they end up to be little angels and let other people raise their kids their way it is none of yours or the government or the people who come up with those crappy studies and articals business in anyway how other people discipline their kids  Theodicy Plame

what do you think of the show super nanny i was flipping through the channels last night and came apon it after reading some many comments on here about it and people refering to it i decided to watch it for a few minutes what do you think of it i find humor in how parents can't control their kids so they look for people like supernanny to get their kids in line for them it's the same thing over and over kids running around screaming beating up on eachother cussing etc and the parents are like please don't do that it is not okay and supernanny comes in with her only discipline tecnique which has to do with time outs whether it is naughty corner chair rug bench stair room pond etc goes on and on and on it amazes me how people can't seem to control their kids nowadays it really does and what amuses me more is people use supernanny as a reason to not do other types of discipline apparently they don't realize how much reality tv is edited to make you believe stuff no spoiled brat turns into a little angel in an hour worth of time and time outs definitely do not work on every children so i bet the ones supernanny couldn't fix aren't even aired on tv supernanny is just an amusing show that i finally got bored of because it's the same exact thing over and over  Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Amazing Race The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milton H.

how to nicely say your kids are monsters okay i won't use that as my reason but still some wording help please i babysit kids aged and they are complete monsters in therapy troubled emotionally disturbed learning disabled on top of two families coming together with a death of a parent on one side and an abusive mother on the other i just cannot do it i'm not qualified don't have the experience plus you can't talk to these parents because they always have an excuse for the kids behavior they had a bad home life his dad died i mean sad yes but not an excuse to break a kids finger in summer school or choke your sister how do i nicely say not only do i not want to stay at your house with them for days while youre on your honeymoon but i never want to watch your kids again i want to say it nicely and professionally how to do that another thing i assume i should give weeks notice like any other job or just hey don't come back tomorrow which i would prefer lol sigh i think that you definately need to get yourself out of that situation especially if you have already tried to talk to the parents and it's just not working the one thing that i've learned over the years of working is that if you're miserable at work then you can bring that misery home with you there's nothing worse than dreading going to work everyday and wishing you could be somewhere else i would give them my two weeks notice and let them know that you have tried everything that you can to make the situation work for you but that you just feel as though your not qualified enough to take care of children with such special needs unfortunately these children have been through a lot in their young lives but it looks like the parents need to take more responsibility in helping them rather than just making excuses for them  Domestic violence Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Transsexuality Milton H.

please help why doesn't my son listen okay well my son is ending his terrible twos on october th and i'm sure it'll become terrible threes my son has been getting worse he won't do simple things like pull up his pants put his shoes on turn off the t v he's sooo hard headed i just can't get through to him he's a smart kid but so hard headed what can i do he also pushes his sister right infront of me and time out is not working neither is ignoring me what can i do please help twos and three's are always loads of fun children are testing you to see how far they can push you before you snap if you are not an advocate of spanking a child then its up to you to find alterior ways to get him to listen young children often find things easier to deal with and listen better when you make things like dressing and other small chores fun make games of doing things like putting on his cloths and helping mommy with household stuff to help him learn the importance of doing things like turning off the television cleaning up his toys and being nice to his sister as for being hard headed the best way i have found to deal with a child like that i have three is to be hard headed right back you say he ignores you and doesnt pay attention to time out and taking things away from him well next time he demands a drink or wants something that is not a necessity ignore him for a few moments when he gets frustrated sit him down and explain to him that he didnt like being ignored or you not doing what he wanted you to do tell him that mommy doesnt like it when he does it to her either if he wants something extra from you he is going to have to do the things you ask as well when dealing with a toddler ages until about you have to be firm in your stand deal punishment out as soon as he doesn't listen or breaks a rule i know it sounds harsh but when he pushes his sister push him back he will learn that its not fun and everytime he does it he gets it done to him and he will eventually stop children learn by example most do not realize at young ages that pushing biting hitting kicking can actually cause pain if you do the same back to him dont hurt him but let him feel what his sister or the other child did he will figure out that its not as fun as he thought it was a tap on the diaper will get his attention and make him listen to you nothing as harsh as a spanking of course but kinda like swatting at a bug or something that may have landed on him soft but firm to get his attention he will act like his heart is broken but when he realizes mommy is not going to put up with his behavior and that he doesnt like the consequences he will stop or slow this behavior make sure you let him know and keep reminding him you love him but you are the mommy and he has to listen to what you tell him be firm be consistant and be loving but do not give in to his behavior just to make him happy or because you are worried he may think you dont love him a child who is shown discipline in their young life grows to understand and respect their parents more as they get older  Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Pitaten Spanking Aerial (dance move) Blood on the Tracks Milton H.

visitation rights etc advice please after some advice from you all my partner of years walked out on me i am months preganant with his rd child and our sons months ago he is and with a year old girl who has a year ols son herself not his and has social services involved with her child since getting with this girl my ex has threatened to try for custody of our children or rights to them my eldest son is and has decided himself he doesnt love daddy etc my other son is and doesnt really understand they have seen their father physically hurt me to the point where my eldest would sometimes say stop hurting mummy and all of his attitude he has let the kids down by lying saying he would buy them things and doesnt etc during our relationship he didnt help out with the kids to the point where if i was at work and our youngest pooed he wouldnt change him and leave him like it used to get very moody with them over small things etc he does not pay me maintenance for them either in my opinion i think it would be in the childrens best interst if he stayed away as all the will learn from him is violence abuse how to lie and be let down by him he never worked during the years i was with him and i dont think its right for my kids to go near a girl who has social services envolved with her own son advice please anyone else been in this situation he also does not care one bit about the baby and wont even let him have his surname when hes born one thing i am fed up to the back teeth of is people telling me i am telling my son not to love his father because i am not i still love their father so why would i try and turn them against him my point is they have seen him hurt me threaten me turn up at the house at all hours etc they even saw him tell his new g f and her sister to sort me out and one of them come flying at me with them in the car he is old enough to see what his father has done and is doing i saw similar when i was younger and still has visions of it to this day so no i am not telling my kids what to do or influencing them also since being gone he has made no effort to ring me and ask how the kids are talk to them and within the last month has seen them once for min and i had to travel miles for him to do that i love hockey how dare you suggest i am a bad mum my ex never ever hurt the children and all i have ever done is out my children first and tried to make my relationship work with their father so they wouldnt end up like me and him with parents that have split up my children have and always do come first if you have never been in this kind of situation how can u judge if i was a danger to my children dont you think i would have social services or something envolved and just for the book i havent people are making this more complicated that it needs to be let me make it simple he has not held a job for almost years and you have not only done that but more or less raised your children on your own any judge with half a brain won't even consider giving him custody and they'd have to be brain dead to consider giving custody to the girlfriend it won't happen they will make him pay child support but if he can't hold a job don't ever count on actually getting the money due most women never do shame on you for waiting for him to leave you you should have left him abuse is never okay and if there is anything that will harm you in the court proceedings it will be on questioning why you endangered your children and self by staying in an abusive relationship if he is dangerous the children shouldn't be allowed around him and you can bring this up to the court so that his visits will be supervised by child services or the court system  Divorce About a Boy Fathers' rights Knots Landing EastEnders Atomic Kitten Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Pitaten Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Child support 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Charmed Breastfeeding Infantilism Theory of conduct Marriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Smallville (Season 4) Laura Schlessinger The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Phoebe Halliwell Transactional analysis Boston Public The Human Stain Little Britain The Shining (film) Sin City Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dog training Scenes from a Memory The Amber Spyglass Avenue Q Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Miss Saigon Sharon Tate W.I.T.C.H.

does anyone know how to get a mother to care for her child a mother of three went to england with the two normal children and left the retarded one in jamaica with her dad who is now dead which the mom is aware of but refuses to take resposibility for the retarded child who doesnt really have anyone to care for her the childrens homes says shes too old for them to take her how can i get the mom to leave england and care for her shes with an old lady who took her while her father was hospitalized now the lady is stressed out i am not in a position to help besides searching for info for the old lady the child is y o but she acts like a y o i gues thats the level her brain is at no one can contact the mom or the other two sisters in england when the dad died she changed her address and contact number so no one would be able to contact her neither of them are british citizens there is nothing that the jamaican government is willing to do to help or so they say i don't understand who is looking after the child now you say she was left with the father but he's now dead so who's looking after her now and how old is she and who is this mother in relation to you not enough info here sounds like a sad situation though edit ok so she's with a well meaning old lady who now has her hands pretty full that's really sad do some research into care homes for older children in the area there must be places who can take her if her own mother doesn't want to know there's nothing you can do to make her look after her if she's capable of abandoning her own child she's clearly not the kind of mother who would do a good job anyway there may be a way of making her financially responsible for the care costs however it might be worth getting some legal advice for the old lady who is looking after her now tell the lady to see a lawyer who might specialise in cases like this the fact that the mother is out of the country however will make it harder to enforce any rulings worth a try though  Fathers' rights Hillary Rodham Clinton Adoption Divorce Intelligence quotient Unemployment Pitaten British nationality law Fathers' rights movement in the UK Kodocha 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Grandview, U.S.A.

would you choose a sitter that is more expensive certified and has lots of experience but a clashing personality lack of communication and watches a lot of kids or a sitter that is less expensive has no experience watches less kids but better communication about your child i would choose the second one for a few simple reasons we all have to start somewhere we don't start experienced and i think that communication is very important in child raising and would be needed for me less children means that your child gets more attention which is what you are paying for and just because she costs less money doesn't mean that she isn't as good  Trip sitter Gross domestic product Economics Supply and demand Extreme Programming Microeconomics FairTax Inflation Ra (board game) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Poker jargon Rich Mullins Health insurance Tariff Theory of conduct Theodicy School choice Child support Parachuting Philosophical skepticism Daria Ethical consumerism Surveillance Adoption Galactic Civilizations Surplus value Aes Sedai Kender Freeters Procrastination Tax Cost Personal rapid transit Insurance Hyperinflation Labor theory of value Education in the People's Republic of China Randomness Flat tax Social rule The nature of God in Western theology About a Boy Dorama Infantilism Codename: Kids Next Door Education in the United States Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Initial D Education in Germany School of Salamanca Diseconomies of scale Divorce Goodness and value theory Ben Johnson (athlete) Michel Henry Advance fee fraud Garth Brooks Simple living Parasite singles Craps Drug test Credit card Bulk vending Digimon Life insurance W.

how much education should be on the part of the parent here's the background my daughter's daycare is a place where the children have been together since their first year it is wonderful the kids are happy safe and actually look forward to it the parents have bonded and we do many things together outside of the school they do learn in themes but their themes may be butterflies or growing things etc this year many parents started pulling their children out of daycare because as they attempted to enroll their children in kindergarten they were told the children did not have the skills needed to start i e letters numbers shapes i feel that if she is happy and safe i can pick up the slack at home by teaching her letters and numbers i am a teacher and know what to teach and how so now my friends and i are at odds because i think that some education is part of the parent's job what do you think i also run into this problem in my school there are only so many hours in the day to teach i am a first grade teacher i agree with you if your child is happy there why ruin a good thing parents today are often lazy and assume that the school is responsible for everything i have had parents tell me it is my job to teacher their kids how to behave properly not the parent just look over the list of needed skills for kindergarten and work on those at home  Kindergarten Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Hong Kong Education in the United States Avenue Q Education in Germany Education in Australia Murdock-Portal Elementary School Education in Taiwan Kodocha Education Waldorf Education Education in Japan Homeschooling Kender Boston Public Primary education One Tree Hill (TV series) No Child Left Behind Act School choice Teacher Hikikomori Grade (education) The Fairly OddParents The Catcher in the Rye Education reform Education in South Korea Culture of the United States Charter school Education in India Milton H.

if you suspect a family member of neglect endangerment quick history my sister in law and her husband bought a small house in a small town the house was condemned when they bought it so they paid cash and got it very cheap this was several years ago and they've since had two kids and months they're always telling us how horrible their house is and they won't let anyone visit because they're afrait that cpc will find out which makes me think that cpc should find out would you call them if you were me they aren't excellent parents anyway the kids drink kool aid constantly instead of milk sometimes their mom forgets to fix lunch until in the afternoon and the kids just end up sleeping until dinner etc i'm wondering if i'm doing a disservice to my niece and nephew by not calling or if i'd be stinking my nose where it doesn't belong if i did call what would you do hello i would not stay out of this i would contact cps child protective services immediately with my concerns i am sorry but no matter how cheap a house is children deserve to live in a clean and well repaired house period end of story there are many services to help parents out including wic food stamps and even help from the local dhs department of human services agency that could help them find churches or organizations that can help them repair their house at little or no cost i am sorry and i will probably get flamed for saying this but children deserve to have the best start possible in life and by your sister in law not taking proper care of them it is just inexcusable and neglectful do you have any idea how many childless couples would love to have such precious babies as these and these childless couples would make sure that they had a good roof over their head plenty of nourishing meals to eat and they would receive lots of love and care too i am not trying to sound catty by saying that but children really are a gift and it is our responsibility as parents to do the very best for them that we can i would call cps and it is anonymous so you wouldn't have to give your name or anything but you will have to state to cps what you have observed or what is going on such as alleged neglect abuse etc i don't think you are sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong you care about these children and you know that this just isn't right so it would be a good idea to talk to cps and state your concerns to them about these children you had better believe if it was my nieces or nephews if i noticed and knew that something like this was going on i would call cps because they deserve so much better than being neglected and not getting the proper meals or proper beverages such as milk and water that they need to have also they deserve to live in a clean house that is safe and isn't falling apart  Humphrey Bogart The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Kodocha Shaggy dog story Pitaten Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Theory of conduct Rent (musical) Fathers' rights Recurring South Park characters Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Charmed Little Britain Fiddler on the Roof Friends Breath of Fire III Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Abortion debate Fecal incontinence Tooth Babylonian law Marriage Knots Landing Marie Antoinette Breakfast The Smoking Room Survivor (novel) Theodicy Hannibal Lecter Yusuf al-Qaradawi The Amber Spyglass Calvin and Hobbes Child support 613 mitzvot Miss Saigon Adoption Codename: Kids Next Door Marilyn Monroe Phoebe Halliwell Karl Rove Food Garfield Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Fairly OddParents Malcolm in the Middle Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Marshall Mathers LP Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Rais massacre Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Baby Blues Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Roy Meadow Elephant Too Short a Season (TNG episode) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Characters in the Smurfs Beetle in an Anthill Ocean's Twelve RuneScape quests Honey and Clover Poker jargon Dairy AFI 100 Years series Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S__vign__ Make money fast Rich Mullins Tea Jean Schmidt Hillary Rodham Clinton Justification (theology) Meal The Human Stain Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The Death Gate Cycle Series finale Polyamory Plame affair timeline Married... with Children The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Cha chaan teng Bruce Johnson

to the parents whom spank how many of you have thought about your actions and have at least considered using discipline over fear to teach your children it would be a joy to hear that at least some people have thought better of using violence against their own children sunny i didn't ask a question about spanking being banned we're all very defensive aren't we i'll bet you probably wish you could spank me how will you get your way with only words right leslie k that scenario wouldn't happen because my children are under my control and not running all over the place not like those little hooligans you see whose parents think a slap is good enough nope my children weren't taken away from me all but one are grown up now and doing excellently i'm just giving my opinions and asking questions call it curiosity and the fact that i care about children not being raised with fear sometimes its absolutely vital to gain there attention but i think they should stop early my parents stopped when i was about yrs old and they just started showing us they were disappointed and allowed us to make the right choice and i dont know if it was luck but times outta we did we talked about everything openly and they became more of advisers and guidance than just mom and dad i wouldnt say they tried to be our friend because no parent should ever do that they just talked to us like we were people and they treated us like they knew we were capable of doing the right thing and they accepted the fact that we were going to make mistakes i greatly appreciate this because i have strong morals and i am confident enough to know i can make the right decisions  Spanking Theory of conduct Religion Shaggy dog story Theodicy Abortion debate Motion picture rating system Fathers' rights God Emperor of Dune Infantilism Philosophical skepticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Blonde on Blonde Child sexuality Social rule Corporal punishment James Dobson Fred Phelps Time Out of Mind Transsexuality Plame affair Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

advice from parents who spank please have you ever tried to stop spanking completely if so did you stick at it or go back to spanking if you did stick at it what punishments did you use in the place of spankings thanks i stopped as my boys got older below ten i feel that sometimes a spank is helpful even though i really don't believe in it once they get to ten they are bigger and what happens is that you have to hit them harder to have an effect and that is just not good the best three principles of punishments to help correct behavior the threat of a punishment is more effective than the punishment itself take away a priviliege that they really want which means you have to know your kids pretty well the logical consequence is the best punishment of all always think creatively to see if there is a logical consequence there frequently is for instance if the room is not straightened up then you are not going out when friends call because your work is not done that sort of thing also use incentives my wife was big on point charts where certain things had to get done and then a reward or activity could happen we had three boys so the system was constantly evolving i couldn't even keep up with my point chart  Spanking Corporal punishment Utilitarianism Theory of conduct Punishment Humphrey Bogart Domestic violence Incest A Course In Miracles Efficiency wages The Catcher in the Rye Goodness and value theory Erotic spanking Extreme Programming Motivation Pinball Cliff Richard Principal-agent problem Ethics Blood on the Tracks Doug Theodicy Philosophy of language Spice Girls Summa Theologiae Dog training One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.

adults only i asked similar question have any parents this done before allow their children to watch them once my kid saw us my husband allowed the kid to watch us having sex he said in this way the kid will learn about sexuality has any parents done this before was my husband wrong or right i'm all for leading by example and being a positive influence to your children but what you and your husband have done is absurd i think you and your husband crossed the line and although at the time you might think you were doing a good deed it was damaging and probably traumatic to your child this is a form of abuse because there is a time an place you clearly were way out of line talking about sex to children should be age appropriate that way they could have a better understanding children have innocence and you just violated that and became pedophiles how does it feel to be sex offenders because that is exactly what you are i am appalled you would even ask if this was morally right knowing damn well you and your husband were wrong and used bad judgment and poor taste besides the shame and guilt you might be feeling you should be counting your blessings you and your husband aren't lead away in handcuffs  Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Pedophilia Childlove movement Infantilism Rape About a Boy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Child pornography Child sexuality Child sexual abuse Abortion debate Spanking Incest Excommunication Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Marriage Laura Schlessinger Narcissism Sexual abuse Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Age of consent Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion and sexuality Same-sex marriage Guilt Sin Children of God A Series of Unfortunate Events Motion picture rating system Boston Public Television rating system Dissociative identity disorder Iago Transactional analysis Education Human sexual behavior Video game controversy North American Man/Boy Love Association Ephebophilia Germaine Greer Humphrey Bogart Homosexuality Ethics Transsexuality Satanic ritual abuse Sin City Lewis Carroll Left-handed Paragraph 175 Domestic violence Religion and sexual orientation Polyamory Rind et al.

you have any suggestions to help this child i know a year old little boy that is scared of everything and i mean pretty much everything it has just him and his dad for the past and a half years his dad got hurt real bad in an accident a few years back but has been doing good for the past three years or more this little boy is scared to sleep in his own room at night scared to be in a room alone during the day most of the time has to know where and what his dad is doing at all times when he goes and sleeps over at a friends house which only happens maybe once every four months or so he has to call his dad every few hours just to say hi tell him what he is doing and to see what his dad is doing his dad has a girlfriend with kids of her own and when they stay the night he is still scared to sleep in the room with her kids he is right there with his dad does anyone have any suggestions on why he is like this and what advice i could give his dad to try to help him out with it thanks so much also his dad reasures him just about every night that nothing will hurt him and that he will be there in the morning when he wakes up but still don't help he still sleeps with a blankie and alot of stuffed animals too is that uncommen i think that the child needs some counseling this child has been through a lot he has lost his mother either due to divorce death or her taking off and that is traumatic under any circumstances it is traumatic in different ways depending on the reason why mom is not in the picture if mom ran off and left him no one's mom leaves them so it must be his fault if mom died suddently that's not suppose to happen your mommy should always be there for you if mom died after a long illness he saw her suffering and there was nothing he could do helpless if divorce why didn't mom fight for him if divorce why didn't she get custody or regular visitation was she abusive to him there are a lot of different scenerios and each could cause a lot of different problems that only a reputable child psychologist can address then he almost lost dad recovery was slow scary to think that he was that close to losing his dad too i agree with the answer of maybe getting a dog let him stay in the house at least at night i think he would feel more secure if he had a living thing lying next on the bed or floor next to him and another kid won't have the same effect because he may be embarrassed about being so afraid a dog won't make fun of you because you are scared dad needs to continue to be patient maybe dad should go as far as to tell him that if something happens to him dad then he would go and live with grandma grandpa so he will know exactly what would happen fear of the unknown can also be really scary i wish this family good luck encourage counseling  The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kodocha 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Grandview, U.S.A.

parents and the way they let their kids act why do some parents not allow their kids to talk down to back talk or mouth them but they allow them to do it to other adults seen some things going on this weekend and didn't understand why they let them treat others that way but didn't let them treat the parent that way what do you think the reasoning in that is parents have strange double standards when it comes to things like that they often preach many things but don't act upon them or don't apply them in all areas my parents weren't perfect but if i was ever disrespectful to another adult i knew it was wrong and that i could be punished even the slightest comment said out of line even unknowingly was corrected i grew up sensitive to the needs and feelings of other people and as a result i am privileged enough to be able to move about in the world successfully as a result i think maybe some parents might encourage their children to 'answer back' to other adults because many years ago children were abused regularly because of the 'children should be seen and not heard' attitude and as a result many people were tortured in silence now we're completely the other way children have an answer for everything and because they don't respect other people consistently they don't have real respect for themselves or real discipline it does send out mixed messages to children parents these days though i feel with the media and everything scaring people have a feeling of dread about their children and their safety  Plame affair Theory of conduct Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Infantilism Milton H.

finally we see kate mccann admitting that they did wrong by leaving the children alone in her first solo interview kate admits that if she had thought for one second she would have realised that leaving the children was wrong so they failed to think even for a second about the welfare of their children as they leave them night after night to go drinking i wonder if gerry will now admit he was less than a perfect parent luis very common i dont know where you come from what cultural difference i am english it is certainly not common to leave children alone because everybody knows its dangerous its also against the law i really dont know where you get your information from aptly named retard boy i'm not commenting on the crime aledgedly committed by the kidnapper if there is one i'm commenting on the mccann's serial neglect of their three children you are correct it is against the law in the uk in portugal where it happened and in nearly all the other european countries it would be interesting to hear from the first person to answer just what country they think it is legal in madeline was sadly snatched because the parents broke the criminal law of portugal by neglecting all their children and leaving them alone the parents claim fifty yards away but they left the door unlocked so the children could have walked out straight into the swimming pool and drown before they could get to them i would argue that they continue to neglect the other two children by hauling them around dumping them on relatives and denying them any form of proper home security the real tragedy may be that in defending leaving the children they will suck in the gullible people some on here already who will think it ok to leave their own children or encourage others to do so that would open the door for more children to be snatched the mccann family should be saying loud and clear learn from us and never leave your children unattended  EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Avenue Q Appeal Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capital punishment Kidnapping Plame affair Shaggy dog story Celtic F.C.

why are there so many questions on her asking is it ok to spank your child and then give an answer there's no real question the person just gives a statement all the answers that say they do it get heaps of thumbs up and people who say they don't get heaps of thumbs down why bother asking questions that you don't want an answer to without starting a debate on to spank not spank why are so many people so closed minded and judgemental bugsey i agree with you debates are good fun as long as everyone is respectful but if you want a debate start a debate it shouldn't be thinly disguised as an actual question lisaclara it's nothing to do with my point of view i'm totally open to everyone's opinions and i just give my own if it's asked for i'm just asking a specific question about something that 'some' people do so don't misunderstand and you also don't need to call me names i can listen to other's points of view hah i always wonder the same thing people just want other people to agree with them they aren't really asking they just want to have that feeling that it is okay because some others say it is i hate that just because i disagree doesn't mean i should get thumbs downs its like why even bother asking if you only want to hear me encourage you and praise you if you don't want differing opinions dont ask not you just referring to the people who do ask questions and give thumbs down to all the people who dont agree with them  Theory of conduct Philosophy of language The nature of God in Western theology Social rule Human sexual behavior U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Singlish Plame affair Past teachings of Prem Rawat Epistemology Biblical inerrancy Intelligent design Spanking Abortion debate Atheism Hiberno-English Gemara Monarchy in Canada Avenue Q Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Charles Darwin's views on religion Current teachings of Prem Rawat Ann Coulter Consensus decision-making God Milton H.

there is no reason my yard has to be a mess or not mowed every days saying my boys hit baseballs into their windows golf balls ruin their mowers and so on and not one of them has ever said anything to me our yard is huge so i can't always hear the kids when they are outside and i have central air so the windows are shut then the one neighbor my cousin said my boys were hitting her dog and at the time they were at the pool so the friend is no longer welcome here he has had one to many chances i had them go over to apologize to her but she said she would not accept it my boys lost tv games bikes boards blades allowance and have to do double the chores are not allowed outside without an adult are not allowed to go to friends homes and have to mow her lawn for the rest of the year i just don't think they 'get it' they don't seem phased at all any suggestions please i've never had to deal with this personally i've been trying to think what i would tell someone else to do and i just can't think thanks momma p my boys have always been respectful to other adults like i said this is the first i have ever heard of things like this from them they even admitted what they said to her i was thinking maybe it was this friends influence about a month ago they were with this one and another and said that the two friends were smoking and drinking beer at and called them names and told them to leave because my boys wouldn't do it i have never in a million years ever even had an inkling that my boys were this bad they have always been nice to everyone they say the right things and have true feelings for adults in my presence my dad's and also my brother's we would have kicked their a es otherwise and they know this and is a very impressionable age and unfortunatly though it's hard for parents sometimes it's hard for neighbors too when i was around this age one of the other kids that hung out with my brother and i was acting up and doing stuff to our neighbors by association we got blamed for this kid's crap too also if your neighbors are adults they shouldn't be talking behind your back and not confronting you when your kids did something for what your kids confessed to they need to be punished but they need to be punished in a way that makes them realize it's because of what they said to the neighbor not because they told you the truth it's hard to punish kids this age i was nanny for these ages for two years and trust me i know that it's hard by no means should you spank or smack your children they are too old for one and for two they will never confess when confronted if they are severely punished what needs to be done is confronting the neighbors about what you heard and explain to the neighbor that told you what was going on that you are sorry and the kids will make it up to her by helping her with mowing the lawn and walking the hated dog on a daily basis secondly do you know the friend's parents if you do you should tell them what is going on if not or if they don't seem like the kind of parents that give a then tell your kids that they can only see that kid at your house while supervised you can't tell your child to not be friends with someone but you can supervise their time with that friend and make sure things don't get out of hand also if your neighbors property is being damaged why wouldn't the neighbors come talk to you when it happened i think that your neighbor was just upset and lashing out without even talking to the other neighbors and if she won't forgive your kids for being kids then it's her problem and you shouldn't punish your kids more for this finally if you haven't already now is the time to have the birds and bees talk because they obviously are curious about sex to be saying crude things to your neighbor be understanding that it could be uncomfortable but they obviously are in puberty and should know about things before there is another teen pregnancy posting also talk to them about drugs and alcohol and be open to listening about the peer pressures they are facing the more listening and open and honest you are with your kids about sex drugs alcohol etc the more likely they will turn out for the better and bad behavior will turn into a good relationship anyway this is my advice take it or leave it hope it helps and best of luck  Theory of conduct Social rule Shaggy dog

pothos toxic to month old i really need some quick responses my husbands mother left her stupid plants at the house with the baby here and didnt see fit to mention that they were possible toxic we have kittens and even though the hanging plants were set up on a table out of his reach the kittens keep knocking the plant parts down where they dangle and he can grab them we just realized that the cats were doing this and he had a leaf in his hand that he had pulled off i dont know if he ate any but since he is teething i would say its a safe bet she called posion control to be safe and i think she gave them the wrong plant name pathos instead of pothos so i dont know if they gave her the right info just said it would irritate his mouth does anyone have any advice he is not fussy or anything and as i said its possible he didnt swallow any but also like i said i didnt see the cats knock it down so i dont know how long he had been playing with it it says that it can cause swelling of the throat should i be concerned about him napping or should i be concerned about it causing him breathing difficulties concerned about trouble breathing in his sleep s i did wipe out his mouth with a damp baby washcloth and gave him a couple ounces of water i did call them and confirm that the information was correct they said he would just have an irritated mouth and to watch him for an hour he didnt have any trouble so i think we caught him before he got any in his mouth still better safe than sorry either way i am still furious with his grandmother for irresponsibly bringing something around that could have hurt him its just a good thing i thought to look it up instead of trusting that she would know better s call posion control again and go through all the info with them never assume that posiion control knew to correct an incorrect name they are there to answers all questions even if we as parents think they are silly or stupid i called posion control about some depression pills that my son had gotten a hold of and the lady from posion control called me back later to check up on him and was very sweet even though it turned out he had not eaten any just call yourself it will make you feel better  Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Atomic Kitten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Kodocha Garfield EastEnders One Piece minor characters Little Britain Friends Calvin and Hobbes Boston Public Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Inside Humphrey Bogart Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Days of our Lives Jam (TV series) Poker jargon The Amber Spyglass Fancy Crane Kitten Pitaten Social rule Oral sex RuneScape quests The Catcher in the Rye Elephant The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Menstrual cup Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Happy Tree Friends Rose (Doctor Who) Guinea pig Rebreather Columbine High School massacre Traumatic brain injury Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Hamster Theory of conduct Mystique (comics) Palindrome Eric Cartman Plame affair Wolfrider Boom Town (Doctor Who) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tobacco smoking Professional wrestling attacks Silent Night, Deadly Night Dilbert Good Times Childbirth Hiccup Ron and Fez Conker's Bad Fur Day Book of Isaiah Characters of Naruto Softball Japanese mythology Haven (TNG episode) Gaia Online Professional wrestling holds Ed, Edd n Eddy Piccolo Junior Saga Characters of Lost Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Trapped in the Closet Professional wrestling throws Vampire Jumpstart 3rd Grade StarCraft: Uprising Tomato Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Abortion debate Jon Secada Coffee Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist

have people lost their minds my kids were at the park earlier today and another kid got hurt this child's mother came up to my year old and said he had hurt her when my year old daughter tried to explain that it had been another child that had done it the mother said i know the little b stard did it then told my daughter to shut her f cking mouth or she'd shut it for her the scary part is this isn't the first time something like this has happened when did it become ok for adults to threaten children i can understand being upset but to threaten to hurt a child how can i help my daughter not be afraid that she is going to get hurt when she tells the truth today's incident happened while they were at their dads so i wasn't there and the other time i had let them go alone but they haven't went since then i've seen this happen before not only parents yell at their own children rather loudly but other people's children that they dont even know as well i simply tell my kids that if anyone comes up to you and talk yells at you you come find me and i will handle it that mother went way overboard and i would have had a thing or two to say to her i would explain to your daughter that she did nothing wrong by explaining what had happened to that woman but next time something like that happens and you see the person getting rather angry to just simply take her sibling by the hand and tell her that she'll go get her parent if they are alone they should just walk away kids get hurt all the time and i can certainly understand a parent getting upset and coming up to the kid and saying can you apologize to my child for but to do what that mother did there's a big issue there what a wack job best wishes  Shaggy dog story About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Marshall Mathers LP The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Fairly OddParents Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist EastEnders Milton H.

what are your thoughts on stay at home dads do you think they can do as good of job as moms with the kids i think that if men are encouraged to explore their natural urge to nurture as women are encouraged to do the same by society from an early age that they do just as well as women when it comes to caring for their children i think that as more men do it in this generation more boys will grow up thinking it's possible for them in the next generation and soon over the course of a few generations stay at home dads will be as common place in our society as working women something that society thought that women were not capable of doing just a few generations ago my husband is home with our kids during the day when i'm at work they do great  Homemaker Gender role About a Boy Intelligence quotient Laura Schlessinger Carl Jung Hillary Rodham Clinton Yoko Ono Child sexuality Women in the Victorian era Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Fathers' rights Child Customs and etiquette of Japan The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Economic inequality Infantilism Timmy Turner The Fairly OddParents Doug Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Woman Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Incest Human Family Treehouse of Horror V Married... with Children Bro'Town Kyle Broflovski Culture Cartman Joins NAMBLA Malcolm in the Middle Marriage Dad's Army The Adventures of Pete & Pete Care Bears Breastfeeding Father Girl Divorce Women and Mormonism Industrial Revolution Soccer mom Recurring South Park characters Utopia (book) Grandview, U.S.A.

question for single mommies or mommies who were once single mommies though its hard under any circumstance do you think it's easier emotionally to become a single mom while pregnant or after the baby arrives and you parent together for at least a short period of time why im weeks along he has decided hes leaving because i wont put her up for adoption i can see how one might feel this situation to be empowering i just pray to god i made a decent mother and can successfully do this on my own not to mention the social stigma around being an unwed single mother i think it depends on the circumstances around the ending of the relationship as well as the support the mom has and also if the father stays involved in my case my sons father left me at months pregnant because i wouldnt have an abortion he pays child support but chooses not to be involved in my sons life if he had left after my son was born i am sure that it would have been harder on me being single and pregnant was hard but emotionally it was actually very easy it was sort of empowering in a way because i know alot of women would have gotten an abortion also there was another lady that i worked with who had the exact same thing happen that the guy split when she found out having someone that i saw everyday who was dealing with the same thing as me made it alot easier i chose also to look at the brighter side of things for example i was single and pregnant but atleast i wasnt pregnant by a loving husband who had died when i was months pregnant compared to women who go through that i had it easy  Abortion debate EastEnders Marriage Divorce Roe v.

isn't it about time that we banned dangerous dogs and had all dogs leashed and muzzled around children http news bbc co uk hi england dorset stm i don't want to hear all of these arguments that it's not the dog it's the owner i just think that we should protect our children these are animals for god's sake i know robert c but i don't care the children must come first no matter how cute their wild animals are doobiedrm yes that's disgusting and i could tell you of what i had to put up with on my boys' shoes if they forgot to take them off at the door too before the days of poopscoops and even then who regulates that they are unhygeinic too i should add that they should wear nappies too or preferably banned altogether except for working dogs in the countryside disrespectul to dogs animals rl have you completely lost all perspective my nappy suggestion was a joke although i heared that tourist horses in new york had to wear them correct me if i am wrong anyway leashes and muzzles are a must if it only saves one child from being savaged and as moonstone says the nappies aren't such a bad idea anyway i am sure that my boys got worms from picking up dirt from the park from other people's pet droppings and that can cause blindness so don't make light of it so i left the f out of disrespectful above just as well maybe i agree fully there are too many instances of dogs attacking children even family dogs when the owners can't believe it why take the chance why should my kids be at risk because someone else wants a dog and because they trust it everyones opinions are different and maybe they think their dog is great and will never attack but i dont want to take any chances with my children and any dog all dogs should be muzzled in public and dangerous dogs need to be banned i mean what exactly do people keep dangerous dogs for there are plenty non dangerous pets after all  Fox hunting Dog Ferret Pit bull Dog training Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Animal rights Docking Gray Wolf Obedience training Shaggy dog story Garfield The Death Gate Cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Zoophilia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Consensus decision-making Philosophical skepticism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cat Plame affair Joke Whaling Working dog Trailer Park Boys Political correctness Horseshoe RuneScape quests 613 mitzvot Characters in the Smurfs Game show Friends Dog collar Punk ideology Pet skunk Domestic rabbit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Discordianism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Animal Farm Pun Paul Is Dead Originalism Poker jargon Diaper Abortion debate Ocean Beach, New York Pet Separation of church and state Aerial (dance move) Lisa the Vegetarian Breath of Fire III Teacher's Pet (Disney) Dog agility Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cleveland Browns Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical inerrancy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sin City Taboo food and drink Ontological argument Leash Kylie Minogue Socrates Fathers' rights The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hitchhiking Animal testing Yusuf al-Qaradawi Rabies Libertarianism Little Britain Police dog The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Spyware Philosophy of language Futurama (TV series - season 5) American Eskimo Dog Doraemon Trapping Hunting Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Ranma __ characters George Orwell Tobacco smoking Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Milton H.

at age would you allow your kid to ride bikes up and down the road all the neighborhood kids who are around the same age are allowed to ride up and down the road to different houses as they please i am extremely uncomfortable with this even though i am his step mom our street is not very busy but there are cars who go quite quickly sometimes plus i don't know the neighbors here well enough to feel safe i hate to tell him no because then he can't hang out with his friends but i do tell him no because i'm just not comfortable my husband's mom tells me that i need to just let go because that's what you do so i feel pressure from her to go against my instincts am i over reacting or is he just too young at i had the same worries when our youngest was and we moved to a new town i compromised a bit allowing my son to ride his bike on our road from this house to this house i later extended his space a few houses further and now he's allowed to ride the whole block he's as i met the neighbours i found out that most of them had similar boundaries our road is not busy but we live in the country so the cars that do drive past sometimes drive too fast and the road is gravel with really deep ditches on each side i worried a lot but i talked to my kids a lot about safety and paying attention to what's going on around them and taught them to stop their bike and wait for a car to drive past them i watched closely until i started to feel more confident so go with your instincts because only you know how busy the road is how real the danger is and how responsible your stepson is you could just tell him he can only ride if you're outside watching him at least until you feel more comfortable and if you find a neighbour whose judgement you trust talk to her about your worries and see what rules she has good luck  Bike lane debate Motorcycle Milton H.

stuggling to be a good mother to both of my children i am sure i will be judged at this question but i want to bare my soul anyway i have two children a little girl almost and a son who is now my problem is that i struggle to bond with my daughter for some reason i often find it hard to touch her and reach out to her which is no problem with my son i am aware of it and have to make special time to have with her and open my heart towards her it is hard to explain and i wondered if anyone else found the same problem my son has always been hard work and very demanding and he will make noise until he gets my attention but my daughter is much more passive for example i spent an hour talking with her at bedtime stroking her and being her mummy but this doesn't happen all the time i have to make it happen and i do totally enjoy this bond between us but it is much harder with her than with my son your experience and advice is greatly appreciated i can't believe how wonderful these answers are you are truly inspriring my daughter is very loving and i tell her hundreds of times a day that i love her but sometimes i find it hard to reciprocate her affection whereas i struggle to get cuddles from her brother and i will actively seek them out from him dad and i are married he is great with our kids in fact eons better at parenting than i am i guess i just have to keep doing what i am we have our own time every week and i make time every single day for her to make sure she knows i love her even if i don't appear to show it during the day thanks i guess i am a good mom after all i just wish i could give them both all the time how do i achieve that i didn't read much of people's answers but i am moved to answer your question for my own reasons if you can i would recommend you talk with a good therapist i'll explain why but try to find someone you like and feel comfortable with and talk with her about your daughter and your feelings for her it sounds like you are very aware of how you feel and you are doing whatever it takes to be sure your daughter grows up without any doubt that she is loved i don't mean to sound difficult but i think kids can really tell what's going on that's why i think you should find a good therapist to talk to don't settle for someone who is just okay or you figure is probably fine or you don't particularly connect with it can take a while to find someone you can work well with the reason i recommend this is that i am a mother of kids and i had and have issues all my love about whether my mother loved me or not i know she loved my brother and i was never conscious of being jealous because i didn't really want her love the thing is that children do want their mother to love them and it's not a good situation when a child learns to not care if their mother loves them or not i've been working on this issue for a long time and it is something i just think is a part of me but i do wish my mother could have found a way to show her love for me in a way that i could take in she died when i was yrs old so that obviously complicates things too i think you sound like a wonderful mother and you are clearly aware of the need for your daughter to feel loved just don't let it become only that  About a Boy Transactional analysis Avenue Q Sant Thakar Singh Breastfeeding Autism Theory of conduct Milton H.

peeing in legos ok so i have this big issue with my yo that i thought we had gotten rid of about a year ago i had bought my kids a big bucket of legos tiny ones and it worked because they both like to build things then i noticed a foul smell in them turned out that my yo at that time had urinated on them i had a big talk and he got time out for that i had to dump the legos because i couldn't get rid of the smell now my dad bought more legos for my older son but they both share them this morning they were fighting over them and i decided to take them away when i picke up the bag i noticed it was wet yes it was pee i confronted my son and admited that he had done it he is not able to tell me why he does it but it bothers the heck out of me should i take him to a therapist or is this a boy thing your first mistake with him was the time out that is not a proper punishment for a boy as you now see it does nothing all it did was teach him that not much happens when he does bad stuff if he peed in them he has to wash them put hot not too hot for him though water and soap in the bathtub and make him wash the pee off and wash out the bucket act really mad and go on and on about how nasty peeing on legos is don't let it phase you if he starts wailing to get out of it show him how to wash them make sure he does it and does it right years is not to young for this if he is really struggling help him but make sure he is doing it too you have to keep acting mad though so he won't think it's a game he has to learn that actions have consequences and i don't mean having to stop playing for a few minutes the consequence to peeing on something is it has to be washed how does he learn that if you do it for him while he sits in a chair for a few minutes tell him if he pees on anything else he has to wash that too you may have to do this a couple of times boys can be stubborn or slow to catch on  Sento Shaggy dog story Toilet humour The Inside Euphemism Milton H.

where did i go wrong as a parent i was talking to my year old daughter earlier and she asked me a very strange question her step dad had gone out for awhile and i wasn't sure when he'd be back her question was isn't that a wife girlfriends job to always know where their husband boyfriend is it may just be me but i found this a very disturbing thought for a young girl i've always tried to teach her that both people are equals in a relationship so why would she think that it is the woman's job to keep track of everything their partner does i've seen some women who call their husbands every hour to know what they're doing and who they're with and that drives me nuts but from my daughters question it sounds like she may end up being one of those women how can i teach her that as an adult people are free to come and go as they please any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated thanks after reading some of the answers i decided tht maybe i was teaching her by example so i asked the one person who could give me a straight answer my ex husband his response was that my non clinginess was the only trait of mine he ever admired and liked so i'm pretty sure she hasn't learned this behaviour from me your doing the right thing just tell her that you trust your husband and if you dont have trust you have nothing my husband works out of town hes gone for weeks at a time we talk about two times a day it would drive me crazy if he constanly kept check on me or me him weve been together yrs there is such a thing a running someone off by smothering them shes still young so she might not understand what relationships are all about take care  Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Avenue Q EastEnders Hey Jude Charmed Infantilism About a Boy Milton H.

parents would you let your daughter smoke if your teenage daughter came home one day reeking of smoke what would you do omg i remember when i was i was grounded because my parents found cigarettes in my room i was supposed to be grounded for a month because of this however i still continued to recieve an allowance during this time i actually had a friend buy them for me and throw them up on the roof outside my window and i would climb out there and get them and throw her the money so here i was grounded for smoking and they caught me smoking in my room well they decided that i was too stubborn for their punishments to make me quit and from then on i was allowed to smoke as long as i did it downstairs instead of in my room since they were afraid of me burning the house down with one of my makeshift ashtrays many years later i quit smoking and have a daughter of my own i know in about yrs i may go through this with her but unlike my parents i just dont think i will be able to give in to stubbornness while i do not in any way fault my parents with the habbit i picked up and had such a hard time quitting i am determined that i will at least try a little harder to make her quit and i sure as heck will not allow her to do it under my supervision because of the health risks as well as the fact that it is illegal for her to smoke i would do everything in my power to make her stop even if it meant making her life miserable a friend of mine had a mother with an interesting idea that actually worked she caught her smoking so she went out and bought a pack and at dinner she offered her a smoke well after she smoked that one she made her smoke another and another until she bacame quite ill she never smoked another one after that i guess it must have been a pretty awful experience she didnt want to repeat  Tobacco smoking Divorce Cigarette Smoking ban Abigail Folger The Smoking Room Friends Health insurance Knots Landing Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Illegal drug trade Sub-Zero GunZ The Duel Fancy Crane EastEnders Shaggy dog story Craps Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Jam (TV series) About a Boy Jean Grey Cigar The Virgin Suicides The Star Wars Holiday Special Days of our Lives Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bristol Grammar School Arguments for and against drug prohibition Little Britain Causality The Masters Apprentices The Shining (film) Amedeo Modigliani Calvin and Hobbes Charles Peace Nico Robin Good Times Katelyn Faber Tobacco advertising Humphrey Bogart Kurt Cobain Carl Barks Cannabis (drug) Sigmund Freud Sin City Rovers Return Milton H.

spanking does anyone else have this dilemma with family or friends ok i have gorgeous kids they're pretty good for the most part occasionally act out like all kids do i've always been a 'spanker' but lately i've been reading up researching talking to other moms etc and i'm seriously trying to move away from spanking i've never really felt right doing it i'm finding other methods work as well if not better anyway the problem i have is that i was brought up as was my husband in a very 'pro spank' family not that they're abusive but they believe greatly in spare the rod and spoil the child now that i'm trying to stop spanking they're all being extremely critical and are criticising me for taking notice of 'new age nonsense' i'm just trying to understand my children better and discipline them the best way i can i really feel more in control not spanking and much calmer i didn't really believe that was possible lol has anyone else experienced this or have any suggestions all advice welcome i have exactly the same problem with my family they are all very 'pro smacking' also except in their case that is all they use they will refuse to even consider a different form of discipline i also tend to think about things from a child's perspective and try to get through to their little minds children are so much smarter than we give them credit for but i think a lot of people don't like to be open to other options and possiblities i know in my family the concept of 'lifetime learning' is absolutely lost you just need to be firm don't explain yourself and don't justify what you are doing this sounds like you're making excuses which you don't need to do just tell them that you're very happy with your children's overall behaviour and you're pleased that you've found a discipline method that suits you well whatever that may be if they continue just nod and smile and say well the results speak for themselves they will either give up or you will have to really tell them to butt out just remember usually when people push that hard over something it's because of their own insecurities about it good luck hope this helps  Spanking Theory of conduct Corporal punishment James Dobson Social rule Infantilism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Scientology beliefs and practices Past teachings of Prem Rawat The nature of God in Western theology Kodocha Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Microeconomics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Prisoner's dilemma Adult attention-deficit disorder Theodicy Erotic spanking Religion Falsifiability Laura Schlessinger Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rich Mullins Shaggy dog story Doug The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Extreme Programming Milton H.

what do you think about so many parents claiming that all rights over their children have been taken as far as i'm aware it's still up to us to discipline our children i know we're not allowed to abuse them in any way but shouldn't that go without saying a lot of people are so disparaging about 'children's rights' but have they considered that there is good reason for those rights to have to be protected in the first place what is your take on this that's all fine but don't you think that there was a reason that children had to be made aware of their rights i'm sorry but i believe that children are entitled to more than just basic physical needs giving children rights doesn't mean losing discipline discipline and a good upbringing is a right too but so many people seem to have the attitude that i made them i can do what i want with them that upsets me they're human beings this is a huge pet peeve of mine parents making comments like that now it's not as if the teachers at the schools are able to punish them for anything that they do outside of the school grounds or at home so i don't know what the parents are talking about there i'm not really certain exactly who is taking these rights away parents are still the final authority over their kids and need to be the ones to teach the proper lessons of right and wrong and dole out the appropriate punishments when something goes wrong i think the first poster is very astute in saying that the modern day idea of parenting is to be a friend to your child especially teenagers when that's really the last thing that they need they have their circle of friends and while yes of course you want to be able to have a friendly relationship with your son or daughter if you're more concerned about them being mad at you for a while and less concerned about them going out and doing something stupid that might get themselves or somebody else seriously hurt or in a great deal of trouble then you've got some things to work out there a parent is first and foremost a teacher and a guide to show their kids the right way to do things and how to be a decent person they are a friend afterwards so that they can still be the person that their child comes to when they need help a lot of parents now are just too self righteous and stubborn to admit that they're going about things the wrong way sorry about the long post just a huge pet peeve of mine let me just climb down off my soap box here  Theory of conduct Theodicy Fathers' rights Punishment Kodocha Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Boston Public Corporal punishment Animal rights Spanking Ten Commandments Autism rights movement James Dobson Saved by the Bell Justification (theology) The nature of God in Western theology Friends Kender Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ethics Pitaten Homeschooling EastEnders Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Confucius Sant Thakar Singh Child Good Times The Fairly OddParents Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Polyamory Domestic violence Education Utilitarianism School discipline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Great Teacher Onizuka Reincarnation God Emperor of Dune Religion Capital punishment Our Gang Economics Teacher's Pet (Disney) Malcolm in the Middle Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Narcissism Plame affair Atheism Scientology beliefs and practices Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder My Parents are Aliens Infant baptism Nicomachean Ethics Motion picture rating system Adoption Evil Criticism of libertarianism Hell Aristotle Carlos Castaneda Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Children of God The Book of Five Rings Michel Foucault Polygamy Zoophilia Person Alignment (role-playing games) Alcoholics Anonymous Education in the People's Republic of China Rich Mullins Tai Chi Chuan Dog training The Death Gate Cycle Charles Grandison Finney Separation of church and state The Catcher in the Rye Motivation Excommunication History of British nationality law The Apprentice 2 The Human Stain Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India John the Baptist

can she stop him my partner is going for a contact order to see his son the mother has stopped him because we asked her to sign for the money we were giving her thing is my partner smokes weed on a weekend can she stop him seeing him or have his visits to be supervised because of this he is not a drug addict and he works in a good job to support his family and our kids are happy and well looked after like i said not a drug addict and actually one of the nicest people ive ever met only on a weekend wow its really strange that i found this question my partner is going through the same thing with his ex partner he even stopped making maintenance payments so she would contact him so he could try and come to an agreement with her about access not a smart move and not reccomended at all my partner used to smoke quite a bit of weed whilst he was with his ex and even though he hasnt touched it since they split she still uses this against him although the fact that he no longer smokes has given him a little bit of help as with your partner he has a very good job and although we dont have children of our own yet he has always been as good a father as he could be to his son even when he wasnt making payments to her he was putting the money to one side so that he could pay it all when they reached an agreement he has even opened a bank account in his sons name and puts money in there each week for his son when he is older the only thing i can suggest however is for your partner to stand a fighting chance in court to see his son he needs to give up the weed at least until the case has been dealt with whist hes still smoking it he doesnt stand a chance and if she uses this against him which no doubt she will he will get tested and fail and the case will be thrown out of court in her favour good luck hope i have been of some help and just remember to be there for him its gonna be hard  Divorce Knots Landing Contract Schabir Shaik Trial SCO-Linux controversies 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Drug test Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Theory of conduct Plame affair Contract bridge Schapelle Corby Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fathers' rights 1919 World Series Poker jargon Friends Kasparov versus The World Atomic Kitten Octopus card Incarnations of Immortality Domestic violence Cigarette Smoking Man Child support Probation officer Cyprus dispute Vernon Schillinger Only Fools and Horses Appeal Health insurance ITV Monetary policy National Football League Sant Thakar Singh Illegal drug trade War of the Worlds (2005 film) Nicomachean Ethics Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Japan-United States relations The Star Wars Holiday Special Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Syphon Filter Katelyn Faber Dead Like Me Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fathers' rights movement in the UK Vegeta Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Arguments for and against drug prohibition Continuation War Aerial (dance move) Government of India Act 1935 Swingout Meat Loaf Cheating in poker One Tree Hill (TV series) Apology (Plato) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Estoppel Fire fighting Baseball Liam Gallagher Piccolo Junior Saga Medicare (Canada) Cannabis (drug) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States About a Boy Volleyball Advance fee fraud Pittsburgh Steelers Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Little Britain Consensus decision-making Tobacco smoking Muslim ibn Aqeel Sydney Riot of 1879 Operation Market Garden League of Nations Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Same-sex marriage in Canada Drug abuse Rich Mullins Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Consensual crime Good Times Ben Johnson (athlete) Unemployment Marshall Plan Bradley Nowell Dancing at Lughnasa

how to deal with irresponsible parent s first i want to make it clear that i don't think i am super mom but i do think i am a normal responsible parent so my question is how do you deal with parents who won't take any responsibility over their children i swear i live in irresponsible parent capital city let me throw you an example one winter i was outside playing with my two daughters who were and years old at the time there were other older kids outside making a snow fort my youngest being a toddler didn't know better and stole some of their snow from their stockpile a boy who was years old got really angry and tried to beat her up my daughter was literally hiding behind me while i was holding this kid back the kid was all in my face while i told him to back off i decided enough was enough and went to his house to try and speak to his mother it was like talking to a brick wall she thought her son did nothing wrong by threatening a year old little girl continued her explanation was that my daughter should have known better not to steal their snow i tried to reason with her that it does not justify violence and wasn t she concerned that he had no qualms about beating up a baby who just happens to be a girl wasn t she concerned about the fact that he didn t back down after a parent myself interfered nope all that mattered to her was that my daughter stole their snow nevermind the fact that there was a whole football field of snow around i was pratically screaming in frustration when i left her doorstep this is just one example of many that i have had to deal with over the years from multiple parents so how do you deal with irresponsible ignorant parents is there a way thanks welcome to society today you will have to follow your girls around and make sure they are supervised all the time or you will have an incident where a child could beat up your girls parents are clueless they dump their children outside and forget about them here are some tips that i have for you since my son is older get a fence and and much property as you can don't deal with parents they are clueless and stupid and don't like to be corrected be careful of where you send them to school private schools don't equate to better parents look for schools that stress family values etc and ask if the parents are involved good luck i feel really bad for you but i would say you are an old fashioned parent like me and there we account for about of the parents that i see out there  Poker jargon Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Sin City Kodocha The Shining (film) Infantilism EastEnders The Marshall Mathers LP Knots Landing Fathers' rights Abortion debate Shaggy dog story Boston Public About a Boy Billy the Kid Pitaten Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rais massacre Characters in the Smurfs Domestic violence Ethics Adoption One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Plame affair Criticism of libertarianism Trailer Park Boys Milton H.

a question for people who have never smoked pot what do you imagine the short term physical and psychological effects of smoking pot are i am only referring to the time you are actually high from smoking not long term effects such as lung damage exactly they wouldn't know yet they assume that the effects are so tremendous that people can't even care for children when smoking small amounts i've never smoked it but i don't have to 'imagine' the effects it has on people i've lived in environments that were saturated with pot in varying degrees and i saw some of the effects it had lazy and neglectful parenting domestic violence crime and unemployment to name a few i like how you assume people are 'uneducated' about something like this because they haven't done it have you considered the fact that some people overcame their ignorance by learning from the mistakes of others that they saw all around them it's sad the way these days some people wear drug use like a badge of honour edit i read your other question if you're so insecure about smoking pot around your children try not doing it instead of a crusade to convince people that being on drugs while you attempt to care for your children is ok  Cannabis (drug) Causality Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tobacco smoking Cancer Psychology Diving Motivation Divorce Infantilism Drug addiction Nuclear explosion The Smoking Room Plame affair Betting (poker) Illegal drug trade Coercion Cocaine Consensual crime Lung cancer Methamphetamine Explosive material Stroke Hypertension Adoption Gender role The Marshall Mathers LP Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Sub-Zero Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical cannabis Narcissism Characters in the Smurfs Spanking Health insurance Down syndrome Kurt Cobain Microeconomics Theodicy Transsexuality Unemployment Smoking ban Neuro-linguistic programming Goodness and value theory Child abuse Growth hormone treatment Social rule Attachment theory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Prostate cancer Ionizing radiation Breastfeeding Hollyoaks Fire fighting Radar Culture of the United States Rape Anger management Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Philosophical skepticism Cigarette Smoking Man Religion Urinary incontinence Sauna Deprogramming Asthma Stomach cancer Wealth Hand grenade Child sexual abuse Addiction Daredevil Domestic violence Same-sex marriage Autism Drowning 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Donovan Hikikomori Langmuir probe Normal distribution Model minority Anti-Semitism Asperger syndrome Decompression sickness Japanese tea ceremony Borderline personality disorder Alcohol fuel Carl Jung No Child Left Behind Act Poker jargon Aikido Democratic Kampuchea Non-native pronunciations of English

son who is almost yrs old thinks he's on summer vacation still my son will be in a few weeks my godmom who passes away mos ago left her car for me i told my son he could have it if he had a job and could pay for his insurance it is my attempt to move him in a more responsible direction he has a lot of friends some the same age but some of them younger he has not gotten a job or completed his ged he has been hanging out with his friends and he is practically never home he calls me everynight to let me know approximately where he is going to be sleeping i know that he is almost and i have to let him go but it's strange for me he wants his independence and i have been trying to give it to him i have no control in whether he wants to be at home or not i want him to get a job get his car on the road and then move out with his buddies that is the natural progression of things he talks about getting a job getting his car insured and moving out but he has not done a thing but hang out all summer any advice my first question is if he isn't working where is he getting his spending money from you have given him the chance to step up and take responsibility now it is more than fair for you to enforce it stop paying for his cell phone don't give him to go out on the weekends disconnect the internet from his computer stop paying for his video game or movie rental program if you have one for him refuse to drop him off or pick him up from friend's houses or the mall no car privelages as you are cancelling his insurance until he can py for it himself tell him that you appreciate his letting you know where he is each night and that is a good thing so be sure to really emphasize it but that if he is not going to attend school full time he is now responsible for his own laundry and all his exspenses also tell him that he must have a job by a certain date or he will need to find another way to contribute to the house taking over all the chores laundry etc while you work encourage him to get his ged it is probably the only way he can get a job at his age as he is not currently working already you can love him but make it clear that if he wants to be treated as an adult he has to act like one as well  Knots Landing GED Social rule Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q Friends The Sims One Tree Hill (TV series) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Contract Insurance Unemployment Grand Theft Auto (game) Extreme Programming Sin City EastEnders The Inside Cindy Sheehan The Catcher in the Rye Garfield Unemployment benefit About a Boy Video game developer James Hanratty Grandview, U.S.A.

question for spankers and non spankers my four year old daughter talking back i have a four year old daughter she's mostly a great kid but can have a pretty smart mouth on her lately i've had a lot of trouble with her attitude she's just saying no a lot unwilling to do things when she's asked etc i've used spankings in the past but they're just not effective and i really don't want to spank her anymore because it doesn't do any good anyway so if you spank how else would you handle this situation and if you don't spank what do you find works we only use spanking for very serious stuff to be honest we've usually tried other methods before we use spanking if we get to spanking that usually finishes it then again nothing about our family is very pc our spankings are no joke we use the more traditional way of spanking pants down over the lap so i'd suggest you try one of these spankings if your at the end of the rope personally i think if you don't make a spanking a real spanking like i described above they just flat out don't work if this is not a method you think you'd want to use then maybe try long time outs half an hour or just pick a consequence and stay with it be consistent on the very rare occasion we get to spanking and it doesn't work we simply just do another one that i think has only happened once or maybe twice with all of our daughters i usually never do a second spanking but on those occasions i've never done a third sorry my methods aren't very new age but we stick with what works good luck  Spanking Theory of conduct Social rule Erotic spanking Buttocks Beavis and Butt-head Textile manufacturing Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hazing Shaggy dog story Shit Pitaten Paddle (spanking) Corporal punishment Poker jargon L.O.C.K.D.O.W.N.

how is visitation handled when one parent moves out of state with the kids my neice made a comment to my son that her mom and stepdad were moving her and her sister out of state but not to tell me cause i would tell my brother and he might try to kidnap them well of course i told my brother immediatly and he called his ex wife to find out what was going on at first she said it was just a thought but nothing was definate however the next day she calls him back and says they are moving about states away in about a week he hasnt been able to call his lawyer yet to find out his rights or if she can even legally move out of state i know my divorce papers say i cant move out of the counties adjacent to the county where my divorce was done but he knows his doesn't say that however he isn't sure about moving out of state how does this usually work with people moving their kids out of state are they usually allowed to do this just out of the blue and how do visitations work has anyone else been in this situation and how did you work it out so basically she can move out of state and if my brother cant afford to drive that distance or pay for plane tickets every other weekend then he is basically just out of luck on his visitation that doesn't seem fair to me if your brother has shared or joint custody then no she can't move out of state try to help him get in touch with his lawyer tell him to call his ex wife back and tell her that if she leaves the state with his kids he will press charges for kidnapping a parent might take the kids and move across the country in order to make things more difficult for the other parent the laws are generally written to avoid that possibility it's best to consult with a local attorney before she moves no he shouldn't move to follow her where she goes she has no right to leave and he shouldn't have to uproot himself to please his ex wife if she wants to move then let her move but get custody of the children so that you don't have to change your life everytime she wants to hop around  Divorce Marriage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Family EastEnders Fathers' rights Theory of conduct Knots Landing The Catcher in the Rye Child custody Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kidnapping Ernesto Miranda Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Unlawful combatant Alberto Gonzales Appeal The Critic Sharon Tate Polyamory James Bulger Phoebe Halliwell Concurrent estate Miss Saigon Karl Rove Federal Marriage Amendment Son Goku (Dragon Ball) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Fair Game (Scientology) Tom DeLay Badly Drawn Kitties Kodocha Pitaten Malcolm in the Middle Charmed Marc Dutroux The Untouchables Social rule Polygamy United Kingdom corporation tax Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dancing at Lughnasa George Galloway Blankets (graphic novel) Mumia Abu-Jamal Prolog The Human Stain Baby Blues Evan Mecham Rosa Parks Insurance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Children of God Leo Wyatt Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 Doug Vivian Solon Women in the Victorian era Maria Hertogh riots W.

is this legal child tkane from parents some of you may have read my question yesterday my brother in law got his then month old baby taken away for months because she had skull fracture two happened at once the other was older he and his girlfriend got the baby back after she was in foster care since no else wanted her i cannot take her i'm and live at home since then he's gotten back into his violent behavior of throwing breaking things and hitting people i couldn't understand how they had gotten her back until i realized they didnt his girlfriend's mother got custody after a long battle and has since given the baby to them what can i do about this clearly they were taken away for a reason how can this go on without cps catching on call cps on the grandmother what she did was arguably worse than what they do she purposely evaded the agency that is looking out for her granddaughter's safety and willingly handed her over to her abusers it may be better to just call the police or to call a court clerk to ask what steps you should take cps often involves looking into claims of abuse your sister in law's mother is most likely in violation of a court order which may be acted upon much more quickly than calling cps to resume the investigation when they realize what she did it's unlikely other family members would be able to get the child unless there is some serious court supervision involved but at least the baby wouldn't be with mom or dad considering the situation even though you can report anonymously i would give your information they won't share it with the parents but i know from personal experience that calls are taken more seriously if the caller leaves info after all if you truly are close to the situation and feel a child is in danger you'd want authorities to be able to get as many details as possible for the child's safety which can only be done if they know who you are the fact that you call and you leave your information could salvage your chances of getting visitation with your niece something that may be denied family members for the time being seeing as one close relative has so horribly abused their rights as the baby's guardian  2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fathers' rights Domestic violence Charmed EastEnders Knots Landing Adoption Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Children of God Child support Family Infantilism Incest Divorce Abortion debate Theodicy Kodocha Child custody Fathers 4 Justice Child pornography Child abuse Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Days of our Lives Probation officer Theory of conduct James Bulger Yusuf al-Qaradawi Child sexual abuse Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Plame affair Rape Fancy Crane Daredevil Traumatic brain injury Appeal Jon Secada Angelina Jolie Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Mental Health Act 1983 Transsexuality Classified information Guantanamo Bay Involuntary commitment LiveJournal Henry Lee Lucas Everwood Free will Serial killer British nationality law Stolen Generation Spanking Privacy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eddie Guerrero One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Alois Hitler Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Ethics Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda One Life to Live Rais massacre StarCraft: Uprising Extraordinary rendition Cindy Sheehan Columbine High School massacre USA PATRIOT Act Surveillance About a Boy Ranma __ characters Human rights in the United States Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Satanic ritual abuse Good Times Torture Cult James Hanratty Fred Phelps Sharon Tate Roy Meadow Paradox Neighbours Vivian Solon Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Amish Sin City The Contender (television series) Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks

my yr old daughter and yr old son want to share a room is this to old for a boy and a girl to share a room they want to get bunk beds and share a room because they saythey are best friends its sooo cute i am just wonderin everyones else thinking on this btw they have their own rooms at the momment the yr old sleeps in the yr olds bed every night though honestly i wouldn't worry about it at this age i do have to say one thing about someone elses comments tseruyah suggested it wasn't a good idea because boys are curious about the sexual differences between the sexes at this age but the truth is both boys and girls are curious about it no need to become paranoid though and what tseruyah says about the touching is a bit overboard it's normal for children to recognize the differences between boys and girls it's all part of growing up but her suggestion that your son would start touching your daughter inappropriately is ridiculous that is a learned behavior and usually occurs among siblings that have been molested by someone thus repeating what they have experienced on others around them it kinda bothers me that tseruyah would suggest such a thing and then include that this has happened among ppl she knows that would send up a red flag to me as a parent that something fishy was going on in that house kids are curious yes but usually they have questions or comments that they share w everyone about what it is they don't understand rarely do they touch each other knowingly as if they understood the function of each part of each others bodies as for how old is too old i'd say when your son starts to ask more questions about life in general the typical stuff that needs explaining the birds and the bees stuff then i would separate them that and he will be going through puberty around age and boys tend to want their privacy then i would however discourage the sleeping in the same bed not because of what could happen but simply that it's become a bad habit and needs to be broken now before your son is soon your son might not think it's such a fun idea to have little sis crowding his bed and your daughter might take this as a rejection of some sort and could hurt their bond as brother sister it's better to get across to your daughter now that sharing a room is okay but that everyone has their own sleeping space and needs to stay in it be prepared for your daughter to want and try to climb into your bed at night if she can't sleep w your yr old it sounds like she just is wanting comfort this is not much different from older kids that still want to sleep w the parents and the parents are conflicted on how to get their older child to sleep in their own bed your going to have the same issues here  Milton H.

how many of you actually think that someone who smokes pot recreationally is unable to care for their children if they're high when they're in charge of the kids no they can't care for them they might get lucky and nothing bad happen but they're screwed if an emergency should arise i don't care how 'recreational' it is no decent human being gets high in front of their kids and from experience i can tell you that no matter how much the user thinks they can 'maintain' they cannot properly react to a small child or even a small emergency when they're high it's just wishful thinking this question baffles me why would anyone even try to accomplish such a thing  Explosive material Theory of conduct Social rule 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Son Goku (Dragon Ball) They Might Be Giants Philosophy of language Ethics Luck Epistemology Origin belief Arguments for and against drug prohibition Philosophical Investigations Poker jargon Cannabis (drug) Humphrey Bogart Medicare (Canada) Socrates Health insurance Electrophysiology Emergence Mojave people The Care Bears (television series) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cancer Theodicy Volleyball Philosophical skepticism About a Boy Illegal drug trade ISO 9000 Magical thinking Beavis and Butt-head Free will Karen Horney Meme Publicly funded medicine Jean Chr__tien Miracleman Traditional Chinese medicine Origin of life Internet troll Bonsai Microeconomics Hollyoaks Extreme Programming Hillary Rodham Clinton Eric Cartman Scientology beliefs and practices Determinism Childfree Traumatic brain injury Time Out of Mind Japanese tea ceremony Goodness and value theory Pitaten Milton H.

and she wants a baby my niece ally who just turned yrs old months ago wants to have a baby to love and care for read last post more info she thinks that there are tons of single moms who make it working finishing school who get good jobs dress nicley and still get to have lives party ect she is basing this off of me and of my friends who are single moms but she is overlooking the fact that we were all yrs old or older when we became parents and also in college already she does not see how hard it was for us to finish college all the help we needed to do so or all of the tight budgeting involved that all the nice things she see's are the result of finishing college something that is difficult to do with a child to support how do i give her the reality check without beig too harsh is taking her to a parenting class for young or teen moms too harsh i have one child a daughter turning soon but i dont think i would trust them alone together there are classes at planned parenthood about teen mother's that might wake her up to the reality of it but hon sometimes the only way to learn a lesson is to make the mistake that's a harsh lesson to learn but sometimes no matter what you or anyone else could say if she is determined none of it will matter all you can do is be there for her if she doesn't listen i knew better didn't want a baby young but at made a stupid mistake and found myself pregnant i married the father always a bad idea and of course that ended in divorce i then worked jobs to support us both it sucked my child was always in daycare i didn't get to raise him the way i wanted in those early years i am one of the lucky ones i found a wonderful man that loves me my son and brought his son into my life we have children of our own too now but for every success there are more so that are still struggling my cousin thought the same thing just because i was okay she would be okay she is now living in a very crappy apartment her child is sick all the time from being born premature to a teen mother and she has no medical insurance the father is a creep of the th degree and she doesn't have much money coming into the home at all even though she works full time she has no money or time for college or higher learning because she is busy working to pay medical bills harsh yes but it's what she got herself into and she realizes that now of course she has her family there for her but she is so full of self pity that she is refusing our help she is still learning the hard way some ppl are just going to have to  Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Charmed Friends EastEnders Kodocha Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Hollyoaks Alois Hitler Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Infantilism Kim Possible Phoebe Halliwell Fancy Crane Good Times Everwood Married... with Children Laura Schlessinger Great Teacher Onizuka Abortion debate Neighbours Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Sharon Tate Luke and Laura Spencer The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ocean's Twelve Badly Drawn Kitties Boston Public Miss Saigon The Amber Spyglass Incarnations of Immortality Little Britain History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Sin City Recurring South Park characters Marilyn Monroe Daredevil Adoption Ranma __ characters Fathers' rights Le Malade imaginaire Poker jargon Lex Luthor Divorce Cindy Sheehan Satchel Paige Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Beavis and Butt-head Polyamory The O.C.

did having kids change you in what way how were you before having kids completely yes it was quite scary at first thinking there was this little person that totally depended on me all of a sudden it wasn't just 'me' anymore i was a mother i had a massive responsibility which arrived literally overnight nothing was ever the same again it's made me more mature in some ways and less mature in others i feel like i've turned into my mother in some respects but i am still capable of being completely daft and childish with my kids too it's fun to be able to let go of your inhibitions like that having my second child changed me even more because he is autistic having a child with special needs changes you it has to you find energy reserves you never knew you had and a level of patience and understanding you never had before every little bit of progress he makes gives me a thrill like nothing else my daughter always makes me proud but when he came along it gave the word a whole new meaning i don't find my life has been hugely restricted sure there are things we used to be able to do like pop out for a meal whenever we felt like it now we have to get a babysitter so it's more of a big occasion when we do it but really we've found there isn't much we aren't able to do if we put our minds to it we still have dinner parties we still socialise we still have a good time i suppose the biggest thing about having kids for me has been that knowledge that there is suddenly someone in the world i would die for without hesitation keeping them safe and well is my job and nothing else is as important as that  Autism Humphrey Bogart Social rule About a Boy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Milton H.

what do you think of the dugger family with the children mrs dugger just had her th child and is looking forward to having more i personally think she is sainted woman for having all those children and if she wants to have more i think that is great all the children are home schooled all the children help out with their brothers and sister i think the father did or does something in real estate i know he did something in congress like he was a congressman at one time they all helped built the house they are living in i also think they paid cash for it too all the children have the first name that starts with a j i think this is a wonderful family and the more the better i totally agree with you something that alot of people on here are not getting is that this family is extremely religious i actually believe the same way that they do in regards to having children they believe that every child they have is a blessing from god and they don't feel that it is their place to decide how many children god wants to bless them with that is why the mom doesn't use any form of birth control i also don't believe in using birth control however god has chosen to only bless me with children perhaps he knows that she can handle that many and i couldn't it has amazed me to read all the questions and answers on here over the last few days about this family and to see how many people just want to put down and critisize them some people are more concerned with the fact that this christian family had kids and isn't on welfare food stamps wic or public housing yet you hardly ever see anyone on here complaining about the teenagers high school drop outs and women who already have kids who are already on welfare food stamps wic and in public housing who continue to keep having more and more kids some guy commented to me on here that it is his business because they are eating up the resourses on our planet that he and his kids have to live on is he serious and those women who have kids and who are on every type of public assistance available arn't whether it was this family or teenagers who get pregnant with unwanted babies children are going to continue to be born in the country i would rather see them born into a family like that than to some teenager who is going to be in the welfare line every month that is what is using up our resources not this wonderful family  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Incarnations of Immortality Mary, the mother of Jesus Friends John the Baptist Welfare Laura Schlessinger Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Howard Yoder Herbert W.

what are some of the best ways to show your children how very proud you are of them although i have always been very proud of both of my children a year old boy and a year old girl recently due to a family crisis they have both had the opportunity to really step up and help out frankly i don't know what i would have done without them although i have told them both how proud i am i really want to do something that would really show them what has happened for you that really expressed how much pride and love your parents feel for you or how have you expressed this to your own children sometimes words just don't have the impact on people that i would like and actions definitely speak louder than words any suggestions i don't necessarily want to buy them anything i want to show them and i tell them all the time that i'm so proud of them maybe that's why telling them again doesn't have the impact i would like it to they are always great kids but they really knocked my socks off recently hence my appeal for ideas i had a friend that lost her dad that had to step in when her mother had just about lost it it was a trying time but i remember her and her sister and brother all pitched in when it got tough i think a year later or maybe it wasn't quite a year but i remember all of them taking a trip together this was due to her sincere gratitude and love for their genuine character loving nature to help one another and how proud of them she had been they all went to disney world that following christmas and my friend still to this day talks about it it was a healing time and a time for them to bond in a new way we are in our early s late twenties now and that happened when we were in high school for graduation her mom gave her a family heirloom to have and explained to her that she was so impressed with the amount of courage and maturity that she had shown that she knew that she was ready to be the new proud owner of her grandmother s ring it was really a big deal to my friend at the time she talks about that too to this day i think the letter idea is a good one too though just do what comes natural  2004 Republican National Convention Kodocha Friends Doug Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Great Teacher Onizuka Pride and Prejudice Kyle Broflovski Garfield Cliff Richard About a Boy Scrooge McDuck The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.

my five or six year old cousin wants me to teach her how to swim but i want to make sure i teach her the right way and that she's safe please give me some advice and no i'm not just gonna throw her in the water that would traumatize her thanks ok first of all my cousin is five or six i'm thirteen i was a lifeguard and swim instructor for seven years so i'll help you with the basics more advanced strokes she should go on a swim team or take swim lessons but to teach her how to swim just to save her life you can do if you are a strong swimmer first never take her into deep water the shallowest part of the pool is the best where she can stand second get her comfortable with the water if she's already comfortable the you start with floating you support her head with one hand and the other hand under her back tell her to put her hands out like and airplane and to hold her head back so you can see her eyes and she can see yours this is the correct formation hold her and tell her that you will remove the hand from her back but she must push her tummy to the sky as far as she can work on this until she is level then remove the head support once she is secure after she has back float down front float is a lot easier same principle but have her blow bubbles at first and slowly put her face in finally teach her the motions of swimming by moving her her arms for her through the water both for back stroke and front crawl i usually use analogies like if she has a dog dig in the yard for a bone like the dog digs once she has these motions down support either her tummy for front crawl or her back for back stroke and have her do the arm motions for back stroke make sure the pinky finger goes in the water first and and then she turns her hand and scoops the water forward if you don't feel comfortable with these basics then tell your aunt or uncle that you think your cousin should take swim lessons also and this is a must make sure you are at swimming pool that has a lifeguard on duty and that you do stay in the most shallow part of the pool at all times hope this helps  Swimming Breaststroke Backstroke Diving Butterfly stroke Aerial (dance move) Drowning Professional wrestling throws Swimming pool Front crawl Lifeguard Professional wrestling holds Medley swimming Tag Equine conformation History of swimming Canoe Kitesurfing Water polo Swingout Dog training Care Bears Suplex Triathlon Bottlenose Dolphin Diving suit Japanese tea ceremony Anchor Table tennis Shaggy dog story Skateboarding trick Aikido Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Naval mine Glossary of American football Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charleston (dance move) Pikmin Sandy Koufax Contredanse Russian joke The Inside Casualty lifting Johnny Weissmuller Car handling Powerbomb Poker jargon Boxing Golf Naruto jutsu Strap-on dildo Glossary of partner dance terms Breastfeeding West Coast Swing Parachuting Pushing hands Personal flotation device Sailing Big Brother (USA TV series) Theory of conduct Menstrual cup Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Arjuna Mercury 4 American football Taikyoku shogi Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Parade (military) Anatomical terms of location Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Bong Sport rowing Three Stooges Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Textile manufacturing Little Britain Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling attacks USS Tunny (SS-282) Epistemology USS Trigger (SS-237) Bleeding Dog agility Time Out of Mind Helicopter Heinkel He 112 USS Tang (SS-306) Cleveland Browns

should bad behaviour be rewarded when my boys were little if they did something wrong they had smacked bottoms or some other form of punishment if it was causing damage like when they flooded my kitchen playing firemen they had smacked bottoms and were made to put the damage right if it had been deliberate vandalism they wouldn't have been sitting down for a week and they'd spend that week doing lots and lots of chores to make up for what they'd done and think about not doing it again so why is it that teenaged graffiti artists who spray obscene language all over our town where young children can see it are given grants to attend art college and those who steal cars and drive them dangerously are sent on car maintainance courses or taken go carting what sort of a deterrent is that what example does it set to the children who stay within the law shouldn't vandals and thieves rather be birched and then set to work in the community in distinctive uniforms so that we can see justice being done i mean set to work on community projects like scrubbing their graffiti from the walls cleaning up the canals buiding cycle paths and play areas for the children and so on well i agree that these things should ideally be dealt with within the family but i am talking about families where this will not happen and then the authorities must step in yes they can be trained and rehabilitated with courses after they have been punished but i am talking about deterrence what incentive is there for the well behaved children to continue to do so if they see the naughty children constantly being rewarded and given all of the attention see what sparkles says also the public who suffer from their activities need to see justice being done or else one day there will be an explosion of vigilanti ism if there isn't already hence the public works idea why don't we just try it and see what happens well as i say above skeet i am talking about those families who will not discipline their own children as for the birch i have heared that when we did have it here very few went back for a second dose and that is the point isn't it if it works as a deterrence that is good enough for me and it's hardly anything more than a temporary short sharp shock that will hopefully change attitudes and behaviour permanently excellent answer caroline s and from real life experience not parenting books and theories we all knew what you say to be true once just as our parents and grandparents did before us well moonstone maybe you can begin to understand me i want the best for all of our children's and grandchildren's future and above all that means creating a decent society for them to grow up in families play the major role but if they don't and within families too grandparents can play a role thank you for your answer i agree with you too on that sparkles' edit b from the number of thumbs downs i get on here do you think that i would be elected ha ha i find the idea of constantly praising children and ignoring bad behaviour very wearing i went on a parenting course because i was having problems managing my then yr old son i got sick of having to 'meet him at his level' and tell him all the time how great he was if a child is kicking you in the shins how can you ignore this i was supposed to wait until the naughty behaviour had stopped and then praise him after a few disagreements with the course leader i said what's wrong with a quick whack it always seems to work so much faster he looked at me like i had suggested frying kittens every action must have a consequence this is a fact of life the sooner people get this the better  Theory of conduct Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Plame affair Ethics Spanking Corporal punishment Punishment Social rule Nicomachean Ethics Justification (theology) Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ecco the Dolphin Goodness and value theory Religion Dog training Motivation Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Graffiti Beetle in an Anthill Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Second language acquisition EastEnders Causality Leadership Theodicy The Catcher in the Rye Capital punishment Fathers' rights The nature of God in Western theology Determinism Economics Abortion debate Development of Darwin's theory Kender One Tree Hill (TV series) Grand Theft Auto (game) Originalism Contract Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Entropy Bernard Williams Karma Sin Buddhism Value system Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Futurama (TV series -

what do you think of a homeless shelter that refuses to house boy's ages i have a friend that got into a fight with her violent husband so she yr old son went to the local homeless shelter they would not let her stay b c her son was between the ages of the reason given was that there was no place to house the boy with other females the women may be afraid of boy's and there was a privacy issue with males females housed in close quarters the shelter told my friend to take her son to a shelter that housed run away teens leave him there then she would be welcomed to stay at the shelter she refused to leave her son with troubled teens who may be a bad influence on him so the shelter told her to just go back home isn't this illegal the shelter is discriminating against age gender singling out boy's in a specific age group just doesn't sound right to me do you think anything legal could be done to force the shelter to make suitable housing for boy's with their mom's if dad came in with same son they would be allowed to stay it's a family shelter they have different units one for men over one for females over without children one for mom's with children under other than the problem mentioned the shelter is a nice one they get a lot of from local churches business's not to mention funds from individuals i personally have donated a lot of money to them over the years but never again we live in oregon and i don't know about the laws here i can see both sides of the argument here but at the boy does know about females and the women's shelter doesn't know what kind of history that kid has or moral fiber for that matter  Domestic violence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Theory of conduct Anarcho-capitalism Kyle Broflovski Homelessness Fathers' rights Transsexuality Social rule Federal Marriage Amendment Age of consent Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Transgender Homosexuality and Christianity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Adolescence Shaggy dog story Gender role Salic law Order of succession Recurring South Park characters French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Pitaten Elections in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Grandview, U.S.A.

don't you hate it when people compare babies to animals there are actually people who think the life of a child is somehow lower or equal to an animal how insane is that i like my pets more than most people i meet and my dogs are like my kids but comparing the worth of a baby to an animal how could they i agree with you nobody should compare the life of an animal no matter how wonderful and loving that animal is to a child person no animal no matter how intelligent and capable can compare to a child an animal operates strictly on instinct and what it has learned been taught but a child has the ability to choose and gains more and more independence the older they get and can make a choice to accept or ignore what they have been taught in a way completely different than an animal so i totally agree how can you compare  Polyamory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abortion debate Speciesism Peter Singer Intelligence quotient Force (Star Wars) Dog Comparative psychology Predestination KaBlam!

did your father have an interest in you growing up i was talking with a friend today and i realized that my father wasn't really interested in me or my sister when we were kids unless we'd done something bad so he could punish us or if my mom was doing something with us for example when we were kids my sister had really bad diarhea and needed medicine it was dark outside and i asked my father if he could take us to cvs to get some he said no so i asked my mother when my father heard she was going to take us he suddenly was interested in driving he may have not known how to show his interest you would be surprised of the people who were not shown a lot of love and affection themselves as children and how difficult it is to give try to find out a little about his growing up years may help you to understand what is making him tick today  One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Pitaten The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha Rocko's Modern Life Shaggy dog story Springfield Elementary School Daredevil Doug Baby Blues Theory of conduct Kimi Finster The Fairly OddParents Milton H.

any australian parents out there who know what next year's csa changes are all about the csa is being incredibly coy about what the changes are supposed to achieve i can't find straight answers anywhere are they changing the child support formula and if so in which direction ie does the resident parent get more or less support from the non resident parent or is it possible that the csa is making it up as it goes along fathers should try thinking twice before they get tired of their wives clear out and beget more kids while their children are suffering doubly first from losing their dad then financially feckless dads deserve to get hit in the pocket however most of our pollies are men so it's inevitable they will take the men's side the link below might help they probably are making it up as they go along but it also looks like mothers will lose out yet again i scent the vocal bullying dads' lobby at work again intimidating the pollies single mums need to get a stronger voice imho  Father Kurt Cobain About a Boy The Fairly OddParents The Marshall Mathers LP Divorce Kyle Broflovski Child custody Little Britain Fathers' rights Calvin and Hobbes Fathers' rights movement in the UK Recurring South Park characters Bro'Town Biff Tannen Social rule Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Marriage 2000 Australian Grand Prix Child Support Agency Justification (theology) Dexter's Laboratory Grandview, U.S.A.

help my almost year old son has started using potty talk i e poopy butt pee pee head every time my son gets mad he calls me some kind of bad word like poopy butt or pee pee head or even worse stupid he learned it from another child whom we are no longer around anymore but he doesn't seem like he is ever going to forget these words when he isn't mad we talk about it and he agrees that we don't say stupid but then the minute he gets mad at me usually for telling him he can't have do something he resorts to name calling i am at my wits end we have tried time outs in his room using a naughty spot like supernanny and even the taboo discipline method spanking i never thought i would spank my child but this child doesn't seem to respond to any form of discipline no matter how vigilant we are by the way whoever decided they were the terrible twos never had a three year old i really agree with ignoring the behavior most kids at this age use this type of language and will grow out of it the more you make it a big deal the more he is going to use it if he start resorting back to using it as part of his everyday language he may be using it as a way to get your attention kids at that age love attention regardless if its positive or negative attention don't use the hot sauce method my mom used to do that to me and my brother and i used to wish she would die so it wouldn't happen anymore  Spanking Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct El Chavo del Ocho Milton H.

am i a bad parent my ten year old son only wears crocs to school and the rest of the time he is barefoot and my six year old has never had any thing on his feet i always go barefoot my self because today we went to walmart and my kids wear the only kids just wearing there bathing suits we wear all barefoot and my kids did not have shirts on you are a far better parent than all those people who believe in myths and unfounded fears of every little germ their children may encounter and who give in to social pressure based on such unfounded beliefs contrary to those myths going barefoot is very healthy even in a city environment disease is unlikely unless they put their feet on the table or lick their toes our skin is made to keep pathogens out and we're at far greater risk of picking something up through our hands dirt from the ground may be more visible but with our hands we touch surfaces touched by many other people door knobs railings shopping carts etc and pick up the far less visible but no less germy dirt from those then we're far more likely to transfer those germs to our faces or food where they can enter our body on our feet it may look dirty but the dirt will just sit there until we wash it off parasites are unlikely too far most only enter the body by ingestion the hookworm that can enter through the skin has been pretty much eradicated from the south since modern plumbing has replaced the outhouses and never was a problem in cooler climates injury is unlikely feet get very tough very quickly i go barefoot everywhere never divert my step no matter how much glass i see and i get a tiny splinter maybe once a year never had a cut in the unlikely case of an injury they should have their tetanus vaccinations up to date but any active kid or adult should have that there are other ways of catching it apart from stepping on a rusty nail barefoot about social pressures please dare to be different people who wear alternative dress make the world more interesting imagine we'd all wear the same fashion clothes teach your children to accept people who prefer to look different rather than to 'dress for success' the first is a much more important lesson to learn if you ask me don't raise them to become judgmental like some of the posters in this thread  Diving Barefoot Skateboarding trick Clothing Spanking Aerial (dance move) Japanese tea ceremony Volleyball Oral sex Decompression sickness Undergarment Customs and etiquette of Japan Social aspects of clothing Foodborne illness Wound Sento Human sexual behavior Comanche Paul Is Dead Tattoo Hygiene Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Softball Allergy Infantilism Pneumonia Irish dance Autism Common cold Columbine High School massacre Tetanus Diving suit Drowning Horse Skin Psoriasis Fast bowling M16 (rifle) Poliomyelitis Asperger syndrome Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hookworm Textile manufacturing terminology Tire Drill bit Toilet Electrophysiology Hazing Biological warfare Urinary incontinence Horseshoe Dairy Ascariasis Boston Public Figure skating Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sauna Professional wrestling match types Fencing Codename: Kids Next Door The Fairly OddParents Gender role Trailer Park Boys Vampire Nuclear fallout Milton H.

what to can i do when school starts for my six year old my six year old son has never had anything on his feet he is always barefoot he has been at preschool for two years barefoot what would be good for his feet to start wearing because my old son ten years old only wears crocs to school and is barefoot all the rest of the time there are schools that allow crocs flipflops and even bare feet but in the us they are very rare if you can't find one nearby print some of the material in the source and see if you can convince the teacher to let him go barefoot at least at his desk the anti barefoot dress codes are usually based on unfounded fears about injury or disease while in fact going barefoot is very healthy for everyone but especially for growing children it's sad so many people in the us believe in all these unfounded myths about injury and disease in most other countries including the rest of the western world more people know it for a healthy habit  Barefoot Johnny Appleseed Flat feet Social aspects of clothing High-heeled shoe Modesty Horseshoe Foot Paul Is Dead Duesberg hypothesis Disease Montessori method AIDS Spanking Foot-and-mouth disease Gender role Diving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Crocodile Urinary incontinence Public health in mainland China Irish dance Supernatural Steve Irwin Shaggy dog story Poliomyelitis Dissociative identity disorder Carpal tunnel syndrome Siege of Jerusalem (1099) Lhoba Columbine High School massacre Clothing Education in Taiwan Foot odor Mission UK School uniform David Beckham The Wiggles Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what are parents views on having a cellphone for their kids what ages do you believe are complelty inappropriate for kids to have their own cellphones my neice who is years old was approached by a girl in school who asked to have her cell phone number my sister was astonished then the girls mother actually asked my sister if my neice had a cell phone and explained that her year old daughter has one for emergancies and joked that she had already had it taken away for texting too much hello does anyone else think that this is absurd i am all for using technology to keep our young ones safe i myself will allow my children to have cellphones on their person when they are old enough to keep communication readily available i think in todays world we need that safety they have programs for kids such as emergancy installed prepaid phones blocked numbers aside from emergancy contacts and maybe one or other personal but i think this should begin once the child enters high school possible junior high if you believe it is acceptable what reasons can you give because in my eyes there should be no year old un accompainied by an adult an year old has no business being without supervision long enough to need a cell phone for emergancies they are either i school where there is access to land line phones at home again landlines or at a friends house land lines i'll give the bennefit of the doubt and say that the child i possibly walking home from school and in order to ensure safety the parents give her a cell phone to walk to and form school but it should end there block all outgoing and incoming calls except that of emergancy contacts and what year old has such anetwork of friends that a cell phone is needed for personal enjoyment its crazy i think they dont need a cell phone until they are responsible enough to leave the house without me or their dad with them whether that is or either way they have to prove themselves  Mobile phone Short message service North American Numbering Plan Global System for Mobile Communications The Fairly OddParents Contemporary culture of South Korea Kodocha Telephone tapping Sharon Tate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mobile phone radiation and health About a Boy Ocean's Twelve Social rule Call for help Morse Code 9-1-1 Telkom Fathers' rights GSM services Verizon Wireless Surveillance School bus Domestic violence One Tree Hill (TV series) Generation Y Skype Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Communication during the September 11, 2001 attacks The Shining (film) Telephone Cornelia Rau War of the Worlds (2005 film) Bluetooth Drowning Modem Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Springfield Elementary School High school Air traffic control Final Fantasy: Unlimited Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Beaumont children disappearance Ben Johnson (athlete) Hearing impairment StarCraft Secret Missions Gmail Virgin Mobile Emergency telephone number Transsexuality Pitaten Motion picture rating system Code division multiple access Burglar alarm Humphrey Bogart John Kerr UK telephone numbering plan Columbine High School massacre Mitosis Saved by the Bell Solar cell Over-the-air programming The Catcher in the Rye Salad Fingers Mystique (comics) Code: Lyoko Autism Silent Night, Deadly Night Child Human sexual behavior Baby Blues Customer relationship management Codename: Kids Next Door Order of succession Meiosis Shaggy dog story Plame affair Network Switching Subsystem The End of the World (Doctor Who) Elevator Private branch exchange Emergency service Hiking Argentine telephone numbering plan Adolescence Jennifer Lopez Camera phone G-Man (Half-Life) The Emancipation of Mimi AT&T Database management system Extreme Programming Shawn Michaels Hikikomori Digital Subscriber Line Kill Bill

daugter and disrepecting so i have two kids one is and the other will be at the end of this year my daughter has just started kindergarten and wanted to know why she would be disrespecting her mom me and her are very civil in front of the kids and say nothing bad to each of the kids but my daughter will not talk to her or listen to her at all i am able to talk to my daughter and and discuss how her day went i am able to get her to do simple chores like dishes laundry cleaning and vacuuming her room the mom on the other hand states that she is not able to get her to do anything and ignores her pretty much all the time i am sorry i didn't say that she has been doing it for a little while already it has just gotten worse this past week since she has started school it's hard to tell from your question who the child lives with or if you and your wife are living together or separated but it's perfectly normal if the daughter is for her to be going through her romantic phase this is the time of a girl's life when she briefly detaches from the mother who will be her main support and confidante most of her life and expresses her preference for her father this is very normal and just means she will like boys when she grows up psychologists call this the romantic phase but of course it has nothing to do with adult romance or sexuality she is just imaging you in her affections and bonding with you as a daughter this phase doesn't happen with sons because they continue their romantic feelings toward their mothers throughout their childhood and never need to change from them  Kodocha Pedophilia Transsexuality Love About a Boy Infantilism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sexual orientation Laura Schlessinger Transactional analysis Child sexuality Alois Hitler Childlove movement One Tree Hill (TV series) Narcissism Maison Ikkoku The Fairly OddParents One Life to Live Charmed Humphrey Bogart Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Shaggy dog story English grammar Sharon Tate Puberty Recurring South Park characters Baby Blues Phoebe Halliwell Incest The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kylie Minogue Domestic violence Pitaten Theory of conduct Kimi Finster EastEnders Gwen Stacy Luke and Laura Spencer Jean Grey Kindergarten Doug Another World (TV series) Extreme Programming Kim Possible Serial killer Cindy Sheehan Kurt Cobain Days of our Lives Human sexual behavior Springfield Elementary School Timmy Turner Kyle Broflovski Alena Taken For Better or For Worse 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Modernism T'Pol Androgen insensitivity syndrome My Life as a Teenage Robot Phase (matter) Babe Carey Asperger syndrome Boston Public Megan Griffin Knots Landing Earth Girl Arjuna Philip J.

what do you think about multi age classrooms especially anyone that has had a child in a k class or teachers i have just found that my son is going to be in a multi age classroom this year i had already known he'd be with the same teacher from last year and i had said that i thought that a multi age classroom might be good for him i had read about some benefits including overall more acceptance of differences and of peers less peer pressure the fact that children grow and learn from siblings that are of different ages than them it can promote leadership and nurturing qualities as far as i know they will all be learning the first grade curriculum children kindergarten age that are ready to begin learning first grade skills already will be in this class along with the st graders i can see how it could benefit a child like my own who entered school at an early age and give them extra time to mature at their own rate and i like that he will still be learning st grade level work i was also wondering if anyonelse had any thoughts on this or anyone that who has experienced this could i used to teach at a school that had rooms and was grade k i taught special ed there so i didn't have experience in the classrooms but i did observe them it was k then then then i think it really helped the kids being in those kinds of classes they would have frequent study times while the teacher taught the other side of the room i subbed in one of them before and it went really smoothly the kids played together well if you have the right teacher and limited students i think k would work well  Education in the United States Education Education in Japan Experiential education Graduate school Secondary education in Japan Education in Taiwan Homeschooling Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Drama No Child Left Behind Act Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gifted Intelligent design movement Primary education Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Romania Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Alexander Technique Glen Ridge, New Jersey High school E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

do economics and government force many parents to be neglectful continued parents tired and stressed from work buying fast food more often than cooking healthy foods guilty from spending little time with their children parents handing out material goods unaccounted for cash tired parents willing to let their kids go out as often as they'd like whether or not homework is done i don't see how economics or government effect parental decisions such as the ones you stated instead of buying fast food they could set a crock pot before they leave for work and have a healthy dinner or spend time with their kids preparing the evening meal together if they feel guilt from spending little time with their kids they can change jobs they may not make as much and may not have the huge house fancy cars all the latest gadgets but their kids would know they were more important than all these material things and being tired is no excuse to allow your kids to run the neighborhood the rest of us are tired too and don't want to police other people's kids  About a Boy EastEnders Passover Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fast food Breakfast Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) The Amazing Race Restaurant Meal Social rule Hamburger Slow cooker Economy of the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kitchen Recipe Inspector Gadget Rosa Parks Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Theory of conduct Microeconomics Eating Ben Johnson (athlete) Ronald McDonald Labour economics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Burger King The Human Stain Externality Customs and etiquette of Japan Game programming Gross domestic product Infantilism Codename: Kids Next Door Wall Street Eid ul-Fitr Transactional analysis Joseph Haydn Hypoglycemia Great Depression Arguments for and against drug prohibition Knots Landing Lindsay Lohan Monetary policy Phil Hendrie Drag racing Economic inequality The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hell's Kitchen (television) Bruce Johnson Chopsticks Foodborne illness George Brown, Baron George-Brown Supply and demand Food Not Bombs Energy economics The Catcher in the Rye The Contender (television series) $ale of the Century Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Fast bowling Trailer Park Boys Phil of the Future Mary Wollstonecraft The Jeffersons (South Park) Viva La Bam Calvin and Hobbes Apple Health insurance Food Monopoly (game) Tire Korean cuisine Humphrey Bogart Capitalism Healthy eating Cultural Revolution Babylonian law Oasis (band) American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Our Gang Culture of Japan Laura Schlessinger Hillary Rodham Clinton Education in the People's Republic of China Survivor (novel) Cookware and bakeware Cleveland Browns Anger management YMCA Sauerkraut Little Britain They Might Be Giants John the Baptist

how old were you when you had your first child did it make you grow up how did it change your perception i love to read comments stories of how children have enhanced the lives of their parents too often i hear of how children are a burden or they cost a lot of money and my kids bring me grief and so on while these things are certainly unescapable there are many wonderful memories and dreams to come about our legacies will you share your experience i honestly believed i had everything figured out when it came to kids i was and married had a degree in child development and childhood education tons of babysitting and teaching experiences under my belt and couldn't possibly think of anything else i would need to know to parent a child i was all set had the baby's room painted and full of furniture every baby gadget i thought the baby might use and all i needed was for him to pop out so i could start to be the world's best mom my son nicholas was born on march two weeks early and by march i knew that i was no where near prepared as i thought i was no the baby didn't get up every x hours like i learned in school he didn't use x amount of diapers or fall alseep after drinking x amount of formula by god he came weeks early and threw me all off i remember calling my mom stressed out and crying nicholas isn't following what i learned in school she laughed and said you mean he didn't read up before he came out i told him he had until the mid march you can't parent from a book and you can always go by what you read i had a big reality check as weeks when on it seemed like everything i had learned in school was wrong when it came to my son i learned to work around him what little dances and songs i had to sing and do to get him to sleep how much clothing to put on him how to change his diaper when to do household chores when i should sleep when i should eat when to do this and when to do that and what worked best for me and my son parenting wasn't a piece of cake like i thought it would be but i got better at it and learned through trial and error and little tips here and there from my mom and others i couldn't believe how much stuff i bought that the baby nevered used it's the best way to learn through experience when my nd one came along two years later i was prepared as they got older and i added more children to my family you learn to manage to take one day at a time and enjoy what is life throws at you maybe things don't go as you planned but the most imporant thing i learned when i became a parent is to just go with it if he doesn't make it to soccer practice on time if he doesn't get an a on his test if he doesn't learn to share by a certain age or write his name at a certain age i work with them and fix the problem i'm now a mother of boys ages and and am pregnant with a little girl i'm preparing for whatever surprises she brings to the family lol  EastEnders Friends Shaggy dog story Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga Extreme Programming Pitaten Great Teacher Onizuka Blood on the Tracks Kurt Cobain Characters in the Smurfs Avenue Q Milton H.

how long after i stop brestfeeding does the milk stop coming i actually don't know the answer but i would have to guess that it might depend on how long you have been breastfeeding i have been breastfeeding for over years almost entirely the whole time so i have no clue but i do have a friend that breastfed for quite awhile not as long as i have and she still had milk for months or more afterwards but it was not uncomfortable for her in any way she was just surprised that there was still some there ok i just looked it up with a simple internet search breastmilk after weaning on google and found this http www breastfeed com resources articles mybody htm milk milk go away you thought when you stopped nursing your milk would magically disappear right wrong believe me i was in the same boat and was quite surprised when drops of milk kept showing up week after week after week and i'm not alone i was a little taken aback by how long it took for the milk to completely dry up says carson several weeks after i had stopped breastfeeding and pumping i noticed that i could still produce milk according to james milk can be expressed for weeks and even months yes it's true after the weaning process ends in addition she says leaking is common early in weaning but stops when the breasts acclimate to the decrease in breastfeeding for moms who are ready to leave milk stained bras behind the slowness of milk to dry up can be disconcerting especially when you're surprised with a sudden spray during an intimate moment with your husband any stimulation even your shirt apparently can encourage milk flow while you're drying up you may be wondering where the leftover milk goes according to james any remaining milk is reabsorbed into the body mystery solved  Breast Brassiere Dairy Breast milk Fertility awareness Milk Protein-energy malnutrition Shaggy dog story Oxytocin Prostate cancer Prolactin Childbirth Mastitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin D Haloperidol Infant formula Breast cancer Who Shot Mr. Burns?

are there any parents here that oppose corporal punishment often when this debate comes up the people who oppose corporal punishment for children are usually assumed to be childless folks who just happened to get ahold of a few child psychology books in my life i have heard a few parents one even had grown kids say that they did not see spankings and whatnot as necessary forms of punishment so i was just wondering if there were any parents here that opposed it and what the reasoning was thanks i'll turn around the old 'pro spanking' argument just for the fun of it my parents never spanked any of us we all turned out fine i'm the th of kids in my family by the way oldest was born in the late 's my parents weren't trendy psychology book reading people so i would imagine that they too were not spanked and that they probably had peer parents that both weren't spanked and didn't spank but anyway spanking was not a necessary teaching method in my family when i was raised i can't imagine why i would choose to physically hurt someone especially my own child when it wasn't necessary that's why we don't spank  Spanking Corporal punishment Punishment James Dobson Parenting Homeschooling The Giver Human sexual behavior Paddle (spanking) Erotic spanking Serial killer Theodicy Caning Buttocks Child abuse Infantilism Capital punishment Children of God Transsexuality L.O.C.K.D.O.W.N.

how is it possible to forget you have a child in the car i'm not a mother but i know if i had a child i would not forget that they are in the car there has been a rash of these incidents lately and am wondering how is this possible to add to this question no not everyone is perfect but that is ridiculous you carry a child in your stomach for nine months you would think you would excercise a little more caution the only thing i can think of is that they parents are busy and their minds are elsewhere and the baby is asleep so they aren't making any noise but honestly i don't know all i know is that i couldn't forget my son in the car  Jam (TV series) Joke Shaggy dog story EastEnders Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Adoption Philosophical skepticism Humphrey Bogart Treehouse of Horror IX Kender Russian joke Night (book) Friends Childbirth Abortion debate Sudden infant death syndrome Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Infantilism Jon Secada Milton H.

for mothers of school age children how do you handle placing your child in a school that you know has been rated low we live in an area where the schools are okay our original plan was to put our children in private school but it is not in the budget what do you do to keep your child reaching their potential when the school isn't necessarily challenging your child i agree with the second post if you find the education system in your area to be lacking you can supplement education at home you have to decide what you are willing to invest in how much you think your kids may be missing and what time and tools you have available to you i have kids in school now and we have two hours a day during the summer that they devote to reading writing etc so their skills aren't dulled by the long summer also during the year we have set homework times and reading times if the kids don't bring home any work from school we supply them with worksheets for that period of time it's not long we aren't dictators lol but their education is important to us and also not being able to budget private schooling we feel we should do something to help their progress  Education Education in England Education in the People's Republic of China Theory of conduct Homeschooling School choice Education in Scotland Economy of Russia Supply-side economics Education in Japan Education in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 No Child Left Behind Act Slot machine Deficit spending Education in Hong Kong Ben Johnson (athlete) Baseball GED Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Shaggy dog story Education in France Manitoba Hydro Procrastination CPU cache Keynesian economics Homework Unemployment Boston Public Tripartite System Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product Dalton McGuinty Literacy Publicly funded medicine Weight training Education in India Phonics Graduate school Boarding school Economic inequality The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Amber Spyglass Economy of Nigeria Political subdivisions of New York State Warren Buffett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of India Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Crew Exploration Vehicle Hikikomori Israeli Arab Mutual fund Asperger syndrome Breastfeeding Economy of Maldives Labour economics Oxford English Dictionary Kender The Cure The Jeffersons (South Park) Public education Freeters FairTax Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Air traffic control Rosa Parks Reginald Maudling The Cat in the Hat Floppy disk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Debugging Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Belgium Wall Street The Critic Education in Portugal Poker jargon Digimon History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Disney's California Adventure Anarchism and society Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Test (student assessment) Reaganomics Microeconomics CPU design Charter school Initial D The Apprentice 2 The O.C.

should parents take more responsibility ok first off let me explain that i in no way endorse the filth that is child pornography in any way shape or form but my point is valid non the less do you think that parents should take more care in what they dress their children in these days i see so many young girls walking around in clothes that make adults look like slappers and when you see shops selling bras for year olds it makes you wonder are they encouraging the problem i'm not saying its the parent or the childs fault if anything was to happen or that it makes it ok for the paedophile but should parents be a little more thoughtful and dress their children as children oh i couldn't agree more the shops are just as much to blame however there are still shops that sell clothing that's perfectly fine if people stopped buying it the shops wouldn't stock it some one obviously had an idea which for some reason caught on this is a tricky question because i personally do not agree with little girls wearing bra's or g strings nor do i like them wearing hot pants and tiny skirts that most would call a belt however paedophiles strike no matter what a child is wearing its more a case that some parents have babies and wish them into adulthood very quickly yes the parents are to blame for making them look older as they have ultimate control but this does not cause paedophiles to abuse children they do it because they fantasise about having sex with children and believe they have the right to do so although they know it is wrong they break through the external and internal barriers that would stop normal people from abusing children i love the question though because it gets us all thinking and debating i was abused as a child and to my horror i discovered a close family member was abusing my then year old and my year old i have set up a website to try and help abuse victims see the light please feel free to post this question in my forum www libertyfromabuse com many thanks  Childlove movement Serial killer Child pornography Undergarment Transsexuality Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Gender role Sento Child sexuality Transactional analysis About a Boy EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rape Theodicy Theory of conduct Androgen insensitivity syndrome False memory Video game controversy Brassiere Free will North American Man/Boy Love Association Dissociative identity disorder French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Comanche Polyamory Child Jam (TV series) Pornography Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Microeconomics Child sexual abuse Cross-dressing Characters in the Smurfs Solar system Social aspects of clothing We Belong Together Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Intelligence quotient Avenue Q Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Ex-gay Professional wrestling match types Children of God Human sexual behavior Good Times Adult Charmed Neopets Trailer Park Boys Prostitution Nudity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cult Borderline personality disorder Past teachings of Prem Rawat Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Satanic ritual abuse Autism Madonna (entertainer) Kylie Minogue Miss Saigon Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child Trousers One Tree Hill (TV series) Divorce Friends Left-handed Paedophile Information Exchange Spanking Bish__jo game Hikikomori Aqua Teen Hunger Force Incest Scientology beliefs and practices The Amber Spyglass

when your child children from the ages listens follow simple instructions behaves what do you award them with example a piece of candy a day out buy them a toy etc i know that you can't always award them with things because then they'll get use to it that's how it leads to getting spoiled but most kids that act up a little don't understand if you just give them a hug or kiss for behaving because i don't stop giving my kids hugs or kisses because they don't behave i give them that at all times wether being bad or good if they behave listen something that they're not use to doing why not award them with something for example i will take my kids out to the park if they behave or maybe give them something they don't eat every day perhaps gummie bears or maybe a bag of chips what do you guys think you reward them with a pat on the back and i am proud of you the reason you wouldn't want to spend on them for listening or take them out is because you will be setting up the expectation of that reward each time children are supposed to listen and we as moms are trained these days to think that we must reward the listening when instead rewarding should be saved for behavior that is by far and wide exceptional children deep down want to impress their parents and to be noticed so by just doing that you are encouraging more good behavior minus the hand out for a freebie try reading the new six point plan for raising happy healthy children by dr john rosemond i wish i had read that when my kids were younger it really helps put things into perspective and it's not like any other parenting book i have ever read good luck mom and keep up the good work  Theory of conduct The Fairly OddParents Dog training Care Bears Humphrey Bogart The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Microeconomics Kodocha Laura Schlessinger The Catcher in the Rye Kyle Broflovski David Hume English grammar Customs and etiquette of Japan Social psychology Milton H.

re should i allow them out thanks to everyone who answered just to add i have tried sitting out front with them but i end up with every child in the place in the garden i even had parents lift there child over the gate and ask if they can play it was turning into a creche for everyone i tried inviting other kids in to play but parents again took advantage and would leave them all day i often gave them lunch and dinner no one would come looking for them so now i just keep to myself i had enough of it but every time i walk out my door i get looks or else they all turn there backs to me i try to just ignore it but its not easy at times to be peoples enemy for no reason my kids are happy out and have cousins coming to stay tonite and thery are great buddies and play great together also its not just small kids here its teenagers too and they get a great kick out of teaching them bad language ive even seen them drinking and kids sitting in the middle of it very good linda c maybe im just too quiet and i have to say life is more peaceful since i put an end to it you would be within your rights to tell people to go home if it isn't convenient tell them people can't take advantage of you without your permission so don't be concerned about what they think they don't respect you i often had kids just show up wanting to play that's okay but i make them call their mothers and set a specific time limit if they couldn't contact their mom they couldn't stay every time i was doing yard work my kids liked to help so did half the kids in the neighborhood i was a working mom and most of the moms in the neighborhood weren't so i couldn't understand why my yard was such a magnet i made sure the kids went home very dirty and the visits stopped maybe you could work out something like that when my kids were in high school there were rules at home such as no kids can visit when mom isn't home no drinking smoking or swearing at our house violators banned for life unfortunately not all parents make rules like that i was a divorced working mom so i didn't have time to mess around with disciplining other people's kids behave or leave if the parents want to chew me out they can leave too i thought of putting a sign on the door that said did i invite you if not go home i guess you could call me the meanest mom on the block here's another one top this kids playing basketball in the street in front of my house until p m shouting and screaming i had to be at work at a m so needed my sleep i talked to the kids but it didn't do any good i called the parents and it didn't do any good so what i did was call the parents when i had to leave for work in the morning just thought i'd let you know that your kids kept me awake last night and i'm returning the favor for some reason the basketball players found a different place  Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Social rule Volleyball Tag Muslim ibn Aqeel EastEnders Satchel Paige Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Catcher in the Rye The Inside Pitaten The Marshall Mathers LP Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Kyle Broflovski Futurama (TV series - season 5) Customs and etiquette of Japan Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q Poker jargon Rosa Parks Cindy Sheehan Rent (musical) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Milton H.

how different is it having children than i've always heard people say that after kids it's all the same how true could that possibly be i already have a car that will fit a th child i'm not concerned financially heck after two it was all the same for me you have to make dinner just add a few more of the same ingredients so it's just about the same you have to shop for clothing just pick up one or two more outfits thankfully much can be handed down so that is just about the same you are already changing diapers so one more doesn't matter what is an extra minutes i babysit two children and they just sort of fall into line with the rest of my kids i look a bit funny walking around with two extra toddlers i guess because i get a lot of comments but to me it doesn't seem like that big of deal because there is not much difference from to shrug i think it's all in how you look at it if you think you will struggle then you will if you think of it as no big deal and just go about your day then it's no big deal  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Diaper Kimi Finster Social rule The Apprentice 2 Wheel of Fortune Late Night with Conan O'Brien Invader Zim Theory of conduct Jackass: The Movie Rich Mullins The Sims 2 Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology Garfield Sheepshead Little Britain Aerial (dance move) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Joke Our Gang Winning Streak Recurring South Park characters Teachers (film) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Trailer Park Boys EastEnders Time Out of Mind Infant baptism About a Boy Philosophical skepticism Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 President (game) SpongeBob SquarePants Vegeta 2000 Australian Grand Prix Baldrick Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garth Brooks The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Extreme Programming The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Escape from New York Calvin and Hobbes Card Sharks Fecal incontinence Spot the Dog Hey Jude Teletubbies Whose Line Is It Anyway?

please help me i need your opinions about what is your opinion to the unwed mothers i feel you will get a big debate of different answers on this subject here's my take people look down on unwed mothers becasue society thinks it is wrong but how many people get married and have kids that end in divorce today i feel marriage isn't something that you should do because your pregnant it is harder on the single parent but it depends on that persons ambitions on how their life goes i agree that some kids have a hard time with growing up without two parentss but why marry and ended up in divorce that cause problems for the kids as well i think kids need two parents and just because the parents didn't marry doesnt mean they cant have parents the real questions should be why have kids if you dont want to be a parent because having kids is a lot of work and if you aren't willing to make sacrifces in your life then don't have them so i feel it isn't a fact for unwed mothers that they have low education poverty ect it is simply a problem that exsists for unwed mothers divorced mothers divorced fathers unwed fathers and many wed parents as well society doesn't accept because we all have a white picket fence view of life and it doesn't exsist we can believe that it does but we are only lying to ourselves there are bigger problems in our world than a single unwed mother  Marriage Divorce Theory of conduct Abortion debate Friends Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Adoption Roe v.

spoiled children my children are draining me the more i try to make them happy the more miserable they are i am an older mom with young children how can i make them understand isn't the same as being your job is not to make them happy your job is to guide them you need some objective outside help so you can change your unsuccessful parenting patterns kids will run you over if you let them the key is to let them know what you expect and hold them accountable for their responses this is not to say you should make their lives miserable you have to be creative in finding ways to enjoy them and let them enjoy you too one thing i learned is the harder you try to get anything done the harder it is to succeed when they demand your attention stop what you're doing and really focus on their needs usually they just need to know you're paying attention and that you care then they'll go entertain themselves for a while and you can actually get more done  Pitaten Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Milton H.

did i deserve my big big spanking and punishment i'm last week i smoked at home and mom spanked me it was so embarrassing as it was in front of my friends she stripped me naked asked my friends if they wanted to see me spanked of 'em said yes and my mom took me to livingroom and spanked me with a hairbrush it hurted a lot and my friends laughed when i bawled then she let me wear my top without bra and asked all friends to come in n look at my red bare butt with my hands on my head for mins then she asked me to kneel down and raise my hands for min naked u think i deserved it and i was to stay bare bottomed that day and go shopping with my mom crap everyone there laughed at me mom also made me wear a shirt which was printed my mom spanked me in front of my friends did i deserve it i think so 'coz smoking was strictly prohibited in my house that's a nice try but actually it is not a nice try you have added to many highly unbelieveable facts and that makes people not to believe your story i'd suggest you make it a bit shorter with only the spanking in front of your friends without the bare bottom and all the other stuff about t shirts and walking naked etc i mena this is more likely to be believed to then a cup of such facts at the same time and also next time try to say you are or because spanking an yo is let's say hysically impossible if the yo doesn't want to be spanked and it would be more believeable if you say that nothing happened in front of anybody else but add some harsh facts for example my mom tied me to the bed and spanked me of course after you say you're to sum up the story is funny but i highly doubt anyone with his all intelligence in usa i mean people who are not that intelligent usually would believe and that makes it not the way you want and you want to see comments as what call cps your mother is crazy or omg how could a mother do that to her child it is possible just try to make the story a little bit more believeable and don't forget to cut off some really strange facts good luck  Spanking Erotic spanking Shaggy dog story Social rule Undergarment Buttocks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mojave people Recurring South Park characters Theory of conduct Ron and Fez Nudity Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Plame affair Bart chalkboard gags Good Morning, Vietnam Have I Got News For You Humphrey Bogart Rocko's Modern Life Downing Street memo SpongeBob SquarePants The Ashlee Simpson Show Hazing Opie and Anthony Paul Is Dead Punishment Paddle (spanking) Kim Possible Undergrads Dilbert Sento Jam (TV series) Cindy Sheehan Sharon Tate Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sin City Dogville Time Out of Mind Joke Sinfest Strap Rich Mullins Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Friends Kenny McCormick Trailer Park Boys Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Doug Cigarette Smoking Man Fred Phelps The Smoking Room The Marshall Mathers LP Mnemonic Mickey Mouse Brassiere Springfield Elementary School Pok__mon Live!

would you scold someone else's kid or does it bother you when other people scold and or discipline your child or children i ask cause it really pisses me off and i just wanted to know if maybe i am exaggerating i am always on top of my kids let me tell you maybe i should have explained more so people won't jump to conclusions basically if i am scolding my children i don't need anyone's help especially if you've already screwed up your own kids people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones yes i am a little touchy about this topic but i can't help it they came out of me and i am a damn good mother i don't think anyone else should be butting in where they're not wanted or needed if you are in the process of scolding your own children and someone butts in with their two cents worth you are perfectly right to be angry about that they have no business doing so however once your kids are in school and or joining various groups it is perfectly acceptable for an adult in charge of their well being to scold them as the mother of two i have been a cub scout leader and a h leader i can tell you there have been times when i had to scold some of the kids it's generally no big deal but occasionally the offense was fairly serious and i felt compelled to tell the parents what the child did and how i handled it i do not remember a time when the parents were indignant over this if they were i would probably have told them that perhaps another group would be better for their child  The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Scouting Theory of conduct About a Boy Recurring South Park characters Narcissism Zhao Yun Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Aerial (dance move) Damn Yankees Pitaten Rent (musical) Chess (musical) Ken Ichijouji Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist True Crime: Streets of LA Shaggy dog story Codename: Kids Next Door One Piece minor characters South Park Babe Ruth Trailer Park Boys Code: Lyoko Eric Bischoff The Fairly OddParents Calvin and Hobbes Billy the Kid Electrophysiology The Jeffersons (South Park) Economics Criticism of libertarianism Spanking Make money fast Lance Armstrong God Emperor of Dune Professional wrestling attacks Boy Scouts of America Grief Recess (TV series) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule Shawn Michaels Kender E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

why do the fervent 'pro spankers' keep shoving their view at everyone that spanking is the 'only' discipline in actual fact spanking is a punishment not a discipline but that's beside the point the strangest part is when someone who spanks claims that someone is lying when they say they don't spank and have well behaved kids does this then mean that we can assume if you do spank you are lying about how hard and actually do abuse them of course not why do you have to be so defensive look back over some spanking questions about if the rude and ignorant answers are coming from the die hard pro spankers nobody wants you to say it's wrong it isn't just stop making out that yours is the only punishment that works can anyone see this point let me apologise in advance if this causes offence to anybody it's not meant to i'm just trying to understand why people are like this oh for heaven's sake mimi and a couple of the others please read the question i'm not asking for yet another debate on for or against spanking i've already aknowledged that it's just some very fervent pro spankers who do this and yes some very fervent anti spankers do it also but most of the rude responses come from pro spankers i'm not against spanking i don't know how many times it takes for that to sink in frankly even i am beginning to think of these people as ignorant judging by some very misguided responses pink cowgirl all of the above applies to you lol i'm not shoving my views down anyone's throat i'm asking why other people do that i don't know how much clearer i can make my questions i thought they were pretty easy to understand if you can't read them don't bother responding as for why i keep asking about certain topics not that it's anyone's business it's because i'm interested want to know something and have as much right to post non offensive material on this forum as anyone else does again if you don't like them don't answer them easy not everyone is this way  Spanking Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Socrates Plame affair Punishment Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Capital punishment James Dobson Erotic spanking Atheism Presuppositional apologetics Originalism Goodness and value theory Serial killer Philosophical skepticism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Corporal punishment Resurrection of Jesus Human sexual behavior Kasparov versus The World Economics Buttocks Biblical inerrancy Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Internet troll GED Landmark Education Intelligent design Philosophy of language Religion Determinism Satanism Parapsychology Singlish Scientology beliefs and practices Apology (Plato) Evil Creationism Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Lie Rigging Cultural relativism A Course In Miracles David Hume Have I Got News For You Free will BDSM Paddle (spanking) Western philosophy Time Out of Mind Appeal Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cult Teach the Controversy God Emperor of Dune Leviathan (book) Parliament of the United Kingdom Anger management Milton H.

are parents to blameif their child gets sexually abused if a child is sexually abused by a family member ie a grandparent or an uncle is this the parents fault that they never suspected abuse was happening baring in mind abusers manipulate the family and the dynamics of a family opinions please it may seems like a strange question but i recently discovered my little angels were being abused by someone who was my idol not only my father but my best friend i thought his interest in my children was as a loving grandfather if had of known or suspected never in a million yers would i have left them but within the community the fingers are being pointed at me i should have known but i honestly had no idea i have firmly believed that the abuser is the only one to blame but the community feel i should have known btw the community are supporting my father apparently he would never do such a thing and no physical signs or emotional signs were shown by my oldest daughter and luckily for me i walked in as he was up to no good with my then year old have asked myself many times what signs were there must have been something and honestly i did not see any and i was abused myself not by him so i have always been fully aware of the signs but none ok someone just said that children should know about good touches and bad touches and be aware of sexual abuse well because of my own abuse i have been great in making them aware but this still happened as a response to sweet i am not acting like poor me at all and i do not feel sorry for myself my kids are in therapy and receiving all the help they can get and as for me not being strong you are totally wrong strenght is reporting your father for child abuse and preventing it from happening to others which i know there is at least others strenght is making sure that my kids live as normal a life as possible strenght is moving on dispite your grief as the mother of a child that was abused i understand where you are coming from in this question my daughter was abused by an ex partner of mine when she was very small more than years ago i have always felt that i was in some way responsible that i should have spotted something seen the signs but i never did these animals are usually very emotionally manipulative and can worm their way into family affections often becoming a valued family friend its often not until the child speaks up about the abuse that anyone has any idea what is going on the only time the parent is responsible is if they are part of the abusers circle and are party to the heinous crime the best advice i can give you is to take each day as it comes be there for your children and believe them ignore the gossip and stand firm  Knots Landing 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Domestic violence Scientology beliefs and practices Child sexuality EastEnders Autism Theory of conduct Milton H.

what do other parents think of using child restraint leashes i'm thinking of using one my son isn't walking yet but when he is i've thought about using a child leash but so many people seem to think they're terrible what are your opinions i think it's something that the parent can judge best everyone knows what their child is capable of and whether or not they're likely to 'listen' and follow instructions or if they're more inclined to run off or dart into the street personally i would much rather see a child in toddler reins that being hit by a car i think that whether or not you 'like' them is irrelevant you have to respect that they exist for a reason and that these days there are so many risks to young children both natural and human that any measures you take to keep them safe is better than doing nothing and putting them in danger i honestly don't see how people can make such wild judgements about this i probably won't use them either i just prefer using a pusher or pram but i see absolutely nothing wrong with them i think it's just another thing for people to get on their soapboxes about good luck with your little one  Theory of conduct Baby transport Abortion debate Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Human sexual behavior Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Polyamory Goodness and value theory Human nature Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The nature of God in Western theology Property (ownership right) Ethics Adoption Ontological argument Shaggy dog story Stoicism Autism rights movement Social rule Moral relativism Summa Theologiae Atheism Dog training Freedom of speech Customs and etiquette of Japan Contract About a Boy Originalism Luck Economic inequality Utilitarianism James Bulger Horse Scientific method Objectivist philosophy Spanking Ferret Child Anarcho-capitalism Aerial (dance move) Sexual orientation School bus Project Orion Road safety Decision making Hearing impairment Evil Birth control Brian Close Milton H.

do you think that parents who have abuse their children in any way severely should ever have them back if they're happy and doing well with their foster parents don't you think it's wrong to give them back to parents who ever sexually physically or emotionally abused those children if the abuse was severe then no obviously not i do know that this would happen a lot in the past but nowadays i think even the 'system' is realising that it's the worst possible thing to do taking children away from loving homes and parents and placing them back with unfit and abusive parents sadly though i know it still happens  Child abuse Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Domestic violence Parenting Infantilism Good Times Sexual abuse Ex-gay Childlove movement Narcissism Transsexuality Spanking Laura Schlessinger Pitaten Corporal punishment Feral child Child sexual abuse Drug abuse EastEnders Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Sant Thakar Singh Miss Saigon Adoption My So-Called Life Kodocha Pedophilia Ageplay Children of God Abortion debate Foster care Divorce Polyamory Eugenics Child sexuality The Fairly OddParents Emotions (album) Dead Like Me Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Marriage of Figaro Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Stolen Generation False memory Brave New World Fathers' rights Sigmund Freud Futurama (TV series - season 2) Rent (musical) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

overprotective this is sort of based on my other question about me not being able to date until i'm it's kind of a question yet statement of why i think my parents might be a tad bit overprotective and what you think on the subject my parents won't let me date until i'm a little extreme i think so most kids that aren't able to date or even group date get themselves into a whole lot more trouble when their because they aren't at the dating maturity as everyone else since i am aware of this this probably won't happen to me but kids get overwhelmed because they have no idea what to do in situations that might come up since when your sex is an issue sometimes and other physical things that since people didn't experience a taste of what a boyfriend was when they were younger may think it is okay to do i don't think it is safe to wait until your child is to let them date life is way more cruel at that age and you can't keep tabs on your kid like you can now continue i would have no problem telling my parents who i am dating where i will be going with my boyfriend and most of the other details that they are wanting when you get older you have your own life you make most of the decisions and without experiencing just the little bit of what happens when your younger you can make some huge mistakes i know my parents love me and want to protect me but i don't think they are realistically able to see what may happen in the future since i barely ever get to go to the movies at night with my friends or some parties with guys normal parties not bad ones for all they know i can be out clubbin when i get older and pregnant before marriage and in college what do you have to say on the subject yeah it's over protective ibelive in the same thing that is the party stage and that being given that much responsibility at that stage is too much i mean if u don't know how can u be forced to learn in such a short period of time i'm allowed to date when i'm whicth is okay to me i wouldn't mind but i'm not complaining i just like how my mom believes in that also so she wants me to know before i turn my mom says that that is normally the stage when boys who go out with ask u to put out so she wants me to make good choices  Humphrey Bogart About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Social rule Avenue Q Charmed Transactional analysis Milton H.

at what point do you have the talk with your kids you know the dreaded talk is there a good age i don't want to wait until school breaches the subject but i don't know how long to wait before my children bring it up help anxiety i have just kind of answered questions as we go along for example when my son was he wanted to know why i was eating daddy's face lol we explained kissing in age apropriate language it has just kind of flowed over the years he is now and just comes to us when he has questions he wanted to know if i was going to poop his sister out when i was pregnant lol reproduction talk every kid is different and you have to cater to their learning styles my son just was and is a naturally curious kid and very upfront and honest so i am the same with him i think and is a good age to start talking about changes in your body and then go from there make sure you guys are in a relaxed enviroment like doing something together you both enjoy playing baseball or fishing whatever it gives you something to do with your hands good luck  Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Qiyamah Pitaten Social rule Game show The Fairly OddParents Friends Theory of conduct Milton H.

how can i help two underprivlidged children in my neighborhood i've become acquainted with two children in my neighborhood who live down the street in the subsidized housing complex their mother is on welfare and disability so i know they don't have much all summer long they pretty much walked the streets and would talk with me while i worked in my gardens i'd like to help these kids out somehow but i think i'm doing it wrong i started giving them food because i knew they didn't eat well but now they are coming and knocking on my door at all hours asking for food and are bringing other children in the neighborhood it's starting to get crazy and i simply cannot afford to feed all these kids can you please give me some ideas on what i can do to tame this situation i'd still like to help the kids i see how bright they are but i can't continue on the path we're going on now thanks for your help these kids need guidance and you can help them a lot by discussing appropriate behavior tell them you're sorry but you must set limits they can come for dinner nights per week but they are absolutely not allowed to knock on the door after dark or with friends to ask for handouts in addition if they could help you at all perhaps growing their own tomato plants or washing windows etc they could start understanding the concept of work and reward  RuneScape quests Tomato Breath of Fire III The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Milton H.

does anyone really buy that kids bop thing or whatever the hell it is called there was a commercial for it and the kids cannot sing well neither can i it seems this year especially they suck because the voices of the artist this year have been changed so the kids really suck your thoughts you know if you're a parent definetly buy a cd for your kids i think kids ages should listen to kidz bop becuase when you get in high school you need to know your top rap and pop because that's just what everyone does you're not cool if you don't know the words to whatever song so this gives them a sense of what kids listen to and i think its good for smaller kids becuase it cuts out bad words and besides those kids could care less what the voices sounds like  The Marshall Mathers LP Hip hop music Music genre Punk ideology Billboard Hot 100 Mixtape The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bohemian Rhapsody Kyle Broflovski Steely Dan Rapping Tom Waits Sheryl Crow Cover version Jennifer Lopez Cyndi Lauper Freddie Mercury Jazz rap Timeline of trends in music (1950-1959) Jazz Remix Hall & Oates Usher (entertainer) Roxette Empire Burlesque Pop punk Gangsta rap Hey Jude Ramones Insane Clown Posse The Emancipation of Mimi Lyte Funky Ones About a Boy Recurring South Park characters Hip hop culture Samples of music from the United States The Ashlee Simpson Show Love and Theft The Fairly OddParents Sampling (music) Music history of the United States (1980s to the present) Daryl Hall Alternative hip hop Kid Rock Kylie Minogue Billboard magazine Euphemism Song Rhythm and blues Amerie Nashville Skyline The Jam Faye Wong Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1930-1970) Rich Mullins 3 Feet High and Rising The Isley Brothers Frankie Goes to Hollywood The Life and Times of Juniper Lee George Michael Internet phenomenon Tony Bennett Singer Journey (band) Grammy Award Humphrey Bogart Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Blues Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Jon Secada Iggy Pop Adult contemporary music British hip hop Gwen Stefani New Kids on the Blecch WCBS-FM Taxi Driver Joni Mitchell BoA Time Out of Mind Popular music Rock (music) Nine Inch Nails The Who Juggalo Country music Boyz II Men Highway 61 Revisited Sly & the Family Stone TLC Bart Simpson Pop music Lollipop WNNX (FM) The Descendents English grammar Delta Goodrem Hip hop rivalries Garth Brooks Avenue Q

why are some parents so self righteous and think that anything other than their way is wrong such as daycare such as with daycare staying home breast feeding everyone is different some parents have to work i am lucky to be able to stay home with my kids but some people can't make it on one income period some downsize their homes have old cars no cable no extras and they still can't make it on one income that's life daycare is the only option and it isn't the horrible place that some people make it out to be another thing is breastfeeding it just doesn't work for some people whether it be for medical reasons or physical reasons that's just the way it is why do some still have a holier than thou attitude towards others and why are they so quick to judge why do they belittle others who don't make the same decisions does it make them feel better about themselves they're not helping matters they're making them worse why do people feel they must pass their one sided judgement on other people's questions does it occur to them that their way might not be the right way alot of people have a problem stepping off their high horses and realizing that life is different for everyone i know how you feel i was unable to breastfeed because my body just didn't let me and i to got downsized i also stay at home with my children and not because i have to but because i can sure daycare is fine but i have the opportunity to watch them grow up in what i believe is the most precious years for both us and them and i to get downsized but really its all about how you take it sure they can talk and criticize but does it really matter is their ranting and pointing of fingers going to make you change your life style or look at yourself as being a great mom to your kids cause in the long run its really about them not these idiots that rather talk about you instead of paying attention to what they should reallybe paying attention to like themselves  Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Procrastination Milton H.

son took the blame for someone else little help my yr son is a cit at a camp this summer and hates it yet is good with the kids his best friend joe who works with him on the other hand is the complete opposite my son came home yesterday with a look that said something was on his mind so i asked he told me that joe was on pool duty not doing what he was suppose to be doing and a kid got hurt the owner of the camp said that who ever was suppose to be watching the kid wasn't going to asked back next year so my son told the owner that he was on pool duty b c joe wants to come back next year and my son doesn't i can see why he did this but i don't want him being blamed for something he didn't do or losing this camp and a reference for the future what would you tell your son in this situation i would explain to your son how you know why he did this but telling someone this lie so a friend gets a job next year is wrong even if you hate the job to begin with he's going to need the reference from this place to do something different next summer not paying attention is not a quality employers are looking for and i'm guessing since he's a cit this is one of his first jobs it would look wonderful to have a reference like this especially if he was good at it i would advise him to talk this over with the camp owner privately explain what he did and why he did so it's not fair that joe be rehired again next year if he's the one who isn't doing what he's suppose to be doing this is something your son needs to do without your help it's not like he was the one who wasn't paying attention and causing serious trouble as simple as the task was to take the blame it sounds like he has no idea how not simple the crime that he took the blame was lying about doing it is just as unprofessional and immature as lying about doing it i was reading your profile and i've answered some of your questions in the past and you have an older daughter right i'd suggest having her say something to your son as well let him know how important it is not to take the blame about this situation or any situation for that matter unless you've done the crime best wishes  Theory of conduct Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ann Coulter Vegeta Kodocha Milton H.

my son is and he gets very upset if i don't shower with him if i'm in the shower he insists to shower with me and when he is taking a shower he wants me in there with him ever since he was i've been trying to make him more independent with showering by himself but he just won't do it so i give in and just shower with him still and i also help wash him like i used to as a mother i don't think this is the correct thing to do but it keeps him calm he seems to enjoy it and at least he's getting clean i just don't think this should happen when he's maybe even older i don't understand all these shower issues with him help some of the answers on here are unbelievable he's only for goodness' sake why create these unnecessary taboos between parents and children like it's something dirty or perverted the mind truly boggles if your son likes you in the shower with him i don't see a problem unless it bothers you or him don't stop as he gets older he will develop a sense of self consciousness which is natural and he will want to cover up more this is a natural step which will happen eventually there is no need to force the issue or make him feel bad be pleased that he's willing to shower at all many mothers of little boys find it a nightmare to get them to take a bath or shower i'm sure you will find a way to get him to shower alone as he gets older he could have a fear of water or be unsure what to do on his own if it's just the independence factor involved put a shower radio in there so he can listen to music while he showers this might make him more keen to go in there on his own or let him take a toy to shower alongside him honestly though don't fret about it he wont be doing it when he's  Social rule Justification (theology) Milton H.

sometimes i wonder how many people consider good advice in the art of parenting and maybe without this ticket sometimes despite the parent s love they can actually hurt the child a deep kind of love that they can t get over entirety there are so many things that are wrong and it worries me that we might be creating a ruinous society many of us adults say that we turned out fine but how is fine defined they are just so many troubled and depressed people in the world i wonder if their parents were just a bit more devoted or more patient or more serious about their duty as a parent then maybe those people would be happy and enjoyed life but then maybe most just aren t devoted as i am or have too many problems of their own i wonder if enough parents really and truly try to work on the following rewards the child for telling the truth then they are not frightened into lying tell the child when they make mistakes and what they learned from them can accept that they are okay even when they blunder pay attention to the child and spend time with them then they can believe that they are important and worthwhile help the child explore their unique interests talents and potential l in order for the child to be happy they need to be them do the things they want the child to do then the child has a good positive model tell the child by their words and actions that they love them then the child i will feel loveable and will be able to love themselves and others aren t afraid to be firm with the child they prefer it it makes them feel more secure don t let the child form bad habits they have to rely on you to detect them in the early stages don't make the child feel smaller than they are it only makes them behave stupidly big don't correct the child in front of people if you can help it don't make the child feel that their mistakes are sins it upsets their set of values don't make rash promises remember the child feels badly let down when promises are broken don't tax the child s honesty too much they are easily frightened into telling lies don't be inconsistent that completely confuses the child and makes them lose faith in you don't tell the child their fears are silly they are terribly real to them and you can do much to reassure them if you try to understand don't ever suggest that you are perfect or infallible it gives them to great a shock when they discover that you are neither don't forget that the child can't thrive without lots of love and understanding but they don't need to tell you that do they i really believe that if we all worked on this together we can bring about a better and greater society what are your thoughts i really believe that if we all worked on this together we can bring about a better and greater society what are your thoughts i really believe that if we all worked on this together we can bring about a better and greater society what are your thoughts listen to this if you please http www youtube com watch v m qfljben k http www youtube com watch v risdgcsji i just want everyone to be the best that they can be edit i want everyone to try to be the best that they can be i know that we are flawed but we should strive for a better society i think you've got good ideas but i also think you sound arrogant and naive we are all human and we are flawed some people are incredibly poor or needy or ill or unable to truly care for a child well even though they want desperately to do so some people were so damaged in their own lives that they are not capable of giving to a child or relating to a child in a healthy way even though they love the child enormously some people would sware that they are doing everything you listed and yet their children would not agree some parents are incredibly unlucky and have extremely difficult children that they can not cope with even though they have done everything you say i have healthy smart beautiful children i try really hard to not think that it is based on what i have done but more just who they are and how lucky we are i know that life can be really really hard and i just hope that i don't need to learn to love and appreciate my children the hard way the world is a very difficult place for a large number of people and your suggestions may sound simple or obvious but they are also naive and arrogant  Social rule Microeconomics Goodness and value theory Infantilism Religion Humphrey Bogart Ethics Karen Horney Jon Secada Milton H.

im so confused yahoo people have a big difference of opinion should an unstable abusive parent have rights to be involved in their childs life this is not a situation where its a matter of parent no longer liking the other this is simply about knowing this parent will habitually abuse the child do you people really think ''the child should still ''be able to see their parent'' c mon also doesnt the child have the right to be protected why wait until the child comes home one day saying ''daddy touched me here'' yes i believe a child has a right to know who their bio parents are but that doesnt mean they need to be invovlved in their life if you know they will be abused also you cannot always sit around and wait for the courts to do their paperwork to get the visits supervised we need to protect our children some of you people suggest unless theres ''proof''the abuse should continue until there is proof what a beautifull world we live in also anyone who is familiar with family abuse knows how difficult it can be to get proof esp depending on what ''kind'' of abuse this is if a parent is abusive they should have no rights the ability to procreate does not make you a parent  Divorce Fathers' rights Infantilism Abortion debate British nationality law Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Domestic violence Autism rights movement Drug abuse Narcissism Dissociative identity disorder Adoption Alexander Technique Indian nationality law Slander and libel Hikikomori Trademark Who is a Jew?

can he have a problem my step son yrs is spending the summer with us after amost yrs of not coming our home due his mom the problem is i have notice he lies a lot my hubby seems not to believe i don't spank him or punish him i just give orders to him as i give orders to my other kids the problem is that when my hubby comes home ask how did he behave sometimes i just don't tell but when is a big thing i do tell him so he can punish him for doing wrong so i tell my version in front of the kid but he change everything so i end up being a liar i have notice my hubby believes him more than me we end up in discussion don't know if the kids does this on purpose or does he have a problem i have known him since he was parents were divorce by that time if i don t punish him is because of the big deal the mom will form as soon as she finds out but i don't know what else to do i have told my hubby that the kid maybe has a problem that i need his support what to do help you have a big problem but it isn't with your stepson this year old is learning from his mother and others in his life how to lie and manipulate punishment and discipline are two very different things he's coming to your home and the rules are different than he has at his mom's house plus his mother obviously has some bad feelings toward you that she may be passing along to her son you just need to give him a clear set a rules and define the discipline tell him straight out that lies are unacceptable and if he caught in a lie you will ask him to go to his room to think about why he shouldn't lie or whatever discipline you decide on putting him in time out won't hurt him and his mother shouldn't have a problem with it if you don't spank him but you can't allow him to get away with this and he needs to be clear about that right away you could give him a chance to change his lie into the truth by saying i'm not so sure if that is the truth are you sure you don't have something else to say that let's him know that you are on to him and let's him get things straight without getting into trouble but if he persists in lying you have to discipline him the problem that i see is with your husband if he doesn't believe you but believes his son over you and doesn't discipline him at all he is teaching his son by example that you are not that important and that he can do whatever he wants where you are concerned and not get in trouble you are going to have to talk to your husband and find out why he thinks you would lie to him about this child's behavior then make sure that he understands that he is your husband and needs to be your support and united with you in your decisions if you are being kind and fair your husband should back you up all the way especially in front of your children stepchild or not  Theory of conduct Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Spanking Transactional analysis The nature of God in Western theology Aerial (dance move) Cindy Sheehan Randomness Lie Friends About a Boy Goodness and value theory Logic Moral Politics EastEnders Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Malcolm in the Middle Extreme Programming Kodocha Beetle in an Anthill Laura Schlessinger Fathers' rights Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Poker jargon Ten Commandments God Emperor of Dune Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart Jumpstart 3rd Grade Epistemology Philosophy of language Avenue Q Paradox Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Jiddu Krishnamurti Muslim ibn Aqeel Atheism Coming of Age (TNG episode) Nicomachean Ethics Alcoholics Anonymous The Amber Spyglass Human sexual behavior Sheepshead Halting problem Dog training Good Times W.I.T.C.H.

just a quick question to parents if you responded rudely to a question i asked or were disrespectful would you consider it a learning experience if i gave you a quick pop on the butt it's padded so it shouldn't hurt and after all your actions need to bring about consequences for you to learn from is that ok disney chick you hit the nail on the head it wasn't meant to be veiled lol i am pointing out the ridiculousness of the argument that fervent 'pro spankers' consistantly present as a matter of fact i have never been 'against' spanking but the ignorant and childish 'parents' who consistantly tell others they are wrong not to spank are a different story it seems many people are so defensive i wonder why when you're so obviously doing the best thing for your child terratad i'm so sorry but your question made no sense i tried to read it and give a response but i wasn't able to understand what you were going on about to a couple of the others who still try to imply that spanking a child is the only way i will just say that as sorry as you appear to feel for me with my children lol i feel ten times sorrier for you and yours best wishes is it ok to ask retarded questions that are really just a cover for a deeper issue like a parent's right to discipline their children how ever they see legally fit that's my take on this question edit ok i see what you did there lol i am pro spanking for my family have i seen children that clearly needed a spanking and wished their parents did as such yes do i have the right to demand others discipline their children as i discipline mine no are there families that make no spanking work and manage to raise well behaved children yes but not as many as they would lead you to believe i think though about your argument that pro spankers feel they have to be on the defensive about their discipline techniques because soooo many anti spankers bring up the ridiculous child abuse remarks but it does go both ways and if we could all be a little more tolerant of other people's choices we would all be much happier my thing is just make your kids behave people don't make the rest of us suffer because your child doesn't understand how to act in public make them understand there are consequences for their actions  Spanking Theory of conduct Theodicy Plame affair James Dobson Utilitarianism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transactional analysis Corporal punishment Goodness and value theory Determinism Abortion debate The nature of God in Western theology Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Karen Horney Milton H.

children i just saw an article that stated an arkansas couple just had their th child in todays market how can anyone afford more than children i certainly don't understand it either and it's not just the financial impact how do the parents devote any significant amount of meaningful time and attention to the children individually if this is the family i've read about before jim bob and michelle duggar i remember them mentioning that a lot of the parenting responsibilities fall on the older children that's just sad what a travesty to force upon those children in the name of something like 'we'll welcome more children as long as god blesses us with them' nuts  Supply and demand John the Baptist Infant baptism Dissociative identity disorder Same-sex marriage Time Out of Mind Ten Commandments Rich Mullins Wealth Eid ul-Fitr Hillary Rodham Clinton Marriage Second language acquisition Diwali Judaism Generation Y Civil union Daria Polyamory Original sin Microcredit Microeconomics Sharon Tate Insurance Unemployment Domestic violence Growth hormone treatment Cognitive science Ganesha Infantilism Predestination Smartism George Burns Charter school Child support Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Passover Carl Jung Meaning of life Moral Politics Mad Money Barack Obama God and gender Adoption United Kingdom corporation tax Nikah Mut'ah Little Rock, Arkansas Virgin Mary in Islam Divorce Book of Mormon Kurt Cobain The Fairly OddParents Birth control Sant Thakar Singh AmeriCorps Mary, the mother of Jesus Family name Deconstruction Father James Dobson Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Narcissism Eric Bischoff Canonical hours Transactional analysis Eastern Orthodox Church Community of Christ Mountain Meadows massacre Extreme Programming Ethical challenges to autism treatment Laura Schlessinger Roy Meadow Evan Mecham Controversies in autism Free will Frankie Laine Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Culture of the United States Intelligent design movement Autism Simone Weil Mother Teresa Halloween Annuity Life insurance Saint Emperor of Japan Allergy Grief Amidah Postpartum depression Economic inequality Ramakrishna Wal-Mart Alawite Prayer Family Jews as a chosen people

do you believe that children should be smacked by their parents as punishment i don't mean horrible things like hitting them with belts and stuff i just mean if a child is being naughty and he she has had lots of warnings and if he she is really playing up and won't settle and the mum or dad gives them a smack on their bottom or something my mum did it to me and my brothers and we turned out fine do you think it's a good way of punishing your children i was smacked a lot as a child and it didn't do me any harm but it did teach me the difference between right and wrong pretty fast i didn't need to smack my kids very often but i'm not adverse if the situation calls for it as kids get older getting 'down to their level does not work and that's when as teenagers there lack of discipline as a child becomes apparent i hate these softly softly people they are the bloody cause of teenagers behaviour and lack of respect edit and i totally agree with phobius hit the nail on the head  Spanking About a Boy Silent Night, Deadly Night Little Britain Corporal punishment Sampling (music) EastEnders Teenage pregnancy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eddie Guerrero Theory of conduct Rich Mullins Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evil Theodicy Milton H.

you don't really have to feed your kids meat for them to be healthy right i had asked a question days ago asking people's opinions about me not wanting to feed my children if i ever have any meat because i'm a vegetarian http answers yahoo com question index ylt avgww k oqctn t pjlbty ix qid aa ina if you read the link it doesnt make sense for me to raise my children as a meat eater if i am a vegetarian and people said that kids need meat to grow and develop well it's not really the meat that they need it's the protien right you can get plenty of protien from lots of other foods besides meat and the kids will be very healthy can someone back me up here my kids have never eaten dead animals and they are remarkably healthy kids need protein to grow but it does not need to come from corpses as long as they eat a healthy diet with pleanty of veggies whole grains fruits and legumes they will most likely be healthier than their peers especially if they are allowed to self wean from breastmilk when they are ready it is absurd to say you are depriving them of meat if you were raising your kids christian would you be depriving them of satanism no you are raising them in accordance with your family's moral stance they may choose differently when they are older but until then it is not up for debate especially with anyone outside you family  Vegetarianism Veganism Protein Breastfeeding Hamburger Vegetarianism and religion Food Dieting Whaling Meat analogue Vegetarian cuisine Soybean Domestic rabbit Environmental vegetarianism Animal rights Abortion debate Cat Atkins Nutritional Approach Clean animals Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Dog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goat 613 mitzvot Factory farming Taboo food and drink Egg (food) Theory of conduct Peter Singer Livestock Low-carbohydrate diet MRE Raw food diet Chicken Gray Wolf Guinea pig Kosher foods Coronary heart disease Nutrition Mahatma Gandhi In-N-Out Burger Meat Buddhist cuisine Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism McDonald's Healthy eating Fruitarianism Agriculture Sausage MyPyramid Salmon Genetically modified food Domestic goat Vitamin C Chili con carne Chinese cuisine Tofu Stomach cancer Fasting Soy milk Organic farming Cuisine of Africa Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bread Domesticated turkey Organic food Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Fecal incontinence Snack food Folic acid Dietary fiber Paleolithic diet People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Buddhism Slaughterhouse Pork rind Eating Punk ideology Koala Cuisine of Brazil Dairy Hamster Fugu Burger Famine Aztec Hunting Apple Christianity and anti-Semitism Peruvian cuisine Day-Age Creationism Carnivore Seventh-day Adventist Church Food storage Ferret

i used to want to name my daughter chastity but not anymore what do you think of desera and my son gob hi i decided not to name my daughter chastity because people will make fun of her in school what do you think of the name desera should i name her desera or desray and my son what do you think of the name gob pronounced jobe with a hard j is that how you would spell it or should i spell it jobe ok people i obviously don't want a name for my kids that everyone has herd of why because there are so many other people with those names now that it would be lame and unoriginal for me to name them that desera is pronounced des erah its not that hard d soft e s r soft a and to avoid the job problem people would say the o as a soft o if i add an e to the end right so if i name him jobe it sounds like jobe right the alternative to my daughters name could be clairece and i don't want to name my kids this to be creative i also really like those names especially desera why is desera an ugly name and weeder not all names have to be real words desiree that would be syllables and sound like desire that is so porn i think des ruh is actually the best way to spell the pronunciation of the way i want her name to be pronounced there is a fine line of wanting your children's names to be unique and child abuse and by naming your children these funky names you are close to crossing that line i can understand desera i've heard that one before and i could even understand job it's biblical but why are you so determined to spell them so strangely that they will never be pronounce or spelled correctly by people who do not know them just imagine a lifetime of having to correct your misspelled name on official documents or having to repeat the phrase actually it's pronounced why would you intentionally do that to a person maybe you want to be unique but did you ever stop to think that your children may not share that desire  International Phonetic Alphabet Hangul Non-native pronunciations of English Dutch language Greek language Shibboleth New Zealand English Slovak language Bulgarian language French language Sesotho language English language Arabic alphabet Standard Cantonese Liaison Korean language Phoneme Singlish Chinese language Thai alphabet Indonesian language Leet Speech synthesis Apostrophe (mark) Vishnu sahasranama Misspelling Revised Romanization of Korean Polish language NATO phonetic alphabet Scottish Gaelic language Hindi Quebec French Vietnamese language Canadian English Hanja Dictionary Korean name Spoken Finnish Family name Russian phonology Japanese name English English Written Cantonese Australian English Kanji Sindarin Vowel Mispronunciation Hebrew language Pinyin Chinese character Tetragrammaton Taiwanese (linguistics) Mantra Arabic name Finnish language Cyrillic alphabet Cantonese (linguistics) Arabic language Latin alphabet Phonology World Wide Web Stuttering Wolof language Hypercorrection Phonics English plural R__maji Portuguese language Names of God in Judaism English spelling Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what is the difference between 'spanking' and 'abuse' this is my definition of both spanking when physical punishment is used as a consequense to unacceptable actions and is used to teach a child what actions are unacceptable this type of punishment does not cause any permanant marks doesn't break the skin doesn't break any bones doesn't bruise and doesn't cause any permanant damage example little johnny jerked his sisters ponytail purposly and his mother spanks his bottom little johnny feels pain briefly and cries however that is the last time he pulls his sisters hair abuse when physical punishment is used simply to lash out at a child out of anger frustration or meanness and is not used to teach a child about consequenses or unacceptable behavior this punishment causes bruises cuts broken bones and other long lasting physical marks example little johnnys father is tired after working and johnny accidentally spills his milk in the floor so his father closed fist hits him across the face causing a bruise that lasts for days  Spanking Domestic violence Flagellation Diving Serial killer Fred Phelps Corporal punishment Dog training Bruise Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation James Dobson Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infantilism Fecal incontinence Boxing Incest Eddie Guerrero Child abuse Human sexual behavior Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Violence in sports Knots Landing Pitaten Comanche Self-harm Boston Public Cephalic disorder Beavis and Butt-head Paddle (spanking) Buttocks Child time-out Punishment Urinary incontinence Erotic spanking Great Teacher Onizuka Torture BDSM Radiation therapy Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Fathers' rights Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Ten Commandments Poker jargon Switch (rod) Psoriasis Puberty Hansel und Gretel Physical attractiveness Breech birth Hypoglycemia Guinea pig Professional wrestling The Catcher in the Rye Professional wrestling holds The Caves of Androzani Ranma __ characters Tenshinhan Narcissism Pillory Cat Jackass: The Movie Good Times Milton H.

why isn't spanking illegal in the us most contries within the european union do now have a total ban on spanking and smacking why would it be so impossible to introduce that law in the us for one thing the government already has enough control over the way we parent our children and live our lives outlawing spanking would just be one more way for the government to control how we parent there is a huge difference between spanking being used to disapline and teach and spanking being used out of frustration or meanness one is abuse and one is not i don't know how many times i have seen those anti spanking parents try the talk it out method and most of the time i have noticed that their kids are little brats they have very little respect for their parents and certainly not for other adults true abuse can breed abuse a child who was physically or sexually abused as a child may be more likely to do it to their own children than a child who wasnt however just because a child recieved a few spats on the rear doesn't mean they are going to grow up to abuse other people in their lives nor that they will grow up to be mean violent adults i got occasional spankings when i was a kid and guess what i have never abused my kids never hit my husband never been arrested never stole and am not a violent person i hold down a full time job pay my bills and pay my taxes a normal american so just because i was spanked as a child it didn't do anything to cause me to turn out to be a screwed up adult  Spanking Child pornography Child abuse Motion picture rating system Infantilism James Dobson Sexual abuse Incest Human sexual behavior 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Serial killer BDSM Pedophilia Child sexuality Buttocks Pitaten Abortion debate Theory of conduct Birthday Domestic violence Abortion in the United States Beavis and Butt-head Rick Santorum Censorship in Australia Parenting Trailer Park Boys Childlove movement Malcolm in the Middle Narcissism Divorce Separation of church and state Procrastination Ageplay Laura Schlessinger Ex-gay Transsexuality Erotic spanking Child sexual abuse EastEnders Polyamory Video game controversy Codename: Kids Next Door Human rights in the United States Dead Like Me Transactional analysis Rupert Murdoch Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Anger management North American Man/Boy Love Association Child Marriage Prohibition (drugs) Rich Mullins Fred Phelps Children of God Arguments for and against drug prohibition Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 2004 Democratic National Convention School choice Humphrey Bogart Domination & submission (BDSM) Paddle (spanking) Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Drug test Baby Blues Dissociative identity disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Autism rights movement United Kingdom corporation tax Outlaw Star Abortion Trafficking in human beings American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Adolescence Kylie Minogue Polygamy Controlled Substances Act The Catcher in the Rye Poll tax Violence in sports Dogville Education Justification (theology) LiveJournal Billy the Kid Creationism The Giver Controversies in autism FLCL Androgen insensitivity syndrome MPAA film rating system Caning Gay rights Prostitution Wild Barts Can't Be Broken Deprogramming

if you were spanked as a child would you do the same to your children there is a research out today from univ of bristol uk that says that you are times more likely to use corporal punishment on your children if you experienced that during your childhood i don't really think so but what do you think ah there is a reason the bible says spare the rod spoil the child i think it's an effective form of discipline even though it shouldn't be the only form i was spanked as a child and i can say that it was very effective a parent has to be consistent in what they say and do when it comes to discipline and always follow up on their word when spanking it should never be done out of anger the parent must calm down and explain to the child that he she loves him her very much and must discipline them so they can grow up with good character also the child must always be informed clearly of why they are being spanked also a parent should never spank using their hands the child must see the hands of the parent as loving and accepting there should always be a median my parents used a thin rod from a tree or a belt and they hit just hard enough to where it hurt but didn't leave any kind of bruises or marks when a child is young they learn to fear the rod and not the hands of the parents god created our behinds puffy padded for a reason lol  Spanking Punishment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an James Dobson Paddle (spanking) Child time-out Infantilism Child abuse Caning Tai Chi Chuan Infant baptism Domestic violence John the Baptist Theodicy Birching Human sexual behavior Transactional analysis Religion Incest Pitaten Children of God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fred Phelps The Death Gate Cycle EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Parenting Pony Education Hurricane Neddy Hazing Diving John Wesley Avenue Q Merit Theory of conduct Brian Close Ned Flanders Rocko's Modern Life Moral Politics Ageplay Creation science Serial killer Milton H.

what do you guys think about this a six year old child hospitalised for treatment due to malnutrition this is the son of a 'friend' of mine he's got cavaties wear and tear of a year old and is losing enamel of most of his teeth the reason for this takeaway meals a day most days no water or milk to drink ever and lots and lots of sugar lollies and sweet drinks he's calcium and vitamin deficiant and had to be hospitalised recently for four days to be given laxative meds through a nasal tube because he was so badly constipated this woman gets over a fortnight through maintenence and social security we live in australia and has huge problems looking after her son obviously oh and child welfare says there's nothing they can do sorry for the rant i had to get this off my chest feel free to comment katrina no that wasn't me who saw her friend hit her child for breaking the console but i'm glad i didn't have to see that i like all your suggestions but i've tried everything with this girl and she won't listen she thinks she's a good mum the reason welfare can't do anything is because they can't prove that what she is doing is causing 'lasting' harm cr p i know i'm a foster parent and i believe she should have this kid taken away until she gets her act together how frustrating it is to have to see this child being abused that's what i think it is and not being able to do a darn thing about it i guess if i were you i would try to insert myself into that child's life as much as possible is there a foster child you have close to his age i'd have your friend's son spend the night at your house a lot and also document everything that you see going on even look for things such as bruises etc please stay strong and don't lose hope that you'll be able to impact this child's life thank god he has you  Tooth Anorexia nervosa Fecal incontinence About a Boy EastEnders Pitaten Urinary incontinence SMTV Live Folic acid Hypoglycemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alcoholism Coeliac disease Social rule Diving 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Nutrition Veganism Oasis (band) Food The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Domestic violence Jon Secada Methamphetamine Soft drink The Contender (television series) Ellen Foster Sharon Tate One Tree Hill (TV series) Fluoride Characters in the Smurfs Cocaine The Emancipation of Mimi Rickets Vitamin D Crohn's disease Diarrhea Chronic fatigue syndrome The Inside Self-harm Cliff Richard Common cold Infantilism Liam Gallagher Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rais massacre Theory of conduct Queen (band) Hearing impairment Adoption Osteoporosis Red Hot Chili Peppers Empire Burlesque Kodocha Fathers' rights Laura Schlessinger Traumatic brain injury Vitamin C Ex-gay Spice Girls Avenue Q Dairy Protein-energy malnutrition Divorce Fasting Sigmund Freud Vegetarianism Green Day Hiberno-English Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate LiveJournal Rick Santorum Coffee Acne Tooth enamel Knots Landing Charles Darwin's illness 2000 Australian Grand Prix Insulin Garth Brooks Ron and Fez Garfield John Lennon Eric Cartman Hikikomori

i am and having my st kid in weeks i am really scared i am so scared i'm about to have a kid i don't even know if i want her i know that is a bad thing to say but i had a really bad experience while pregnant i don't know if i can do this being a single young mother i do not think i was ready for a child the father is not supportive so it hurts even more i think she deserves better then what i can give her i try to be positive about the situation but tears bring my joy down everyday some say i will not be able to party or date that my life is over and i made a big mistake by not getting an abortion i am starting to feel this way to i do not know what to do i know if i give her up for adoption my family and peers will look down on me the father says its my fault and i have to live with the consequences and that i can't date or go out that my life is over and tells me i can't raise this child i need some serious advice i feel like i am losing it i had my daughter at and i was a single mother too i can't relate to how you're feeling because i was thrilled to be pregnant however i think the way you're feeling has a lot to do with the fact that you have so many negative people around you who are doubting you before you have even had the baby also your hormones are all over the place it's natural to be scared when pregnant with your first child and that goes for wether you're or trust me as soon as you hold your daughter in your arms you will love her unconditionally what you need to do is surrond yourself with positive people are your family being supportive stop talking to the child's father if he has nothing useful to say you need to be strong for your daughter i'm not gonna tell you that it will be easy but i can tell you it will be worth it in the end i'm now my daughter is and her and her brother are my reason and my heartbeat i met my son's father when my daughter was it's not unusual for young women to have children these days so don't think you will never meet a man again i have never had a shortage of male interest being a single mother doesn't deter men in this day and age i married my son's father and he adopted my daughter sadly we divorced years ago but he still sees the kids so yeh i'm a single parent again but i wouldn't change my life for the world i have a very successful career which i built for my kids for all the hard times i went through i can think of a million more good times i don't think that i have missed out on anything by having my kids so young they are both well balanced and doing well in school and i am thankful that i'm young enough to be able to be a friend to them aswell as a parent so you can do this and it will make you a stronger person too i think it's very brave of you to admit how you are feeling my advice is to wait until your daughter is born and see how you feel then if you still don't feel like you can cope then you can think about adoption don't think about what you can't give your baby think about what you can give her lots of love is what children need you should start looking at what help you can get financially and emotionally look for groups for young mothers in your area where you can meet other girls in the same situation as you talk to your mother or another close family member about your feelings and see what support they can give you find out what benefits you can get look for college courses with creche's so you can think about building a future for you and your baby take all the help you can get don't be afraid to ask your life doesn't have to stop here it just has to change slightly if you can do all the things i mentioned above you will find a whole new circle of friends who are in the same position as you i wish you all the luck in the world honey you can do this be strong think smart and try to smile you are about to embark on a wonderful journey yes it's scary there will be times you feel like you can't cope and you will shed tears but i promise you there is nothing like the feeling of satisfaction you will get when you prove all those haters wrong and you form a bond with that little helpless person growing inside you who needs you to be strong for her she will bring you more joy than any man or any party ever could  EastEnders Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a

what do you think of the duggar family of arkansas having now children naturally at this point i'm betting they'll have they keep on saying they want more my eyes are still wide in disbelief yes one of my grandmothers had children naturally but that was a different time and place i just can't imagine having over children a family in this day and age me personally i'd be happy with just one child is my limit and maybe if i'm ever really wealthy and have at least one set of twins well i have to say these are really good answers i'm glad the family finds a way to make ends meet and accommodate every child they have but yeah it is a little freaky i think one of the reasons why they use so many old fashioned hand me down self made clothes is because of money issues i'm sure because let's be honest buying a wardrobe at a regular store is pretty expensive over time imagine trying to buy like now wardrobes every year and yes population is a concern and i do figure their old fashioned christian values have something to do with why they obviously don't use birth control tube tying methods etc and let's face it there's children in smaller households that are completely neglected so of course not every child in that family will feel their needs met i wonder if any of them have moved out of the house or going to college katrina when i say natural i mean without ivf which if she is quiverfull would be against her religion i know she had one cesarean and the lastest one she had a vbac vaginal birth after cesarean which i've never heard of before i saw the documentary on them a few days ago on discovery health but it must've been filmed a few years ago because they only had kids at the time and she was pregnant with her th child if you haven't seen the documentary i highly suggest it they are part of the quiverfull sect of christianity do a search for it it'll freak you out there were multiple things that weirded me out about this family for one the way this family looked was unreal from the little house on the prairie clothes the girls were wearing to the mom's hairdo that looked like she uses a bottle of aquanet daily the other thing that weirded me out about this family was the homeschooling and the mom being the teacher she was teaching the young ones about bankruptcy what kind of homeschooling is that i feel sorry for the older kids because rather than having a chance to be a kid and develop to find out who they are they are forced to become young surrogate parents by taking care of the little ones it is not fair to any child to have to care for another child and to put this burden on her children is just plain selfish it's a good thing they live in the boonies of arkansas because they would never ever survive in an urban or suburban environment for that matter if her kids ever went to a public school or college which i seriously doubt since they seem to stress having litters of kids i don't think the kids would be able to cope people should have as many kids as they can financially emotionally physically and spiritually afford they might have the financial part down but if her other kids have to take care of her younger kids then she's not really being a parent i too believe that it's people like this as to why there is overpopulation in the world i guess they think the world has infinite resources i don't want to be mean but there's a bumper sticker that i've seen that says stupid people are breeding you make the connection and in response to cowgirl below no my answer was not hateful the fact is that the children born into this family do not have a choice they don't have a choice to go out and make friends and socialize with others outside of their family go to a public school what clothes to wear etc these actions are very similar to a brain washing cult children form their own identities and develop a sense of who they are by being allowed to make choices and being given the opportunity to become independent the kids in this family never get that opportunity because they are too busy caring for the younger siblings to deprive a child a chance to grow experiment and learn about themselves and other things in the world is just plain selfish and bad parenting what happens if the parents die unexpectedly the older kids will be left with the burden of caring for the rest and or the children will have to go into the foster system there's a reason why there's a saying everything in moderation excess is hardly ever a good thing  Abortion debate Homeschooling Infantilism Gender role

my daughter is years old and still breast feeding we both love it do we stop i love the feeling and the closeness we have my husband doesnt think anything of it but im pretty sure this has to stop my daughter is so close to me she loves it but im guessing it has to stop if i had it my way she would do it forever as long as it kept us this close for all of this baloney about how it can damage her teeth it can only damage her teeth if she sits there with mouth full of milk swishing it around in her mouth and this crap about they only need it until three months or all those other stupid comments about how minimal the length of time breastfeeding should be obviously they are very uneducated about breastfeeding and should find a la leche league to discuss this matter more accurately so they get all the facts one commenter said they say to continue breasfeeding as long as it's a mutually positive experience but there comes a time when you have to consider the weirdness factor and i agree with that i'm not going to tell you that you have to wean her i'm not going to tell you that is disgusting it's not btw i'm not going to tell you that you are horrible for doing it those people need to just shut up but you do need to consider the weirdness factor i understand the bonding experience involved with it and i'm glad your husband isn't concerned about it but your daughter is getting to the age where she will be entering school it is time to start weaning her don't worry about the bond you have a bond and it will not be broken because you wean her but yes it is time to start weaning not because other people find it offensive or disgusting but because of the developmental steps your daughter will soon be taking  Kodocha Fertility awareness Polyamory Shaggy dog story Childbirth "Weird Al" Yankovic EastEnders Nine Inch Nails Eric Cartman Anne Rice One Tree Hill (TV series) Jean Grey Tooth enamel Taken Late Night with Conan O'Brien Whose Line Is It Anyway?

at what age do you think it is ok for a boy and girl to stay over at each other house in the same bed taking into account they are mature responsible and have been in the relationship for over years thank you in my country the legal age is we don't believe until waiting for marriage when you say 'staying in the same bed' you obviously mean having sex the 'nature' has ordained males and females to coupulate to produce off springs so that the species continue for that it has established a 'start up' point which is puberty for both males and females in animal kingdom other than the humans natural instinct guides the animals however humans have developed brains and it can and has find out the right time of starting sexual activities we the humans have determined that though people can have sex at and sometimes even before puberty the body is not fully ready for child bearing for some more years after that also humans are social animals and we are responsible towards our societies which include our off springs we cannot simply produce them and leave them to fend for themselves therefore all over the civilized societies of the world the age of years has been established as the time when an individual is considered ready physically mentally economically and socially to bear the burden of his her responsibilities there are exceptions too risking to be branded as 'moralistic' which i am not in a narrow sense i would say that a boy and a girl should not indulge into sexual activities before and that too not befoer they get married to each other point here is not of morals but of responsibility towards children society we all know that children of single parents broken homes face tremendous tress in their growing stage and are highly prone to end up in wrong direction having safe sex using contraceptives is a way out but most of the time sexual urge is uncontrollable which may result into unwanted pregnancies putting much great stress on girls' as also boys' lives your contention of they being mature responsible i would ask what is the yard stick for that which boy and or girl would say he she is not mature or responsible and as for being in relationship for over two years many times a whole life is insufficient to understand each other else why would there be so many divorces that too within a few years of marriage not too long ago there was a time in western societies when there were more children of an individual than the number of marriages he she had now the trend is reversing and time is not far when there will be more marriages than children in one's life  Puberty Marriage Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Gender role Abortion debate Sexual differentiation Same-sex marriage Sexual abstinence Sex Transsexuality Human Adolescence Religion and sexuality Human sexuality Statutory rape Zoophilia Divorce Sex education The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Child sexual abuse Childlove movement Sexual revolution Heterosexuality Intersexuality Infantilism History of sex Child Abortion Dog Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Laura Schlessinger Biology and sexual orientation Person Sexual orientation Teenage pregnancy Anal sex Human nature Girl Homosexuality and Christianity Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Sociology Religion and sexual orientation Narcissism Lawrence v.

where and how do we return the recalled mattel toys i'm angered at the way this mattel recall is being handles or not handled as the case may be we own a few of those recalled mattel toys including the dora talking house and some of the figurines i went to the mattel site as well as the walmart and toys r us sites and none of them have any information on what to do about the recalled toys i saw on the national news that one can return the toys for vouchers but how can one does not know where or how to return the toys this is gross neglect by these companies and i'm sickened especially when it is affecting our children's health so in other words we have to mail in a lb toy this is what i'm talking about they don't make it easy but what's worse is that excessive lead can cause brain damage i thought this kind of stuff stopped happening in the s class action lawsuit is what i smell here if you go to this website address http www service mattel com us recall default asp recall id you can determine if your toy is indeed being recalled and get a voucher through the mattel website i saw one of my son's elmo toys on the list and went here if you purchased the toy after may it is recalled before may it is not recalled mine was not recalled but it still makes me wonder if i can trust them maybe it is safer just to throw it out anyway the website says once you receive your brochure and label please follow the instructions included if your product is affected a voucher for the retail value of the product s will be sent to you within to weeks upon the receipt of your returned product s the voucher can be used at most national retailers and is good toward any fisher price or mattel manufactured product excludes licensed products on this same webpage there is a click here section to process the voucher and have it sent to you of course you aren't going to get your voucher for another couple of months i agree with you the negligence is sickening we need to get on our government officials to regulate this type of thing more closely if we can't trust a huge toy company like mattel how do we know if any of the toys our children play with are safe  Video game crash of 1983 Intellivision Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Mattel Microeconomics Privatization Trademark Phishing Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Gmail Data retention Spyware PHP First-sale doctrine Contract Fair use Separation of church and state Opera (web browser) Uniform Resource Locator School choice Apple Computer Plame affair Citigroup Inflation Fisher-Price Food and Drug Administration Economy of Russia M16 (rifle) Common Unix Printing System Measures of national income and output America Online Bank Social Security (United States) Dog training Electronic Arts Website 2003 California recall Organic farming E-mail spam Ethical consumerism Insurance Externality Classified information Value added tax Debt Denial-of-service attack Intellectual property American Flyer Electronic commerce Retailer Copyright Anonymous remailer Scientology beliefs and practices Slander and libel G.I.

at what age did you tell your child how a baby is born not how they were made just how the baby gets from mommy's belly to being born my year old asked me today and i was not prepared how old is old enough how did you explain i guess i should add that i am months pregnant with my rd child and that my year old came home from school last spring after i found out that i was pregnant again and told me that a friend had told her excatly how babies were made too hello i have always said that honesty is the best policy because if you make up stories about how babies are born the children will just end up being very confused of course whatever you tell the child it should be age appropriate but is shouldn't be a lie like you were delivered by a stork i have always believed in teaching children as young as two years old what the real names of their private parts are i told my nephews when they were two that they have a penis and girls have a vagina it may sound shocking but if you give children nicknames for their private parts they will think that their privates are dirty or that they should be ashamed of their bodies i would go to the library and get some age appropriate books that deal with a truthful but child friendly way of teaching kids about the birds and the bees and all about childbirth too there are many wonderfully illustrated books out there that teach children everything about how babies are made and what the names of their body parts are without being too graphic or inappropriate for a child to learn about  Childbirth Kodocha EastEnders Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Sharon Tate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Melanie Wilkes Alois Hitler Breastfeeding Friends Days of our Lives Sant Thakar Singh Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hera AFI 100 Years series Humphrey Bogart Joke Pitaten John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lazarus Long Jam (TV series) Baby Blues Androgen insensitivity syndrome Paradise Lost Gwen Stacy The writing of Principia Mathematica Incarnations of Immortality Obi-Wan Kenobi Sugo The Family from One End Street Rais massacre 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Vulva One Life to Live Charmed The Island (2005 film) Boy Meets World Oral sex Scenes from a Memory Comanche Avenue Q Stork Survivor (novel) Arjuna Miss Saigon Domestic violence Sexual reproduction Doug Sex and the City The Amber Spyglass Characters of Lost Theory of conduct The Jazz Singer Night (book) Neighbours David Blunkett Peter Pan Pornographic movie Boston Public Virgin Mary in Islam Ayyavazhi mythology Dorothy L.

does anybody agree that the no child left behind is a load i don't see why i have to waste my time in school just so one person can learn what is narrow cirriculum poor funding etc i just feel that the idea is just stupid normally on these questions i'd go on a big ranting tirade but right now i can't completely say all i want to without getting reported for using the f word times in the same sentence lol jk as a high school student i'm sick of hearing about it and having to deal with it most of the kids they are targeting for it at the school i attend don't care what happens to them in the future i have witnessed a few boys say that they don't care about school that they are happy with working in a factory the rest of their lives but i have to suffer through stupid lesson plans and ramblings and lectures about things that have nothing to do with me  The Giver Kyle Broflovski Shit Education in the United States Laura Schlessinger F.

i have nieces and nephews who are very sheltered no playing outside homeschooled no tv mormons ok so its not quite so bad they are allowed to watch pbs for like an hour a day but i am pretty sure their mom doesnt let them play outside much for fear of her neighbors or something she has girls and a boy this year she has started homeschooing them because she wants the girls to be learn to be homemakers i think the boy he is the oldest is really into stuff like star wars and yugio cards and transformers and stuff but he is not allowed to watch the movies i hate to say it but he is extemely geeky they arent allowed to watch anything rated higher than g and she doesnt let them watch some things like spongebob or lilo and stich because they are too sassy the kids seem to be very nice and pretty well behaved besides the fact that they are incredibly hyper my question is have you seen kids that have been raised like this how do they turn out as they get older do you think it will be a good or a bad thing to be raised in such a sheltered enviroment i also wanted to add that their father is not a nice person he is really geeky and really rude to the extended family and plays pretty rough with his kids when the kids enter the mainstream as inevitably they will they may sustain a certain amount of 'culture shock' but other than that will probably do fine in future schools we have relatives also mormon who have raised their kids homeschooled and isolated from regular kid life and they have all done brilliantly well at college are planning decent careers and within the confines of their church's social world appear to be quite normal they probably won't marry 'gentiles' due to some unfortunate experiences with their parents' mixed marriage but i wouldn't worry about your kin it will balance out keep thinking about this bill gates was a geek too  Homeschooling The Fairly OddParents Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Humphrey Bogart Unemployment Poker jargon Kim Possible Polygamy Charmed KaBlam!

what should we have done okay this relates to the etiquette yesterday my husband and i took our two year old and our month old to the zoo about noon we sat down to have lunch we were done eating but i was leaning over to help the baby cram cheerios in his mouth when i felt someone reach in front of me and grab my soda hubby had gone to throw out the trash and i thought it was him so i said without looking up back off buddy that's mine then i heard him yell hey what are you doing from about three feet away i looked up and this or year old boy was looking down my shirt and holding my soda he was also way too close to my kids i jumped up and yelled hey the kid threw the soda at me and ran away laughing my husband yelled what are you doing and started toward the kid then these two women said leave him alone he has autism we backed right down and said oh i sorry we didn't mean to yell at him i didn't know i'm sorry and so on they sat down right next to us and each lit cigarettes we sat there feeling awkward and then packed the kids up as quickly as possible my husband asked if i wanted the soda and i said no so they were close enough to hear us and offered to buy a new one we decinled and they bought one anyway we still declined and ran away with our tails between our legs mostly to get away from an ackward situation but also to get the kids away from the smoke i felt like our over reaction was even more insulting than yelling at the kids anyone who parents children with differences what should we have done not that it is likely to happen again but what is a better way to respond sorry he didn't spash the soda on me just threw the cup back at at me i caught it you did the right thing even kids with autism can be taught some manners depending on the severity of it it's not as if you knew he was autistic anyones first reaction is going to be to yell regardless i'm sure they are used to having him yelled at if this is part of his typical behavior so it wasn't any matter to them aside from the fact i'm sure they may have felt bad as evident by them buying you a drink personally after i yelled and they pointed out to me he was autistic i would have said okay no worries then left it at that  Autism Shaggy dog story Mojave people Controversies in autism Autism rights movement Milton H.

should parents be required to control their kids on airplanes this story happened in july it's about a mother and her month old son getting kicked off of a plane the reason the child kept screaming bye bye plane repeatedly now the mother is considering legal action because she was asked to leave the flight personally i think the parents should be responsible for controlling their kids it's really inconsiderate to others if you let your kid scream and throw tantrums the mother in the video said she didn't have food diapers etc but all of those things can be bought in the airport watch the video here http video yahoo com video play vid fr yfp t what are your thoughts people who agree with the flight attendant aren't blaming the kid they are blaming the parent for not giving the kid a bottle or anything that would prevent an inconsiderate disruption on the plane yes this kid was saying the same thing over and over for a long period of time during which the mother made no effort to quiet the kid at all wasnt it like minutes of this kid saying the same thing i've flown many times with my children when they were young and never had any problems the mother first of all should have shushed the kid what kind of a mother doesnt bring things to occupy the child especially on a flight  2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Fixed-wing aircraft Eddie August Schneider Infantilism Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks The Critic Adoption Motion picture rating system Characters of Lost Urinary incontinence The Catcher in the Rye Airplane!

parents with experience with this when will it start to work my son just started taking mg focalin days ago wednesday on the first day i thought i was seeing a change but when i gave it to him thursday it had a small effect if any at all its bad enough that i didn't want to give him the meds to begin with but i know he needs them and it seems like its not working i was hoping to see a change before school starts for him week and days approximately how long does it take for a full effect to take place like when did you parents that have kids or know people that have kids with adhd on focalin notice a total change in your child did it take days weeks thanks i know what you are going through my eyes are watering now thinking back when i found out about my older son at the age of years of age was diagnosed withtourette syndrome and adhd it is really hard for me thinking about my son and other parent that are going through the same thing as i am and struggling life can be hard and we as parents struggle on a daily basis to learn and understand all that needs to be understood and acknowlede everything around us with the concerns of certain medicines that our children have to endure i would have to say that it all depends on the child and the medicine from a few days to even a month i went to a tourette syndrome ts support group and i have learned from other parents that some med's do not work at all and they have to change med's untill the right one works which is also hard on the child and the parent the one that you said focalin was not good at least that is what was said for about parents at the ts support group there were a couple of parents that would not use med's at all one of the parent's that did not use med's for several years untill the their child said they want to use med's because they were tired of going through the changes and because of peer pressure and fortunetly the med's worked for them my son is taking the medicine called tenex he is on a very low dose mg tenex is uses for ts and adhd i had told the dr that i really did not want him to take anything but i was stressing out so much and so was my child and the rest o the family i felt that i had to do something i told the dr that i wanted my son to be on something that is not strong but will do the work the medicine took about a month to see a big difference yes at first you will see a big difference and then change like its not working but after a while it the med's started to work my child started out with of the pill morning noon and night everyday and now at the age of he is taking at morning pill noon and night pill my son is doing a lot better now if you do not feel that the dr is not right like a quack dr for you then you have the right to change if feel uncomfortable with the certain med's that your son is taking then definatle speak your peace and if need be get a second opinion you are the boss of your child i wish you best of luck on you your son and your family with this challenging time i know we will be strong for our children ears we listen soft sounds of children's laughter's echoing afar children prancing around like feathers drifting in a breeze of air to gain the balance of living the breath that was given the flow of warming thoughts that may run through your heart knowing and understanding our growing children as they blossom with elegance boundaries of unknown nature may await their curiosity sorry if their is mis spelled words the spell check was not working and sorry if this was too long for you but i felt i wanted to make a point because i am going through with experiance hang in there and have happy thoughts  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Social rule Prostate cancer Asperger syndrome Asthma Adult attention-deficit disorder Controversies in autism Breastfeeding Autism Stuttering Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Chronic fatigue syndrome Alternative medicine Prayer Mattress Pitaten Charles Darwin's illness The Contender (television series) Transactional analysis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Extreme Programming About a Boy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Traumatic brain injury Androgen insensitivity syndrome Jon Secada Scenes from a Memory Dyslexia Characters in the Smurfs Time Out of Mind Hearing impairment Stomach cancer The Ashlee Simpson Show Urinary incontinence Laura Schlessinger Hypoglycemia Acute respiratory distress syndrome Folic acid Blood on the Tracks Past teachings of Prem Rawat Abortion debate Ocean's Twelve Methylphenidate Medicine The Catcher in the Rye 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Haven (TNG episode) Carpal tunnel syndrome Kurt Cobain Kender Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Giver Drowning StarCraft: Uprising Sant Thakar Singh Schizophrenia Book of Isaiah Child sexuality The Emancipation of Mimi Milton H.

why do people have children and then expect the government to take care of them i have been a single mom to two beautiful girls who both have down's syndrome i do receive ssi for their disability but i work full time i take my kids to a decent daycare i do not receive food stamps according to the gov't i make too much i know a lady who has kids she is years old and literally lives off the government she does not work yes i know that she is pysically and mentally able to work and literally gets free money from the government from housing to food stamps etc the government needs to start helping parents who help themselves not the other way around they need to stop giving money away to people who do not want to work just to let you guys know i do know this lady and her situation she's proud of being a mom of kids different fathers and that she's living off the government i am not saying that everybody in this situation is abusing it it just aggravates me when i hear from her own mouth i live off the government because i can exact words i agree with you as long as every teen girl knows even before she's pregnant how easy it is to get wic medicaid child support and free housing for the next yrs the longer the system will exist how is it fair that a woman who gets an education and waits for marriage before getting pregnant has to pay full healthcare and or insurance costs but a girl who dropped out of high school and got pregnant with her boyfriend gets everything paid for and never has to repay it plain and simple even mothers should have to pay back what they take from the system  Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Health care in the United States Freeters Divorce Laura Schlessinger Bond Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Medicare (Canada) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Abortion debate Medicaid Kodocha Flat tax Student loan One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights Married... with Children Anorexia nervosa Tax Unemployment Hillary Rodham Clinton Medicare (United States) Transsexuality Food Stamp Program Knots Landing The Wack Pack Social issues in the United States Child support Breastfeeding Social welfare United States Postal Service Audrey Hepburn Amish Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EastEnders Domestic violence Democratic Party (United States) Down syndrome Japanese tea ceremony Androgen insensitivity syndrome Emperor Yuan of Han Eating disorder Kyle Broflovski Money Insurance National Health Service The O.C.

am i being fair so i have two daughters the ages and and sometimes they talk back or disobey me or my husband so we have to punish them for about a year now whenever they do that i take away the year olds cool clothes which are abercrombie and hollister clothes and i take away my year olds makeup both of them say that its totally unfair and that they need those things i feel that neither of them need those things to get by each day the year old has tons of clothes just from different stores like old navy gap macy's target pac sun and limited too so its not like she literally has nothing to where and the year old has perfect skin and has no reason to wear makeup foundation and personally i think shes to young to wear mascara eyeliner and eyeshadow but i let her so the question is am i being fair or should i think of different punishments if you disagree please give me other suggestions thank you so much thank you so much to everyone now i dont feel so bad about taking away their clothes the reason why i chose clothes instead of cell phones computer privileges or tv is because they can get by without them i want my kids to realize that they are blessed to be able to have nice things so i guess its working thank you again it is good to take away your kids privileges and or possessions for punishment i never thought to take away their cool clothes or makeup that's a great idea when my kids disobeyed no phone or tv for the day when my daughter snuck out and i caught her coming back in thru her bedroom window at in the morning i grounded her to her room but i took it a step further and made her put all her electronics outside her room i thought what good is that to sit in her room and watch tv talk on the phone listen to her stereo play video games etc i made her keep her door open and no sleeping she was so tired from being out all night she was mad and yelled what am i suppose to do i told her read a book when my kids were older and got their drivers license and cars for punishment i would take their car away for the weekend the best punishment for kids is to take away what they love most yes it's fair you're doing a great job  The Inside Avenue Q Silent Night, Deadly Night Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Sin City Social rule About a Boy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Oh My Goddess!

what would happen if my year old son kill some body nonono he didnt do anything im watching a show bout murders and they are all old and going to jail so i was just wondering what would happen if a little kid did that sry if i worried you chances are the defense would be that he is too young to fully understand right and wrong a murder at this age would be at most considered manslaughter he would probably have to undergo therapy i don't see him being locked up there would probably be more penalties for his caretaker for neglect  Murder The Shining (film) Treehouse of Horror V Manslaughter Capital punishment Syphon Filter Inspector Gadget Milton H.

is if safe for my month old to watch tv my little girl loves to watch tv is this safe the american academy of pediatrics recommends no television for children under and after only a very limited amount why because it's just not the best use of time there is also a suggestion there might be correlation between the quickly shifting images and add the rapid change of the screen and something to do with the way kids view things later on now i'm a practical mother i needed time to do things like go to the bathroom and clean up or cook so i did allow tv but it was very sparingly maybe a total of a hour a day i think sometimes we need to do what we need to do because life it's a textbook case of anything but definitely if tv is on all the time or the child is in front of it all the time that's a big no no kids need to be active and not sedentary and tv promotes sedentary lifestyle  Breastfeeding Ex-gay Medical analysis of circumcision Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Speed limit Solar eclipse Puberty The Brady Bunch American Academy of Pediatrics Antiretroviral drug Explosive material Cancer Cathode ray tube History of intersex surgery Anarcho-primitivism About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Reparative therapy Hypoglycemia Daylight saving time Television in the United States Sesame Street Married... with Children Vitamin C Extreme Programming Growth hormone deficiency Friends Liquid crystal display Phimosis National Film Board of Canada Cognitive science Motion picture rating system EastEnders Aerial (dance move) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Urinary incontinence Intracranial pressure Neolithic Revolution Empire Burlesque Kimberly-Clark Corporation Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ben Johnson (athlete) Our Gang Hamster Postpartum depression Dead Like Me Sharon Tate Multiple sclerosis Anorexia nervosa Dorama Bipolar disorder Motivation Gurage God Autism Thimerosal Science fiction on television Veganism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Autism epidemic Bob Hope Epistemology Obesity The Fairly OddParents Laura Schlessinger Tocopherol Sento Chronic fatigue syndrome Betting (poker) Sin City Atkins Nutritional Approach Television rating system Phase-shift keying Irna Phillips Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Asperger syndrome Pedophilia The Giver Karen Horney Scooby-Doo Transsexuality Textile manufacturing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Birth control Fecal incontinence Triage Education in Japan Baby Blues The Star Wars Holiday Special The Adventures of Pete & Pete Movie projector Child sexual abuse Psychoanalysis Pediatrics Driver's license MMORPG Hikikomori Global warming

to circumcise or not to circumcise to women who have had boys did you circumcise your son why or why not to pregnant ladies who are having boys are you planning on circumcising why or why not ayla i like your answer it is a personal decision we didn't do it to our son there didn't seem to be any reason to so we couldn't figure out why we would just seems kind of silly to alter the perfectly fine healthy body that our son was born with for no reason re locker room teasing circ rate is falling to less than these days i just don't see that as a problem and well when it comes right down to it who's more likely to be teased really the guy who's not circed or the guy who makes it obvious that he was looking at the other guys' equipment re looking like dad dudes a grown up penis looks nothing like a baby penis at all anyway or well i hope that your husband's penis doesn't look like a baby penis by the time they're old enough to look anywhere near the same they probably won't be comparing them anymore ask your husband when the last time was that he his father compared penises re hygeine it's no different teaching your child to clean their penis than it is teaching them to clean their bottoms you're going to teach them to do that right re phimosis in the insanely unlikely case that that happens he can get it taken care of at that time re cosmetic appearance what the girls will think see above re falling circ rate i guess the natural look will help my son weed out the superficial girls in his life re health benefits the benefits risks really balance themselves out in my opinion anything that he might get in the future we'll take care of at that time it seems like a pretty extreme preventive measure to take for some very unlikely risks  Phimosis Circumcision Kyle Broflovski Medical analysis of circumcision Breastfeeding History of male circumcision Androgen insensitivity syndrome Penis Masturbation Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Circumcision advocacy AIDS in Africa Condom Balanitis xerotica obliterans Intersex surgery Infant baptism Penile cancer Theory of conduct Gay slang Human sexual behavior David Reimer Gender role Birth control Growth hormone treatment Sex assignment Jam (TV series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Penis removal Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Cancer Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma About a Boy EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Hillary Rodham Clinton History of intersex surgery Oral sex Jon Secada Body modification Abortion in the United States Domestic violence Foreskin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sex and the City Vitamin C Tocopherol Jean Grey Joke Smegma Transsexuality Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Hypoglycemia Puberty Utility cycling Microeconomics Cytomegalovirus AIDS American Dad!

parents how do you deal with the way your kids are coached in sports before i was married i was an athlete and coached pee wee football i am still heavily into sports and am a personal trainer now i think i am becoming one of the parents i used to hate right now my son plays pee wee football and my daughter runs track i get to the point where i can't watch practices and games because i don't like the way the coach is coaching i am very competitive and just want to step in and take over i have even exchanged words with coaches and afterwards felt really bad and had to apologize especially for the sake of my kids i know in my mind i need to step back and let the coach do his job and this year i am trying to do that but it's hard do any other parents have this problem and if so how do you handle it i am a coach as well as a parent i'm not as competitive as you seem to be but remember that in peewee football the coach is a volunteer and is out there because he she wants to be there or no one else volunteered in school sports it's a little different and a little more competitive but the more parents interfere the more difficult it is to coach or keep the kids' respect have you volunteered to coach peewee one season of coaching should give you a whole new perspective on the parent situation i coach soccer and we have a zero tolerance rule if a parent interferes at all the parent is banned from games how sad for the child try hard to step into your child's shoes during practices and games concentrate on what they are feeling thinking and doing during that time instead of what the coach should or should not be doing live life through your children's eyes and realize how embarrassing it is to them to be one of those parents i don't always agree with the way other coaches coach or how parents act however i make sure i try hard to be a positive role model for my children as well as my players seeing parents so upset or frustrated during practices or games makes the kids lose concentration and takes all the fun out of it pretty soon they won't want to play anymore this is really sad if they have natural talent try taking an anger management class it will teach you methods to calm down instead of over reacting my brother took an anger management class and he's so much better at controlling his outbursts  Football (soccer) American football Sport Cincinnati Bengals Ty Cobb National Football League Norway national football team New York Giants Ben Johnson (athlete) New York Jets Football Volleyball Jim Thorpe ELO rating system Indiana Pacers Infantilism Pitaten Boston Public Major League Baseball television contracts Buffalo Bills Cleveland Browns Rugby union Theory of conduct Blackjack Baseball Violence in sports New York Knicks R.S.C.

to older parents who have adult age children what makes having children worth it my husband and i have a great loving stable marriage and look forward to having children some day soon we both come from loving families where we had good childhoods and our parents are still married and love each other i've always been very good with children and i can tell my husband will be an incredible father of the time i can't wait to have children i get so excited and sappy thinking of it but there is of me that dreads some of the changes married couples go through when they have a child you hear horror stories of couples who become so focused on their children that they completely lose sight of each other their r'ship suffers and years later they look up and don't even know each other they have nothing to talk about other than their kids i fear that and my husband knows that he knows it's important to me that if when we have children we continue to build a strong r'ship and not lose sight of our love for each other the other thing i dread or fear is the teenage years that of the time i start thinking is all the good memories you make between ages birth thru age worth having your child practically hate you from age i know not all teenagers hate their parents but it sure seems like it i'm not sure i have it in me to work my butt off for this kid to only have them yell i hate you as they slam the door because you wouldn't buy them a cell phone so i guess my question is is having children worth some of the bad parts you have to endure both to your emotional state and your marriage i know children are a gift and i can imagine there are sooooo many wonderful incredible moments i think it's just fear of the unknown i loooove children and really am excited to become a mother but these issues flitter in the back of my mind you and your husband will have no problems raising your children as you already know what to look for and will work at keeping your marriage strong you sound like people who are perfect for being parents mature responsible thoughtful we raised our two daughters who are now and with two each of their own the rewards come every day when you get a big hug when you watch them sleeping when they giggle take their first steps go to school that first day make new friends kiss your cheek and say i love you but especially when out on their own they make it work because they have been raised by loving mature thoughtful parents like you parenting is perseverance especially when you have teenagers you just keep them close know who they are with stay in touch with their friends' parents and help them make good decisions when they fall you pick them up dust them off give them a lecture take them under your wing and start over again i would do it all over again just the same to have the two loving daughters i have today and my four rambunctious precious grandchildren  The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Codename: Kids Next Door Knots Landing Child sexuality Miss Saigon Father's Day (Doctor Who) Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Divorce Good Times Charmed Humphrey Bogart We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode) Jon Secada Ephesian Tale Infantilism John the Baptist Kodocha Saved by the Bell Sigmund Freud Marriage The Amber Spyglass Little Britain Neighbours The Death Gate Cycle Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lovely Bones Sin City Calvin and Hobbes Autism Hollyoaks Dawson's Creek Motion picture rating system Pitaten Haven (TNG episode) Kender Darth Vader Days of our Lives The Shining (film) Incest Futurama (TV series - season 5) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Yoko Ono Transactional analysis The Invisibles Juliana of the Netherlands Kurt Cobain Series finale The Human Stain W.I.T.C.H.

horrible terrible misrable two's what to do my son is months old does not listen he is constantly getting into things breaking things i never thought could be broken but worse is that whenever we go anywhere it turns into me chasing and yelling at him if anyone but me says stop or sit down he listens it is becoming so frustrating especially when we are out in public i dont want to spank or scream any other good options time out has been working for the moment and only that moment then he gets into something else your son sounds just like my daughter at that age she got into everything broke things i didn't think she could break and tested me every chance she got often she would look at me and say no before i even asked her to do something i was very frustrated i did alot of reading and researched behavioral type books for ways to get her to listen i finally tried a reward system i made a chart with all the days of the week and several little squares under each day every time she did what she was asked i would give her verbal praise as well as hugs and kisses i would then let her put little stars next to the boxes on her chart i told her that when she filled in her chart i would take her to the store and let her pick a prize it doesn't have to be expensive i took her to a store and let her pick a toy she was really happy it will take a while but when a child sees that behaving properly and listening will be to their benefit they eventually come around it is very necessary to stand your ground on accepted behavior if you make exceptions your child will quickly pick it up it took about weeks for my daughter to get used to the routine and in time she embraced it things improved dramatically i also started doing this to establish a good tooth brushing schedule it really worked for me i hope you have the same results  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Dog training Milton H.

do any parents not let their kids drink soda because your not letting them drink soda they will wind up drinking more in the future i've never really been restricted and i barelly drink soda at all and i'm really healthy i have known many kids who are restricted to soda and when they're aloud to drink it they inhale it they thinks they're so cool drinking soda and do it when ever they can to feel cool if someone offers me one i'll only have one like of the time estimating so if you gradually let them drink a bit they'll be less tempted to drink so much in the future soft drinks should be only for special occasions and cola based ones shouldn't be given to children under about because of the caffeine just think of a soft drink can as having about teaspoons of sugar for coke they add lemon oil and salt so they can squeeze in that extra teaspoons even juice needs to be restricted to one glass per day it's almost as sweet as soft drink although it does at least have vitamins juice based drinks are better as they provide more water if you start early get your kids used to watered down juice so they get less of a sugar addiction  Soft drink Tea 7 Up Coca-Cola Drink The Coca-Cola Company Breakfast Fanta Lemon Lemonade Energy drink Rum Tooth Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

i dated a woman who lied about having her tubes tied now she's pregnant supposedly what are my rights here i have proof that she also slept with another man while we were dating and also told him her tubes were tied she has also contacted him to say she is pregnant both of us suspect that she was trying to get pregnant on purpose to get child support as she is currently on welfare with three kids and we are both well off men who seem to have been targetted for this sick game of extortion if she is pregnant and i am the father i want full custody of the child because she lives a life of lies drugs violence and chaos and that is no place for a child i also feel that her current children are in danger and probably should not be allowed to stay with her please tell me i have a chance here any lawyers out there please don't assume that i knew her lifestyle and slept with her anyway that was not at all the case i broke things off after i started finding these things out then suddenly a few weeks later i am contacted by some guy who says that she told him he was the father the same day i got a phone call saying the same thing sigh thanks to those of you offering encouragement i admit i didn't really want a child but if i am the father i definitely want to make sure my child has the best home that i can give him or her i'm in law school but i'm afraid i've yet to take family law basically i think you need a court order for a dna test as soon as the child is born and you need some kind of proof that she's an unfit mother does she have an arrest record has she been reported to the dept of children and family services you could always make a call to them if you know she has drugs in the house and if you suspect she's using drugs while pregnant with your child yikes call dcfs and see what your options are here you can also post your question on lawguru com and if you're well off as you say why not go ahead and meet with a lawyer get your ducks in a row i guess i don't have to advise that in the future you always wear a condom pregnancy isn't the only thing you need to worry about in this day and age if she's a drug user and sleeps around you should be tested for stds men frequently have no symptoms but they can mess you up trich is very common and pretty much symptom less in men but can lead to urinary tract kidney problems later on  EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Knots Landing Urinary incontinence Pregnancy Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Fathers' rights Birth control Terri Schiavo Human sexual behavior Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Schapelle Corby Kodocha Condom Obstetrics Folic acid Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Gonorrhoea Premature birth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Abortion Poker jargon Katelyn Faber Boston Public Mumia Abu-Jamal Rosa Parks Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Infantilism Ben Johnson (athlete) Divorce Extreme Programming Tupac Shakur Fathers' rights movement in the UK Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Endometriosis Child custody Oral sex Big Brother (USA TV series) Plame affair timeline Daredevil Herpes simplex virus Pelvic inflammatory disease Mensal__o scandal Twin Pitaten The Contender (television series) Domestic violence Sexual intercourse Marriage Psoriasis The Death Gate Cycle Days of our Lives Vernon Schillinger Prostitution Kurt Cobain James Hanratty James Bulger 21 July 2005 London bombings The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sin City Miscarriage Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Health insurance Elvis and Me Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Stroke Oral contraceptive Vivian Solon Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Abortion in the United States Sex and the City Survivor (novel) Jam (TV series) 1919 World Series Neighbours Tom DeLay Melanie Wilkes Drug test History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Volkert van der Graaf The Amber Spyglass Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Negima The Smoking Room

why do so many people condemn other people when they decide to have a baby when they are not married i can understand for youn teenagers but what about people who are in their mid to late 's or even early 's i had kids without being married and i wouldn't have changed a thing sometimes marriage isn't for everyone and if there is nothing wrong just being in a comitted realtionship without marriage times are changing people i'm and recently married but i see it on here all the time with people in their mid 's trying to conceive and people always saying why aren't you married yet or something to that affect you don't have to be married to be a loving supportive father or mother i agree with you and i see you have attracted just some of the people you were talking about there's nothing wrong with not being married i have been in a very stable relationship like marriage in all ways except the paperwork for years we don't have any kids yet but if we did happen to get pregnant what difference would it make if we were married none he will be an awesome dad whether he marries me or not and would i be less of a mother for not completing a certain ceremony i don't think so  Friends Marriage Neighbours Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Knots Landing EastEnders Divorce Pedophilia Laura Schlessinger Days of our Lives About a Boy Teenage pregnancy Fathers' rights Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Polyamory Homosexuality and Judaism Rick Santorum Charmed Father Human sexual behavior Stewie Griffin Fiddler on the Roof Keith Richards Incest Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Same-sex marriage One Tree Hill (TV series) Philosophical skepticism Henry Fonda Sharon Tate The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ex-gay Ayyavazhi mythology Love The O.C.

would you use a babysitter that you don't feel warm and fuzzy about i interviewed a babysitter that one of my good friends recommended she's a college grad and works with autistic kids and is looking to babysit to supplement her income i have three kids one with high functioning autism so i figured she's be perfect my kids liked her she played nicely with my kids while i interviewed her but i felt like she didn't really enjoy kids or at least mine she went overboard reprimanding my barely year old daughter to say please every seconds while i was right there made some disdainful comments when my son showed her his new pirate sword she doesn't like toys that are weapons and about them watching tv they were watchign dora so i could interview her in peace she said well at least its educational i'm sure she'd take great care of my kids but i just didn't get warm and fuzzy feelings from her am i asking too much previous to this i've pretty much only had my mother babysit so i'm feeling lost thanks for any input just wanted to add in case it makes a difference that this would be a babysitter i'd use on weekends occasionally if my husband and i wanted to go out to dinner i'm at sahm but overall i'm so happy to hear you all pretty much feel the same way i do i thought i was being way too picky and asked this question to see what others thought thanks everyone she's sounds like she's using her educational knowledge a little over the top when i first got out of college degree in child development i was the same way constantly applying what i learned in school to my every day world it doesn't really work that way and as i learned when i had kids and as i'm sure she'll eventually learn you can't raise and work with kids exactly the way they teach you in school and books not every yr kid says the word please for every single thing a little tv isn't going to kill them etc but it's what she's learned in school she's going a little over board and needs to lighten up just a tad if you don't get the warm and fuzzy feeling about her when you leave and you're out you're going to have some worry on your mind what is she saying to my kids what are they doing now it's not a feeling you want to have i would want a babysitter who i know will take good care of my kids keep them safe enforce the rules but not go over board and whom my kids enjoy while i'm away not only should you have that warm fuzzy feeling about them but the sitter should have it for you too with every family i babysat nannied for as a teen and my early twenties i enjoyed the kids and the parents if i didn't i stopped you're not asking for too much i'd give her a shot let her come once or twice and see how it goes see what your kids think about her what she does while you're away and see what she does says when you call to check up on things don't be afraid to call best wishes  Day care The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Autism Infantilism EastEnders Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marilyn Monroe Baby Blues Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) One Tree Hill (TV series) Poker jargon Mina Mongoose Philosophical skepticism Controversies in autism Milton H.

why do our parents feel the need to offer advice about raising our children i hate it when i ask my family not to do something with my child and they do it anyway for example a family member of mine kept giving my month old son pickles while i was trying to get him to eat his chicken and i finally told him not too because of the sodium and he needed to eat real food then he went to give him a grape and i was instructed not to give grapes because they can choke on the skin and i told him not to give it to him and he said why i finally said because he will get choked and i asked you not too i now i sound like a but when did grandparents start to dictate what we do for their grandchildren i mean i fear some of my family in keeping an eye on him and people wonder why i don't let my child stay with anyone oh by the way he gave him a huge chunk of that pickle before i had a chance to ask him not too and my son got choked i had to pull it out of his mouth they do it b c it is them my battle was diet pepsi and grandma's cup if you feel that they do not watch him well enough then do not send him but honestly you survived it so how bad could it be i ended up laying down the law as to how my children would be raised and that she can offer her opinion but nothing else and it seemed to work they are at grandma's and grandma will spoil them that is true in most cases they mean well and i am sure they do not do it to spite you i said i told you so lots of times and after awhile she just let it go and started carrying through with certain things i definitely did not want happening talk to them like an adult and if all else fails stop taking him around them but explain why you do not they will come around but you can not expect them to stop completely i still do stuff for my nieces nail polish and chapstick specifically and my brother hates it but lets me do it cause it is only at my house and that is what aunts are for good luck  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Charmed Pitaten 613 mitzvot Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Family Little Britain Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Grandview, U.S.A.

parents what is crossing the line in correcting someone elses child i am recently engaged and my finace has a god daughter the problem is she is three and misbehaves unfortunatly she loves me and will follow me around everywhere she has to sit in my lap when im eating plays in my food sits in my lap and wants to remote control or is at the computer with me typing over me it annoys me that her parents just let her do whatever but the child really does like me if i very politly correct her she screams bloody murder and runs to go tattle it annoys me so bad my question is when is it ok to correct her and how do i do it without making the the parents feel that im crossing the line the other issue is that she is the flower girl in our wedding i am not going to get upset becuase she doesnt want to walk ot wear the dress im laid back about it i knew when picking her she was too young the issue is she doesnt listen and i dont want her talking crying through my ceramony what is the nicest way to tell the parents what my concern is let me re phrase my question i am going to correct her but i need to do it in the right way i refuse to let her bang on my laptop play in my food or yank the remote out of my hands she may be three but she knows what she is doing she has full vocabulary and will roll her eyes and point blank tell you no i hate to be the bearer of bad news but the little darling doesn't love you or even like you for that matter she simply enjoys the adult that lets her push her around and do whatever she wants and responds so quickly when she goes crying to mommy her parents aren't about to correct her because they obviously have no control over her themselves so when she is on your lap they can heave a sigh of relief at not having to deal with the little angel for minutes or so the way i see it you have two choices here have her as your flowergirl to try and maintain family harmony with those two parents and believe me the rest of the family will think you are either stupid or a saint because they already recognize the princess for what she is and be prepared to kiss your day goodbye because she will wreck it or grow a backbone discuss it with your fiance' and tell him you love the little girl but are not prepared to give up your big day simply to please a year old brat that won't even remember the day a year down the road the parents might be miffed on the surface but will totally understand in private while the rest of the family will admire you for having the courage to stand up for yourself and what is right to answer your question about when is it ok to correct her anytime she crosses personal boundaries you are within your rights to say no sorry you cannot sit on my lap etc etc if she screams off to mommy that is her problem not yours as far as educating her or teaching her forget it that is the parents job and you cannot correct a lifetime of bad behavior and training in a hour visit or even a day for that matter what you can hope to achieve is that she will learn she cannot push auntie's buttons or run roughshod over top of you she will hate it now but years from now she will respect and like you if the little darlin' survives that long lol j k do yourself your fiance' and the whole wedding day a favour and ask her parents to find a babysitter for the wedding day if you want to be real nice offer to pay for the babysitter yourself and count it money well spent  Little Britain Social rule Pitaten Jennifer Lopez Friends Infantilism Theory of conduct Sin City Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kodocha Characters in the Smurfs EastEnders Japanese tea ceremony Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

as a parent what are you doing to teach your children how important it is to have their own voice and to make their own decisions if you are a parent of a very small child what things do you plan to do to teach them that it is so important not to just follow the crowd i am a birth mother of three a stepmother to one and a foster mother to two each i have raised to understand they have a voice they are independant and can make their own choices as the ages allow of course they are taught to be respectful in their voicing of opinions to stand up for what they believe in and to do things on their own its very important to make sure a child knows that they have a voice that their opinion counts and they will be listened to as long as they voice such in a respectful manner i will admit my year old is a little to opinionated and is having to learn the hard way that sometimes its just best to keep your mouth shut but its a live and learn situation as a child i was allowed to question my parents descisions when it came to me as long as i was respectful i knew that in the end it was their choice and their word was final but they listened to what i had to say and even sometimes changed their minds because i had a good point as a result i grew up to be the type of adult who doesnt follow crowds i think on my own and do things my way it doesnt always agree with society but i am happy with the outcome of my life i think its important to teach a child that they are individuals and they dont have to follow the crowd i started by letting them make choices at an early age about what they would wear within reason what they would eat what they liked to watch etc i was mindful of what was appropriate but gave them as much liberty in these choices as i could to promote individual thinking i was and still am strict on alot of things but the rules of my house are set and the children know them they are not like my parents rules nor like my grandparents and they even conflict with alot of other parents ideas on the types of rules a child should have but they work for my house my girls are grown now and all have lives of their own they make me proud in the fact that they dont follow trends or try to fit in they choose to stand on their own and be individuals my boys are showing the same signs of individuality and i am grateful that the have listened and learned over the years  Infantilism Abortion debate Theory of conduct Objectivist philosophy Pitaten Milton H.

question for parents why do parents say that having a baby made them a better person shouldn't you strive to be a better person before you have kids although each of us think that we may already be a better person we change our views and even try harder to be even better after having a child it isn't just our views but we have to be responisable for bringing up children to value these things as well we see things in a different light so to speak you try harder and usually have a higher determation to do better when you know that such a tiny person depends on you for everything  Hearing impairment Infantilism Theory of conduct Sharon Tate Karen Horney Infant baptism Abortion debate Hiberno-English Lie The nature of God in Western theology Adoption Childfree Theodicy Property (ownership right) Generation Y Soul Species Pedophilia Baby Blues Extreme Programming Causality Humphrey Bogart Jiddu Krishnamurti Summa Theologiae Child Peter Singer Criticism of libertarianism Polyamory Sant Thakar Singh Floppy disk Excommunication Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mental retardation Laura Schlessinger Free will Mathematics Controversies in autism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Catechism Autism Ukrainian language Moral Politics Jewish bereavement Calvin and Hobbes Justification (theology) Social rule Autism rights movement Alcoholics Anonymous Communication skill Reincarnation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Columbo Sento Disney's California Adventure Premature birth Prolog Transactional analysis Origin belief Philosophical skepticism Gamera vs. Jiger God Gender-neutral language Kyle Broflovski Datalore (TNG episode) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Pitaten Class (computer science) Immortality Who is a Jew?

do you agree with not being able to smack your child no i was brought up in the 's and if i misbehaved i was given a smack across the leg i wasn't beaten or mistreated and i grew up with no hang ups i loved and respected my mum and dad my own two years old children got the same treatment i did and i know they respect me and they frequently tell me they love me too it's all very well saying 'reason with them' or put them on the 'naughty step' but most bad behaviour occurs when you are out in public you can't reason with a screaming child in the frozen food aisle of tesco's or sit them in a quiet corner and leave them in asda's so a smack would then be the best punishment but parents can't even threaten to do it without some do gooder telling them it's 'child abuse'  Spanking Corporal punishment Domestic violence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Silent Night, Deadly Night Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 About a Boy Saint Nicholas Fathers' rights Dog training 2005 trial of Michael Jackson EastEnders Parenting Boston Public John the Baptist ASDA Oasis (band) Tesco Stolen Generation The Marshall Mathers LP Mumia Abu-Jamal Rocko's Modern Life Kodocha Punishment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mojave people Social rule Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Comanche Anorexia nervosa The dozens The Shining (film) Swingout My Parents are Aliens James Stockdale The Story of Tracy Beaker Infantilism Guantanamo Bay Little Britain Apostasy in Islam Kyle Broflovski Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Wrigley Field Great Teacher Onizuka Theodicy Fictional crossover Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Ron and Fez Capital punishment Children of God Miss Saigon James Dobson Fred Phelps Divorce Father's Day (Doctor Who) School discipline Incest Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Mr. and Mrs. Turner Supermarkets in the United Kingdom Professional wrestling attacks Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Rais massacre Michelle Tanner Anger management Bat Boy Ranma __ characters Eddie Guerrero Jonestown Welsh mythology Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Treehouse of Horror V Brown v.

why are some parents nots teaching their children to cook clean or even do laundry i have noticed more and more over the years that a lot of people do not teach their children how to cook clean or even do laundry and i wish understand the reasoning behind this i would think that teaching your children these skills would be a valuable asset in their adult lives and i'm not just talking about new parents today i know people who cannot do any of these things that are years old and all the way up to years old so when i do ask them why do you eat out everynight why don't you cook why do you have to take your laundry to a cleaning service do you know what kind of responses i get i don't know how no one ever showed me how to do it we had somebody else do it for us what sense does this make and please before i have to hear about the fact that i don't have children i grew up in a large family and being the oldest i had to help raise and take care of my siblings and all of us know how to do these basic things for those who asked what is my basis for this here are a few examples example my mother has a neighbor who is years old and his mother comes over days a week to do his laundry buy groceries cleans his house and takes out his garbage example my ex who is years old never had to do anything in the house when he was growing up so when we moved in together you could imagine what i came home to on after the st day example a year old coworker of mine eats out every meal of the day and doesn't even know how to make a sandwich at home it seems that your examples could also be a cause of laziness and dependency however i know what you mean my children help me do the household chores yes they are supervised when using solvents or machinery but my year old knows how to operate the washing machine does the dusting she loves to dust go figure vacuums the house mops the floor washes windows and cleans the bathroom counters all without complaining because she understands that these things need doing and that mommy is not going to do it all by herself why should i her dad is also teaching her how to cook i don't like to cook so that is my hubby's job the year old feeds the dog helps me unload the dishwasher also loves to dust it must be the neat duster we have and picks up her toys every day this is just how it is in our family so they know no different i want them to be able to be self sufficient when they get older i also want them to have respect for all the chores that must be done and for the people that do them daily like mom we have a chore choice chart at home and the kids get to choose their own chores to do each week it is a laminated sheet that we can write on with a dry erase pen and each week we start with a blank page each person can choose to do whatever chore they want provided that they all get checked off during the week my oldest likes this and tries to get her favorite chores before anyone else does which is great since it makes her do it quickly and motivates her my hubby's best friend still lives at home has mom do his laundry and basically take care of him i don't want my kids to be living at home when they are  The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Fecal incontinence Hamster Garfield Laura Schlessinger Kitchen Calvin and Hobbes The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct About a Boy Microeconomics The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Textile manufacturing Laundry Humphrey Bogart Kimi Finster Baby Blues Dog training Rich Mullins Infantilism Social rule Good Times Little Britain Married... with Children Abortion debate Milton H.

omg he wont listen help me my son is in general a very good kid most everything i tell him to do not do he listens the only problem i have with him is he keeps playing in the bathroom it is attached to his room so unless im supervising every move of the time i dont know if hes in his room or the bathroom i cant lock him out or anything cuz its the bathroom i took all the chemicals out so thats not a concern but thats gross i dont want him playing in there and every time i catch him at least times a day i ask him what are you doing he always responds with playing in the bathroom i know im not supposed to so i know he knows better i have spanked him taken things away done time out and nothing is working its frustrating the hell out of me if he knows hes not supposed to how do i make him stop the more you punish him the more he will probably gonna be in there that is why you have to encourage him to replace his playing spot try to interest him in playing outside or in his room or any other place that is more suitable when he goes to play in the bathroom try to say look how warm and bright it is in your room look how cleaner it is hear and all of your toys are here or another thing if he is still small you can scare him like if you start to play in the bathroom the bathroom monster will come and so and so on this usually scares kids and they do not want to do it again  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bart chalkboard gags The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bathroom The Shining (film) The Inside Japanese toilet Silent Night, Deadly Night The Time Machine Toilet paper Fecal incontinence Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Toilet Milton H.

is it wrong to shoot little kids i love going to playgrounds and capturing the innocence of childhood on film recently i got a new digital camera as well but do you think that's illegal i mean i ask the parents first and give them copies but is it wrong it isn't illegal if you ask the parents first but if anyone ever turned around and said they didn't give permission you would have a hard time proving that they said it was ok i understand about loving to take pictures of children at play but the current way you are doing it may cause many people to think you are creepy or something you could try contacting the heads of playgroups and saying that you are starting a non profit photography business of taking pics of children to capture childhood innocence and you would love to give the parents the gift of free photographs of their children playgroup that way you are being more professional and you are making sure that every child who will be in your shot will have parental permission you should also draw up a little contract stating that the parents give you permission to take the pictures and whether or not you are allowed to copyright them if you decide to show sell them good luck and enjoy  Photography Digital photography Warez Pornography Good Times Humphrey Bogart Child pornography MAME Copyright infringement of software Sin City Theory of conduct Cinematography Digital cinema Google Digital camera Our Gang American individualist anarchism Nintendo Lewis Carroll Alfred Hitchcock Transactional analysis Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Film Kidnapping GNU General Public License Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Francis Bacon (painter) Children of God Street photography SCO-Linux controversies Monopoly (game) Neopets Panoramic photography Property (ownership right) Abortion debate Codename: Kids Next Door Motion picture rating system Babylonian law Digital rights management Peter Pan Intellectual property Copy protection Charmed The Critic Fair use Sharon Tate Pitaten Kodocha Kylie Minogue Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Four square Video game controversy About a Boy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Childlove movement Trailer Park Boys Divorce ROM image Contemporary culture of South Korea Japanese copyright law Escape from New York Camera Billy the Kid Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shaggy dog story Stereoscopy Ten Commandments Photojournalism Great Teacher Onizuka Marriage Insurance Road-rule enforcement camera Marilyn Monroe Photograph Snooker Malcolm in the Middle Stanley Kubrick Controversies in autism Contract bridge Gift economy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Digital single-lens reflex cameras The Inside Prank flash Care Bears Macro photography Modchip Konica Minolta Friends Education Paramount Pictures Sergei Eisenstein Tokusatsu Craps

about daycare thing what step should i take i changed my year old daughter s daycare a month ago because this one is more convenient for us to drop off and pick up at first she s not willing to the daycare she said i don t know the kids i said to her never mind honey you don t know them because you are a new one after some days you ll know them and make friends with them the other day before when i asked her things of her daycare she said slowly in a small voice i like anri but anri and lili are friends i said one can have many friends you can tell her can we be friends she said i told her she said no i told her never mind honey she don t want make friends with you just because you re a new one and she don t know you well when you re familiar with your classmates you ll make many friends i know it take time for her to be familiar with her new daycare and she will make some friends there but i still feel kind of sorry for her so how should i do for her in such a situation what will you do all children are uncomfortable when going to a new daycare especially if she was comfortable in the other setting don't dismiss her fellings validate them with something like i know you want to have friends at school i want you to have friends at school too talk to the teacher and the director for ideas in your particular situation because they see your child either interact or hang back from the other children think about when you are put into new social situations most of us don't jump in on the first day your daughter has to get the feelings of security and comradship with the other children in this new setting but don't minimize her feelings she's probably lonely and has to find a way to break into a set group possibly when the new school year starts at the end of august or beginning of september other new children will start and she will find someone to bond with think of what has just happened to your daughter she has had the equivalency of a divorce from one daycare and a remarriage at the new daycare only she doesn't and didn't have a say in who she remarried and the other children have already formed alliances even as young as two or three years old and are not yet ready to let another child in it will happen gradually but do validate your daughter's feeling and ask her what could make it better then talk to the teacher perhaps with the numbers of children in the classroom the teacher has not noticed how unhappy your daughter seems from your description children are resilient but sometimes need adult intervention and guidance for moving into a group that is already set and paired she really is telling you that she doesn't know anyone and possibly doesn't know how to try to get to know some of the children that is where the teacher woould be helpful if she could have one of the other children show your daughtere how everything works and where everything is kept the housekeeping area is one in which children can pretend and get to know each other but sad as it is there are already cliques in preschool so try to advocate for your daughter and listen really listen to what she says then encourage without dismissing her feelings because the fact is that is how she feels right now that nobody wants to play with her and she has no friends find books on going to a new school and read them with her you could also look for books like nobody likes me i have no friends or something to that effect and then talk with your daughter about what the book suggests as possible solutions think about what you would do if you were in a similar situation we as adults can cope a little better but nobody wants to be left out or have no friends at school or work  Kodocha Social rule Friends Kindergarten About a Boy Shaggy dog story Pitaten The Giver Laura Schlessinger Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marilyn Monroe The Lovely Bones Transactional analysis Milton H.

what to do kids kissing ok so my cousin's girls came over today one is and the other is they've play with my son who is well me and the yo were in my room online and the other two were in my son's room behind the bed and guess what i go to check on the and they were kissing the girl had her mouth wide open and my son was kissing regular like the way i kiss him i don't know if that matters or not i really don't have much experience with this sort os thing i asked them what they were doing and my son replied nothing real quick so obviously he knew he was doing something wrong so i called them over to come into my room to come join us on the comp i called my gma who is kind of like my mom since she raised me to tell her about the situation and how i should handle it i didn't get an answer so i called my aunt which is another person that i talk to a lot and that i'm close to and i told her what happened and she told me this is the second time something like this has happened i was furious my son often spends the night at my gma's house who watches the girls my aunt told me that the little girl was on top of my son i don't know the details because that's all she told me i def plan on telling the mother my cousin i've also heard another story about the little girl that my gma told me months ago she tols me that the little girl was how can i word this playing with the penis of her male dog i told my hubby and he said that we should ask the mother if it is possible that anyone is sexually abusing her but i have no idea how to approach this to her if i should at all what do i tell my son i plan on doing some research but any advice on this topic would be greatly apprciated and on how i should handle this situation well i did tell the mom what happened today and that i found about the other instance when they were under the blankets would i be out of line to suggest her daughter may be being abused my dh thinks not but i'm not sure how to even suggest to her mother my cousin this how about kids being curious if you want to see evidence of abuse i am sure you can interprete anything you see as such your kid replying 'nothing' real quick has a lot to do with the look on your face and your tone of voice when you ask the question kids see these things all around them all the time all it takes is a tv and kids are naturally curious especially when it concerns things that you won't talk about or feel ashamed about you make the direct link with sexual behaviour but it's just investigation to them it must be interesting because they notice how touchy the subject is with you sorry but it sounds like you're freaking out  Milton H.

men hitting women im a female and was always bought up that men should never hit a women and a women should never hit a man i dont think i ever would unless it was a life or death situation for me or my family my husband and i have the same disagreement all the time his mother chooses to stay in a physicly abbusive relationship she has admitted to me that she usually starts the fight and throws the first punch my husband then gets angry at her partner for putting his hands on her i know a man could floor me easily that is why i know i would never pravoke a man by throwing punches and i would expect that if ive hit him his gonna do the same back i know women being hit by a man is frowned apon but if my mother in law is choosing this life style am i wrong for not feeling the slightest bit of sympathy for her or her situation it just seems to me that people think its ok for a women to hit a man but its not ok for a man to hit a women please share youre thoughts with me on this matter what will you teach your children i totally agree that it is wrong for a man to hit a women unless provoked i e she hitting him first and its kinda funny cause i'm in the same situation my mother in law stays with her boyfriend who beats her and then my husband wants to kill him when he hears of the newest abuse and most of the time its her who starts it there have been times when my husband has gone over there to correct the problem with his mom's b f and she would end up getting mad at my husband for hurting her b f i have also been raised that if you are gonna hit like a man a female hitting a man first then you deserve to get hit like a man i am yrs old i am ' and weigh lbs and my husband is ' and lbs so i know he could take me out with one punch that is why i do not provoke it and he has never laid a hand on me because there is no reason to but as for his mom i feel absolutely no sympathy for her because she is the one who starts it most of the time and even when she doesn't she throws her sob story about her getting beat up to everyone and then an hour later she is on the phone with her dude telling him she loves him and goes home to him the next day so as for your mother in law and mine they love the drama and that is why they do it just to get attention when they want it and get the adrenaline rush because of the drama they have created and honestly i say they get what they deserve if they are dumb enough to stay with an abusive partner than they are dumb enough to get their ass kicked again and again harsh but true also i will teach my daughters the same thing even tho i know it will piss me off if a man puts his hands on my daughters even if they did start it but if they are gonna hit like men then they deserve to be hit back do not provoke a man to hit you because there will always be someone stronger than you and if you man at the time is that person then you do not want to provoke him to hit you also i will teach my daughters that unless provoked such as my girls throwing the first punch it is never ok for a man to put his hands on them for any reason other than what i said above and even some circumstances of the above stated reason are not acceptable and if they are getting beat up for no reason by a man they need to leave and then call the police right away so the matter can be dealt with cause i will kill the first asshole to lay his hands on either of my daughters for no reason  EastEnders Domestic violence Theory of conduct True Crime: Streets of LA The Marshall Mathers LP Sin City Similarities between the

why are ghetto teen mothers so proud of their situation i don't hate them necessarily and some do raise their kids right but there were so many ghetto all races pregnant girls at my school that were so proud of what happened even when their boyfriends drop out of school and get jobs in construction or some other dead end job they think they have instantly become responsible adults and they prize and envy that position that's an unfair generalization but i myself am intimately familiar with that throw in a divorce the consequences of child support meaning the father has to provide for two households and that is when the 'ghetto' element really comes into play  Springfield Elementary School The O.C.

why do parents get mad when kids get lice my aunt is a nurse and when she tells the parents that they're kids have lice they get mad at the kids it's not their fault so why get mad i have never understood this myself i think it has to do with parents being embarrassed and ashamed my guess is they think it's some sort of reflection on them like they don't keep their children clean or something i managed to not get lice when i was a kid but a lot of that has to do with the fact that we didn't live in the us and i went to expensive private schools had i gone to public schools especially when i was really young i would most likely have gotten it my cousins got it twice both times my younger cousin brought it home from school it's such a natural normal thing for kids to get i don't see what all the fuss is about yes you have to do a lot of cleaning and not just of your kid's head but it isn't their fault i know one of the times my cousin got it every single kid in her classroom had it as well and they spread it to kids on the playground so the school had everyone stay home for three days until stuff at the school could be cleaned up the thing i remember most though is that my aunt was absolutely mortified it was like my cousin who was all of about six the first time had gone and hung out with homeless people or something and brought it home just to shame my aunt i remember my mom talking to her about it later and telling her it wasn't a big deal and since the whole school had to deal with it no one was going to worry about pointing fingers i also remember that my aunt got really indignant with my mom and said that was all fine and dandy my mom didn't have to deal with a kid with lice did she little kids share germs too so getting mad at a kid for catching lice is like getting mad at them for catching a cold or the flu both are equally useless parents need to get a grip treat the kid and just move on  EastEnders Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha Little Britain Empire Burlesque Rugrats AFI 100 Years series Rich Mullins Codename: Kids Next Door Infantilism She Loves You Recess (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Hey Arnold!

any good ideals on how to get a year old boy and his year old sister get along they will get along good for short periods but fight most of the time they tattle constantly and if i try to get them to work it out on their own it turns violent to top it off they have a year old brother who loves to copy big brother and sister help there were kids in my family but we were not as lucky as my kids and had to take care of each other there were a few fights but we usually got along i have been where you are sometimes it gets hard to bear on your nerves but the best thing i found out was to get them time to do things alone or put them in separate rooms and before you know it they will be wanting to involve the other in what ever they are doing and that means getting along this is normal for siblings so if nothing else take time for yourself before starting a whole new day of some of the same old thing  About a Boy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kimi Finster Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy Family The Catcher in the Rye Kylie Minogue Silent Night, Deadly Night Care Bears Boy Meets World Philip J.

would you leave your three year old to babysit younger sister and brother while you go and have fun i was disgussted to learn that madeleines mother and father left madeleine alone with their other children whom are younger then madeleine yet they expected madeleine to baby sit if they wake up i just like to know how many parents are actually willing to leave a three year old alone let alone leave three year old in charge of younger sister and brothers i was in the park yesterday with our six year old and three year old i was amazed to see how much all mums and dads were alert about their childrens where abouts although the children were playing within the covered grounds of the park yet due to recent events most people felt that may be they are not doing enough to protect their children although whatever has happened to madeleine is not other peoples fault most people we met were just as amazed to hear that parents have left three year old madeleine alone i thought i must be the only feeling strange however it does bring questions why did they left her alone no i would not leave my year alone let alone to babysit my younger children best of all i would not leave my year old to baby sit my three year old i think this story about maddy has gone too far yes we feel bad that she is gone missing but its also irresponsible of her parents to leave her the way they did it might have been wise to get a child minder or a baby sitter to do the job at least you know they are safe you save few quids but you lose a daughter that is sad but i dont think its wise for the rest of us to sit on the bench and feel unsafe this world is not a totally bad place i take our children to the park yes i keep an eye on them but i did notice some people smother their children due to what has happenend its no body's fault but their own live and let live enjoy life while you can and be safe  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours About a Boy Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Kyle Broflovski Charmed Garfield Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Rais massacre The Shining (film) The Lovely Bones Night (book) Everwood Melanie Wilkes Romulus and Remus Infantilism Father's Day (Doctor Who) Knots Landing General Protection Fault (comic) Darth Vader Wolfrider Angel Sanctuary The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Line of succession to the British Throne Pip (South Park episode) Miss Saigon Hollyoaks Dead Like Me The Family from One End Street W.I.T.C.H.

if you were a parent looking for a childcare provider what characteristics would you look for in a provider i used to work in a daycare so this is what i would look for that the center was accredited by the state workers were certified required background and drug tests i would do research to see if anything bad had happened there in the past also make sure there are fire extinguishers and smoke alarms visible caregivers were required to be cpr and first aid certified and that the facilitys were big enough and sanitary and to make sure that the adult child ratio is being monitored and followed according to state or federal guidelines but i don't trust anyone thats why my kids don't go to daycare or stay with anyone other than me and my husband  Day care Nurse Childcare Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Dissociative identity disorder Child support Fire extinguisher Transsexuality Infantilism Emergency medical technician Drug test Education in the People's Republic of China Community emergency response team Certified first responder Social work Organic farming Antiretroviral drug School accreditation ISO 9000 Paramedic Myocardial infarction Organic certification Kindergarten Education in the United States Lifeguard Animal testing Fire fighting Tobacco smoking Censorship in Australia Playground First aid Dietitian Data center Microsoft Carbon dioxide Food and Drug Administration Certified Nursing Assistant Social Security (United States) Health insurance Asthma School bus Charter school Smoke detector Fathers' rights Medicine Fire alarm control panel Glossary of firefighting terms Laura Schlessinger Air safety Firefighter School choice Attachment parenting E85 Boarding school Transactional analysis Emergency Medical Services Cytomegalovirus Drowning American Red Cross Glossary of wildland fire terms Leukemia Ambulance Attorney at Law Medical Assistant Daylight saving time GED Pharmaceutical company Ben Johnson (athlete) Duesberg hypothesis American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Corporate governance United States Postal Service Television rating system Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Nursing home Medicare (Canada) Polyamory Divorce Division of labour Prostate cancer Nurse anesthetist Naval Station Norfolk National Weather Service Whitney Houston Homeschooling Accountancy Sesame Street Advanced cardiac life support Certification The Fairly OddParents Chernobyl accident Cancer Prohibition (drugs) Child King City, Ontario Education in Australia

i am in a really bad situation here please read the question i would love answers following my other question i posted earlier about taking my year old sister who i am in the process or adopting to my mom's house and her asking to come home and throwing a tantrum she wrote me a letter a while ago in big letters and on the page she wrote please please please don't take me back there any more i hate it x x x with a little drawing at the bottom of the page obviously i know not take take her back so please don't just state the obvious and i have already talked her but she wouldn't talk to me much so my question is does anyone who have slightly older kids late pre teen early teen have any tips on getting them to talk about their feelings because i tried to talk to her and she didn't really talk much so after about minuets i just said i loved her and she didn't have to go any more and let her go back to playing on her computer i know you mean well but for the time being don't try to force your sister to talk to you let her come to you obviously she needs to be in counseling too i haven't read the other question yet but just don't make her talk when and if she gets ready to talk to you she will hope this helps okay i've read your other questions about your sister quit taking her to your parents' house now there is obviously something going on there no more if you are taking on the responsibility of your sister you need to start looking out for her and that includes keeping her away from that house period until you know that it's fine which i don't think you ever will i repeat she needs to get into some professional counseling and as for rewarding her for her good behavior i agree with the best answer give her your time she obviously has not had someone positive give her their time if your mom smacked her around don't buy her 'stuff' that doesn't mean anything and will give her the wrong message give her your time and make sure you let her know that she's important to you and that you are looking out for her know what a mess i'll be thinking of and praying for you guys good luck  Friends Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Cindy Sheehan Kodocha Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Singlish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an My Life as a Teenage Robot Poker jargon Pitaten Time Out of Mind Charmed Milton H.

if people have children shouldn't they educate themselves about child development i'm now sitting in a computer lab at a college there is a single mother here with her son who is almost and is now cranky he keeps crying and she keeps telling him to shut up and that people are trying to work here i can't help but think that if she knew anything about child development at all she would realize that his behavior is normal and that it's pointless to tell him to behave differently what are your thoughts nadadime i'm not putting down single parents in fact i was raised by a single mother and i still have a great deal of respect for her i reckon people should have to go through a course on parenting before they have children it makes my stomach churn to see most of the parenting i see but then i think most people should have to go through a course on growing up before they marry too it's much more important than most of what we learn at school  Controversies in autism About a Boy Friends Shaggy dog story Autism Economic inequality Milton H.

what your view on working vs stay home mothers i have an month old baby and am not currently working so i can care for him i did go back to work part time when he was months old but struggled so badly with childcare i have no family nearby to care for him and couldn't afford the childcare plus hated leaving him with someone else that i gave up months later i love being at home with him but i know i won't be able to do it forever my partner is a low wage earner and we are struggling on just his salary it would be great to work from home but i don't have any skill that would make that feasible and my house is not suitable for me to be a childminder i feel guilty at staying home and not working as it means we struggle for money and can't give him all i'd like to but then i'd feel guilty if i went to work and left him with someone else all day whats your view is it best for a mother to stay home even if it means the family purse strings being tight or work and bring in extra cash missbeans i'm in the uk i have got a degree but it has never helped me get a job like many brits and i've had to work in callcentres alongside loads of other graduates i'm thinking of going back to college to re skill as my degree is not helping me but don't know what course to do obviously we know minimum wage is not going to be liveable for the rest of our lives and my partner wants to retrain but is finding it very hard to find funding because there isn't much in the uk for adult re training bringmesunshine sorry you don't like my views on immigration which i have a right to hold in a free country however that has nothing to do with this question so i'd ask you to keep your childish playground jobs to yourself it is tough now because not many people earn enough to be able to live on one salary alone certainly not in greater london where i live i'm still not sure what i will be doing once my baby is born my maternity leave ends i know that i wont want to leave him with a stranger but i'm not sure that we will cope on just my boyfriends salary i think i will most likely try to work part time but hours that will work around my boyfriends so that i can leave the baby with him there are jobs that you can do this with they wont be the most glamorous or challenging of work but it will bring in some extra money things like cleaning working in a supermarket even if its only a few hours in the evening every little helps jobs with shift work can also be useful to look at too i've yet to see a work from home opportunity that hasn't been a scam so be wary of anything like that as your baby gets older you can maybe look at working days in a week he can go to a nursery spend time around other kids his age you will be able to bring some more money in places like doctors surgeries schools are good to look at as they tend to employ people part time councils are also good as they consider job sharing some even have a creche so your son wouldn't be too far away from you try not to worry too much about it if you look hard enough you will find something that suits you as long as you are able to pay your mortgage or rent bills can afford to buy food you will be ok don't worry about the so called luxuries of holidays etc your baby is too little to be concerned about these things yet good luck  Economic inequality Unemployment Knots Landing Kodocha Day care EastEnders Minimum wage Education in the People's Republic of China Poker jargon Division of labour Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Graduate school Humphrey Bogart London mayoral election, 2004 Publicly funded medicine Avenue Q Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jon Secada Days of our Lives Progressive tax Medicare (Canada) Wal-Mart Great Depression Professor Infantilism Anarchism and capitalism One Tree Hill (TV series) Rosa Parks Flat tax Freeters Charles Ponzi Satchel Paige Microeconomics Friends Care Bears Working time Gross domestic product Rent (musical) Education in Germany 1957 World Series Taxation in the United States Capitalism Offshoring Vladimir Peter Tytla Warren Buffett About a Boy Unemployment benefit Kibbutz Health insurance Shaggy dog story $ale of the Century Deflation (economics) Labour economics Labor theory of value Honey and Clover Culture of the United States The Family from One End Street National Kidney Foundation Singapore Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salary Leeds United F.C.

how do we discipline our kids i have lil girls yrs old and the other one is yr old sometimes i have a hard time reprimanding them coz they won't listen they frequently fight w each other and the usual reason is they fight over for a toy or even our attention pls give me some good advise and year olds have a hard time sharing anything they haven't developed the ability to understand taking turns i don't think it as much about reprimanding as it is about teaching them how you expect them to behave it means alot of time on the floor with them showing them how explain what you want them to do clearly e i i know you want to play with the toy your sister has when she is done you can have a turn make sure that the person waiting for the toy has a turn soon after that e i your sister has been waiting to play with the toy let's let her have a turn and you can play with i use a naughty chair with my year old if he is out of control and won't listen i sit him in the chair and tell him what he is there for throwing his juice cup hitting biting ect i tell him he needs to sit for two minutes and set the timer on the microwave if he gets up before the two minutes are done almost a given i put him back in the chair after the timer goes off i tell him again what he is in the chair for and ask him to apologize for his behavior when i first started having him apologize for his behavior my husband thought i was nuts but now he will say sorry for throwing juice mommy so he is getting it at some level i also make sure i praise him alot when he is doing something that we have asked him to do he is responding well and alot of the behaviors that were driving us crazy are getting better as for the attention issue we have kids that never goes away our year old still fights as much as the year old to get our attention we try really hard to make sure that they all get at least an hour a week by themselves with one of us to do something they want to do or just to talk it's alot of work but it is also alot of fun  Milton H.

my daughter got kicked out from a private sitter that is how bad she was i don't know what to do she is turning on sunday for the past few weeks she has been acting really bad not listening bad mouthing talking back you name it we have grounded her stuck her in the corner taken away her toys everything last night the baby sitter gave me the money back from the rest of the week said she can't come back i spanked my daughter stuck her in the corner and made her go to bed early she promised to be good and promised i told her i didn't believe her i told her she will get nothing for her birthday she continued to say she would be good grandma wanted to take her to the lake this weekend i told her if she was good for the new baby sitter which is at my house today then i might let her go she is being horrible she cursed locked herself out of her room so she didn't have to get back in it and i don't know what to do what am i doing wrong why is she like this how can i make her behave what can i do i am single but she has an active father and my live in boyfriend years i am consenstant and do reward good behavior but i don't know what else to do this sounds bad but i am looking into a boarding school also i have two kids my oldest is i raise my children the same they are in the same situation and i have never had a problem with my oldest first of all i am not criticizing or judging i am going to speak from experience and address it from an overall point of view if i say you i am actually meaning people in general i just dont want you to take it the wrong way but it seems as though her punishments have not been consistant this is where most of us go wrong you have to keep to your word of what you say you are going to do or not do do not break it for any reason what so ever or she will call your bluff she will push you as far as she can you will have to use spankings along with other forms of punishment with her until she starts getting used to the consequences of her actions tell her what she has done wrong and tell her why it is wrong then explain to her that you have to punish her so that she will learn how to behave and respect people you can even use her feelings against her if she will allow you some do not care though tell her that others do not like kids who misbehave and are bad and she will not make friends to play with if she keeps doing this she is old enough to understand it explain to her that you do not like the way she acts and you will not have much to do with her until she learns to be nice and do as you say she is likely doing it for attention for part of it and just for spite for the other also let her know that things are going to change around the house tell her when she does good then she will get rewarded for it give her simple chores to do around the house as well to help keep her busy doing something instead of getting into things try not to yell or let her see you get mad you are going to have to show her tough love for a while until she gets better and you will feel like you are being cruel at times but you are actually helping her and making her understand how to treat people and how to act in social situations do not let her get away with one thing until she starts to improve by a great deal every single time she does something wrong punish her as you see fit when talking back to you or other adults and things like those those are major things and call for a spanking and punishing together since she has not had to be done like this before it is going to make it harder on you trust me i know first hand i took it drastically and if i even had to tell them more than one time then they got a spanking or something they really liked taken away within one month of me standing my ground and not letting them by with the tiniest thing they are now the best kids you could ask for everything is yes mam no mam yes sir no sir thank you please excuse me and are the very polite and honest they get into major trouble for disrespecting adults in any way and for lieing i would cry myself to sleep bc i thought they would hate me for it and bc i thought i was being too hard on them after that month i have had to get onto them about times total and that was months ago they clean their rooms and do small chores they do as i ask when i ask and the best of all we are closer now than we have ever been mine are and they have actually thanked me for punishing them bc they did not want to be bad it is definitely worth it in the long run i promise i also got them into church and they get to do what they want when they want now i can trust them so much more and they respect me more than ever good luck and god bless also you will get discouraged and you will be ready to throw your hands up keep reminding yourself that this is for your daughters benefit as well as yours and it has to be done do not let things go bc you are so overwhelmed and so tired of it this will be a major set back and will make things worse keep your head up and suffer through it with your daughter i promise it is worth it i am sorry i wrote so much but i have been where you are and know how tough it is let me

daughter having problems with her friend afterchool situation my daughter has had this ongoing problem with this girl for the last two years there are three girls my daughter is close with one used to be with the other but not anymore the other girl is close with her basically the three of then can't hang out together because the one girl had had serious issues with it the problem is my daughter always gets the bad end of it the ignoring the talking about etc she goes and has been going for two years to the one girls' house afterschool because i work well for the last three weeks she is ignoring my daughter's phone calls emails im's it used to be like a day she is now with the other girl all the time she has maybe once or twice wrote hi but then ignore my daughter when she writes back i don't know what to do about afterschool now do i send her somewhere else do i say something to the mom i hate to get in her business but hate to see her so hurt any advice i think you need to say something to the other girl's mother only because that is where your daughter goes after school if she does not know about a negative and hurtful situation that her daughter is involved in she can't help mediate i think that if this is going on in her home then she should know but if it were only at school you have to let the girls work things out on their own it sounds like the one girl has some serious issues but she is a girl and unfortunately girls arent taught to get a long together but to compete and be hurtful i know how your daughter feels i had similar issues years ago when i was in school if your daughter wants to consider looking at other after school options tell her before you mention anything to anyone depending on how old she is that may be more traumatic than the experience itself hopefully her old friend will realize what she is doing but if she doesnt then you need to encourage your daughter to get involved with other kids and activities  Kodocha Ranma __ characters The Fairly OddParents Traumatic incident reduction Plame affair About a Boy Boston Public Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Charmed Kim Possible Scenes from a Memory Saved by the Bell The Shining (film) Anne Rice The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Transactional analysis Cindy Sheehan Avenue Q Dilbert Ron and Fez The Inside Laura Schlessinger Pok__mon Live!

why do parents let their children scream in public i see people who let their kids scream at the top of their lungs in public places hit the parents curse at their parents tell their parents what to do etc i really want to know who taught you parents to let your children run all over you i'm sorry when i was a child this was not tolerated and if i attempted to do some of these things i would have had a sore rear end from having my behind spanked some people say this is not a good form of punishment but i tell you what i knew my place growing up and i knew they're were serious consequnces to bad behavior in my house and to this day i have not been in trouble i see parents trying to do the time out and just telling them don't do that form of punishment and i have yet to see that improve their childrens behavior i think that if some of you parents learned to take control of your children like they use to years ago your children might learn a little respect for you as well as stay out of trouble because a lot of parents out there are to scared to discipline their kids because of the nosy a other mother's out there that think that a swat on the butt is child abuse and go running to report it or they like to gasp and give the how dare you hit your child look thank goodness in texas it is legal yes legal to physically discipline your child i by no means believe in beating a child but a smack when the situation calls for it is okay with me to many moms want to be more lovey dovey with their kids but hey my generation we all got spankings and we turned out fine obviously all this time out crap isn't working because look at all the young hooligans out there i so agree with you parents stop spoiling your kids and learn to discipline them time out just isn't working now watch how much criticism i will get for that saying that i must not be a mom yes i have two kids a yr old and a month old so i do know how it goes when kids have meltdowns but screaming at the top off your lungs because they didn't get a toy or whatever it was they wanted isn't having a meltdown it is called a spoiled child that is used to getting what they want to shut them up  Spanking Corporal punishment The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Baby Blues Infantilism Punishment EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten James Dobson Child Bart chalkboard gags Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Inside Rocko's Modern Life Codename: Kids Next Door Child abuse Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Great Teacher Onizuka Buttocks Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Malcolm in the Middle Milton H.

pregnant with nd child how do we tell his parents i am a year old mother of a year old son my son's father is horrible he sees him occasionally but doesn't do absolutely anything for him my boyfriend and i have been dating for the better part of a year now he has been a tremendous help with my son we are planning on getting married within the next years he is and still lives at home with his parents who seem to like me a lot until he graduates with his bs in accounting in may we just found out that i am pregnant and have decided to have the child he is worried about when to tell his parents and how he is afraid that he will be letting them down to a certain degree i know that everything is going to be ok and i let him know that he is just not sure when to tell them i think we should tell them asap p s we are happy and the fact that i am pregnant is not the issue for those of you who feel the need to comment on such things your honest yet intelligent and considerate answers are appreciated wow some of u are cruel don't make this out to be a bad situation because it is not i know what to do i just asked you all so that he could see that i know what i'm talking about secondly he is definitely not a loser he is on his way last time i checked a loser is someone who had no direction and didn't even try i already have a career in real estate belive me i take care of home as i mentioned before the fact that i am pregnant is not the issue at hand it's what's the right and respectful way to inform his parents think of the big picture it's his life not his parents sometimes children don't come into our lives on a planned schedule but it doesn't mean they are shameful as some people would think the taboo of children out of wed lock isn't really a big deal anymore in our generation i understand his concern for his parents' feelings and i think that s very thoughtful of him but at years old he is a grown man and should not hide something that is so important he should tell his parents about the news the sooner the better since they are helping him with school and living expenses i feel they have the right to know what's going on that doesn't give them a right to demand their personal beliefs onto you or him but a baby will be better received if not hidden from your description he sounds like a wonderful and mature guy he is also shown experience with being a good father with your son when he tells them about the new baby have him prepare what he is going to say to them including what the plan is how does he plan to support his new family does he plan a marriage soon where will the baby live who will take care of the baby how will he finish school with a baby to take care of hey even write down your plan to present to them a plan will reassure his parents that he is ready to be a good parent these are probably questions that they would be thinking about it would also be a good time to ask his parents if they are willing to help out but make it clear that they are not expected to tell them that you too are very much in love are happy together and do plan to marry also make it clear that you value them and would love to have them part of your baby's life if the baby will be their first grand child it will be hard to swallow even under the best conditions i still remember the shocked look of my father's face when i revealed my first pregnancy i was married at the time i came to visit them after a medical appointment he had asked what the appointment was for i simply replied a pregnancy test period gave him a few minutes to collect his thoughts because i think he probably stopped breathing for a few seconds as for your first son you should fight for child's support if you haven't already  Friends EastEnders Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Kodocha God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Pregnancy Adoption Shaggy dog story About a Boy Pitaten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q The Smoking Room Goodness and value theory Social rule Infantilism Futurama (TV series - season 5) The nature of God in Western theology Pok__mon Live!

how do we know that sex was meant for over s only there are lots of laws against underage sex i'm not a paedofile or pervert i'm just curious back in the dinosaur times were year olds etc forbidden from having sex and in the victorian era around that time teen parents have existed as long as humans have why is there such a bad perseption of them now maybe if people didn't have such low expectations of them then some of them might not be so reckless and stuff there are so many teen parents that don't get the support and help that they need and most of them are decent kids with good heads on there shoulders even if they didn't expect to have a child so early in life centuries ago the average life span was only about to years if girls didn't start having babies in their teen years they might not be able to raise the children they did have also life was much simpler then there weren't many professions mostly farming or trade your life wasn't as full of possibility as it is today now if a young person has a baby too soon it can be a real tragedy they might not ever be able to get the education and training they need to get a good job much less fulfill their dreams also adolescence isn't what it used to be teenagers might know more at an earlier age than a few generations ago but they are much less mature most aren't capable of raising a baby or making decisions about when they are ready to have sex or when they are merely buckling under to peer pressure the bottom line is that sex was intended for procreation women on birth control get pregnant all the time so if you aren't able to handle that possible consequence you shouldn't have sex  Age of consent Child sexuality Adolescence Abortion debate Teenage pregnancy Infantilism Sex education One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Child Child pornography History of sex Motion picture rating system Theory of conduct Marriage Little Britain Sexual abstinence Humphrey Bogart Same-sex marriage Shaggy dog story Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pregnancy Friends Dawson's Creek Empire Burlesque Pedophilia The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Reproduction Kender Human sexual behavior Puberty Gender role Life expectancy Ephebophilia Hikikomori Generation X Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Social rule Kodocha Polyamory Baby Blues Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Stewie Griffin Britney Spears Generation Y Titans (comics) Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye Mothers Against Drunk Driving Video game controversy Sex and the City Sharon Tate Birth control Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Driver's license Breastfeeding Hollyoaks Identity Crisis (comics) MPAA film rating system Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Murder Sheepshead Jason Voorhees Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Street-Legal Prenatal diagnosis Sex Sex assignment Jon Secada Incest Prostitution Emperor of Japan Pop punk Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Original sin Salic law Rocko's Modern Life Neighbours Domestic rabbit Childfree Consensual crime Boston Public Sexual orientation Plame affair Kimi Finster Order of succession Teen drama Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Jennifer Lopez Charter school

why do so many people answer a question without answering it then give an opinion about something else just one example the question where can i get information about overseas adoption answers you should wait until you're married you should adopt in your own country you should have your own baby why do people do this does it annoy anybody else i don't know you shouldn't eat spaghettio's for breakfast just kidding i think there are a lot of people who don't get the idea that some people are actually looking for legitimate answers on here go figure i have seen quite a few well informed answers quite a few people who researched and educated themselves before forming an opinion and they state their case intelligently and coherently then there are the rubbish questions and many more rubbish answers posted by people who are really only in here because the school semester hasn't started yet and there are the answers that are just people who are inordinately proud of their own opinions without any kind of facts to back them up and then there are the ones who create dummy accounts just to see how many thumbs down and bad reports they can get yes it is incredibly annoying but those of us who are actually looking for facts and or honest opinions just have to lump it and take the good with the bad  Theory of conduct Plame affair Epistemology The nature of God in Western theology Creation-evolution controversy Creationism Shit Teach the Controversy Intelligent design William A.

how long is too long with video games my year old son loves to play video games but i am really torn up with how long is too long my husband and i don't agree all the time when he has been on for what i think is too long he is pretty active outside and does go out everyday and play in the backyard but i have had issues at times when he would rather play the games then go out and argue with me about turning it off for awhile the games he plays are at his level and none of them are violent what do you think minutes a day max your child is not getting anything out of playing those games they are a waste of life time games should be active and be interactive with other people not staring at a television screen children these days are losing their imaginations and tune out when not stimulated in the same manner as video games like at school i think to keep a healthy balance have your son earn video game time and keep it to one or two days a week minutes a piece it just isn't worth it p s do you interact with your son too i'm sure he loves playing and doing things with you o  Theory of conduct Computer role-playing game Video game controversy Jon Secada Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Computer and video games Console game Babylon 5 Meta-reference Drama Anger management Norway national football team EastEnders Shaggy dog story Dorama The Sims GoldenEye 007 BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban $ale of the Century Game development Asperger syndrome Goodness and value theory Game show Surveillance Super Mario Bros.

when is the best time to tell my year old step son that i'm not his real dad his biological dad has never been part of his life i've been in his life since he was months old i don't want to wait too late and take the chance that he'll resent me or his mother but i think he's too young to understand now any advice i should probably elaborate he also has two olders sisters and who are also my step children just letting it go is probably not going to be an option note i am in the process of adopting him it should be complete in the next month or two i think he should lnow as soon as possible i wouldnt want him to find out when he is in his teens and has so many hormones rushing through him that he wants to analize it be hurt that you lied to him all this time and then wonder what he did at that point that you are telling him now he will resent you tell him young when his little mind and heart are open to everything so that it becauses something ordinary and your love and care for him and the attention you give him at this young age will show him step or not you love him i would also advise being as nice as possible about why his real dad hasnt been part of his life give him a nice truthful answer that he can live with when we told my sister when she was that she was adopted she acted like it was no big deal but as the days when on she would ask questions and we would answer when she was in her teens she was in alot of trouble and if we had waited till then to tell her then it would have seemed like we were telling her then cause she was being so bad that we wanted her to know she didnt come from us i think that kids should know as soon as possible so that it feels normal to them and not that you asked but when you tell him you should make him feel that he filled a void in your life that you had till you got him such as all my life i wanted a little boy and when your mommy came into my life with you i was soo happy to finally get to be the daddy i always wanted to be you've made me so happy and proud to be your dad thank you for letting me be pat  Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule Jon Secada Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Bon Jovi Kodocha EastEnders The McGuire Sisters Rocko's Modern Life Friends The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Past teachings of Prem Rawat Situation comedy Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.

i have year old twin boys should they have different nd grade class they have been in same class since preschool this year they've started soccer and i put them on different teams they are still ambiguos about that we haven't had games yet just practice it's a small rural school and there was never an oppourtunity to split them before though i wouldn't have tried untill kicergarten or st grade i think they are both brilliant it's just htat one always has to outshine the other and i think it could hurt them later along with being too dependant on each other kids always see black white chocolate or vanilla boy a or boy b and unfortunatly some teachers do to the school assigned them to the same class without talking to me and my boys saw the letter but i told them nothing was certain yet they liked the idea of sharing again but they share a room at home it just feels like time for them to split a little should i listen to them or my instincts should have been more specific they aren't direct competitors in soccer they practice together and the rest with teams and they are playing lots of different teams in fact i checked and they will probably never play each other if they do they might be sick that day listen to your instinct and listen to their teachers i have twins boys and they were in kindergarten together but have been separated since then they didn't do well the first few weeks in pre school i tried them in separate classes and the teachers suggested i put them together it still took a few months for them to be comfortable without their twin standing next to them in kindergarten i didn't want the same thing to happen since it was going to be a new school so i requested them to be together in the end they were fine the kindergarten teacher told me they were very different learners something i had also noticed at home and suggested the be separated in st grade its been that way ever since i find it hard to not compare them sometimes and i don't want to put that pressure on the teachers also if they look alike it could cause a problem my friend has twins in the same class small private school so no choice their teacher couldn't remember which one did the better job on an oral project and decided to average the grade one of the biggest cons is the homework in st grade one teacher only gave homework over the weekend to be due the next tuesday the other give homework throughout the week it made scheduling a bit difficult another is that one class or teacher may be more fun or offer more class incentives the one that mattered most to my sons birthday parties a lot of families just say invite the boys in your class some don't know or remember that there are twins it's happened a few times where one is invited and not the other i just do something special with the one at home good luck either way make sure the school allows for discussion every year things may change even in between years to make you want to keep them together or separate them  Social rule Shaggy dog story Education in the United States Theory of conduct Education in Romania Education in Germany Grade (education) Kindergarten Education in the People's Republic of China Kodocha Teen Girl Squad Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming Milton H.

would you let your year old son watch the latest harry potter movie my year old daughter a harry potter freak has been dying to see it and so we're going on friday with my hubby and older daughter my only question is do you think it would be appropriate to bring my year old son along or should we let him stay home with a babysitter i am personally a harry potter freak as you put it and my children have seen the first couple of movies and really liked them but after seeing this last movie i refused to let either of mine ages see it there's just too much violence for either one of them the raters of the movies were dead on with putting it as a pg it shouldn't be viewed by anyone younger so to answer your question no don't take your year old and if i were you i would reconsider the year old as well believe me i love the books and movies and if i felt it was appropriate i would let mine see it but it's not it's just too scary for the little folks also if you haven't read the books you should the books become much more sophisticated dangerous dark and violent as they progress therefore any movie after should be viewed with caution  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Motion picture rating system Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sydney Riot of 1879 Theory of conduct Harry Potter (character) Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Young adult literature EastEnders Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Knots Landing MPAA film rating system Minor Hufflepuffs Danger Man The Shining (film) Hogwarts Ron Weasley Sharon Tate Severus Snape Little Britain The Pilgrim's Progress Iron Maiden Trapped in the Closet Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Socrates Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Cindy Sheehan Mary Sue Ginny Weasley Death Eater AFI 100 Years series Blood purity (Harry Potter) Paul Is Dead Bat Boy Minor Ravenclaws Hogwarts subjects J.

parents of boys ok i have a yr old son and yesterday he was playing and he ran into the coffee table and he hit his pee pee he was in so much pain and crying and i could just see the pain in his eyes i started crying cause it hurts me to see my child in pain and my husband was just sitting there like nothing i yelled at my husband cause i would think him being a man that he knows the pain and he did nothing to comfort my son i was angry and hurt is it cause he is a man and he knows the pain and that it will be alright and did i just over react cause i am female and i don't know that pain idk i was just mad and was very sad for my son also what can i do to teach him to be more careful there well i didn't run to comfort him i was sitting on the floor with my daughter when it happened and he just stood there grabbing himslef crying and i started crying cause i could just see the pain in his eyes and my husband did nothing so i called him to come to me and i more like cried at my husband cause it hurt my feelings that he just sat there when i had my daughter in my arms and i thought it was more of a male thing and he should have comforted him sprintwalker totally lost me spiritwalker i mean thanks i see your guys point its just that my son is the love if my life and i hurt when he hurts i am already an emotional person as it is and when my kids are hurt it just hurts i still get sad right now cause i can still see the tears in his eyes and the pain he expressed it kills me he is my first born and my only son i am not this big sucker i am pretty firm and strict with him and i don't bend easily but when it comes to my kids getting hurt i think it hurts me more it's a guy thing and trust me he will be more careful now poor thing you did not overreact you're his mother mother's hurt when their children hurt that is normal im sure your husband wasn't indifferent to your son at all he was probably thinking to himself oh that gonna leave a mark but like most men he just figures that he'd be alright he wasn't bleeding etc i do think yelling at your hubby was a bit much hon and only adds more stress to the situation for your son it's normal that men and women will react differently to situations like that my husband wouldn't have just sat there but i dont think he would have broke down in tears like i would have and have done when my kids get boo boos he probably would have hugged him and said you'll be okay buddy and left it at that it's a father son thing i think cause if my daughter had banged her head or something my husband would have freaked daddy's girl lol guys are weird  EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Piccolo Junior Saga Kodocha Friends The Shining (film) Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Milton H.

should parents be blamed if their child is fat i think the parents are the sole reason for their child being fat unless there is a serious medical issue which is rare of society has glandular problems that would cause weight issue all others just eat too much i hate when parents say my kids won't eat salad all he eats is macaroni are parents that dumb that they don't know that they are the ones buying the macaroni if the child had no option they would eat whatever they had what do you think sufi before we can address the problem we must find out what the problem is and who is a major contributor to the problem if it is the parents then we have to first come to that conclusion before we can help them they must know they are to blame for their child's obesity shannon yes it is my business when my tax dollars are going towards peoples medical bills a lot of these kids are on welfare and get free medical if they ate healthier than we wouldn't be paying out as much yep its me i am a parent i have kids ages and none are overweight although my middle child looks as if though she may have problems if she doesn't watch her diet as an adult i think you are right i have said this all along if the parents were more involved in there children's lives it wouldn't happen if they only bought food that is good for them and didn't give them choices the kids would be better off parents over feed kids as a way to comfort them by not being there for them i grew up with you eat what's put in front of you or don't eat i'm not overweight and neither are my children parents are the only one who can control what their kids eat so wake up parents out there you know who you are and be there for your children stop blaming others and suing for your problems  Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Binge eating disorder Garfield Health insurance Anorexia nervosa Veganism Terri Schiavo Breastfeeding Body mass index Vegetarianism Little Britain Fecal incontinence Healthy eating Prostate cancer Humphrey Bogart Dieting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Divorce About a Boy Hamburger Famine The Fairly OddParents Stomach cancer Kodocha Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence Milk Sesame Street South Park Folic acid The Amazing Race Hillary Rodham Clinton The Critic Abortion debate School choice Adjustable gastric band The Marshall Mathers LP Recurring South Park characters 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rick Santorum Insulin Theory of conduct Cancer 2004 Democratic National Convention Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids Matt Hardy Daria Infantilism Puberty Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hypoglycemia Microeconomics Corporation Low-carbohydrate diet Homer Simpson Economics Bill Cosby Vegeta Hyperglycemia Poker jargon Food Fred Phelps Egg (food) Autism Nutrition Shit Parasite singles Publicly funded medicine Theodicy Transsexuality Video game controversy Eating The Heartbroke Kid Arguments for and against drug prohibition Flat tax Weight loss Coeliac disease Diabetes mellitus Fugu Hamster Discus (fish) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Unemployment Growth hormone treatment Milton H.

at what age should discipline begin and what method s should be used and what should you do for discipline obviously a young toddler is too young to be grounded and a teen too old to be spanked i am very curious to have other's input because there are so many opinions on this subject and i am in the process of doing a very informal local study of the behavior of friends kids who use various discipline techniques and what age they began using them i have had people tell me i am too easy on my youngest months and others tell me i am too hard on her to date the worst punishment she has ever had was a tap on the butt and me yelling no when she tried to bolt into the street after discovering how to unlatch the gate but no gets used a lot in this home and that's a no no bad for baby so she gets that it's bad or can hurt her i have no qualms about tapping that diaper but i save it for the real serious stuff so it retains it's shock value the bible says from infancy it also speaks of knowing your children because each is different my year old can just get a look from me and she straightens up but my year old is one that responds to spankings or the threat of one my year old needs to be talked too and occasionally tapped on the rear but like you said not often so the shock value is there  Spanking Infantilism Erotic spanking Kimberly-Clark Corporation Buttocks Beavis and Butt-head Parenting Stewie Griffin Teen Girl Squad Corporal punishment Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Child Ron and Fez Rich Mullins Child abuse Paddle (spanking) Boston Public Ageplay Breastfeeding Plame affair Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Rocko's Modern Life Science Child sexuality Child time-out Codename: Kids Next Door Recurring South Park characters Hazing The Sims 2 Second language acquisition Jennifer Lopez Opie and Anthony Computer science Milton H.

would you take it personally if another mother didn't let their child play at your backyard i don't let my year old play in anyone's yard until i met the parents well i met this neighbor a couple of times briefly she turned out to be my neighbor and so she had my children and i over for an afternoon and supper we had a nice time getting to know each other and the kids played for hours awhile later i invited their daughter to play in the backyard with my daughter and her friend who was over for a sleepover the mother said she was uncomfortable for her daughter to have a sleepover here i explained that i was only inviting her daughter to play in the backyard she said she will wait and come over with her daughter sometime but her daughter wouldn't come alone should i take this personally she has been in my house before briefly i am single so she has met my whole family and she is across the street from me and a few houses down maybe she is just overprotective her daughter is and can't go to the park across the street and is in bed by she is very chistian and i set a guideline for our friendship that she shouldn't try to convert me because i have my own beliefs this was in answer to her questions so i didn't say it rudely i was just answering questions and i dont' think much of the christian beliefs so maybe she is worried for her daughter's soul or something because i dont' share her beliefs maybe i know some christians think like that anyway not all i wouldn't take it personally i don't let my kids out of our yard all the neighborhood kids come to our yard and play with them some of these kids are in nd rd grade and are gone for hours and their parents have no clue who they are with or where i can't imagine we recently had a year old girl raped by a year old boys who lived in the neighborhood and played with each other often i honestly don't trust other parents to watch my children as well as i do as a christian myself i can understand her limiting her daughters time with those that don't share her beliefs when i'm outside with my kids and other kids come around i have to warn them about bad language obscene jokes etc if they do it again after being warned they are out of my yard if i weren't out there with them though my kids would be barraged with it i'm not saying your daughter would be this way at all just perhaps giving you some insight on how she might think if you want a friendship between your daughters you may want to have her and her daughter over for dinner let her get to know you better then perhaps she'll feel more comfortable letting her daughter out of her sight for a little while she has to be comfortable with your parenting before she will trust her child in your care the only way for her to know is to see it so have her over sometime hope it all works out  Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Lovely Bones 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story The Jeffersons (South Park) Milton H.

i just found porn on my yr old boys computer is this normal what do i say to him perfectly normal for heterosexual teenage males what can you do well you have two options if his dad is a positive part of his life you can discuss it with him and ask him if he could talk to your son about how this is a normal part of growing up but have the talk with him about how women should be treated and how pornography tends to demean and or demoralize women you could have that same talk with him whatever you do don't put him down don't degrade him don't make him feel foolish or like he's doing something disgusting let him know that it is normal but you want him to know that women are more than sexual objects for men's desire and while it is nice to look at these women in porn there is a certain way a real man treats a woman which is not in a degrading way i think as long as he has positive male role models in his life he will learn how to treat women i know that as a mom you tend to lean towards wanting him to stop looking altogether and you may even have negative aspects on porn but if you raise him with the knowledge of how to appropriately treat women the porn will just be a sexual outlet and it won't be how he sees he can treat women  Pornography Pornographic actor Sexual orientation Child pornography Pornographic movie Infantilism Homophobia Child sexuality Transsexuality Shaggy dog story Homosexuality and transgender Little Britain Male prostitute Prostate cancer Homosexuality and Christianity Gender role Sinfest Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bondage (BDSM) Zoophilia Friends Brian Griffin John Holmes (actor) Hentai Effeminacy Age of consent Domestic violence Strap-on dildo Androgen insensitivity syndrome Laura Schlessinger Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sexism Group sex Biology and sexual orientation Serial killer Motion picture rating system One Tree Hill (TV series) History of intersex surgery Slash fiction Theory of conduct Gay pornography Bish__jo game Sexual abstinence Polyamory Sigmund Freud History of sex Transgender Pornography in Japan Boogie Nights Gay slang BDSM Masturbation Sexual fetishism Homosexuality Oral sex Rain Man Sexual intercourse Germaine Greer Cross-dressing Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Sexual revolution Ion Davidov Physical attractiveness Feminism Microeconomics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pedophilia Daredevil Feminist movement The Inside Pederasty Andrea Dworkin Intelligence quotient Nudity Sex Rape Gaze Motivation Socrates Social rule Human sexuality Humphrey Bogart W.I.T.C.H.

preschooler having problems with transitions my child starts kindergarten in sept and we having a huge problem with transitions when something ends someone leaves something changes he gets really upset sometimes he'll scream other times he'll cry incessantly we've tried forewarning him with min notices and so on we've tried coaching him with statements like come on we've got other stuff to do we've also tried admonishments and ridicule out of desparation does anyone have any ideas on how we can teach him to accept change i would suggest a thorough eval by your pediatrician and asking for an eval from a either a devlopmental pediatrician or a child psychologist psychiatrist the level of anxiety and transition issues you describe could point to other issues that until they are known and worked with will leave you without a clear idea on how to help it sounds like you have tried a lot of the things that i would recommend minute warnings reminders of what to do next etc and i can understand feeling desperate enough to end up trying punishment and teasing a lthough as you have found they generally do little to make things better and at times can make things worse so what to do my first question would be to ask how your child does with a set schedule if things go as they do on a daily basis does he do better if he does then the key is to work school into that schedule and that will mean following the same schedule as much as possible all the time weekends and school holidays as well at least for now if he must get up at for school than do it every day do breakfast brush teeth and get dressed since he won't go to school on weekends have something for him to do those days watch cartoons for an hour work on a small project tile lunch a trip to the park etc make a picture schedule and post it and go over the coming day every night before bed and every morning when he gets up it a major change is coming a doctor appointment going to visit grandma put it on the schedule at least a week in advance and every time you go over his daily schedule remind him that the change is coming remember instead of going to baseball on thursday we'll be meeting grandma for dinner at denny's the key with kids with transition issues is to make as few of them a surprise as possible use a timer to mark how long he can watch tv how long until it is time to leave for school everything it may help him know what is coming of course there will be last minute changes be prepared for what you know is coming if possible have someone there with you to help with the child while you deal with the issue they can sit in the car and read or play while you make that last minute stop at the post office if you can't find an extra set of hands try to have something special for him to play with at just such these times hand held video games can be a good one keep it tucked away to be used when something happens unexpectedly and you need your child's compliance school will take some work even before classes start you should inform the teacher and administration of this issue and request a formal evaluation to see if your child will qualify for an iep or do not wait to see what the doctor says school do not accept findings from private practioners as proof of the need for an iep or and would test him anyway get the process going now if he qualifies the iep or will help set up accomodations and stuctures to help your child in school this could be important if his tantrums cause major disruptions in the class or if he begins to throw items or strike out this is not going to be an easy fix it will take a lot of effort and trying different solutions to find the one that is right for your child use whatever services and professionals you can it may take the first few months of school to get a feel for what is going on but i have no doubt this is somenthing that can be dealt with once youhave a better idea of what is going on  Transsexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Special education EastEnders Education in the People's Republic of China Shaggy dog story GED Education in the United States Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sydney Riot of 1879 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Romania About a Boy National Football League 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education in Japan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Graduate school Milton H.

how much should i get paid each hour to babysit it depends where you live if you live in a larger city more likely you'll be paid more for child i'd generally say anywhere from an hour depending on the needs and age of the child also if you've had any training i e taken any cpr classes or babysitting classes or if you're babysitting from your own home and also your age and experience is taken into account each additional child will probably only be more than what you'd be paid for just one again you have to factor in the age of the children for example twin babies would be much more work than a and year old child i'm assuming you are talking about babysitting only occassionally if this were a regular thing like babysitting everyday for the same people or something like a daycare situation then a salary would have to be negotiated with the parents generally it's a good idea to have an idea of what you'd like to be paid going into it but give the parents a range in price ultimately they will pay you what they feel is the correct amount if you ask for too much then it's likely you won't be asked to babysit again  Day care Economic inequality Supply and demand Capital accumulation Education in the United States Health insurance Law of value Insurance Microeconomics Progressive tax Graduate school Member of the European Parliament Theory of conduct Anarchism and capitalism Childbirth Labor theory of value Salary Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product Kindergarten Inflation The nature of God in Western theology Professor Surplus value Education in the People's Republic of China Salary cap Canadian Pacific Railway Education Goodness and value theory Wheel of Fortune National Kidney Foundation Singapore Productive and unproductive labour Mutual fund Tax Calvin and Hobbes Contract Education in Romania Large numbers Scientology beliefs and practices Annuity Everwood Taxation in the United States Efficiency wages RuneScape Education in Japan Adoption Labour economics Public transport Working class Flat tax Bureaucracy Price discrimination Dog agility National Insurance Hollywood Squares Mixed martial arts Publicly funded medicine Drowning Breastfeeding Minimum wage Drama Blackjack Infantilism Intelligence quotient Transformation problem Hearing impairment Sant Thakar Singh Bond Social rule Social psychology Education in Australia Super Mario Bros. television series Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Credit card Milton H.

year old daughter likes self stimulation my five year old daughter has found well herself i've always planned on raising her to be sexually healthy and read all the books about talking about anatomy correctly not calling it your teetee or nunu or anything like that and i know that in theory that means that i should not put negative connotation on her self exploration i do not however know how to start the conversation i was prepared for a little bit older than this has any one addressed this with your child what worked i'm more worried about the why questions that will come from it than anything she is perfectly normal my year old has discovered herself as well she doesn't see it as a sexual thing so you don't have to worry about having a full blown sex talk yet just keep it simple i do not discourage it but i do tell her that it is something that she does in the privacy of her bedroom and not in public so that she understands that it is by no means a bad thing and that this is a special part of the body that is just for her and touching should be done at home it would also be appropriate to add that no one else should ever touch it except a doctor or a parent who is bathing them hope i helped and please ignore the people who are trying to tell you that she has been molested there is absolutely no correlation between innocent exploration and sexual abuse  Infantilism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Abortion debate Incest Childlove movement Prostate cancer Social rule Human sexual behavior Sexual abuse Child sexual abuse Dissociative identity disorder Rick Santorum Extreme Programming Anne Rice Philosophy of language Reparative therapy Phoebe Halliwell Nudity Justification (theology) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Computer numbering formats Dead Like Me EastEnders Goodness and value theory Gay Motion picture rating system Transactional analysis Economic inequality Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal The Human Stain Motivation Avenue Q Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Rape Breastfeeding Singlish Sento Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Video game controversy Masters and Johnson Richard Feynman Philosophical skepticism Plame affair Mary Wollstonecraft Domestic violence Milton H.

should children be pushed to succeed early on i have read some questions and answers on here from parents who either feel kids should be able to be kids and others who think as soon as they can pay attention they should be taught which do you utilize with your kids or are you somewhere in between why myself i am pretty much kids should be able to be kids but i mix some fun learning in we play in mud find bugs go look at the dinosaur bones at the museum read all kinds of books but i would never sit my kiddo down and force knowledge down his throat he is also very advanced for his age you should not force kids to sit down and learn at a young age studies have shown that to be able to engage in abstract thought as adult you need to exercise your imagination as a child this by playing games and allowing them to create their own imaginary worlds and to just be able to run around and play however it is great to make these fun activites educational which it does sound like you do take them to the zoo or a play and encourage them to read and be read to there is plenty of time to learn spelling there only children once  Milton H.

at what age should you give your first sex talk with your son daughter and what topics should first be touched definately by if not especially if its a girl the reality is if you don't tell them by then they will hear it from someone else and the parent should be the one to give this information also i know girls who started their period at so if you might want to explain it before keep in mind you don't have to explain everything at once you can gradually tell them about sex and its related issues having one big talk is really awkward anyways  Child sexuality Social rule Infantilism Milton H.

does spanking or whipping your child help okay this is for everyone with children please answer each question do you spank or whip your child how old is your child do you consider your child to be well behaved please be honest with each question i really would like to know the views on the matter any other details are welcome personally i was whipped as a child i do believe that my mom was alittle extreme when it came to discipline but i know for a fact that she got that way because of her parents my uncles are the same way although i turned out okay some of my siblings carried that same violent behavior into their lives and now the ones in my family that have children are in my opionion extreme in their discipline as well even though we all hated the way we were treated i do not believe in whipping a child but i do think spanking is okay i believe there is a difference between the two i believe that spanking is a mild form of physical discipline using the hand or something of that nature whipping is what i consider using objects like wood paddles extension cords belts and fist other things that leave bruises and yes there are people who do this as i said i was whipped and my sister and brother and uncles whip there children my kids are too old to spank and but i have spanked them both maybe only times each that's all they needed so i consider it to have been effective for my family they are both well behaved and always have been i believe that there is a right and wrong way to carry out this form of punishment however done the wrong way it can do much more damage than good here are the general guidelines i used not in any particular order try to always match the punishment with the crime reserve spanking only for the worst offenses like blatant disrespect or disobedience that you have no question about never punish a child for something that was an accident don't use your hand the hand is meant to be a loving instrument use a wide flat surface like a paddle you only spank to get their attention not to hurt them you should never leave a mark it should sting but not for long never spank your kids when you are angry you can tell them they are going to get a spanking but wait until you calm down before you actually do it talk with your child before you spank them and tell them exactly why you are doing it make sure they understand and give them time to ask questions this is not a negotiation just their time to make sure they understand why you decided to spank them always punish in private and praise in public it's very important that you allow the child to maintain as much dignity as possible throughout the ordeal talk to your child after you are done make sure you tell them that you love them and that it's your job to teach them right from wrong even though sometimes it hurts you to do it hug them and send them on their way to recover in private give them some space move on like nothing ever happened don't hold a grudge don't be moody and never talk about it again unless they bring it up make sure your next interaction with them is a positive one if possible if done using the above guidelines the spanking does not become associated with violence but rather a duty that the parent carries out because of his her deep and abiding love for the child  Theory of conduct Paddle (spanking) Punishment Erotic spanking Human sexual behavior BDSM Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity James Dobson Social rule Alignment (role-playing games) Capital punishment Evil Determinism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Caning Child time-out Infantilism Transactional analysis Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Strap John Howard Yoder Domestic violence Sin Ethics Martial art Goodness and value theory Incest Theodicy Religion and sexuality Tai Chi Chuan Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Plame affair Torture Flagellation Dog training Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses EastEnders The Human Stain Rocko's Modern Life Ten Commandments Narcissism Child abuse Causality Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Moral Politics John Wycliffe Abortion debate Origin belief Nicomachean Ethics Kodocha Intelligence quotient Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Human Aerial (dance move) Polyamory The nature of God in Western theology God Emperor of Dune Merit Futurama (TV series - season 5) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story Summa Theologiae Eddie Guerrero Sheikh Abdullah Cindy Sheehan Surveillance Rich Mullins John the Baptist Censorship in Australia Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dogville Political economy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fathers' rights Knots Landing Parenting Biology Sigmund Freud Autism Characters in the Smurfs Sola fide Consensual crime Hikikomori Jon Secada Diving Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

how do you discipline a child who just won't listen to you please read details let's say a yr old child isn't misbehaving i e s he isn't running around causing trouble or s he isn't doing anything bad but when you tell him her to do something such as pick up the toys or go outside to the living room they don't listen what should a parent do about this do you still use the naughty spot or naughty chair method additional details optional read i don't believe in spanking because my parents used to physically discipline me but when i got old enough to endure the physical punishment i stopped listening to them i don't want my kids to be the same way i want my kids to respect me rather than to fear me i used the time out method with my son when he was that age i remember two particular instances that i tried this with him one time he threw his cheerios all over the living room floor he was about at the time i told him a couple of times to pick them up and he wouldn't i sat him in time out and told him he could get up when he decided to pick up his cheerios he was still there an hour later another time he wouldn't pick up his toys after being asked a couple of times and i told him that if he didn't i would put them up and he wouldn't be able to play with them did he pick them up no he went and put them in the closet for me while these strategies worked with my youngest i could not put him in time out where he could still interact and see the rest of the family he had to be sat in another room in order for the time out to be effective on him i didn't spank them because of the same reasons that you don't want to but they knew that i meant what i said each kid is different and what works for one will not necessarily work for another my oldest is a why kid and so was i i have found that giving him a reason works best in getting him to do as i ask he doesn't really care what it is as long as he knows why he is doing it i have to use because i said so on my youngest you know your child best and what will most be effective in getting your wishes wants across to them sometimes you just have to do a little tweeking  Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

tactics to get yo to sleep through the night all of my kids were sleeping through the night by mo so i was just wondering if it was normal for her to still be waking up times a night at mo what can i do so she'll sleep all night through first it is normal to have periodic night waking all the way up to ages or the question is whether or not the frequent wakings make you insane or not some parents that nurse and co sleep with their toddlers aren't bugged by the waking others want to night wean asap having kids that do the full hour thing right off is a miracle to be enjoyed but it isn't the norm after a year you can do things to modify infant sleep but you do need to make sure nothing else is going on and realize that it is unrealistic to expect that kids will magically sleep hours plus and never have off days in addition to feeding before bedtime but brush teeth after at months teething and sinus allergy related issues can be major causes of night waking diapers can be a culprit some babies simply will not sleep if they need a change going to a more absorbent larger diaper can help it can also be because of temperature changes hot or cold my apartment is often ice cold at am and most of us wake up then and only my year old who still won't use a blanket has to shushed back to sleep dr gordon has great advice for trying to get at least one good hour stretch from a month kiddo http www drjaygordon com development ap sleep asp  Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Insomnia Infantilism Diaper Sleep Humphrey Bogart Climate of the United Kingdom Dream The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie House of M Narcolepsy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Avenue Q Milton H.

when will having two children get easier i am a mother of a two fabulous children aged months and years whew these are tough times can anyone tell me when i am going to feel a bit above water i used to think one child was a handful now that seems like a breeze i just feel like there is never enough times and i need at least more hands i spent two weeks looking after my two infants when my wife had to take time to complete some post grad education and to this day it was years ago i remember it being the toughest thing i ever did no exception i always thought of myself a fairly kid focused person but the kids were there every day there no matter what you just want to do some little thing for yourself but the kids are always there and that selfishness just made me feel guilty which then made me feel worse this was only two weeks and i started to feel like i was never going to do anything else in my life except look after them and there was nothing to look forward to so i have a huge amount of respect for stay at home parents the good thing is that it was all in my mind it does eventually end and every minute that you spend now being a patient good mother will pay you back ten fold on the flip side you will always regret those moments when you got angry and there is no way to take them back i now have pangs of regret for those two little babies who grew so big years old is a huge progressive point where they really get independent but thats too far away to be on your horizon right now the good thing is that it is a slow but sure progression between now and then i think you should just look forward to the day when they are both out of diapers and then out of pull ups when they will both be walking gradually you will be able to stop taking so much stuff every time you go out sitting down and reading a story to them can be both relaxing for you and good for them both go places where you can take the kids and socialise with other parents joining a mum's club can keep you sane in the meantime good luck you are raising the future and the better you do it the better they will be i know this is a lot of writing but i also want to share this poem that my oldest was given after his first year in kindergarten you should print it out and tape it the fridge i believe it was written by julie o brien take time to hold me on your lap to joke with me and make me laugh take time mommy this time will go so fast take time to give me extra hugs to teach me a nursery rhyme or song take time mommy i won't be little long take time to tuck me into bed to read that story you know by heart take time mommy soon these days will part take time to exclaim over what i color to admire the things i make from clay take time mommy i'm growing up and away take time to imagine or make believe to play some childish silly game take time mommy soon it won't be the same take time to let me help you work to teach me the many things you know take time mommy enjoy me as i grow  Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Care Bears EastEnders Hey Jude About a Boy The Contender (television series) The McGuire Sisters 2000 Australian Grand Prix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

how do i accept my son with a mental disability this if very difficult to ask and i would appreciate it if you could refrain from bible bashing me or telling me i'm satan i have gorgeous kids my year old daughter is super intelligent and we've been having in depth conversations since she was my son is two and a half and has epilepsy and developmental delay we don't know if it's permanent but i suspect he has a permanent mental disability from talking to his doctors and therapists i always knew i could handle a child with a physical disability but i always dreaded having a child with an intellectual disability people say as long as he's happy or tell me they work with mentally challenged adults and they are doing well but in truth no fully functioning adult or child wants to be friends with a person with a mental deficiency he will never get married or have a job i may have to care for him until i die and i am having a lot of trouble accepting this how do i come to terms with my future and his um that should be is not if sorry honey it's not true that no fully functioning adult or child wants to be friends with a person with a mental deficiency in actual fact the world is a scarier more hateful place for those of us with a fully functioning brain than it is for people with an intellectual disability you don't know yet if he will never get married many people with an intellectual disability go on to have normal happy wonderful rich full lives fall in love get married live happier ever after you also don't know if he'll ever have a job he's only two and a half many things could change between now and when he is grown don't borrow this trouble from the future as worrying about it now won't make it easier to deal with when the time comes it'll just mean that you wasted years of your life worrying i have a child with a permanent physical disability he is extremely intelligent in many areas but in other areas he is a little delayed i too have worried about how he will cope with friends whether he will have any whether he will be bullied will he ever find someone to love him will he get married what will happen to him after i die but there is no answer to these questions and worrying about them is doing me no good all i can do is focus on putting my energy into loving him and making his childhood something special incidentally he has many many friends his personality is charming and cheeky and he has no enemies whatsoever he is the favourite amongst his cousins he has a male cousin the same age who considers him his best friend and as close as a brother stop trying to come to terms with your future and his there's a long time for that come to terms with it when it gets here for now just keep putting one foot in front of the other i can't stress this enough there's no value in obsessing over something you can't change just deal with the here and now and the rest takes care of itself oh and try to stop comparing your children because consciously or unconsciously you are doing that in a way focusing on your daughter's intelligence and your son's lack of same will just cause you to miss out on his strengths my daughters too are very intelligent so i understand your pride in her achievement but it will only harm you all to compare two such different children who knows your son may even have normal intelligence he may just be a little slower in getting there but because your daughter was so bright in comparison it makes him seem less so your son will have his own strengths give him time to develop them and work on bonding with him and discovering his talents and special qualities the same way you did with your daughter your son is a special beautiful child in his own right and his intellectual capacity doesn't define him in any way what will define him is his support network his opportunities the way he is treated by his loved ones and the expectations you place on him don't sell him short but instead encourage him to reach for the stars he may just surprise you by getting there  Autism EastEnders Infantilism Asperger syndrome Social rule Human Charmed Unemployment Theory of conduct Intelligence quotient Autism rights movement Reparative therapy Milton H.

i don't know what to do currently i live with my boyfriend of just over a year i knew he came with baggage when we first got together and i thought i was strong enough to handle it he has two daughters aged and who constantly whine and snivel and misbehave and he doesn't do anything about it he just does whatever will shut them up and then he'll take them out later he is in the middle of a custody battle and wants to come out looking like the good guy but i seriously don't think that spoiling children no matter what the circumstances are is an okay thing to do i have discussed this issue with him and he said he will work on it he's not working on it and i'm finding myself in a hard place i don't have children but if i did i wouldn't let them get away with the stuff he lets his daughters get away with i don't know how much longer i can deal with it because in the end of it all they are not my children and i shouldn't care what if we got married someday any thoughts also the girls do not live with us they come over two days a week and he makes excuses saysing i only see them two days a week this isn't a relationship you should be in i can see lots of trouble down the road especially if you guys got married with you being a step mother i'm not saying you would be a bad one in anyway but you trying to correct the children's behavior and do the right thing will definitely cause trouble between you and your boyfriend and eventually the girls' mother i remember this happening with my own family they seperate when i was my brother was and my sister was my dad spoiled us rotten to make us happy and his girlfriend really didn't approve of it he'd get annoyed and when she tried to help us out or tell us to stop doing something one of us would tell our mother and she would flip these children really seem like they're stuck in the middle right now between their parents and most likely get whatever they want from both sides it's not something you want to deal with trust me i would consider leaving this relationship it seems like you yourself aren't sure of it yourself best wishes  Friends EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Pitaten Hollyoaks Kodocha Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Calvin and Hobbes The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Badly Drawn Kitties Boston Public Charmed Saved by the Bell Time Out of Mind Kurt Cobain Neighbours Full House Little Britain Pok__mon Live!

when do children begin to do the following eat with silverware color and not eat the crayons stay with you in public and not run off become more of a joy on trips learn the importance of what you try to teach them i was just wondering the following because i took my son on vacation this past weekend and he's sixteen months old i was miserable because i was constantly worried about him running off somewhere when do children actually begin to realize that there are rules to follow why does people also always say when i tell them how old he is they say oh that's a good age do they really mean it i think it's difficult because i want him to have the freedom to explore but it's exhausting to keep up with him what is a really good age when they start listening when my twins were that age i used harnesses they were more comfortable and i was a lot happier they were always running off or even hiding in the store and i couldn't do anything when i was hanging onto both of them with the harness i had my hands free and so did they my son continued running off his whole childhood eating with utensils one year with occasional reverting to fingers my niece at four was chasing a bite around her plate and someone said put your foot on it and she did color two years a joy to travel with years my favorite age with my kids was old enough to do for themselves and too young for the hormones to kick in but enjoy each age as they are grown and gone too soon  Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kender Humphrey Bogart Happiness Paragliding Blood on the Tracks Dead Like Me Tag Into the West (miniseries) Vegeta Piccolo Junior Saga 2000 Australian Grand Prix Days of our Lives Milton H.

why are some parents so sexist i just answered a question about a girl who can't do anything but her brother can't even though he gets drunk and stuff like that there was this other question i answered a few weeks ago about how parents are more protective of their daughters please don't answer because girls get pregnant or because girls have a better chance of being raped because boys can get girls pregnant and boys get kidnapped and raped all the time and girls are perfectly capable of protecting themselves and also please don't answer because people don't want their daughters to grow up too fast it's like people care more about their daughters more than they care about their sons sorry on the first paragraph i ment to say she can't do anything but her brother can i have a year old and a week old one boy and one girl i know whatever my son will be able to so will my daughter adn whatever he cant do neither will she you cant choose favorite children i know i couldnt if i wanted but i dont want to just saying i love both my children equally and wont let one get away with something the other one cant parents need to realize you have to be fair unfortunately some parents dont realizer that  One Life to Live Knots Landing Kurt Cobain Friends Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Neighbours Jennifer Lopez Child sexuality Incarnations of Immortality Great Teacher Onizuka Alois Hitler Hikaru Genji The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Charmed Lucille Ball Marc Dutroux Glen Jacobs The Beach Boys Sharon Tate Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Luke and Laura Spencer Romulus and Remus Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guiding Light John the Baptist Babe Carey Another World (TV series) Trailer Park Boys Timmy Turner Game show Sin City The Inside Leo Frank Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transsexuality The Catcher in the Rye Child abuse Billboard Hot 100 Lifetime Movie Network French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Jean Grey Lazarus Long The Jazz Singer Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete Hollyoaks Negima Full House Mystique (comics) Incest The Human Stain Theory of conduct Ted Kennedy Emperor Xuan of Han Gosei Sentai Dairanger Roe v.

mothers how many kids would you recommend having i am getting married next year and we both say we want a big family but my friends that have one kid are telling me i'll change my mind about wanting several kids after i have my first one because they are so much time and energy comments please i'm thinking i want it'll depend on a lot of things and you really can't say until you're in the situation i wanted as many kids as my body would produce but if you're responsible please be responsible your finances will limit that if you're an average person we can afford to have several kids but not at the rate of one every year or two for the next how ever many years plus we want to be able to give our kids nice clothes not ones that have been handed down times first also our house can only hold so many people or we'll have to get a new one i want my kids to have a chance to go to college and i'd love to be able to pay for it and i can't afford college educations for us its a matter of being responsible to the children we have and limiting how many more we have so that we can take care of them well and fully plus you can't give undivided attention to a billion kids i think is a fine number still a large family in this day and age but small enough you can care for their needs physical and emotional and they do require energy but it just kind of happens when you have kids you get used to it good luck and have those babies  Humphrey Bogart Social rule Abortion debate About a Boy Divorce Theory of conduct Microeconomics Diaper EastEnders Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Pitaten Extreme Programming Charmed Marriage Education in the People's Republic of China Gender role Education in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jon Secada Normal distribution The Fairly OddParents Dualism (philosophy of mind) Cancer Transsexuality Luck Motion picture rating system The Contender (television series) Sharon Tate Adoption Brewery Piccolo Junior Saga Origin belief Social Security (United States) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sant Thakar Singh W.

what to do with a stubborn argumentive dramatic yr old help i have a daughter that will be very soon i swear from the moment she was born she was difficult didn't sleep through the night until she was years old literally woke up very easily and screamed for an hour never liked to be held never liked to be put down this same baby is now almost and doesn't ever shut her mouth she's already been asked to leave one daycare because she is so high need so now she is in pre school and i'm starting to get soft complaints about her arguing talking back and sassy attitude on the flip side i am going through a divorce from her dad who she is crazy about he lives in another country we don't have family around us to help she is a sweet sweet child that shares easily and will help any child who has fallen or hurt themselves she extremely physically affectionate but my problem is i am worn out from constant battles if i say the sky is blue she will argue that it isn't and yes i have spanked time outs and point system etc i just wanted to say thanks for the mostly helpful answers and to ka i have heard of that term and i will look into it more thanks for your wonderful advice and also to suthernyankee too i do praise her a lot whenever she does something good she is very pleased with herself when that happens and i reward her to keep it up right now i'm promising disneyland and she does see the value in that reward lol it's nice to know i'm not the only one my friends kids seem to be so normal they seem to learn their lesson after punishments mine doesnt anyways thanks for all the wonderful comments keep them coming you just described my second child you have what is known in positive parenting circles as a spirited child google it she is intelligent and she knows it she is willful and her independence must be recognized she is more intense more sensitive and more emotional than children of different temperments she needs firm limits and you will have to enforce them often it is critical that you establish your role as the authority figure and fast also be sure you have some support from family or friends because a child with this temperament is exhausting the best thing you can do is educate yourself about spirited children and learn how to address your daughters needs catch her being good is one of the most effective methods of guiding her to appropriate behavior discipline is required for inappropriate behavior but positive reinforcement is much more powerful with this kind of child find out what her passion is my daughter is very tactile and she enjoys arts and crafts at i gave her macaroni dry beans and glue on foam trays the raised edge kept the glue contained fingerpainting with pudding or shaving cream was loads of fun shaving cream is easier to clean up as she got older i involved her a lot in food preparation kneading dough and rolling out her own pizza crust or cookies snapping green beans even washing plastic dishes was enjoyable to her if you can enroll her in gymnastics or martial arts classes the focus and discipline of those activites will help her channel her energy into something productive i encourage you to read a few books and work on catching her being good good luck  Spanking The Apprentice 2 Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Kodocha W.I.T.C.H.

what do you guys think about this i found it very hurtful and upsetting a couple days ago i announced at a family get together not a special occasion just a monthly ritual that i had been approved to foster to adopt and i would have a child within a month that would be my first child the same night my cousin announded she was pregnant with her third the comments i got were you're very lucky to be given a child and i hope you take the responsibility seriously my cousin got congratulations and well done now i know this is bitchy but she had sex i went through months of grilling interviews classes etc sorry i'm not usually like that i'm just so upset none of my family could understand why i walked out did i over react hi yes i know many pregnant women struggle also i really didn't mean to undermine how special and important pregnancy is as i said earlier i'm not normally one to make a remark like that and i did congratulate my cousin and i honestly am happy for her sorry if i hurt anyone's feelings by that remark p i was just sad because everyone else got so many good comments with their first children and they're not all great parents ofcourse i would've gotten upset this is your first child your child rather you carried it or not it is sooo special anyone can lie in a bed and make a baby but to go through the process it takes today to get a child and succeed is a remarkable thing and you should be commended on going through this to help a child in need of a mommy and while this may be an exciting time for your cousin as well shame on her for announcing her pregnancy right after you announce your big news she sould've waited until a different occasion so you could've got all the attention she's already got that attention for two others why steal your spotlight but take my advice and do not let it ruin the happiest moment in your life when i got pregnant with my son and was so thrilled to tell my mother in law b c she has no grandchildren and also wanted them so badly and this would be her first i thought she'd be thrilled and i told her on mothers day last year and she goes oh really in a very disappointed way and i say whats wrong aren't you happy and she said it would've been better if robbie and crystal would've been the ones giving me a grandchild which is my husbands brother and wife i was depressed for a long time and then i realized that i was missing a beautiful thing being pregnant with my baby over what someone thinks i wasn't having a baby for her so i shouldn't give a damn what she thinks and you shouldn't either girl i completely understand you though and i think you should tell all your girlfriends and you should have a baby shower even if its not a baby you're adopting let them know the age and gender of the child and they buy gifts accordingly that will give you the party you deserve and help you realize how happy you should be just roll your eyes about the scene at that occasion and feel sorry for your family b c they are missing out on this this is a great thing you're doing and even though your family didn't tell you well done congratulations and i'm very excited for you  EastEnders Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Knots Landing Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Kodocha Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Cliff Richard Eddie Guerrero Theory of conduct Days of our Lives About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Miss Saigon Marilyn Monroe Abortion debate Married... with Children Alois Hitler The Catcher in the Rye Neighbours Laura Schlessinger Adoption Sex and the City Jam (TV series) Charmed The Inside Fancy Crane Babe Ruth Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jon Secada The Smoking Room Marriage Haven (TNG episode) Elvis Presley Milton H.

stay at home moms what is life like my husband and i found out that we are pregnant with our first i'm about weeks currently i also currenlty work a full time job that brings in half of our income however we both feel strongly that i should become a sahm when the baby is born i'm feeling a little nervous about this though as financially it doesn't add up when i quit we will be about short on our bills trust me we live tight too we don't eat out i cook no credit card debt the hubbie is looking at getting a second job and hopefully i can bring in some income with my small cake business but that's not a sure thing i would really love to hear your stories and or advise on this whole situation thank you no unfortunately the only family in this area is his mother and she is not able to watch our baby i am i have a y o m o and week old when we found out i was pregnant with our first we both agreed that the best thing was for me to stay home and i loved that idea the thought of seeing every single milestone and being close all day long we sat down and wrote down exactly what bills we pay and how much they add up to compared to how much my husband earns a fortnight then we figured out how much we'd have left over and sometimes it may only have been when i got pregnant with our nd my first was months old things were incredibly tight my in laws have nothing to do with one another and my whole family live overseas so we did every single thing and bought almost everything by ourselves we quit eating out to and cancelled our blockbuster account ooooh what i tell every pregnant parent start stocking up on diapers and or formula if you buy a pack of diapers every fortnight then by the time the baby is born you don't have to worry about that expense same on formula if you use it when our nd daughter was months old i found out that i was pregnant with our rd daughter we were managing our finances correctly and he just managed to get overtime at work several occasions things got scary and it came up that he'd have to get a second job but thankfully it hasen't had to happen he is a technician and can get his hands on as much work as possible which has helped us out plus we had to use what was in the retirement funds and also pray that our tax refund was big enough to get ahead if you manage your finances correctly and budget your grocery bill to only what you need that week and will eat and then cut down on electricty and phone bills things aren't that bad we still have more bills going out than what income we have coming in the idea is to just stay ahead in your account to you don't get overdrawn at least this is what works for us right now good luck i'm sure things will work out for you it is scary when i was having our first we actually were ugh living with his mum and dad but his sister called the county who ordered us a citation to get out and two weeks before i delivered we were forced into a hotel room we prayed so hard and two days before we had to leave the hotel with no money my husband happened upon a house for sale the owners worked with us for a year and we were finally able to buy it it was tough i won't lie at times my husband and i did go hungry but our child never went without and we've only come through the entire ordeals stronger closer and happier you will realize your strengths very quickly just stay strong and you will get thorugh it  EastEnders Poker jargon Friends Kodocha Gross domestic product Knots Landing Personal finance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mutual fund Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wal-Mart Microeconomics Social rule Social Security (United States) Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ocean's Twelve Sharon Tate Shaggy dog story The Amazing Race United Kingdom corporation tax About a Boy New York Giants Infantilism Days of our Lives Boston Public Pitaten Rosa Parks Neighbours Babe Ruth Miss Saigon The Fairly OddParents Charmed Breastfeeding Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Mortgage Billboard Hot 100 Hillary Rodham Clinton Plame affair Economy of Russia Leeds United F.C.

are kids mcbranded or just mclazy i was reading this article on y and just had a though and wanted to see if anyone agrees why do these healthy kids activists always go after fast food companies but you never hear about them confronting tv or video game makers are kids really getting too much fast food or not enough exercise i feel it's a mixture of both i think the fast food that their mom has to pick up on her way home from work wouldn't be so harmful if kids and adults for that matter got some exercise instead of spending all day in front of the tv or game system what do you think http news yahoo com s nm hl nm kids fastfood dc i agree with you its definitely a combination of both there was just as many fast food places when i was growing up as there are now and my generation was not as obese as children nowadays the difference is i spent my childhood pretty much outdoors just playing running around playing sports etc we had longer recesses at school and more pe all this is lacking with kids these days frankly i think the activists should go after the parents its the parents that have control over this while the children are living in the house everything in moderation is fine its the parents responsibility to ensure their kids are eating healthy and getting enough exercise in my opinion  Fast food Sesame Street Atkins Nutritional Approach Ben Johnson (athlete) Super Size Me Adolescence Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Obesity Hypoglycemia Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Terri Schiavo Eating Tai Chi Chuan Hamburger Child sexuality John the Baptist Diabetes mellitus Human height Motivation Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Fast bowling Exercise Sonic the Hedgehog Narcissism The Fairly OddParents Computer and video game genres Domestic rabbit Intelligence quotient Economy of the United States Fathers' rights Laura Schlessinger Homeschooling Urinary incontinence IBM PC compatible Binge eating disorder Theory of conduct School choice Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Married... with Children Insulin Fox Broadcasting Company Dieting Internet phenomenon Recess (TV series) Transsexuality YMCA Swimming Generation Y Inflation Growth hormone treatment Dog Infantilism Sega Divorce About a Boy Ekadasi Milk Plame affair Autism rights movement Abortion debate Fasting Judicial functions of the House of Lords Sports Illustrated Unreal Our Gang The Sims Separation of church and state Androgen insensitivity syndrome Motion picture rating system Mixed-breed dog Hamster Tooth Vegetarianism Fatality Nuclear power Dissociative identity disorder 2004-05 NHL lockout Spy Kids The Adventures of Pete & Pete Word of Wisdom Kodocha Sea-Monkey McDonald's Lindsay Lohan Healthy eating National Kidney Foundation Singapore Spyware Tennis Mahjong Television in the United States Cancer Cardcaptor Sakura Hearing impairment Hunting Ted Williams Organic farming Child

new life new worries my son's father hardly comes to get him on the weekends or ever he's lied on me to his mom about coming to get the baby his girlfriend and him work together which is twelve hours five six days a week and on the weekends he spends time with her and her three children if he has our son he leaves him with his mom which is not a problem i'm just saying how do i go about confronting him about spending time with his son or even taking the initiative to come and get him instead of waiting on me to call squeaky first of all sorry for the length of this but your question really touched my heart you see i was in the same situation years ago and what broke my heart is the look on the childs face when he is let down over and over again what made our situation really bad was that his child support was only dollars every days that wouldn't even cover his diapers what i did was simple one day after yet another let down i took that little year old child in my arms and hugged him while he cried yet again i had to find answers to questions like why does daddy hate me what did i do to make daddy stop loving me i told him that a father is not the person that made him but rather the person that raises him and i made him a promise then and there that i will be his father from now on this of course made things a little difficult when his father did want to go pick him up because i would always have something planned for him to do with me and he did not want to go with his biological dad soon enough he was calling me daddy and as he grew older dad we did everything together and i treated him equally and like he was my own even my family knowing full well the situation sees him and treats him as if he were my biological son soon his father actually stopped sending the child support altogether it did not matter because he had everything he needed and so much more now years later that little kid is a college man he is an incredible human being with all the right values and all the right teachings every time we see each other regardless of where he is or what he is doing he will always stop come over to me give me a kiss on the cheek and throw his arms around me whenever he introduces me he doesn't say here is my dad he says this is my father one day recently i told him his biological father asked about him but he cut me short and said he was not interested in what the man had to say i told him look you may not like it but he is your father imagine my surprise when he told me the words i spoke to him so many years ago my father is not the man that made me but rather the man that raised me and gave everything for me everytime he goes to do something whether it's sports school whatever he always says to me i'll make you proud dad squeaky isn't this worth having if you think so you grab that kid in your arms and you hug him and do everything you can for him protect his feelings from the lack of fatherly love play with him study with him take him with you wherever you go and one day many years from now you will be where i am today the happiest proudest father to walk the earth take care  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story About a Boy The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fathers' rights Kodocha Infantilism Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Friends Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents Hey Jude Miss Saigon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Grandview, U.S.A.

is there any reason for concern or is this just a fashion statement i hear many differing opinions regarding the trend of young girls wearing shorts with writing across the ss writing like obey flirt follow sexy etc some also have the names of schools and organizations obviously having writing anywhere on your clothes brings attention is this a harmless fashion statement or is there more to it what do you think clothing manufacturers were thinking when they decided to make the clothing i am referring to underage girls not adults it's the same with anything companies are making and don't care how they do it they will pimp your kids your pets anything you just have to face up to the fact that being a responsible parent is not a popularity contest  About a Boy Undergarment Fashion Clothing Gender role The Fairly OddParents French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Nudity Fashion design Autism rights movement Friends School bus Trailer Park Boys Culture of the United States Vegeta Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Women in Islam The Amazing Race Child pornography Infantilism Ethics Social aspects of clothing Generation Y The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Avenue Q Comanche John Wycliffe The Apprentice 2 Epistemology KaBlam!

my son and adhd so i believe that my son has adhd he is yr old and about to go into the second grade he was constantly in trouble in the first grade he almost was expelled for bad behavior he was suspended form school a total of times it was seeming like the school was shoving meds down my throat and that they looked at me like i was a horrible parent because i wanted to explore all other options first i cut out caffeine alot of sugary foods and did my absolute best to work on him and his behavior nothing is working i feel like a failure it is taking time to get him state medical benefits and i am desperately trying to get him to be seen by a doc but i dont make alot of money even if i do get him to see a doc i heard that adhd meds are extremely expensive and i doubt i will be able to afford them i dont know what to do and i am at my wits end it seems like my son just doesnt have the ability to do some things on his own and i want to help him sooo badly my son has adhd the meds for this are really expensive and most of them don't have a generic depending on what kind you get mine cost a month i have my son on a low dosage because as you are i'm concerned with the long term effects try some of these tips that the doctor told me if your son truly has adhd caffeine will help try giving him a cup of coffee in the morning and see if this calms him down keep him off the sugar because sugar doesn't help just the caffeine my doctor suggested coffee in the morning and for him to take something like mountain dew or a vault for snack this helps a lot caffeine has an adverse reaction on adhd patients on someone without it it hypes them up just like the meds would but this will counter react with adhd just like the meds do and cause him to calm down strattera is the only drug on the market that does not have amphetamine in it which is what is concerning about the other drugs but it is expensive a month i do not know if there is a generic but that would be something to google also have you tried looking into government mandated programs i don't know where you live but you could check into medicaid or all kids insurance all you have to do is go to your local department of human resources or look on the net good luck because lord knows i've been through what you are going through and now is the time to deal with it because they won't even put children on the meds until they start school you don't want his education to suffer  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Caffeine Drug addiction Adult attention-deficit disorder Breastfeeding Methylphenidate Chronic fatigue syndrome Health insurance Migraine Medicine Publicly funded medicine Folic acid Hypoglycemia Methamphetamine Urinary incontinence Health care in the United States Little Britain Addiction Illegal drug trade Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coffee Education in the United States Microeconomics Pitaten Insomnia Insurance Sleep Fecal incontinence Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomoxetine Saved by the Bell Obesity Autism Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pharmaceutical company Hyperactivity Anxiety Ben Johnson (athlete) Wal-Mart Drug abuse Life insurance Bipolar disorder Neurofeedback Graduate school Cocaine Malaria Supply and demand Chocolate Tobacco smoking Social rule Rofecoxib Growth hormone treatment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the People's Republic of China Amphetamine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma LSD Medical cannabis Theory of conduct Social Security debate (United States) Stomach cancer Procrastination Allergy Bradley Nowell Word of Wisdom Traumatic brain injury Humphrey Bogart Crohn's disease Food and Drug Administration Antipsychotic Medicare (United States) Economy of the United States Blackjack Buprenorphine Common cold Neighbours Sleep apnea Student loan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Alcoholism Mountain Dew Gastroesophageal reflux disease National Kidney Foundation Singapore Breakfast Food Paracetamol Political economy Commodity markets Milton H.

can you believe this when i was at school some girls had knickers with a little pocket for a hankerchief but the rest of us just tucked them into the leg or top now it seems that every item of clothing has to adapt to the computer age http news bbc co uk hi technology stm should fashion follow technonlogy or should it be the other way round even children's clothing is being affected and my daughter in law gave way to my grandsons who wanted shorts with extra long legs to accomadate an extra pocket and which look awful but that extra pocket on the leg mimics the adult fashion to have a special pocket for a mobile 'phone my boys used to have all sorts in their pockets when they came home sometimes from conkers to beetles in a matchbox one thing that they would never have had was a mobile 'phone certainly not at eight years of age and they wouldn't have had teflon coated shorts for the mother's convenience either regardless of what the latest fashion as regards pockets was http uk answers yahoo com question index ylt apcqvm zmrozupjolgnt the second link was meant to be to an earlier question i asked i shall have to deal with this problem again soon when i go to buy the boys their new school clothes so wish me luck http uk answers yahoo com question index ylt apcqvm zmrozupjolgntwzyhbgx qid aa mofa it's a question renaissance should clothing be practical for normal life or should they be made of potentially dangerous materials for the sake of convenience some new fad sorry crazymental i ran out of space i have added the correct link now well missy that is another issue too but i agree with you completely children girls and boys should wear clothing appropriate to their age and what is practical without having fabrics and coatings which may be harmful and not what the latest technology or fashion dictates i know b sparkles but you can be sure that everyone will want them and then they will bring out a range for children and some parents will give in to pester power so that their children are not left out a mad world indeed well i have more time to think on things now spaismunky and she will and give in to my eldest in particular grandson when it comes to buying their new school clothes when they get back whereas i would have them in what looked best and was not teflon coated or unsightly and no matter what the latest fashion is we are talking about an eight year old adayinjanuary i agree i used to climb trees too and i was allowed to wear my older brothers' old shorts to play in not teflon coated back then but very hard wearing because they'd already given them good use by the time i got to wear them but i was dressed appropriately in skirts frocks dresses and so on for school church visiting and so on i don't know what some parents are thinking of these days yes loulla those are the ones the ones she has them in at weekends look bad enough but for school they look awful and i have seen older teenagers wearing them too and using the pocket for mobile 'phones and showing off their underwear too if she is allowing under tens to copy these fashions at so young an age what hope is there for them as for pockets well my boys crammed theirs full as it was without them having extra ones i too had to turn them out properly before putting them in the wash or more likely made them and it was only then that i discovered something that they had been up to and shouldn't have by what the pocket turn out produced at least it was never cigarettes drugs or condoms so they weren't bad boys compared to some and crazymental they are not slightly longer they are much longer just to accomadate a pocket that they do not need and that means even more teflon in contact with their skin can't you see that fashion for seven and eight year olds shouldn't even come into it unless the mother is obsessed by such that is joan your dil isn't even in the country and you're still having a go leave the poor woman be will you edit well joan it's up to you but you will insist on continuing this headlong ride into never seeing those children again at eight years old children are already under pressure from their peers to wear the right thing it may be wrong but it's the way it is personally i didn't go down the fashion route with my son because i couldn't really afford it but if i'm honest with myself i wish i had because he suffered at school for it you view my replies to you as aggression joan but the only aggression i see is vitriol directed at your daughter in law my responses to you are advice which you openly ask for someone has to stick up for your daughter in law's decisions regarding her own children if she can't rely on a warm and loving family that means you joan  Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost

what do you think about cosleeping we've never done it my daughter has always slept in her own bassinet or crib we have family that does it and it's always seemed odd to me especially when the child is five or six i was just wondering other people's opinions on this i don't personally agree with it because i have seen it go too far and too long and contribute to ruined marriages when my daughter was nursing and woke up for her morning feeding between and am i would get her let her nurse and fall asleep in bed with me for about hours i do love the snuggling every once in a while but don't want it to be a habit our bed is the only place in the house that hasn't been invaded by our daughter we as adults need our own space too if she isn't feeling well or having night terrors she will sleep a whole night with us but only if she really needs it  The Amber Spyglass Co-sleeping Knots Landing Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Shining (film) Insomnia Sudden infant death syndrome The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Narcolepsy Aphrodite Sleep Grandview, U.S.A.

question for all spanking and non spanking parents friendly and polite debate can you say if you're 'pro or anti' spanking give your reason and also explain the benefits you see for the other side for example i choose not to spank because i feel that there is always a way to modify behaviour without using physical punishment and i prefer my children to be raised without any physical force being used i can however see how spanking creates a more 'instant' response in many children and how used correctly provides a good deterrent for children to not misbehave i'm not 'anti' smacking but i definitely don't do it and never will my reasons are that i can always find a way to discipline my children without it and i feel that children should receive natural consequences whenever possible as that is how it will be in the real world i also prefer to set the example to my children and have them see me in control of myself solving problems with talking and actions i can see how spanking would be effective with very stubborn children who aren't easy to discipline and would help the parents get control over the situation very quickly  Corporal punishment Punishment Theodicy Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Infantilism Parenting James Dobson Aikido BDSM Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Determinism Microeconomics Adoption Efficiency wages Child time-out Ethics Domestic violence Expert system Transactional analysis Economics Prisoner's dilemma Buttocks Serial killer Philosophy of language Abortion debate Divorce Information Technology Infrastructure Library Sociobiology Social justice Breastfeeding Utilitarianism Collision detection Anger management Incest Ageplay Universal Century Nations and Factions Transsexuality Law of value Fathers' rights Education in the United States Moral Politics Creationism Criticism of libertarianism Erotic spanking The nature of God in Western theology Randomness Policy Debate Social psychology Richard Feynman Sant Thakar Singh Paddle (spanking) Experiment Fecal incontinence Second language acquisition Scientology beliefs and practices Fast bowling Logic Science Dogville Principal-agent problem Autism rights movement Presuppositional apologetics Social rule Caning Free will Radical behaviorism Motivation Consciousness School discipline Politics of Canada Alexander Technique Halting problem Philosophy of space and time Rape Same-sex marriage Philosophy of mathematics Sexual abstinence Diablo II: Lord of Destruction U.S. Electoral College Original sin Esperanto as an international language Religion Problem of Hell Franz Boas Scientific method Modified Newtonian dynamics Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Visual Basic Tai Chi Chuan Karma Kender Physics Strategic management Plame affair Rudolf Hermann Lotze Quantum mechanics

if you are the parents of a year old would you let her date someone if you are the parents of a year old would you let her date someone im amazed by the outpour of answers to this serious question keep answering and thank you so much for writing your opinion i'm and my boyfriend is i'll call him 'v' i was when we met i know many people would assume that as abuse statutory rape anything they would think but i'd suggest you first read what my opinion is as a person who is in high school dating a college person as some of you said everyone will say that love between a yo and a yo isn't possible but it is anyway why am i with v here is why he is a vey kind gentlemanlike and well bred man he is a friend with everybody and everybody likes him when i'm with him he is always careful with me we understand each other we talk about thing i can't talk about with anyone and he understands me and always gives me advice so that i can go out of a hard situation when he hesitates about something we talk and consider all the things he can do and which one is the best to be done now no matter he is he is a person and like all other people he has feelings he has problems and he has worries just as everybody he also has his right mind as alll other people when we go out wherever we go he protcts me from dangerous situations even while we cross the street he never lets me feel 'alone' and he never lets anyone harm me or do anything dangerous near me about the sex question i know many of you will ask for that too we never have sex if i don't want and he never asks me to do anything i don't want if it is not important according to him sex is waaay not important enough so he should ask me to do it and that is right sex is definitely not that important in a true love relationship you might ask youselves why would a yo man want to date a yo girl if he doesn't have sex in mind they have nothing in common that is not so right if a man doesn't have sex in mind of course he has hormones but he is not attracted by me because of the idea of having sex as most yo men are there are other thing which make an attraction between two as first sight different people one of the most important things is that we understand each other and we can talk about everything i can ask him anything he can ask me anything when we disagree about something we sit down and discuss it after that we make a consensus if he asks me whether to do something or not he is sure he will get an answer which is the best for him and sam is with me if i ask him whether to do something or not i know he will give me an answer which will help me most about the age thing yes he is and i'm he is a man i am a girl i am a bit more developed than my coevals people still ask me what do i study in the college and i had the same questions when i was which means i have looked more grown than i really were i hardly ever meet a person who follows the logic in him and not the emotions only a lot of people about of all the people i know and probably more percentage of the people you know follow only their emotions when taking an important or any decision so v is not a person that follows his emotions emotions are love hatred happiness sadness anger jealousy and covetousness it's a real happiness to find a person who doesn't take important decisions under the emotion effects so i'd say yes i would let a yo or a yo date a yo if he is a responsible right minded person and if the girl is a responsible right minded person  Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Social rule Philosophy of language Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology EastEnders Prostate cancer Friends Pedophilia God Emperor of Dune Pitaten Infantilism Little Britain Transsexuality Milton H.

what are your views on breastfeeding i believe that if possble it best for both child and mother and commercial considerations and convenience should not come into it http news bbc co uk hi health stm very well put adayinjanuary and others stick to your guns for the children's sake and don't be put off by silly ignorant people it was even worse when my boys were babies in some ways but in others not so bad and like for many things we do need a campaign as you say in order to remind people what normal natural childrearing is all about certainly it shouldn't be seen simply an opportunity for commercial firms to make a profit by offering a better easier alternative to what is natural well mary doll i did say if possible even if i spelt it wrong but i don't want to argue with you what you say is correct if the mother is genuinely happy the child will be happy the other thought that came to me was that once there were wet nurses for children mainly through wealthy mothers not wanting the bother of breastfeeding but it is an idea for those mothers who want their children to have natural milk but can't provide it themselves although i am not sure how it would work in practice these days breastfeeding is natural i bottlefed my first as i was not given support and did not realise how better it was for the baby my next children were breastfed yes i have i get better sleep breastfeeding its there baby does not have to wait while bottle is made if more support from midwives was given i am sure more would do it as for showing boobs in public i have seen lots of nusing mums and have never noticed their boobs why is it cute for animals to feed their young but not humans why do we produce milk if its not right  Breastfeeding Theory of conduct EastEnders Infant Fertility awareness Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breast Little Britain Microeconomics Midwifery Goodness and value theory Humphrey Bogart Milk Nestl__ boycott Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Pregnancy International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Economics Utilitarianism Theodicy About a Boy Social rule Kibbutz Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aristotle Knots Landing Breast milk Infant formula Pitaten Jam (TV series) Ayyavazhi mythology The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sharon Tate Parenting Nipple Peter Singer Dairy Socrates Nicomachean Ethics Criticism of libertarianism Infantilism Infanticide Comanche Married... with Children Medicare (Canada) Health science Supply and demand Autism rights movement Kodocha Libertarianism Nestl__ Law of value The Amber Spyglass Margaret Sanger Recurring South Park characters Divorce Punk ideology Brassiere 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wealth Fox hunting The nature of God in Western theology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Current teachings of Prem Rawat Horus Stuttering Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Teenage pregnancy Milton H.

does it bother you when parents don't see their kids potential anyone you know give examples not telling a yo to use his words talking to kids like their babies not being involved in school work etc yes it bothers me and it makes me angry i've got a cousin he's years old and since he was old enough to walk and talk my aunt was telling everyone who'd listen right in front of him and him himself that he was her cross to bear in life he was diagnosed in childhood with epilepsy and frontal lobe defect minor brain damage that caused memory lapses and concentration difficulties his mother made this worse by not helping him out at school with his remedial therapy or ever helping him with his after school work all through his life she has told him that he can't do this can't do that it took him until he was when i drove him in there to sit for his driver's license because all my aunt ever said was that he wouldn't pass it because he wasn't 'smart' enough to sit a written test only months ago he got his first 'real' job because she was constantly talking about how he wouldn't ever get anywhere with a career and would just have to do any job he could no matter how degrading for him he was working with kids half his age who got more money than he did he's never had a girlfriend hardly ever makes friends and usually lives in his own world half the time all because his mother chose to believe that he was useless instead of believing in him and doing the hard yards to help him one thing i'm certain of my kids will always be told that they can achieve anything they put their mind to and i'll damn well be helping them every step of the way  Neighbours Aphasia Pitaten EastEnders Milton H.

in mass if a family friend watches my kids days a week at their home are they required to be licensed my ex told the court that our boys would be in a licensed day care while she works but after talking to the state i found out the daycare was not licensed but just a family friend since finding this out my ex has began placing the kids with that friend for two days and another friend for days every week because its only two days each per week do they need to be licensed daycare providers or not they both live in the same town a few miles apart i have joint physical and legal custody and i am home day during the week i have had custody during the week for months with her having them on the weekends the judge just reversed the order for month to see how she does we originally agreed that i would have the kids while she was at work during the day but she then got mad about something else and changed her mind one of the friends has an extensive criminal record and the other just leaves the kids infront of the tv all day while she goes outback and gardens not the best enviorments for my kids to be in to my knowledge all homecares in ma must be liscensed regardless of how many days a week the child attends if your kids are the only kids these people are watching that could change things ma has long had some of the toughest rules for homeday cares the inspections they go through are just as tough if not tougher than the ones many large scale daycre providers go through another issue many people don't consider when using an unliscensed daycare is that by doing so they may not be able to claim daycare exspenses on thier taxes claiming child care costs on your federal and state returns will allert the irs to the fact someone is getting the money and they can ask for proof cancelled checks receipts etc to verify the claim since most unliscened daycares are operating that way to avoid the taxes this could mean some nice fines and fees if they get found out if you are paying for childcare as part of the custody agreement i would ask for a receipt for tax purposes the bigger issue here is that your ex is willfully disregarding the custody and child care arrangements agreed upon when the change in custody took place i would contact your lawyer as well as the person handling your case in the family court and report this keep a record of where and who is caring for the child since the present custody arrangment was on a trial basis i would think you would be going back to court to discuss if it will stand bring up all of these concerns again in front of the judge the lack of liscensed daycare the fact that she changed the care arrangments without your agreement and against court orders the fact that one of the providers has a criminal history hopefully this should be enough for the court to order her to comply and return childcare responsibilities to you if not and if you are paying for the childcare costs i would ask the court to order her to place them in a certified daycare with her being required to provide reciepts for services to you as well as copies of the center's licenses to the judge  Day care Child support Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Appeal Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson SCO-Linux controversies Probation officer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Vivian Solon Article One of the United States Constitution Court system of Canada Public domain Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bush v.
