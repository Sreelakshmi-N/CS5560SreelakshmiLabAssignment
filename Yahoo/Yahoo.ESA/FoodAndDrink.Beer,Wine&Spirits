how do i smoke cigars when i smoke cigars alot of times i dont taste any of the flavor am i doing it wrong how do i get more flavor out of my cigar are they too dry too wet taking puffs too often what i am doing wrong wow it is quite obvious that people answer questions in this forum who have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever about the subject matter first you must select a cigar that has been properly kept what i mean by that is a cigar must be held in a controlled environment at a specific humidity range usually between humidity this is done using a humidor if you do not have a humidor you can use a wood glass or plastic container that can be sealed to make your own humidor take a folded paper towel and soak it with distilled water you can buy a gallon at wal mart for cents place the soaked paper towel in an unsealed sandwich baggy inside the container the distilled water will evaporate inside the container making it humid and keeping the cigar fresh when the paper towel dries repeat the process this will ensure your cigar is properly humidified and will change the taste dramatically there is a huge difference between a properly stored cigar and a dry one your cigar will dry out if you just leave it on a shelf for a few days in your house when smoking a cigar simply draw the smoke into your mouth and release there is no time limit for keeping the smoke in your mouth contrary to what the other person said when drawing smoke from the cigar make sure you do not have to suck on it if you do then the cigar is wrapped to tight and you should roll it through your fingers to loosen up the binder to allow a better draw most everything about smoking a cigar is personal preference the point of smoking a cigar is to enjoy fine tobacco the taste aroma etc the taste is much better if the cigar has been properly stored or fresh the only way a cigar can be too wet is if you dip it in liquid some cigar smokers do dip their cigars in a fine cognac for added flavor however i would not recommend this due to the possiblility of damaging the cigar if you aren't sure how to do it as for the puffs again this is personal preference but as a general rule one puff per minute keeps the cigar from going out so i hope that answers your questions and enjoy your fine cigars they are truly a pleasure if you know what you are doing hang in there and good luck  Humidor Bong Cigarette Tofu Rum Cannabis cultivation Menstrual cup Smoking pipe Casting Hookah Wine Tobacco smoking Water Champagne (beverage) Textile manufacturing Brewery Milk Sake Barbecue Handloading Manicure Hamster Single malt Scotch Floppy disk Puff pastry Smoking ban Pisco Sauna Alcoholic beverage Bacon Scotch whisky Fire extinguisher Moonshine Chocolate Tea Condom Contract Carnivorous plant Blunt (drug culture) Microeconomics Upholstery Cocaine Fiberglass Humidity Agar plate Poker jargon Mattress Coriander Soldering Concrete Cuisine of the Philippines Papal election Common cold Alcohol fuel Theory of conduct Houseplant Air conditioning Hyperthermia Vinegar Ham Food preservation Paint Clarinet Thermal power station Cancer Campfire Pottery Gasoline E85 Brandy Vanilla White phosphorus incendiary Drowning Knife Chili con carne Paper towel Lake District Instant coffee Violin In-N-Out Burger Cello Cantonese cuisine Fishing Sauerkraut

i'm allergic to hops can i still drink malt liquor i recently took an allergy skin test that says i'm allergic to hops so i take that to mean that i shouldn't drink beer what about beverages that call them selves malt do they include hops are hops only an ingredient in beer or do other drinks like ales or lagers have hops in them andrea no you cnnot drink malt liquors as they do contain hops and hop extracts a malt liquor is actually a beer the name of this style of beer is misleading it came about by nonbrewing sources i e government it originally designated beers over a certain alcohol percentage of approximatly today it is an adopted beer style by the brewing community beer water dah beer is made from malted barley which is a grass the barley imparts sugars color and grain flavor to the beer yeast is a very small thing that metabolizes the sugar produced from the prosessing of the malted barley into the byproducts ethanol alcohol same alcohol that is in wine and all distilled spirits finally hops which are the flower of the female hop plant the hops impart bitterness flavor and aromas but no alcohol the hops also act as a natural preservitive all beers use hops the question then becomes of how much if it does not matter to you then the ligher beers including budweiser coors miller etc are very low in hop compounds content no distilled spirits or products that are labeled malt beverage contain hops the malt beverage desigination is given because the alcohol used in them are produced from the same grains as beer more beer ales lagers the subject is beer and both ales and lagers are catagories of beer styles of ales are pale ale brown ale ipa bitter porters stouts etc styles of lagers are pisener american pilsner munich vienna helles bock etc i hope i was able to help you today my suggestion is to not drink beers of any type ales or lagers and malt liquors type of lager enjoy  American lager Sake Ethanol Coffee Wine Hop (plant) Homebrewing Public house Vinegar Miller Brewing Scotch whisky Guinness Alcohol Pilsener Yuengling Stout beer Rum Gin Vodka Cider Bitter (beer) Prohibition Chocolate Lambic Pale ale Porter (beer) Alcohol fuel Whisky German beer Samuel Adams (beer) Belgian beer Wheat beer Tea Honey Alcoholic proof Perfume Cascade Brewery Pisco Alcohol advertising Soft drink Root beer Chinese wine Acetic acid Mild ale Barley Bread Mexican beer Burton-upon-Trent Fuller, Smith and Turner Champagne (beverage) Ginger ale K__lsch (beer) Reinheitsgebot Smoked beer Anheuser-Busch Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Lion Nathan Aging barrel Country wine British cuisine Fermentation Essential oil Allergy Sorghum Liqueur Sugar Yeast Jenever Coopers Brewery Tofu Beck's Molson Drink Rooibos Cuisine of Denmark P__cs Brewery Tooheys Peanut

can a restraunt serve alcohol to a teen if they are accompanied by their parents i heard this from my health teacher and a few other places and i was wondering if this is true the restraunt has the right to say no but it's still legal to serve alcohol to someone under depends on where you are in the country in a state like wisconsin you can order a brew provided a parent is with you in a state like utah a minor cannot purchase or consume booze when the government passed the mdaa of it stated that in order for a state to keep all of its federal highway funding the purchase age but not the age of consumption for all alcohol had to be it is also legal and federally protected for a minor to consume alcohol for religious ceremonies such as communion in some states it is legal for a minor of any age to be served alcohol provided they are with their parents at an on premise establishment however the practical answer is no probably of establishments have a policy of not selling alcohol to anyone under even though they legally could now how well that policy is enforced is usually debatable when i was i went bar hopping with my dad in florida and did not get carded once anyway the people above although they are being kind of mean spirited are right you probably couldn't have a separate beer on your own even if mom or dad are with you at a restaurant oh well as the saying goes life sucks then you get a fake id joe  Prohibition Alcoholic beverage Mothers Against Drunk Driving Prohibition (drugs) Tax Legal drinking age Divorce Separation of church and state Smoking ban Age of consent Breastfeeding Public house Driver's license Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Sake Health insurance Gun politics in the United States Illegal drug trade Coffeehouse Beer Motion picture rating system Minimum wage Food Stamp Program Drunk driving (United States) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Constitution of Ireland Abortion debate Alcoholism Brewery George W.

drinking out of state i'm a year old from ny in ny the drinking age thing is generally pretty relaxed especially in the city yes i know its illegal but i'm legal to do everything else right point is when im out of town i always order drinks virgin and dont give anyone a hard time because i know they will get into trouble for serving me however some people get really nasty and demmand id and act like im trying to trick them somehow is it just that they are worried about liabilties or are they just purposely giving me a hard time because im young they were asking id's for virgin drinks and i had to clarify again that i wanted it virgin and some people get very nasty when you order a drink and look young again i'm not trying to give people a hard time when you go to the city of ny it is very easy to drink underage the rest of the state this is not so please read the question thoroughly before answering thanks they're worred about liabilities the liquor board can bust them if you're drinking underage even if the chances of them being busted by the police is it's still not a risk worth taking because they can lose their liquor license and the server can get fined and no they're not particularly worried about your health and safety and the few that claim to be aren't places i'd enjoy going to anyway just like any other business they are in it for the money if the drinking age was again in ny i would bet you a large sum of money that of restaurants and bars would permit year olds to drink even if every one of them jumped in their car and wrapped themselves around a tree afterwards what i would do in your situation is ensure that they know the drink is virgin if they still ask for id clarify once again virgin no alcohol if they give you a bad rap still get a soda and don't tip them it's certainly not illegal for them to serve n a mixed drinks and if they or the restaurant's policy are being a jerk then you don't have to tip good luck enjoy the booze joe  Poker jargon Mothers Against Drunk Driving Social rule Alcoholic beverage Prohibition Coffeehouse Contract Blackjack Surveillance Restaurant Legal drinking age Consensual crime Concealed carry (USA) Craps Trailer Park Boys Driver's license Insurance Moonshine Breastfeeding Scientology beliefs and practices Sin City Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Beer Pong Prostitution Drunk driving (United States) Humphrey Bogart Rape Expert system Child pornography The Young Ones (TV series) Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cheating in poker Cocktail Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tea Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Drinking culture Sauna Avenue Q Insomnia CPU cache Moe Szyslak Boom Town (Doctor Who) Confidence trick Skateboarding trick Gambling Babe Ruth Maison Ikkoku Word of Wisdom George Costanza Coffee Ocean's Twelve Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Motion picture rating system Kitesurfing Nicomachean Ethics Deflation (economics) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Taxation in the United States Divorce Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Oasis (band) Coca-Cola Shaggy dog story Password Jackass: The Movie Good Morning, Vietnam RuneScape quests Procrastination Tort reform EastEnders Civil rights Cocaine Alcohol Jeopardy!

why is it hard for me to get drunk i'm not much of a drinker but i do drink whenever i am invited to hotel parties my friends throw maybe like twice a year last year on my twenty first birthday i drank like seven shots of tequila along with other drinks and i did not get drunk at all my friends tried to get me drunk but it didn't work sometimes my body aches when i drink does that mean im allergic to alcohol well there care two reasons i can think of your body retains much more water than most people which would dilute the alcohol and prevent you getting drunk as quickly as most people there are enzymes in your body that beak down the alcohol molecules the more often you drink the more your body produces and men usually have more than women maybe your body always produces more of theses than usuall  Alcoholic beverage Alcohol Body piercing Ethanol Coffee Tequila Drinking Hangover Urine Drink Paracetamol Alcoholism Beer Allergy Humphrey Bogart Insulin Biochemistry Blood alcohol content Binge drinking Mothers Against Drunk Driving Beer Pong Absinthe Brewery Breastfeeding Lemonade Single malt Scotch Oasis (band) Sake Birthday Sin City Disinfection Alcoholics Anonymous Social rule Fecal incontinence The Shining (film) Hepatitis Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Drinking culture Acetaldehyde Grog Caffeine Can't Hardly Wait Michael Garibaldi Sauna Prohibition Yerba mate French cuisine Water Vodka Divorce Glucose Enzyme Cirrhosis Ron Weasley The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Cancer Protein Water (molecule) Coming of age One Tree Hill (TV series) Wine Marathon (sport) The Doors New Coke Keith Whitley Tattoo Glycerin Common cold Lucille Ball Drunkenness Arguments for and against drug prohibition Raki (alcoholic beverage) Tooth enamel HIV test __douard Manet Rum Port wine Hyperthermia Public house Ozone Phosphoric acid Scotch whisky Yoghurt Perfume Forty-seven Ronin Drunk driving (United States) Hypoglycemia Homeopathy Distilled beverage Gram staining Alcohol advertising Cognac (drink) Princeton University Witches (Discworld) Noah Tooth Cider St. Elmo's Fire (film)

why is there a stem on wine glasses the stem allows the glass to be held without influencing the temperature of the wine the stem is not in direct contact with the wine and holding it by the stem protects the contents in the bowl of the glass from being affected by the heat of the hand note that some glasses such as brandy balloons or snifters are intended to be held in the palm of the hand which then warms the contents and increases the aroma these normally have a wide base and are narrow at the top to trap the aroma  Brandy Beer Champagne (beverage) Wine Bong Sake Cider Tea Pisco Fujian tea ceremony Glass Glasses Smoking pipe Carburetor Peanut Solar power Alcoholic beverage Perfume Yoghurt Carbon dioxide Wood Cheese Muscat grape Shiraz grape Coriander Rum Instant coffee Temperature Tobacco Port wine Tire Lighting Aquarium Cookware and bakeware Hot air balloon Greenhouse effect Cannabis (drug) Phase (matter) Leaf Welding Urban heat island Ceramics Chocolate Cognac (drink) Motor oil Explosive material Fast bowling Cabernet Sauvignon Water (molecule) Thermodynamics Brewery Helium Soldering Solar variation Global warming and agriculture Hemp Corrosion Wind Diving suit Greenhouse Dog Cuisine of Denmark Laser Global warming Radiometric dating Naval mine Rice Tin Incandescent light bulb Wine making Climbing equipment National Weather Service Optical fiber Gas metal arc welding Ocean thermal energy conversion Inertial guidance system Spark plug Carnivorous plant Biodiesel Dairy Wines of Portugal PaX Ultraviolet Ice core Diseases of the honeybee Methamphetamine Climate of the Alps Climate change Hiccup Climate of the United Kingdom Satellite temperature measurements Sorghum Miami, Florida Hamster Jute Belgian beer Powder metallurgy Desert

proper way to make a spiked watermelon i am attempting to make a vodka watermelon but it seem like the vodka is not being absorbed by the watermelon i tried pouring it in and letting it soak up as well as leaving it overnight with the bottle upside down and very little vodka is being absorbed am i doing something wrong try cutting out small triangular sections on what you determine is the top of the watermelon then take either a syringe or pour directly into the watermelon itself the key to this is to give it some time such as hours before the event so that you can place it back to the refrigerator or put it on ice what ever you do be careful this stuff is potent don't drink and drive and please be mindful of your friends that may get loaded off of this have fun  Watermelon Martini cocktail Aerial (dance move) Coffee Sake Professional wrestling throws Alcoholic beverage Social rule Ice cream Yerba mate Everwood Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Fanta Drinking game Tofu Glossary of climbing terms Menstrual cup Refrigerator Textile manufacturing Bong Bread Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cantonese cuisine Tea Piledriver (professional wrestling) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Joke Teller-Ulam design T.A.T.u.

wine bottle and vinegar why wine can turn to vinegar also why people use glass instead of plastic bottle to contain wine etohrx vinegar is often made from an alcohol source wine for example alcohol is changed chemically speaking through oxidation to acetaldehyde and finally acetic acid a food safe bacteria acetobacter aceti acetobacter pasteurians acetobacteur hansenii and gluconobacter oxydans is used for this change this process occurs naturally in alcoholic beverages when alcohol is present in the presence of the bacteria this is rare in wines since not only does the bacteria need to be present but also oxygen and unless the wine was poorly bottled or has a bad cork etc there exists very little to no oxygen in the wine this happening is only a concern in very old wines as methods of bottling were not as technical as today the bacteria is voracious and will reduce all the alcohol to the acid glass if flavor neutral today with the types of plastic that are used for beer and distilled spirits the reason for ntr using it is preference many people would not accept plastic over the traditional glass bottle food microbiology fundamentals frontiers michael doyle et al isbn  Vinegar Cider Alcoholic beverage Sake Wine Bacteria Fermentation Alcohol Champagne (beverage) Ammonia Beer Methanol Sulfuric acid Rum Food science Milk Hydrogen peroxide Polyethylene terephthalate Coffee Plastic Wine making Aldehyde Port wine E85 Bottle Water purification Sterilization (microbiology) Acid Oxygen Acetaldehyde Pisco Alcoholic proof Biochemistry Sauerkraut Cellular respiration Bourbon whiskey Cheese Alcohol fuel Ultraviolet Ethylene glycol Hydrogen sulfide Explosive material Distilled beverage Pneumonia Tin Alcohol dehydrogenase Waste management Energy development Photosynthesis Carboxylic acid Water Carbon dioxide Coca-Cola Belgian beer Tea Food additive Titanium Aging barrel Brandy Glycerin Prohibition Nutrition Radical (chemistry) Welding Hydrogen Water (molecule) Halitosis Absinthe Lactic acid Gasoline Scotch whisky Ozone depletion Foodborne illness Whisky Ceramics Formic acid Compost Guinness Aluminium Paracetamol IUPAC nomenclature Tofu Nitrogen Acetone Soy protein Cookware and bakeware Kosher foods Zinc Otitis externa

i'm american but why do people waste their time with weak american beer with no good beer flavor i like american beer but it just isn't enough for me we must take all things in context i answered another question similar to yours yesterday and it went like this with a few additions a few examples of good american beers budweiser busch coors anchor brewing's steam anchor porter anchor wheat sierra nevada brewing's pale ale porter wheat boston brewing co's samuel adams wheat triple bock there are many more selections of good american beers as well it is a matter of taste we all have different tastes in both food and beverage i like most any beer although i prefer belgian trappist beers the most should i laugh and scoff at those that make or drink sam adams or budweiser i drink those also becuase it does not have the fuller pungent flavors of my beer of choice i also like continental pilsener but there is always some level of flavor loss with importation there exists more choices and tastes with the beers brewed by craft brewers these days ask yourself if you like liver many people love it where many others think it disgusting it is a matter of taste speaking from a professional perspective anheuser busch has some of the highest quality of beers in the usa world is it marketing perhaps but if someone was selling dead skunk juice and had funny and entertaining commercials during your favorite show would you buy the skunk juice it is highly likey that you would not so it must be more perhaps the laws of supply and demand people demand something light flavored beers and an interprising individual makes it anheuser bush uses the freshest ingriedents in the industry they important the highly desired and prized noble hop variety hallertau from germany when they say they know of no other beer that cost as much to produce it is fact compare the choices of beers including light beers to the variety of soda lime in soda caffeine in water people want it and someone is drinking them or they would not last long the sulfer that people smell and perhaps taste in miller beers is dimethyl sulfide dms it is a vegatable corn like aeromatic compound that is derived from the corn grits that miller uses in its beer the very reason anheuser busch and coors uses rice rice has a much cleaner flavor profile again a matter of taste the national brewing companies enjoy so much success for many reasons some of these reasons include history quality mass appeal marketing light beers as for a light beer being made for people that do not like the taste of beer i say no actually there is some truth to that but it is over simplified to say that also consider a reduction in calories and originally a slight reduction in alcohol it does have the taste of beer to those trained in the sensory analysis of beer but it is true that the lighter subtle flavor profile appeals to many many beer drinkers bottom line to me is enjoy all beers for what they are a wonderfully refreshing malt beverage tastes will vary don't sweat it enjoy pitboss while you say not to blanket craft brewers as included in american beers i say do not balnket the large brewers it tells me by your statment that you know little about beer anheuser busch uses the freshest ingerdients in the industry they import hallertau hops from germany they have teams of professionsl brewmasters that rival any in the world marketing i they marketed skunk piss would you by it being the leadiing brewer in the u s is due to more of a quality product than marketing  Anheuser-Busch Hop (plant) Samuel Adams (beer) Soft drink Bread Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Rum Sake American lager Bock Wheat beer Homebrewing Guinness Vinegar Wine Porter (beer) Breakfast Tea Miller Brewing Pale ale India Pale ale Microeconomics Pilsener Tofu Prohibition Belgian beer Diet soda Stout beer Gin Yuengling New Coke Alcohol advertising Mexican beer Supply and demand Pisco Burton-upon-Trent Coors Brewing Company Vodka Moonshine Public house Ethanol Ramen Alcohol fuel Yerba mate Canadian beer Acetic acid Cuisine of Argentina Agriculture Anchor Brewing Company Sugar Snapple South African Breweries Chocolate Free trade Cuisine of Africa Lemonade Soy sauce Honey Peruvian cuisine Reinheitsgebot Malt liquor Caffeine Green tea Economics Bass (beer) Law of value OK Soda Jewish cuisine Lambic Word of Wisdom Milk Bong Mountain Dew 7 Up Budweiser Budvar Tobacco Chicha Ford Motor Company Smoked beer Shasta (soft drink) Cadbury Schweppes In-N-Out Burger Drink 1982 World Series Cuisine of the Southern United States

how do bartenders keep drunks from killing each other if you run a bar but use glass ash trays heavy beer mugs ketchup bottles salt and sugar shakers or billiard balls all can be used as blunt weapons then how on earth can you make patrons behave and not tear up the place or each other any hints i bartended for many years in roadhouses lounges restaurants clubs and some of the finer discoteques with and without bouncers availlable so i pretty much know what does and does not work scars to prove it your ears are constantly open for your waitresses' drink calls from two to three points of your bar as well as the swarms of loud mouths yelling for hooch drinking and thinking they are much more important than anyone else in the club and they don't tip ever you serve them with a smile being extremely alert and conscious at all times is essential yes i had myself some drinks as i worked but never got drunk to a point of not hearing that glass break on the dance floor the wall or at the tables you get to where you're tuned in to the sound of glass and the unmistakable voices of what has already or will become a bad situation calling the cops it's waaaay too late for that at that point keeping your eyes peeled and aware of everyone in the place and especially on those who could become volatile is really the most important thing because you can get your bar backs to cover for you as you meander casually over to the drunk sit near him her and introduce yourself be kool be funny be their 'friend' they already know who you are because you're the bartender hey man you smile and make them like you even more i'm gonna buy you a beer dude how's everything going then you point out a few of the gorgeous girls and divert their attention away from whomever or whatever seems to be bugging their stupid brains you pal the guy girl and tactfully clue them to the fact that you are indeed the coolest bartender that ever lived and you really have a concern for your people introduce them to some of the employees call them over to meet the guy girl they love that stuff make them feel important and liked the next thing you know they're all happy and cool as you walk slowly with them to the front door and a pre called taxi cab that you gladly provide at the club's expense or your own it isn't much and a whole lot cheaper than finding out the next day that you contributed to killing some people on the highway of the drunks respond positively to this type of treatment and they tend to remember bits of how well you took care of them and a thanks is normal when they come back in as well as reimbursement lesson learned usually and bookoo respect i hate to ramble on but there is the one percent of redneck moronic primate scum that you have to seriously subdue i have fortunately been involved in martial arts most of my life and it has helped but i've had my butt messed up a few times booze and idiots don't mix but they do it anyway if two or more butt smears are going at it before you've been able to thwart it your responsibility to your people is to get them clear of the danger zone crowd control get your best guys involved in that including your good customers let the jerks break all the furniture they want but get your people away first that means your clientelle and employees you go smashing into the middle of a brawl and you're almost inevitably going to be really cut up and sore for a couple of weeks trust me on this a waitress is already calling so that's a done deal your job is to protect the decent people and if you ever see a gun or a knife you are the cop for that moment serve and protect just part of the job these types of incidents are so few and almost never actually but they do occur best to be prepared and have a plan the cops will be there in an hour and a half or so especially if you're in l a not to worry  The Shining (film) Friends Moe Szyslak Garfield RuneScape quests Little Britain Taxi Driver Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Jennifer Lopez Milton H.

if someone got drunk once a week would you consider them an alcoholic according to my therapist you are addicted to something when you met the following two things you do something every day as was already mentioned the thought usually comes as soon as you wake up it has a negative impact on your life clearly this person fails the addict test seeing as s he only does the drinking one night a week depending on the amount consumed it might not even be having a negative effect on his her health assuming addict is the same as alcoholic i would argue no why do people keep coming into this area telling people they shouldn't drink because they know of someone who died drinking don't they know that you could die in an accident even if you are sober it's ok to drink drinking in moderation is even healthy for you i am truely sorry that your father uncle boyfriend bff died crossing the street fell down stairs whatever but to blame that alcohol is a bit if a stretch if you ask me rant  Alcoholism Alcoholics Anonymous Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Alcoholic beverage Avenue Q Clinical depression The Shining (film) Cocaine Friends Social rule Theory of conduct Arguments for and against drug prohibition Borderline personality disorder Harm reduction Neurofeedback Kurt Cobain Word of Wisdom Addiction Nicomachean Ethics Drug addiction Breastfeeding Drunk driving (United States) Hypoglycemia Sexual addiction Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Bradley Nowell Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Procrastination Blood alcohol content Drug test The O.C.

is it a good idea to open a beer hall i want to find some way to do it cheap and simple so i thought just a big hall selling beer might work anything to keep initial costs down no frills no dark lighting no signs just a normal beer hall and beer garden and no fancy names either just beer hall any suggestions no seriously we can launch it as a very simple endeavor and then add the frills later as we go but whatever frills you think people like p lease let me know if you can i think this is a fine idea germany supports thousands of beer halls i'd start small maybe max occupancy just have tables and benches so that strangers are forced to sit next to one another encourage singing and dancing on the benches like oktoberfest have live and prerecorded music including some ein prosit type tunes that periodically make people clink neighbors glasses and take a swallow sounds like fun to me  __douard Manet Palace of Westminster Oktoberfest Munich Music Hall EasyGroup Wheat beer Tony Bennett Ryanair Guinness Dundas Square Video game music Public house Compact audio cassette Bread Lager Karaoke Aerial (dance move) Aldi Brewery Frilled shark Parliament House, Canberra Cuisine of Denmark Treehouse of Horror V German beer Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Ludacris Wine Mickey Mouse Roxette Show of Hands Hash table Beer Hall Putsch Popular music RISC Computer Ale PHP Avenue Q Willie Nelson Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Beer I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Alcoholic beverage Yale University Bong Timeline of trends in music (1950-1959) Conveyor belt sushi Leasing Make money fast Diamond Amusement park Princeton University Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Emergency preparedness Music of Ireland Roaring Twenties Freestyle music Bock Stuttgart Late Night with Conan O'Brien Shaggy dog story Beer garden Sauna Heavy metal music Bee Gees Disney's California Adventure Garfield Rathfarnham The Time Machine Extreme Programming Spot the Dog Mnemonic Law of value Biberach an der Ri__ Miller Brewing Kylie Minogue Fischer Random Chess Hall & Oates Blood on the Tracks No frills ABBA President (game) The Ashlee Simpson Show Mixtape The Beach Boys Abraham Goldfaden Hungarian language Disneyland Weimar Republic Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how much beer will it take to get a monkey drunk like a chimpanzee for example yes its a stupid question and don trip im jus curious the short answer is that it would only take about one or two beers to get a chimp drunk be sure to hide his car keys and any sharp objects because chimps get mean and stubborn when they're drunk according to the national geographic website the average weight for a chimp is to lbs to kg alcohol is metabolized by your liver your liver's size is proportionate to your body size a chimp would have a much smaller liver than an adult human several factors are involved such as height weight gender and food recently ingested but in general the human body can absorb mg deciliter of alcohol per hour on average that's the amount of alcohol contained in one oz beer or one oz glass of wine or one oz shot of hard liquor so if you drank enough to blow a in a state where the legal limit is it would take hours for the alcohol to be absorbed so you could drive legally common chimpanzees have been known to attack humans on occasion there have been many attacks in uganda by chimpanzees against human children the results are sometimes fatal for the children some of these attacks are presumed to be due to chimpanzees being intoxicated from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operations and mistaking human children for the western red colobus one of their favorite meals the dangers of careless human interactions with chimpanzees are only aggravated by the fact that many chimpanzees perceive humans as potential rivals and by the fact that the average chimpanzee has over times the upper body strength of a human male local beer is usually brewed illegally along river valleys which are also the habitat of chimps when chimps come across the local brew they drink it become drunk and in that state any encounter with people means an attack hope that answers your question to see some very funny videos type in 'drunk chimp' into yahoo video search or youtube  Alcoholic beverage Common Chimpanzee Hypoglycemia Blood alcohol content Human Ethanol Moonshine Sake Coffee Caffeine Prohibition Wine Beer Paracetamol Cocaine Alcohol French cuisine Drunk driving (United States) Public house Drinking culture Chimpanzee Chimpanzee Genome Project Jane Goodall Soft drink Liver Cannabis (drug) Growth hormone treatment Insulin Breastfeeding Tocopherol Folic acid Weight training Evidence of evolution Coeliac disease Cider Gravity Penis Contract Milk Cancer Nutrition Food Dieting Legal drinking age Puberty Water Driving under the influence Rum Malt liquor Miller Brewing Bodybuilding Autism Canadian slang Animal testing Homer Simpson Absinthe LSD Vomiting Distilled beverage Depleted uranium Bonobo Brewery Suicide methods Growth hormone Chocolate Digital photography Word of Wisdom Race Blood Olduwan Cognitive bias Rape Cirrhosis Cuisine of Denmark Mothers Against Drunk Driving The Mind of an Ape Foodborne illness Anemia Australian words Ebola Fugu Human sexual behavior Glucokinase Non-medical use of dextromethorphan American Sign Language Tea Aspartame Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atkins Nutritional Approach Human height Brown Bear Moe Szyslak Sauna Road traffic accident Sewage treatment

champagne tastings i am going to be in reims in march and am interested in doing a champagne tasting i am going to be based in paris so i only have one day for this the houses that i have found reccommended are launois pere et fils mercier alfred gratien perrier jouet pommerier mailey grand cru velve cliquot mumm tattinger and maison veuve cliquot ponsardin naturally i don't have time to see all of these can you reccommend a top btw reims is in the champagne region of france btw reims is in the champagne region of france and is the place for champagne mercier is well worth visiting has a nice tour of its cellars but it is not located in reims but in epernay perrier jouet is in epernay so is alfred gratien launois is not in reims and you need to make an appointment veuve cliquot ponsardin is in reims but you must make an appointment for a tour in advance i am puzzled by the person who recommends veuve cliquot ponsardin but then says to forget veuve cliquot since they are one and the same i never heard of pommerier do you mean pommery mailey grand cru isn't a champagne house it is the name of a vineyard area pere fils just means 'father son' and is like part of a winery name launois pere fils which is in mesnil sur oger mumm is in reims center a short walk from the rail station and has a good tour of the cellars before the tasting taittinger is in reims but quite a long walk from the station it is well worth seeing because it has some incredible old pyramidical cellars hand cut out of the chalk by the romans you will probably find it difficult to do more than two winery visits in one day in reims since you'll want to go on a tour conducted in english you'll probably need mins hours per house i hour for tour mins for tasting and some time in the gift shop etc and they close for lunch i'd plan on mumm taittinger both in reims center and if time pommery which is near taittinger both good tours interesting cellars and very good wines there are some champagne shops in reims by the cathedral which offer tastings the cathedral is very historic and worth seeing and the tourist office next to it has maps of the champagne houses and details of visiting but i suggest you do your research before hand and check when the engllish language tours are running see http www maisons champagne com traduction english limach gb htm for links to teh champagne houses websites if you went to epernay there are many champagne all next to each other down one road and you can walk out of one and right into the next one champagne's biggest market is the uk its less than hours drive from the channel ports so they are very used to english speaking visitors english is widely spoken and all the larger champagne houses speak english you'll have a great time don't forget to order a glass or bottle of champagne with your lunch in reims  Champagne (beverage) Reims Wine Champagne-Ardenne __pernay The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Rais massacre Cape Town Buckingham Palace History of Test cricket (to 1883) Lake District Montreal Terroir Wall Street Rose (Doctor Who) Cathedral architecture Champagne (province) Palace of Westminster Hobart Allied Domecq Grand Forks, North Dakota Quebec City, Quebec Cork Cider Tours Archbishop of Reims Shaggy dog story Tourism Bruno of Cologne Social rule Francis Bacon (painter) Pacific, Missouri Sydney Riot of 1879 Plame affair Gothic architecture The Death Gate Cycle Anjou Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Louis XIV of France Wines of Portugal Chinese language Pinot Noir About a Boy Chris Amon Picard language 24 Hours of Le Mans Jean-Baptiste Colbert Abbey Tourism in Hawaii Dijon Little Britain Asterix Internet slang France in the Middle Ages LVMH House of Bourbon Philip II of France Braunschweig Shiraz grape Ithaca, New York Isle of Wight The Lovely Bones Manchester Cuisine of Denmark Napa County, California 1991 Governor General's Awards Hampton Roads Brittany Fort Worth, Texas Table tennis Wine bottle Auto racing Canterbury Cathedral Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dallas, Texas Leicester City Centre Hiberno-English Chinatown The Two Doctors Poker jargon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina W.

all grain brewing is it worth the effort how long does it normally take from start to pitching the yeast just curious if i want to go down this road i'm intrigued about some of the recipes i've made with a mini mash combined with a malt extract kit for me it is worth the effort i can only say for you that it may be you expressed some curiosity with it and this may the signal you got the bug once bitten by the all grain bug many people never or rarely do extract again perhaps it is because we feel closer to the brew more like a brewer more control on malt character alcohol mouth feel gravity etc i only do extracts now when time is limited all grain brewing which involves the mash sparge procedures can take to hours for an infusion mash and perhaps double that for a decoction this includes heating your water for the strike or doughing in adding grist to the hot water other than this all other times boil cooling are the same as with an extract brew so i would say approx hours for an infusion mash and hours for a decoction mash from beginning to pitching decoction mash is really only for pils and a couple other continental lagers and then you would want to get a or row malt from your supplirer many people use a two row variety which would greatly reduce decoction mash times but the method is worth at least a try i recommend you find an all grain brewer to work with him her to discover if its for you enjoy  Beer Homebrewing Coffee Bock Single malt Scotch Sake Bread Tea Vores __l Lager Ale Scotch whisky Alcoholic beverage Food preservation Moonshine Distilled beverage Chinese tea culture Tofu Internal ballistics Pilsener India Pale ale Sugar beet German cuisine Miller Brewing Jewish cuisine British cuisine Rum Sauna Mashed potato Barley Public house Explosive material Cuisine of Africa Cocaine Ayahuasca The Smashing Pumpkins Vinegar Yerba mate Potato Pizza Belgian beer Acetic acid Wheat beer Rice Bagel Samuel Adams (beer) Cat Japanese cuisine Drill bit Solar power Stout beer Welding Food Tamale Hop (plant) Cooking Smoked beer Casting Breakfast Cereal Soy sauce Powder metallurgy Titanium Folic acid Spacecraft propulsion Hemp Alcoholic proof Coors Brewing Company Korean cuisine Lion Nathan Prohibition Common bean Guinness Veganism Russian cuisine Hypoglycemia Yarrow Colorectal cancer Dumpling Yeast E85 Dairy Porter (beer) Nuclear reactor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Chocolate Bengali cuisine Hard water Pasta Lambic Sport rowing Toronto Blue Jays

wear can a person in the united states purchase absinthe are there any web sites that ship to the us i am really curious to try the green farie and was hoping someone could help ok so now there are two of us that want to find some absinthe anyone have any information excuse my spelling mistake please this is a best answer i gave for a similar question a few months back if you want real absinthe check out eabsinthe com i've ordered from them before and it's a quality site with fast shipping always get it within a few days from the uk to wisconsin never a problem i like the reality czech just right nice herbal flavor i've tried the versinthe la blanche french thought anise licorice was too strong and the abisinthe amer french alcohol a little overpowering high wormwood content is what you're looking for alcohol level can be anywhere between proof as far as hallucinating and it being illegal more of a novelty thing really you're not going to see anything that isnt there but a noticeable extra tingle with your buzz they say it makes the heart grow fonder fun with that special someone if you know what i mean if you actually hallucinated from this you wouldn't be able to get near this stuff it is illegal to sell absinthe but not so much to possess it absinthe recently became legal in the canadian province of british columbia in the us thujone is still banned but as a food rather than a drug you aren't allowed to distill or commercially make absinthe but you can legally own a bottle and even make your own as long as it isn't distilled as far as spelling why is absinthe sometimes spelt without an 'e' this is quite simply a language difference although 'absinthe' is the generic spelling as coined by the swiss and french who were the original absinthe producing nations you will find that around the world there are many different spellings for the word absinthe in the czech republic 'e' is dropped and thus absinth the spanish say absenta and the italians say assenzio but they all mean absinthe it is worth noting that the spelling absinth without an 'e' usually denotes that the brand comes from eastern europe and is likely to be czech style' which means that it is unlikely to louche turn cloudy when water is added due to the little to no anise used compared to the traditional swiss french style have fun ps dont forget to buy a spoon  Public house Hangover Alcoholic beverage Brewing Peruvian cuisine Open source Drunkenness Miller Brewing Drinking culture Beer Tap (valve) Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Cuisine of the Philippines Alcoholism Breakfast Brewery Stone Cold Steve Austin Rice University Soft drink Sauna Guinness Oktoberfest Root beer AFI (band) Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

organic wines popular brands of organic wines that you may find in your every day grocery store thank you organic wine isn't quite what you'd think it is wine that doesn't have any added sulfites the reason i am researching this is because i work at a super market and after discussing the topic with a customer we concluded that we probably sell it but it not separated from the rest of the wine we sell what i'd like to do is separate them and advertise them as such but i need to know what popular brands are indeed organic i've been disappointed that in every store i've checked the organic wines are few and mixed in with other varietals check with your store s personnel where you shop for what they carry cost plus carries a few brands imports and i've only found organic wine choices at the trader joe's in my area a local food co op would offer more choices too  Soft drink Can't Hardly Wait Wine Alcoholic beverage Drink Bar (establishment) Drinking culture Carbonated water Bottle Coffeehouse Tapper Alcoholism Homer Simpson Beer Public house Beer Hall Putsch Word of Wisdom Legal drinking age Prohibition The Coca-Cola Company Cadbury Schweppes Cider Spanish cuisine Tapas Guinness Aramaic of Jesus Lemonade Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

how to make cider at home make cider alcohol type here is a simple way to make cider the alcoholic stuff this is a traditional method of cider making that produces amazing results we tried making our own kitchen produced cider following this stunningly simple set of instructions see below the results exceeded our wildest dreams and i am planning another vintage pressing this year we use a mix of worcester pairmain and cox apples from our garden choosing apples for making cider remove the fruit from your apple tree and wash your apples discarding all magotty rotten or mouldy specimens do not be tempted to buy apple juice at any point if you are going to make cider then at least go to the effort of making cider which tastes of real apples if you use apple juice you will be dissapointed pulping apples for making cider pulp the apples there are many ways of doing this for small volumes you can use an electric kitchen juicer or a blender the more traditional and environmentally friendly method is to stand above a strong bucket half full of apples and hit the apples repeatedly with a heavy object we tried both and eventually settled on using the blender with a grater attachment so effectively we push our apples through a cheese grater the traditional method was just too much hard work for us be careful because cheaper models of blenders and juicers have very weak motors which will blow at the slightest siff of a pound of worcester pairmains we went for the magimix le duo juice extractor from john lewis the bigger the motoer the better pressing apples for making cider now you have to press your apple pulp for small volumes a kitchen press such as this is fine but if you want to make more than or three gallons i suggest you invest in a bigger press our home made apple press consisted of four g clamps and two pieces of old melamine board an old kitchen work surface we wrap apple pulp with all apple presses you have to pulp the apples before pressing the juice out in cheesecloth and place it between the boards and start turning the screws the juice drips out on all four sides into a large shallow tray after two years we decided that to make cider in the quantities we wanted we would have to buy a cider press but for your first experiments in cider making this will do just fine fermenting apples for making cider pour your juice into a cleaned and sterilized wooden keg from a home brewery supply store you should fill the keg to the top having an only half full keg is apparently a sure fire recipe for vinegar no yeast needs to be added traditional cider making relies on wild yeasts so remove the bung on the top of the keg to let some yeast in the fermentation starts in days and you will see white froth bubbling up through the bung hole do not panic at this point wait for for several weeks until fermentation stops and then replace the bung maturing cider leave your cider to mature for at least months and then after tasting a sip to ensure it hasn't gone horribly wrong invite some friends round to enjoy a strong we got alcohol sweet and cloudy glass of traditional cider remember not to drink and drive brewers notes you can add brewers yeast at step if you live in the wilds of northern alaska or cleethorpes where there doesn't seem to be enough good yeast in the air you can add sugar to up the alcohol content and sweetness but start with traditional cider made the old fashioned way we got an email about the cloudiness of the cider this is actually natural but if you really need to get rid of it then speak to your local home brewery shop they will probably sell you a packet of powdered fish bladder isinglass or horses hooves finings which are the traditional tools used to remove the cloudiness in beer i you find that a batch goes off you may have too many dodgy yeast strains in the atmosphere a campden tablet available from home brewery suppliers will solve the problem add it to the next batch of apple juice and then wait two days before adding a sachet of brewers yeast this will pretty much guarantee fermentation goes off without a hitch old litre plastic fizzy drinks bottles will do if you want to produce more than a barrelful of cider  Tobacco smoking The Smoking Room Smoking ban Lung cancer Cigar Cannabis (drug) Bong Health issues and the effects of cannabis Social rule Cancer Tobacco advertising

what does it take to open up a small bar i have an idea for a small bar and would like to open one up can someone tell me what it takes as far as licensing goes and how much investment it will take do i need to be a bartender to own a bar how much money can you expect to make your first year and what are the challenges first is a license the going price in my neighborhood is cash only it can not be encumbered by a lien from property or other assets also you must determine if one is available the liquor control commission allows each municipality to determine how many licenses are allowed by population your application also involves a criminal background check the license can only be in an individuals name no corporation don't even think about getting a dwi your license would be in jeopardy ok next is obvious such as location lease insurance etc cash for initial inventory expect a minimum of to start all subsequent orders must be paid in days if not all distributors will require cash only and a notice will be given to the liquor control board ok this is mostly a cash business the irs and the state knows this so pay your taxes they like to watch businesses that deal with a lot of cash also because it is mostly cash you have to have controls to make sure every drink is rung in the cash register there are many tricks around this you would be amazed ok inventory control liquor wine and beer is very expensive very easy to give away to patrons by over pouring or under ringing the minimum is once a week if there is a problem you can hopefully find it yes the bar business is very profitable and can be fun you have to be very much in control  Hangover The Shining (film) Alcoholic beverage Chicken soup Vitamin Alcoholics Anonymous Placebo (band) Quaker Oats Company Disulfiram Gastroparesis Andrew Dice Clay Gatorade Jackass: The Movie Midnight Run Cannabis cultivation New York Giants Bacon Fertilizer Folic acid W.I.T.C.H.

what wine should i buy my mom so im not a drinker at all and thought a nice wine would be a great present so which one do you recommend bah if you think you're mom would like a bottle of wine then buy her one it depends on what other beverages she likes if she tends to prefer sugary drinks like soda and juice she will probably prefer a sweeter wine such as a dessert wine or concord wine other sweet varietals available in the us include niagara white ad catawba can be pink or white and several others if she tends to shy away from sweet beverages then go for a lighter wine if she isn't a big wine drinker i would stay away from most red wine especially the heavier ones she could get a headache from the sulfates often present in the wine and probably won't enjoy a heavy red wine right off the bat in any case italian and spanish wines tend to be very good for the price white zin is almost a dirty phrase in the wine drinking community so if you ask a salesperson at a good wine shop don't be surprised if they don't recommend it and always remember the definition of a good wine is a wine i like to drink  Wine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Languedoc Pinot Noir Illegal drug trade French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Alcoholic beverage Wine making Champagne (beverage) Pisco Sailing Culture of France Intellectual property Hydrogen economy Zinfandel Softball Rigging Baseball Moonshine Renewable energy Shannon Airport Prohibition Cable television Gun politics Word of Wisdom British cuisine Welding Cider Nintendo Korean cuisine Brandy Telephone numbering plan Appeal Avignon Papacy Capitalism Commodore 64 Publicly funded medicine Price discrimination Eastern Orthodox Church Mercantilism Classified information Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Tax French cuisine Government of France Amateur radio Grey market Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Coffee Expert system French hip hop Lawyer Wines of Portugal Robert M.

where did calling a drink a cocktail come from there are several plausible theories as to the origin of the term cocktail among them are colonial taverns kept their spirits rum brandy whiskey gin applejack in casks and as the liquid in the casks lowered the spirits would tend to lose both flavor and potency so the tavern keeper would have an additional cask into which the tailings from the low casks could be combined and sold at a reduced price the patrons requesting the cock tailings or the tailings from the stop cock of the cask this was h l mencken's belief cocktails were originally a morning beverage and the cocktail was the name given as metaphor for the rooster cocktail heralding morning light of day this was first posited in by ted haigh in vintage spirits forgotten cocktails and can be distinguished from the theory take two snips of the hair of the dog that bit you which refers to consuming a small bit of alcohol the morning after a binge drinking night to curb the effects of the symptoms of the hangover in the belief that these symptoms are the result of a form of withdrawal a cock's tail has many varied feathers in exciting colours as a cocktail has varied exciting alcoholic drinks mixed together further the cloaca in the tail of cock is the exit hole for many impure substances alcohol can be harmful and mixing drinks can be dangerous some say that it was customary to put a feather presumably from a cock's tail in the drink to serve both as decoration and to signal to teetotalers that the drink contained alcohol another etymology is that the term is derived from coquetier a french egg cup which was used to serve the beverage in new orleans in the early th century the beverage was named for a mixed breed horse known as a cock tail as the beverage like the horse was neither strictly spirit nor wine it was a mixed breed the word could also be a distortion of latin aqua decocta meaning distilled water  Brush Bong Water Champagne (beverage) Wine Fiddler on the Roof Hustler Magazine v.

nothing better than an ice cold beer right wrong why do so many people believe this myth i know it supposedly started with the major beer companies wanting to mask the taste of their beers but why is it so popular while there is no absolute correct answer as to what temp to serve beer at most beer geeks know that you don't want it ice cold or in a frosty mug joe i know many people that come home to an nice cold not ice cold import or micobrew i'm one of them nothing better than an ice cold beer right wrong i think that the reason there is no absolut correct temperature to serve a beer is do to tastes and preference i still say it is a matter of taste and when on a hot day in much the way joe said a cold or ice cold lighter beer really hits the spot they are light flavored and satiating i strongly disagree that it is to mask flavors but at the same time i must agree that this does occur as the taste buds have a bit of cold shock which prevents tasting the food beverage to some degree we drink soda water and other beverages the same way origin i think you are corect sir it is the marketing of the brewers large brewers and it is tied to the invention of refrigeration back in the day beer was warm due to the fact we had no refer even the cold brewerd pils were served warm the first commercial refers were utilized by establishments such as bars due to their expense brewers ceased upon this and marketed the idea of cold beer and when technology converged packaging cans bottles with home refegeration the cold beer craze hit the brewers ceased upon this and marketed the idea of cold beer at home entertaing etc it was a bit of a status symbol to have a refer we americans really take things to the extreme ales lagers temperature ales are fermented at about f and lagers about f with some variation and so we tend to associate drinking the beers at these temperatures i think it is marketing status and preference that contribute to the myth the ice cold beer is best enjoy  Rum Tea Cuisine of the Philippines Martini cocktail Ice cream Coconut milk Coffee Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Malaysia Milkshake Tofu Yoplait Daiquiri Curry Mayonnaise Laksa Milk Bubble tea Peruvian cuisine Wine Cuisine of Vietnam Cold Stone Creamery Vinegar Rice pudding Beer Yoghurt Soup Russian cuisine Muesli Chocolate Cuisine of Cambodia Breakfast Cider Jelly Belly Fanta Cuisine of Thailand Salad Japanese cuisine Idli Bread Halva Cacha__a Long Island Iced Tea Pancake Bengali cuisine Cuba Libre Sherbet Guinness Dairy Coconut Cuisine of Brazil Tapioca Mung bean Mango Gelato Cheese Moonshine Cuisine of Denmark B__chamel sauce Drink Single malt Scotch Chutney Oreo Chicken soup Grog Cuisine of Africa Sangr__a Kit Kat Food Alcoholic beverage Ketchup Kiwifruit Champagne (beverage) Porridge Cooking Paella Mooncake Chaaru Punch (drink) Hong Kong-style milk tea Satay Pimm's Liqueur Kosher foods Apple pie Wine making Pizza Cappuccino Honey Christmas pudding Soft drink Gazpacho Custard Jewish cuisine

i have to invest what should i do i have about to invest i was thinking about using it to open a bar they always seem to make money i would like to also hear from people that have owned bars and how they did financially was it good money i was thinking about using about half of this money for the lease for the six months or so then the rest for the start up costs liquor licenses and decorating the bar how i want it seems to be a good way to make money to me i am open to other ideas or suggestions on how to invest this money i am not sure which state you live in but to purchase a liquor license in the state of florida the going rate is about a successful bar does make money but the work is harder than it looks and good honest help is not that easy to find theft is very common in the bar business as far as employees stealing and giving drinks away to their friends the bar owner should really be present and keep an eye on things to make sure they are not being ripped off on a regualr basis it is also not that easy to find bar help that is dependable and reliable and someone to stay sober long enough to make it through their shift or to show up sober free of drugs or alcohol there are good honest people that work in bars but they are not as easy to find keep in mind that many bars open and close with in the first year and the ones that are successful the owner is usually present seven days a week at least for the first few years promoting is also a full time job for the owner very few places open and are a success without something going on either live music sports specials or whatever and that is done either by mouth from the employees or advertising which can be very costly don't forget the liability where alcohol is concerned usually insurance cost for the business is higher owning is bar can be fun but it is also a lot of work and you are always taking the chance of being sued by someone i would invest in something not so stressful like a rental property why don't you look for a commercial property and own the land that the bar sits on you will be guaranteed a monthy income from the rent and the work won't be nearly as difficult  Alcoholic beverage Beer Breastfeeding Ethanol Folic acid Alcohol Sake Milk Brewery Brewing Cider Tocopherol Veganism Distilled beverage Wine Ale Prohibition Wheat beer Word of Wisdom Alcohol fuel Omega-3 fatty acid Coffee Fermentation Rum Alcohol consumption and health Soft drink Homebrewing Moonshine Single malt Scotch Yeast Guinness Public house Atkins Nutritional Approach Nutrition French paradox Rooibos Genetically modified food Chocolate Stout beer Pasteurization Absinthe Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Healthy eating Coronary heart disease Lager German beer Grog Herpes simplex virus Hangover Tea Vitamin C Hypoglycemia Alcohol advertising Aspartame Gasoline Vodka Porter (beer) Blood alcohol content Cancer Food Sugar substitute Tobacco smoking Alzheimer's disease Organic food Polychlorinated biphenyl Osteoporosis Cocaine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Drink Medical analysis of circumcision Carbon dioxide Bock Disinfection Gout Pisco Glycemic index Drinking culture Coeliac disease Hepatitis Sleep Soy protein Guinea pig Sauna Hypertension Benzene Caffeine Flavonoid Drug abuse Cuisine of Argentina Cholesterol

why does mixing your drinks get you drunker i once heard it explained via this little ditty beer on wine and i feel fine wine on beer and i feel queer you drink the lower percentage alcohol and get used to drinking at a certain rate you then move to a higher percentage and keep drinking at the same rate in other words effectively drinking more alcohol over the same time period so in the first hours you have beers then in the next hours you have large wines spirits which is about the same as or more beers can be even worse if you free pour and then gulp the wine spirit the same way as a gulp of beer rather than just sipping at them makes sort of sense when you think of it that way  Champagne (beverage) Wine Alcoholic beverage Pisco Brandy Port wine Cider Rum Homebrewing Shiraz grape Cabernet Sauvignon Tokaji Kosher foods Moonshine Beer German wine Brewery Craps Mead Pinot Noir Tea Tofu Madeira wine Sake Grape Scotch whisky Wines of Portugal Coffee Wine degustation Sherry Single malt Scotch Terroir Bong Varietal Chocolate Zinfandel Phylloxera Laserdisc Ice wine Vodka N__gociant Carbon dioxide Cognac (drink) Vinegar Japanese tea ceremony Roman eating and drinking Sewage treatment Honey Kosher wine Dice White Zinfandel Advanced Squad Leader Photographic film Country wine Wine bottle Cellular respiration Trademark Chinese wine Ethanol Balsamic vinegar Korean cuisine Sea-Monkey Hardware random number generator Tannin Kashrut Drill bit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Expert system Philippe de Rothschild Acetic acid Tartaric acid Barolo Fermentation Riesling Biodiesel Chardonnay Dialysis Ch__teau d'Yquem Soy sauce Organic food Black Books Merlot Mass (liturgy) Kit Kat Potato E85 Squad Leader Chile pepper Eucharist Apple Fanta RuneScape locations Cigar S__millon Bourbon whiskey Tokaj (region in Slovakia) Burgundy wine Neopets Marsala wine

fav drinking game what's yours and tell me all the rule please thankyou categories one person names a category anything really like lindsay lohan movies songs by rem brands of lighters types of airplanes you get the picture it then goes around the table clockwise and people in the group start naming stuff in that category and they have to drink while they think you can stop thinking when you finish your beer people get eliminated and the last person chooses someone other than themselves to choose a new category sometimes there will be a dispute over something two other people at the group must validate your guess so even if it's true people must have heard of it it's fun but you can't really ever play the same category again so it get's old fast another similar game is the name game name someone famous like matt damon and then the person clockwise must name use the initial d for damon as the first name of someone else so maybe dana carvey then use the c for carvey to go on if you hit a double letter like sam shepherd ss you reverse direction drink while you think you can stop when you finish your drink two people must have heard of the person if you want to you can include fake people like bugs bunny or to make it short you can limit it by something like actresses from tv only  Cigarette Tobacco smoking Smoking ban Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency Lung cancer Cigar Smoking pipe Tobacco advertising Bong Cannabis (drug) Mojave people Pulmonary alveolus Camel (cigarette) Kretek Pulmonology Waterworld Luther Leonidas Terry Fire fighting Sauna Pneumonia Billboard (advertising) LL Cool J Benzopyrene Asthma Mesothelioma Legionellosis KaBlam!

brewing with wild yeast in honey i am interested in trying a ginger wine of sorts brewing experiment using spontaneous fermentation with the wild yeast contained in honey and i want to know if this is doomed to failure from the outset and are there any serious health hazzards involved here's my plan boil ginger to make a significant quantity of ginger tea use the ginger tea to cook rice high volume of tea vs rice strain off the grains and allow to the soup to cool to a moderately warm temperature add natural organic unprocessed honey to the ginger rice soup and possibly extra sugar put the mixture in a bottle and shake to aerate add an air lock to the bottle and leave it to sit in a warm place for a long time i have read that some solid honeys contain inactive yeasts which can be seen a little active by the bubbles around the edges these become active when the honey is diluted hopefully there will be sufficient saccharomyces cerevisiae present in the mix to brew completely you are better off adding a cultured yeast instead of relying on the possibility of the wild yeasts being either present or plentiful enough to actually propagate and not be taken over by any other microorganisms when you add yeast instead of taking a chance on wild yeast you ensure the yeast takes over and will give you predictable and desirable results waiting to see if the wild yeast is even present much less prolific is a long shot and does leave a lot of room for other potential infections on top of that honey takes longer to ferment than other sugars so it will be a lot longer into the process before you will find out if you've wasted your time and ingredients or not stick with a good wine yeast or champagne yeast if you're shooting for a drier finish or higher final alcohol yield  Gin Martini cocktail Fundamentalism Alcoholic beverage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles Olive oil Ice cream Tea Scotch whisky Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Vodka Wine Judaism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Appeal God Roman Catholic Church Sloe gin Rum Champagne (beverage) Textile manufacturing Cinnamon Food preservation Oregano Jewish principles of faith Chocolate Existence of God Nineteen Eighty-Four Atheism Vanilla Glen Jacobs Church of Christ, Scientist Meaning of life Cheese James Bond Ten Commandments Martin Luther Kitsch Religious pluralism Prayer Esotericism Cuisine of the Philippines Christianity Idolatry Basic taste Prophet Jewish cuisine Bread Young Earth creationism Flavouring Homosexuality and Christianity Milkshake The nature of God in Western theology Creationism Supernatural Religion Iglesia ni Cristo Apocrypha Funeral Witchcraft Theology Cover version Predestination Gin rummy Epistemology Abrahamic religion Sapphire Pisco Babylon 5 Tofu Biblical inerrancy Opus Dei Dynamical system Sushi McDonald's George Edward Moore Sin Cliff Richard Messianic Judaism Church of Christ William M.

any good alcoholic drink ideas for a party i'm having a birthday party for my soon to be year old and i planned on making drinks for us adults nothing too heavy but more like a cocktail party thing a large bowl of sangria it looks and tastes great plus it is easy to make in large batches make sure you allow plenty of time for the fruit to soak as it usually goes with kids you wont have much time to waste so the party will go smoother if you dont have to constantly make drinks for everyone have a large punch bowl out fill it up before the party keep some of it for backup and actually enjoy the party  The Chemical Brothers Blood on the Tracks Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Daiquiri Muslim ibn Aqeel Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat Harry Nilsson Good Morning, Vietnam Limp Bizkit SmartAsk Dawson's Creek Jean Grey Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Ariel (Firefly episode) Family (Buffy episode) Simon Tam The Supremes Angel One (TNG episode) Rich Mullins Guiding Light The Drew Carey Show Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Big Brother UK series 6 Kain (Legacy of Kain) Eurotrip Supergirl Father's Day (Doctor Who) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mama's Family Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what factors do you consider when selecting a wine is price important is reputation important is the design on the label important many factors involved where where i am having the wine if i were to drink at home it really does not matter just whatever i had left if i were at a restaurant i look at the price and pick out the most cost reasonable bottle for the occasion if i were at a wine bar or winery i pretty much will try anything to discover new and exciting wines who with whom am i drinking if i were with my drinking friends then i would be drinking high quality cab or merlot if i were at a party champagne may be at order i tend to pick out wines that other people like and i would drink to that quality life is too short to drink cheap wines more specifically cheaply made wines what we want is good priced wine without sacrificing quality on special occasions i would open very nice wines but on regular occasions i want good quality wines that would complement the food there is nothing worse than a nice dinner with bad wines as for the definition of quality it is pretty much based on experience and reading price price is important in general an expensive wine are wines that are well made but not necessarily good wine the pricing of the wine is based on factors how much the vineyard and the winery put into making the wine and how they feel the wine is worth needless to say great wine that are highly sought after are expensive also it also depends on where i get the wine wines at restaurants are at least times the retail price wine at sam's and costco's are below retail prices so when i am out at a restaurant i tend not to order the expensive stuff unless someone else is paying vintage what vintage is the wine from certain year is better than others this is especially important when drinking older wines some wines may be too old and not good for drinking also if you are planning to cellar your wine you will want to get the better vintages which means you can cellar the wines longer reputation reputation is important in general a good winery will continue to make good wines there are some vineyard winery that has horrible rating yet we keep on supporting them due to prior reputation best exampmle is chateau montelena which gets horrible rating from wine spectator for several years but we keep on buying and drinking their wines when a winery keeps on producing bad wines we avoid them like plague recommendation i buy a lot of wine and quite a number of them were purchased based on recommendation from the wine salespeople who knows me and whom i trust from articles in wine magazines from word of mouth the fact is that there are too many wines out there and no one can possible drink every single wine there is so sometimes you will have to have faith and trust someone's recommendation rating the same goes with rating you have to take the rating with grain of salt rating from wine spectator and wine advocate and robert parker etc are good guide but everyone like their wines differently so what's good for mr bob parker may not be good for you in fact there are some suspicion that the rating at some of the magazines may be influenced by the amount of advertisement placed within the magazine unfortunately design of the bottle and design of the label are not important at all these are mere gimmicks to attract the less educated wine public to buy their wines we avoid a lot of the critter wines wine with animals on the label  Brewery Beer Brewing Wine making Sake Cider Lambic Lager Tofu Yeast Rum Wheat beer Bock Milk Coffee Wine Ethanol Fermentation Tea Alcoholic beverage Basic taste Cuisine of the Philippines Vinegar Egg (food) Honey K__lsch (beer) Rooibos Cuisine of Denmark Guinness Acetic acid Ale Moonshine Yoghurt Biochemistry Belgian beer Breakfast Guinea pig Russian cuisine German beer Kombucha Diseases of the honeybee Vitamin C Cellular respiration Champagne (beverage) Iron Food Reinheitsgebot Alcohol fuel Keg Cheese Japanese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Water Vodka Candidiasis Yarrow Enzyme Breastfeeding Chocolate German cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Food science Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Veganism Idli Budweiser Budvar Mead Social rule Pisco Pilsener Distilled beverage Hard water Lactobacillus acidophilus Chicha Carburetor Honeybee Tattoo Dog Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Grog Tempeh HIV test Fire extinguisher Prion Singlish Mango Garlic India Pale ale Fungus Wine degustation

this is a two part question about wine first what is a sulfite second what is thepurpose of a cork i bought some wine that didnt have a cork does that have anything to do with the quality of the wine but what is a sulfite first the cork a cork is just a cap stopper it is the soft bark of a tree it was used for its ability to seal jugs and bottles in the past people would judge a wines quality by whether it had a cork or not today that is not the case many very good quality wines around the world are using synthetic plastic corks also now in vague is twist caps for the same good wines all wines contain sulfites sulfites are created naturally as a byproduct of fermentation in the wine making process and they have also been added by wine makers for decades as a natural preservative unfortunately a very tiny proportion of people are allergic to sulfites a dangerous and potentially fatal allergy sulfite sensitive individuals who have survived into adulthood know what they must avoid a list that includes wine fruit juice sausages salad bars and many other foodstuffs that routinely use sulfiting in production although the threat is small the u s food and drug administration fda has required since that all foodstuffs containing more than parts per million of sulfites which includes virtually all wines must bear a warning label wines made in the u s may contain as much as parts per million an extreme level rarely attained except perhaps in cheap jug wines at which point the sulfur may be perceptible as a pungent aroma resembling a burnt match some processed foods in contrast contain up to parts per million relax do not worry about sulsites or corks just enjoy  Wal-Mart Slide rule Auction Amazon.com Bong Philatelic investment Topps The Towering Inferno (film) Neopets Craps Magic: The Gathering Online Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bowls Internet fraud Autograph MAME Hypermarket Shen Gong Wu Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) ASDA Super Mario Bros. 3 Naval mine Carnival glass Electronic commerce Austin Powers GunBound Conker's Bad Fur Day Dot-com Online auction business model John F.

is this considered too much drinking my parents both come home from work and immediately start drinking sometimes they only finish half a bottle of wine and other nights they finish a whole bottle and or multiple cocktails some nights more than others i can tell when they have been drinking because there personality changes and i can barely stand to talk to them i have tried telling them that they need to cut back on drinking but they tell me that it makes them happy and they deserve it they won't listen to me and sometimes they just laugh at me what can i do or say to change this please help thanks a drug alcohol abuse professional would say that drinking more than glasses of wine in a sitting is alcohol abuse most people who have a drinking problem have to realize it on there own so confronting them often doesn't work however this does not mean that you should not try i would suggest getting other family members involved if you feel it is that bad if you have siblings talk to them about it if not try an aunt or uncle  Blood alcohol content Urine Urinary incontinence Drunk driving (United States) Hepatitis Dehydration Alcoholism Cocaine Hypoglycemia Urinary system Housebreaking Caffeine Drinking Gout Drug test Urination Driving under the influence Disinfection Diabetes insipidus Prostate cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Urolagnia Drink Distilled beverage Leptospirosis Kidney stone Hong Kong Disneyland Driver's license Flunitrazepam Cystoscopy Alcohol Halitosis Energy drink Pregnancy Carbon tetrachloride Marathon (sport) Diabetes mellitus Dutch Schultz Drunkenness Porphyria Alcoholic beverage Diuretic Urinalysis Hyperthermia Bar (establishment) Adolf Hitler's medical health Ethanol Trimipramine Breathalyzer Fluoride Pneumonia Dairy Soft drink Legal drinking age Paracetamol Kidney Cirrhosis Liver function tests Benzene LSD Skylab 3 Urine therapy Cocktail Dexamethasone Laika Public house Human chorionic gonadotropin Paget's disease of bone Urinary tract infection Richard Chase 1,4-dichlorobenzene Diazepam Doping (sport) Birthday Bupropion Forensic toxicology Pregnancy test Cancer Coffee Coca-Cola Binge drinking Alcoholics Anonymous Medical analysis of circumcision Depleted uranium Mothers Against Drunk Driving Blackcurrant Hyperglycemia Hangover Body piercing Prohibition Jim Morrison Polyethylene terephthalate Shaggy dog story Mountain Dew Phenylketonuria Alcohol advertising Ultraviolet Glucose tolerance test STS-58 Sugar alcohol

when homebrewing an english stout can i use a glass carboy for the initial fermentation i've looked to various resources and seen different answers some instructions say the glass carboy is for the secondary fermentation racking however with a stout i don't think i'm going to do a secondary fermentation i have an autosiphon so transferring isn't an issue i'm worried about the pressure from the active ferment and the possibility of a glass shrapnel bomb in my basement if my co valve gets blocked any ideas experiences to share thanks generally people start homebrewing with the bare necessities because the equipment costs can add up when getting started so the starting equipment is usually a bucket and a carboy plastic buckets are slightly oxygen permeable so while they work fine for primary fermentation when co production is high and there is a slight positive pressure within the bucket they can allow some oxidising when used for secondary fermentation and have the possibility of hurting the final flavors this is why glass is recommended over plastic for secondary however using glass for primary is a step up so you're always going to win using glass for both primary and secondary your carboy will not explode if your airlock gets plugged up it will be ejected from the neck of the carboy before the carboy will break it's still possible and for that reason a lot of people who do primary in carboys will use a blowoff tube instead of an airlock when the bubbles and the foam gets too vigorous it will just blow off into a bucket of water instead of clogging up and possibly blowing off your airlock besides i like blowoff tubes because the bubbling amuses me  Oktoberfest Glastonbury Festival Edinburgh Fringe 613 mitzvot Restaurant Eucharist Isle of Wight Festival 1970 Cuisine of Denmark Passover Foxwoods Resort Casino Cliff Richard PIC microcontroller Woodstock Festival Hobart Wine Zellers French cuisine Asti Falls Festival Jewish holiday Filling station Kiddush King City, Ontario Supermarket Brittany Jerez de la Frontera Slayers Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Oasis (band) Burning Man Woodstock 1999 The Times Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife Oxegen Convenience store Patricia Ford Bl__t Agritourism Lollapalooza Kylie Minogue Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Britney Spears C__line Dion Blue __yster Cult Moscow Coimbra Quebec City, Quebec Isle of Wight Microeconomics Southwest Airlines Public transport Eid ul-Fitr Walt Disney World College Program East Carolina University $ale of the Century Khatushyamji Beef noodle soup Eucharistic discipline Movie theater Icod de los Vinos Burger King Thanksgiving Oregon Country Fair UB40 The Darkness Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Culture of Korea Champagne (beverage) Vinegar Green Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election Wright Amendment San Fernando City, Pampanga Octopus card Hungry ghost Supply and demand Korean cuisine Jewish cuisine Zagreb Australian jazz National Day Parade Cheese Halloween Food and Drug Administration Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Big Brother UK series 6 Vienna RuneScape skills Magic: The Gathering Online Sears Holdings Corporation Animal Farm Wheel of Fortune Lottery Microsoft Office The Who discography Let's Make a Deal Airline Adelaide Film Festival Renaissance Fair Robert M.

ideas for maintaining a good brew temperature i've been home brewing for a while but i've yet to find a good way to maintain a good brew temperature during the summer i've tried freezing liter bottles of water and putting them in the closet i've tried putting the carboy in a cooler of water this one ruined my brewometer and also tried putting a shirt soaked in cold water around the carboy any other ideas i was thinking of just grabbing a fan but thats kind of a waste of electricity put the carboy in a tub of water below the level of your brewometer and wrap a wet towel around the rest of the carboy making sure a good part of the towel is submerged in the water place a small fan facing the wet towel and the carboy will cool due to the evaporation of water off the towel you can also take those l bottles of frozen water and float them in the tub to water alongside your carboy i made a lagering closet big enough for carboys simple x strips of wood to make a cabinet between the stays i cut inch insulation to fit and covered it inside and out with very thin plywood veneer just for aesthetics on the back of the cabinet near the top i made small cutouts for piezo coolers and a temperature probe the whole contraption draws less electricity than a lightbulb and can get the cabinet down to lagering temps in a few days  Beer Stout beer Alcoholic beverage Miller Brewing Ale Microbrew RuneScape quests Beer Pong Sin City Coffee Brewing Dairy Soft drink Anheuser-Busch Craps Drink Public house Vodka Milk Rainier Brewing Company Make money fast Drinking game Cider Wheat beer Brewery Samuel Adams (beer) Moonshine Canadian beer Root beer float Moe Szyslak Porter (beer) Australian words Budweiser Budvar Alcoholics Anonymous Lager Bong Chappelle's Show Shark Homebrewing Little Britain Menstrual cup Bottle French cuisine Cadbury Schweppes Plame affair Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Isinglass Vinegar Homer Simpson Joke Canadian slang Root beer K__lsch (beer) Haarlem President (game) Veganism Oreo Neopets Year of the Spider Cuisine of Denmark Irn-Bru Shit German beer German cuisine Theory of conduct Cocktail Viz (comic) Chocolate Reinheitsgebot First aid Tap (valve) Distilled beverage The Marshall Mathers LP Friends Jackass: The Movie American lager Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sherbet Martini cocktail Sake Eucharist Parachuting Cuisine of Finland Anthony Burgess Akvavit Wine Blackjack Bread Russian cuisine Bock Culture of France Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Can't Hardly Wait Mothers Against Drunk Driving Frogman

why do some wines become cloudy or turbid when they are cold or chilled does it something to do with the protein present in the wine yes some wines do become cloudy turbid when cold yes proteins have some effect on the haze in wines however this should not be a result of haze forming chemicals as they are removed by the wine maker any hazes in a commercially produced wine is a physical condition as a liquid's density inecreaes with decreasing in temperatures the result is a perseived false cloudiness sometimes a bacterial contamination could cause a wine to become cloudy i listed a summary of stability haze factors below there exists several components and environmental in wines parameters that contribute to a wines stability some crytal formation potassium bitartrate calcium tartrate occur in wines but usually do not affect wine clariety these crystals are removed through filtrations although they are sometimes found in the bottle protein stabitity colloidal stability polysaccaharides stability are major sources of haze cloudy turbidity in grape juice and wines heat tests reveal some of their physical properties while cold tempertures help with the filtrational removal of these haze inducing components protein stabitity the slow development of protein hazes cloudy turbid in white wines is perhaps the next most common physical instability after precipitation of potassium bitartrate the levels of total protein show only a poor correlation with the incidence of protein hazes protein instability is treated with use of bentonite colloidal stability colloids can be defined as partially soluble components whose distribution between its soluble and insoluble phases is dependent on the temperature dielectric properties and the polarity of the surrounding solvent in juices and wines the colloids can be classified simply into proteins polysaccharides and complexes between proteins and phenols and between proteins and polysaccharides polysaccaharides two groups the first group includes the pectins which are polymers of galacturonic acid that are partially esterified with methyl groups galactose arabinose galacturonic acid rhamnose and glucose the major fractions are rhamnogalacturans arabinogalactans and arabans also included are b glucans produced by boytris infection the second group includes those released by yeast during fermentation and by certain bacteria a polysaccahrides which contain a significant protein component is called a glycoprotein polysaccahrides are removed by filtration and microfiltrations protein tannin complexes haze formations between polymeric phenols and grape proteins has been demonstrated for the largest molecular weight tannin fraction in a wine protein soltion higher amounts were required of smaller molecular weight polymeric phenols to produce similar hazes the nontannin fraction of the phenols was not able to form such hazes with the wine proteins enjoy  Alcoholism Fecal incontinence Dehydration Bodybuilding Hangover Alcohol Nutrition Dementia Milk Vitamin Veganism Weight training Dieting Enzyme Cerebellum Tocopherol Anemia Diarrhea Food Cirrhosis Folic acid Vitamin C Breastfeeding Garlic Hyperthermia Retinol Urinary incontinence Food preservation B vitamins Yoghurt Biochemistry Osteoporosis Vitamin D Zinc Inborn error of metabolism Human skin color Traumatic incident reduction Beriberi Marathon (sport) Equine conformation Vitamin poisoning Ketosis Hypomagnesemia Hepatitis Soybean Tlingit Blood alcohol content Puberty Malnutrition Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alcohol fuel Everytime Duchenne muscular dystrophy Cocaine Cauliflower Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Driving under the influence Energy drink Drunkenness Hiking Chicken Marmite Sin City Diabetic ketoacidosis Egg (food) Gout Red meat Driver's license Common cold Poison Cancer Soy protein Nutrient Coca-Cola Urine Drinking Drink Atkins Nutritional Approach Ethanol Alcoholics Anonymous The Shining (film) Spirulina Cholera Water Word of Wisdom Raw food diet Acid Humphrey Bogart Tobacco smoking Timeline of the Universe Mothers Against Drunk Driving Protein-energy malnutrition Fatty acid metabolism Psoriasis Cardiomyopathy Coronary heart disease Inclusion body myositis Trigun characters Ultraviolet

what water bottling company is using tap water is this true and who is it i just heard this today and dont know if it is true or not sorry to burst your bubble but all bottlers who produce distilled or purified water products use tap water as a raw ingredient the water is extensively purified filtered and disinfected before bottling so it is purer and safer than the water that comes out of the tap bottlers are required by law to list their water source either on the bottle directly or on the exterior packaging of a multipack the fact that some products use tap water should be clearly marked whether or not they make a big deal out of publicizing it if you prefer to drink water that has never been through a municipal system you will have to restrict your bottled water consumption to spring water and artesian water products in order to qualify for those labels regulations require that the water come from certified natural ground sources and there are rules about how much purification can be done to make it safe for human consumption contrary to popular belief the bottled water industry is strictly regulated particularly if you buy a fairly well known brand you can rest assured that the product in the bottles is clean safe and free of chlorine and other chemicals  Age of consent Legal drinking age Jurisdiction Lawsuit Public house Case law Stare decisis Tip Common law Drunk driving (United States) Tort International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Law of the United States Trademark Mediation International Criminal Court Euthanasia Driving under the influence Civil union Jury Appeal Law Slander and libel Private international law Civil law (legal system) Will (law) Due process Intestacy Roman law Marbury v.

does getting drunk make people forget conversations had immediately before they began drinking also how much does a person have to drink before they become generally forgetful this question is not in reference to myself a friend forgets a conversation we had right before he got drunk and i am trying to figure out if his drinking may have contributed to his sketchy memory of the conversation although there's some connection between drinking and memory he should remember does he have some other problem or does he just not want to remember  Hangover Alcoholism Co-Dependent's Day Drunkenness Breakfast Alcoholics Anonymous Mothers Against Drunk Driving Alcoholic beverage Blood alcohol content Diana Ross George Best Drunk driving (United States) Brian Griffin Fecal incontinence Legal drinking age Cornell Hangovers Irn-Bru Cocaine Bill W.

does alcoholism result from excessive alcohol use why do some people get addicted to alcohol and some don't is it that addiction results from excessive alcohol use but moderate use won't cause addiction some people will probably say it's partially genetic if that's true is it because addiction results from excessive alcohol use and genetics makes people more likely to use alcohol excessively or would people with a genetic disposition to addiction be much more likely than others to become addicted even if they drink alcohol much less often good question  Vodka Alcoholic beverage Long Island Iced Tea Martini cocktail Lemonade Cocktail Tequila Pernod Ricard Distilled beverage Gin Soft drink Red Bull Cheers Pimm's Double Nickels on the Dime Drink Salmiakki Koskenkorva French cuisine Blackcurrant Case Closed Public house Shandy Lime (fruit) Allied Domecq Def Leppard Ethylene glycol Cotton gin Absolut Vodka Alcopop Coffee James Bond Koskenkorva Guns N' Roses Cacha__a Atomic Kitten Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Gin Blossoms Sherbet Gin Lane William Grant & Sons Snapple National dish Minute Maid Hangover Temperance movement Reflux Johnnie Ray Alcoholism Alcohol Jermaine Dupri Energy drink __douard Manet Jennifer Lopez Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

do sensible drinkers think alcoholics are just greedy and self indulgent no in fact asking a question of that nature begs me to ask how naive are you people that suffer from this crippling ailment are not how you seem to portray them at all alcoholism is something that has its way of creeping up and taking over your life the need to buy drink to alleviate the depression that hits them when they don't have it having had someone in the family who was alcoholic i find your attitude offensive sensible drinkers who occasionally get drunk are nore likely to be aggressive as their metabolism and brain try to compensate for the lack of inhibitions the individual feels the adrenalin rush created does not stimulate the brain for the flight part of the rush just the fight part although alcoholics can be aggressive what they need are people who will tell them the truth about their problem and support them through the chaos that is their life providing stability to those in need of this help can aid them and believe me like any form of drug addiction it is a hour job think hard oh sensible drinker prior to any comment you make regarding those who have any form of dependency as it may just come back to haunt you  Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Scenes from a Memory Alcoholics Anonymous Frankie Goes to Hollywood Professional wrestling slang Jazz Alcoholic beverage USS Taussig (DD-746) Level 42 USS Yorktown (CV-10) Gangsta rap Distilled beverage Kamen Rider 555 Humphrey Bogart Smart and Smarter Smart growth 1957 World Series Leisure USS Toledo (CA-133) Fontella Bass Parade (military) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Liquorice Snorlax Java programming language The Inside Drowning Dumfriesshire Associative array Stuart Smalley USS Yarnall (DD-541) Reflexology USS Abbot (DD-629) 2nd Ring Road (Beijing) Kellogg Company Bratmobile Keicar MSA-0011 S Gundam Marty McFly Ben E.

whats the ingredients of beer how they are manufacturing it it depends on the beer the primary ingredients as established by the german beer industry centuries ago are water malted barley and hops at the time yeast wasn't recognized by the brewers as the mechanism for fermentation yeast is now very well known as a vital ingredient for other styles of beer there can be any number of ingredients for flavor economy and variety called adjuncts these can include other grains like wheat corn or rice they can include molasses or specialty syrups like maple or sorghum belgian styles frequently include fruit like pears cherries raspberries and peaches the list of flavor and specialty components can go on forever depending on how creative the brewer is the basics of how it's made the starch in the grains of the malted barley is converted into sugars called mashing using hot water to activate the enzymes in the malted grain the sugars from the converted starch is rinsed from the grain husks called sparging and this sugary liquid is now called wort the wort is boiled and hops is added for flavor aroma and antiseptic qualities then the wort is cooled and yeast is added called pitching so that the yeast can convert the sugars into alcohol and co fermentation periodically the beer is siphoned from the fermenter into another container to separate the clearing liquid from the sediment of yeast and solids in the beer called racking then it's bottled or kegged there's a lot more detail to it but that's a general account of the process  Martini cocktail Coffee Wine Vodka Cocktail Beer Soft drink Oreo Russian cuisine Rum Milkshake Root beer float Long Island Iced Tea Sake Vanilla Mayonnaise Distilled beverage Moonshine Guinness Ice cream Yoghurt Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines German cuisine Cider Mead Korean cuisine French cuisine Apple pie Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Irn-Bru Vernor's Root beer Alcoholic beverage Cold Stone Creamery Rice pudding Ketchup Cocoa Vinegar Absinthe Chinese wine Idli Champagne (beverage) Vanilla Ice Street food Frappuccino Milk Cuisine of Denmark Plastic Cacha__a Hong Kong-style milk tea Punch (drink) Bong Drink Cognac (drink) Bloody Mary (cocktail) Bread Diet soda Pisco Glass Tofu Liqueur Cuisine of Singapore SoBe Pimm's Smoking pipe Butter Drinking culture Dr Pepper Espresso Yerba mate Polish cuisine Water Pepsi-Cola House music Jewish cuisine Gatorade Port wine Cool as Ice Yoplait Coca-Cola Opinion Cuisine of Laos Cake Liquorice French toast Food Custard Snapple 7 Up Leffe Potato Tamale Breakfast Iron Chef America

i always hear about beer and beer bellys but can you get a belly drinkin several glasses of wine too i always avoid drinking beer but i do drink wine i was drinking cheap wine the other day and woke up with a hang over that morning i felt so bloated fat can i get a wine belly if i drink plenty everyday or every other day or am i paranoid the feeling of being bloated is different to that of actually having a fat belly the actual beer belly which takes years and years to develop is caused mainly because beer contains large quantities or carbohydrates is mainly drunk after dinner and in the evening not long before you sleep these three factors lead to the body storing large quantities of the carbs instead of using it to fuel the body it doesn't need much fuel at night especially after a meal where it has already got its energy  Cigar Cigarette Tobacco Smoking pipe Tobacco smoking Publicly funded medicine Inflation Nintendo Coffee Gross domestic product Chocolate Welding Barbecue Smoking ban Hookah Bong Vinegar Microeconomics Health insurance Bulk vending View camera Tobacco advertising Breakfast Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Tea Mutual fund Cuisine of Denmark United States embargo against Cuba Mattress Soft drink Digital photography Inca Kola ATI Technologies Cannabis (drug) Strap-on dildo RuneScape weapons Saxophone Knife Gas metal arc welding Paintball Public good Energy development Deflation (economics) Kimono Sake Supply and demand FairTax Beavis and Butt-head Public policy MMORPG Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Smoke detector Radio controlled airplane Camel (cigarette) Gramophone record Marriage Mortgage Wine Chewing gum Adverse selection Tequila Dutch Masters Hyperinflation Trailer Park Boys Flat tax Short selling Ra (board game) Arc welding Salary cap Katana Babe Ruth Hearing aid Humidor T.

is alcohol heathy or is it always harmful i think beer is bad for health but something like wine is it healthy to drink not to get drunk though breathing kills brain cells too alcohol in general is not just in drinks but also in foods such as sugar alcohols for sweeteners in candy alcohols also occur naturally in fruits which is why they make such good wine so labeling it as bad or evil or even unhealthy is wrong people are consuming small amounts of alcohol and they don't even know it however alcohol in copious amounts eventually makes your liver focus more on processing the alcohol than on the nutrients you are supposed to be getting this causes your body to become dehydrated and leaches essential vitamins and minerals from your body read hangover it also makes your liver work harder than it needs to thus limiting the lifespan of your liver it is true that a glass of wine a day might make you live longer what they don't tell you is that the same effect is achieved with a glass of vinegar a day but no one wants to drink vinegar beer dark not light has nutrients in the hops and when used as a meal supplement once a day is not horribly unhealthy but the same effect can be achieved with switching to whole wheat bread so it really comes down to human consumption and moderating what you eat or drink treat your body like an expensive automobile you might put a little alcohol in the gas tank for a friday night drag race but you wouldn't fill it up with alcohol to drive around town  Smirnoff Vodka Absolut Vodka Royal Warrant Alcopop Yakov Smirnoff LOL (Internet slang) Lol Coxhill Orange Order Chiasmus Martini cocktail Diageo Michel Gondry Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Alcoholic beverage Pure Pwnage Salmiakki Koskenkorva A Clockwork Orange Branson, Missouri About a Boy Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold William Grant & Sons Ethylene glycol Koskenkorva Internet slang Judge Jules Bottle opener The Old Man and the Key Conquest: Frontier Wars 10cc St John's College, Cambridge Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) T.A.T.u.

why does alcohol make us drunk why does it do this to us basically because it is a drug which attacks the whole of the nervous system it commences by attacvking the area of the brain which causes inhibitions which explains why although it is a depressant it has the initial though false appearance of being a stimulant that also explains why when strating with the intention of 'just one or two' control is lost the higher centres having been 'knocked out' first alcohol gets at parts that other drugs cannot reach it then proceeds to attack the motor co ordination which creates slurred speech faulty handling walking etc taken to even further excess it affects lungs and brain to the extent of shutting off breathing even a minimal amount of alcohol destroys brain cells which are irreplaceable shakespeare put it well when he said' oh god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brain more lives have probably been destroyed by alcohol than all other drugs put together  Soft drink Hypoglycemia Alcoholism Sherbet Word of Wisdom Drink Hepatitis Diet soda Cocktail Chocolate Long Island Iced Tea Ramen Coca-Cola Blood alcohol content Alcohol consumption and health Mountain Dew TLC Hot sauce Alcoholic beverage Prohibition Breastfeeding Sodium hydroxide Shasta (soft drink) Matt Hardy Wine Fecal incontinence Coffeehouse Cirrhosis Carbonated water Drinking game Ethanol Bread Cocaine Veganism Tooth Drug addiction Homer Simpson Tea Glass Decompression sickness Babe Ruth Bong Driving under the influence Canada Dry Soda Stereo Breakfast Caffeine The Coca-Cola Company Sake Gout Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

help me solve a wine opening question years ago i was taught to score a bottle of wine especially if you are doing table service below the second lip when bartending i usually just make the bottles naked in any case i've run across a great many people that open a bottle of wine by scoring above the top lip of the bottle in the past i was strictly forbidden from doing such because the wine is more likely to contact the tin metal and help oxydize the wine there are possibly impurities molds other dried wine etc caught underneath the metal and that will affect the wine i am unsure which if any are true my logic has always been that if that wasn't what was supposed to be done the entire wine industry wouldn't have manufactured the bottle with the second lip i am not exactly sure what you mean by top lip and second lip on most bottles there is a wider band of glass about a quarter inch below the top of the bottle and i would cut just above that band using it to guide the blade on a corkscrew but under it is just as good i would agree that cutting the top of the capsule off along the surface of the top of the bottle is not correct practise and i do see inexperienced waiters doing so problem is it is difficult to make a clean cut here and you end up with jagged edges which affect the flow of the wine when poured whichever you do there are a number of issues tho' first is that care in foil removal was more important fifty years ago and nowadays with wines of those vintages because the foil was made of lead and lead is poisonous however lead foils have been banned now for fifty years most wineries use plastic or thin tin which are harmless wine which has been aged often gets a mold growing on the top of the cork under the foil when this is observed the top of the cork and bottle should be wiped with a damp cloth before opening the wine wine touching the capsule will not be the cause of oxidation i think the warning yoiu were given related to the necessity of keeping it from a lead capsule but even if safe today today it is not professional service to get pieces of the capsule interfering with the wine flow increasingly these days the entire capsule can easily be removed which a quick twist and pull and i do so at home in a quality restuarant you may want to make a show of wine service cutting the capsule etc so i would continue doing what you were taught i'll bet the other waiters didn't have the professional training you received they were probably pushed out into the room with a corkscrew and the first time they ever opened a wine was in the restaurant i'd prefer to be seated at the table you serve thanks  New Coke Vanilla Coke Diet Coke The Coca-Cola Company Sucralose Trailer Park Boys Sin City Extreme Championship Wrestling Coca-Cola Harvey Award Soft drink Pepsi-Cola Bad Wolf Diet soda Dallas (TV series) The Invisibles Kevin and Kell Modoc War Matt Hardy Supporting characters on Will & Grace References to Star Trek Hiberno-English Father Ted Dumb & Dumber Sprite (soft drink) The Doors Mike Alfonso Frankie Laine Andy Warhol The Royle Family Eric Clapton Poker jargon Son Gohan Philipp Melanchthon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jack McFarland Tab (soft drink) Knots Landing Mountain Dew Days of our Lives Opie and Anthony Liza of Lambeth Diet of Japan Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jack Ruby Ham Garfield Time Out of Mind The Jazz Singer Jack Bauer The Shining (film) The Dark Tower (series) Alan Moore Harry Nilsson Humphrey Bogart Past characters (Neighbours) Bret Hart SeaChange 21st Century Fox Hong Kong-style milk tea Boogie Nights Mick Foley Boxing Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Jim Morrison Jack Kerouac Sugar 7 Up Jack Benny Minako Aino Shinn Asuka Xiaolin Showdown StarrCade Hollyoaks Patrick Hillery Meat Loaf Academy Award for Best Art Direction Clash of Champions Columbia Pictures Thunderball Drink Jack O'Neill (Stargate) Irn-Bru Friends Fanta Neighbours Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Beam (structure) Frankie Vaughan Silverchair Jefferson Airplane Port wine James T.

i'm a huge wine drinker and i was just wondering if u like ur wine warm or chilled all wine should be drank at degrees f temperature white wines can be served on lower temperature in degrees while red wines are traditionally served at room temperature ie room temperature in europe which are typically in the 's and 's no the same as the room temperature here that can get up to 's or more sometimes if you drink the wine too warm all you can taste and smell is the alcohol which will cover the intricacy and delicacy of the wine if you drink the wine too cold the flavor and the alcohol will not come out it is very tricky which is the reason there are many products out there that measures the temperature of the wine prior to serving you should try the same wine at different temperature and see the difference  Miller Brewing Alcohol advertising Public house Alcoholic beverage Prohibition Anheuser-Busch Soft drink Beer Coffee Drink Wine Coffeehouse Guinness Alcoholism Root beer Sportsman's Park Duff Beer Moonshine Cider Milwaukee, Wisconsin Alcohol Malt liquor French cuisine Redneck Drinking game Brewing Drunkenness Drinking culture Rum Beer Pong Distilled beverage Rice University Rainier Brewing Company Sake Alcopop Near beer Diet soda Gin Molson Caffeine Ale Tea Lemonade Disneyland Mothers Against Drunk Driving New Coke Word of Wisdom Mexican beer Energy drink Cacha__a Sherbet Quarters Legal drinking age Lager Champagne (beverage) Australian words Samuel Adams (beer) Busch Stadium Blood alcohol content American lager Chocolate Pisco Anchor Brewing Company Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Peruvian cuisine Coca-Cola Root beer float Gatorade Patent medicine Temperance movement Red Bull Systembolaget Hot sauce RuneScape quests Rutgers University Kurt Busch Freeze distillation Beer Hall Putsch The Coca-Cola Company Korean cuisine Grog Dot matrix printer Hangover Copula Saint Louis, Missouri Vodka Porter (beer) Plastic Law of value Liquor store British cuisine __douard Manet Nineteen Eighty-Four Shaggy dog story President (game) Bogan Beverage can stove Oregon Drinking Beer Bad (Buffy episode)

why do you salt your beer i read some answers before i submitted this i believe that people buy cheap canned beer and salt it because it takes the bitter taste out of it back in the old days we would see older relatives adding salt to their beer as we got old enough to buy and drink our own beer we realized that the stuff our grandparents and uncles and aunts drank was cheap discusting canned beer thank god we live in a world of great domestic light lagers i live in oregon and we have some great local brews as anyone will attest salt not needed unless your drinking cheap discounted crap beer life really is too short to drink cheap beer  Tap (valve) Keg Brewery Beer Fungus Homebrewing Guinness Draught beer Domestic water system Casting Soap Textile manufacturing Bong Hamster Oktoberfest Pipeline transport Belgian beer Screw Spinal Tap (band) Cruising (maritime) This Is Spinal Tap Carnivorous plant Plant Pneumonia The Rutles Miller Brewing Motility Vinegar Bread Mortar (weapon) Fabrication (metal) Internal ballistics Tooheys Plastic Wheat Tapper Diamond Liquor store Carbon dioxide Prostitution in Thailand Soldering GLOCK Tea Hard water Plaster AT-4 Spigot Soap bubble Density Hand washing Tattoo Beersheba Bock Bottled water Blow molding Sake Metalworking Irish dance Coffee The Mansion Family Drink Prong Public house Nasty Boys Volume Root beer Citric acid AFI (band) Spile Mushroom Sherbet Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Barrel (storage) Dishwashing Haarlem Hair metal Carbon fiber Social rule British Home Championship Borehole Trombone Flash (comics) Citgo Bass guitar XXXX Real ale Samovar Apple Newton Brian May Final Fantasy: Unlimited Telephone tapping Beer Pong Finglish Make money fast Organic certification Tin Fish farming Guilty Gear Sexual reproduction Keystone (cask)

how to open a champagne bottle i wonder how many bottles of champagne the previous answerers have actually opened themselves the basic skill in opening champagne is that you do not twist the cork you twist the bottle it is easier to grip twist the bottle and you have more control the bottle should be chilled remove the foil around the cork loosen the wire cage but leave it on as it gives a better grip optional cover the top of the bottle with a cloth grip the cork in one hand with the palm of your hand over the top of the cork and the base of the bottle in the other have the bottle at a slant pointing away from everyone twist the bottle slowly you will feel the cork start to push against your palm control it so that it comes out the bottle with a slight hiss like a nun farting as the old saying has it pour wine in glass note ifthe bottle has been shaken or isn't cold the cork might want to fly out that is why it is safer to cover with a cloth which will stop the cork flying the air pressure in a chamapgne bottle is the same as in the tire of a bus a flying cork can severly injure people many people lose their eyesight because of flying corks take care  Miller Brewing Beer Lager Brewing Alcoholic beverage Guinness Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Tooheys American lager Yuengling Brewery Bock Moonshine Ale Coffee Public house Stout beer French cuisine Wheat beer German beer Samuel Adams (beer) Gin Bitter (beer) Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) British cuisine Bread Hop (plant) Pilsener Prohibition Isinglass K__lsch (beer) XXXX Malt liquor Mexican beer India Pale ale Molson Cascade Brewery Oktoberfest Vinegar Water Family Victoria Bitter Sake Systembolaget Lambic Draught beer Rum Duff Beer Anheuser-Busch Homebrewing Wine Mead Rainier Brewing Company Cuisine of the Philippines Carlton & United Beverages Hot dog Burton-upon-Trent Coors Brewing Company Small beer Budweiser Budvar Grog South African Breweries New Coke Drinking culture Joseph Smith, Jr. P__cs Brewery Shit Chappelle's Show Microbrew In-N-Out Burger Futurama (TV series - season 2) Nitrogen Samuel Smith (brewery) Aftertaste Belgian beer Knots Landing Stella Artois Sewage treatment Gross domestic product Fanta Porter (beer) Lucille Ball Black Label Lion Nathan Ramen Shaggy dog story German cuisine Homer Simpson Drinking game Sauna Beck's Beer Hall Putsch Pale ale Beverage can Charles Wells Reinheitsgebot Tea Chili con carne Cider Australian beer

is there really a type of absinthe that makes you hallucinate absinthe is absinthe hallucinations were allegedly caused by a stronger concentration of the active ingredient originally absinthe was banned from sale because of the alleged damage to the brain it caused this included reported hallucinatory experiences due to the amount of the active ingredient thujone in the wormwod used in it's manufacture never proven as fact my understanding is that the absinthe on the market today contains much lower levels and so doesn't have the same effect it's alcohol strength is very high if you drank enough of any strong alcohol you'd probably see pink elephants from time to time  HyperText Transfer Protocol Alcoholic beverage Web server Prohibition GNU General Public License Free software Website Software license HTTP cookie Wget Liquor store Taxation in the United States Internet censorship in mainland China Moonshine Absinthe Driver's license License Distilled beverage Apache HTTP Server Miami, Florida Chocolate Licence to Kill Ajax (programming) Warez Public house Concealed carry (USA) Vehicle registration plate Driving under the influence Uniform Resource Locator Coffeehouse Web crawler Drunk driving (United States) Chinese wine Systembolaget Liquor Control Board of Ontario Supermarket BitTorrent World Wide Web Florida Legal drinking age Common Unix Printing System Rum Unix Alcohol Copyleft Internet Speculative Fiction Database Culture of France United States Malt liquor Transport Layer Security Miami-Dade County, Florida Identity document Cider Internet Rum-running Rave party GameFAQs Intellectual property Spyware Proxy server Wine Biodiesel Application service provider Gun politics in the United States PHP-Nuke Binge drinking Television licence Squid cache WNED-TV Grey market Fire Nintendo Entertainment System Agriculture Pisco Pirate radio Carl G.

the drink in the movie eurotrip my friend has some are there any drugs in that drink because we get random drug tests at work it's a common misconception that absinthe gets you high acts as a hallucinogen etc yes it used to but that's going back a couple of centuries when the psychoactive ingredient wormwood was at ridiculously high levels in the drink and the drink itself was known as la faire verte or the green fairy it was blamed for the rising number of people admitted to mental hospitals in paris and was banned it has since been regulated so the amount of wormwood would do considerably less damage to you than the alcohol content in it however the wormwood only becomes psychoactive if you drink it properly through soaking a sugarcube in it lighting the sugarcube holding it over the glass letting the caramelised sugar drip in then stirring the rest in before putting it out with cold water just chugging a shot you'll get drunk and have a bad hangover drugs tests noooo problem  Miller Brewing Alcohol advertising Anheuser-Busch Beer Pong Drink Coors Brewing Company Burton-upon-Trent Soft drink Molson Redundant array of independent disks American lager Rum Beer Coffee Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Bass (beer) Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

why do bottles of tequila contain worms occassionaly my answer would have been part it's a common misconception that tequila bottles contain worms it's forbidden by law however bottles of the drink mescal similar to tequila and also made in mexico usually contain worms the worm traditionally used is a kind of caterpillar that lives in the stems of agave plants from which mescal is made these reddish coloured worms can be quite rare and at times white worms from the leaves of the plant are used instead the practice of adding worms to bottles of mescal started in the s when a mexican named jacobo lazano paez found the addition of a worm changed the taste and colour of the drink and he decided to include worms as a marketing gimmick despite popular belief the practice hasn't been a mexican tradition for centuries my answer would have been part considered a delicacy by mexicans the worm is supposed to be eaten and is thought by some to have aphrodisiac qualities some also believe the worm gives strength to those who eat it and that it's hallucinogenic however apart from any psychological effects the worm might have in reality it's merely a worm saturated in alcohol genuine tequila never has worms inside the bottle however there's another alcoholic beverage made out of the same plant that is called mezcal which is a little bit stronger and this one does have a worm in the bottom of the bottle always this is just tradition i don't think it modifies the taste in any way but it's just fun to see whether the person drinking the last drops of mezcal will be brave enough to eat the worm too or not that's all they do it for those worms grow in the same plant that the beverage is extracted from  Delicatessen Fred Meyer Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington Upper West Side Seattle, Washington Supermarket Coffeehouse Prohibition Beer Kensington Market Bellevue, Washington Chinatown Wall Street Queen Anne, Seattle, Washington Redmond, Washington Portland, Oregon King County, Washington Alcoholic beverage Sears Holdings Corporation Pacific, Missouri Public house Nordstrom Pike Place Market Milwaukee, Wisconsin Quezon City Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools (2005) Liquor store Woolworths Limited Kroger Uwajimaya Brewery Aldi Soft drink Wine Grand Forks, North Dakota Convenience store Starbucks University Village, Seattle, Washington Edge city Liquor Control Board of Ontario World music Indianapolis, Indiana Microbrew Chinatown, Los Angeles, California Retailer Lake Washington Cigar Eastside University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Spadina Avenue University of Washington Diamond University District, Seattle, Washington Chinatowns in North America Royal Tunbridge Wells Whitman College Koreatown Tesco U.S. Highway 1 Chester Seattle Public Schools Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California Puget Sound New York University German cuisine Wedgwood, Seattle, Washington Wallingford, Seattle, Washington Seattle neighborhoods Wal-Mart Bulk vending South African Breweries Marshall Field's Brewers Retail Inc.

what's the difference between scotch or whiskey just wondering if there's a difference i know i've had whiskey before but is there just a scotch drink out there i can try or is it just scotch whiskey mixed up just please tell me thanx scotch and whiskey are the same its just that scotch got its name from being made in scotland it's a common misconception that the term whiskey refers to one certain taste or brand and that bourbon and scotch are a liquor all their own not so whiskey is a common type of liquor it is produced and bottled all over the world each country in its own way bourbon is america's version of whiskey scotch is scotland's and candadian is well you get the idea but make no mistake they are all whiskies there are five major categories of whiskey for sale bourbon american blended scotch irish and canadian there are taste differences between the major whiskies of course the main distinction in the taste of scotch is its smoky peat flavor it can easily be called an acquired taste but those that acquire it crave it irish similarly has a barley malt whiskey taste without the smokiness scotch and irish are mostly lighter whiskies than the american bourbons and blends they are usually aged in old previously used barrels and require a bit more time to reach maturation single malt scotches typically range from to years aging bourbon on the other hand owes much of its taste to the rye and corn grains used bourbon is also considered a fuller bodied whiskey than scotch or irish and some say it does have a bit more of a sweet taste on the palate and by that i do not mean sugary in the production of bourbon only new charred oak barrels are used in the aging process which enables bourbon to reach maturity quicker than scotch regardless when dealing with whiskies age is a fair gauge on how smooth the whiskey will be the longer in the barrel the more complete that whiskey will be  Mezcal Pulque Agave Coffee Wine Cider Day of the Dead Beer Champagne (beverage) Tequila agave Soft drink Yerba mate Pisco Rum Coca-Cola Tea Cochineal Bong Snake Sake Cocaine French cuisine Aztec Chocolate Food preservation Illegal drug trade Mexican cuisine Cacha__a Ayahuasca Vanilla Port wine Sage Roman eating and drinking Peruvian cuisine Martini cocktail Polyethylene terephthalate Chile pepper Cannabis (drug) Water Prohibition Hemp Century plant Olive oil Moonshine Mountain Dew Aloe Fugu Mexican beer Vermicompost Alcoholics Anonymous Vodka Philip J.

bartenders how did you get your start hi my friends own a restaurant i bartended my way through college and dental school great tips if you really learn the trade and i could study when it was slow what they do is have the senior bartender or one of the owners train for about week and then they work with another bartender for another weeks before they are on their own often an owner is near by if the get an unual drink like a dirty martini or a muddled old fashion bartending school helps somewhat but it is with fake alcohol and not the real hussel the other issue is they do not teach you have to deal with people so first you have to be of age be a people person and understand how to mix drinks properly over pouring alcohol does not do anyone a favor what they do is have the new bartenders also wait tables to learn the menu and get people experience also they learn to work together as a team with the other employees i think if you do something like this you can get paid for learning your job and get all the experience you need to work that place properly if you have any other questions please ask  Rum Mezcal Scotch whisky Alcoholic beverage Coffee Beer Port wine Wine Single malt Scotch Brewery Chocolate Sake Silver Champagne (beverage) Bock Wood Cider Barbecue Internal ballistics Glycerin Brandy Clarinet Tai shogi Pisco Wine making Oak Color Sugar Dodge Charger Vinegar Aging barrel Black (people) Madeira wine Soy sauce Motion picture rating system Cacha__a Dragon Booster Carburetor Wheat beer Tofu Plastic Upholstery Milk Human skin color Yu-Gi-Oh!

i turn on friday what should my first legal drink be my st birthday is just around the corner and i am having a hard time deciding what that infomous first drink should be first things first it should be something you enjoy if you already know you don't like something don't go for it just because it's there really though i'd avoid anything fruity or complicated etc sugary drinks are asking for a hangover complicated drinks will just annoy the bartender and make it impossible to taste just about anything the rest of the night welcome yourself into the rest of your life with style stick to the simple and pure classics they're classics for a reason think the classic cocktail like a martini or a manhattan these are serious drinks and then go and have whatever you feel like but for god's sake watch out for the tequila that stuff will sneak in and rob you of your mind  Bong Plastic Glass Curling Milk Dundas Square Fiberglass Solar power Champagne (beverage) Rise of Nations Beer Pong Station wagon Stereoscopy Drill bit Uniform Resource Locator Quarters Sake Solar cell Coffee Explosive material Drinking culture Hong Kong-style milk tea Soap bubble Beer Bottle Shotgun shell Shell (projectile) Tuff Wine Dairy Cider Harmonica Sunglasses Eyepiece Ceramics Australian English Key (lock) Heinkel He 111 Guinness Laser engraving Internal ballistics Saxophone Wood Lacrosse Cardboard Rum Chevrolet Corvette Inertial confinement fusion Casting Refrigerator Tokusatsu Vickers Valiant Door Alcohol advertising London Brian May Cross-country skiing Ultraviolet Tea Shen Gong Wu Philip Glass British Columbia USS Trigger (SS-237) Tallboy bomb Nalgene Google bomb Messerschmitt Me 262 Violin Lightstick Liger Zero Menstrual cup Silicon Glasses Naval mine Beersheba B-47 Stratojet Vacuum tube Handloading Gramophone record Polyethylene terephthalate Tire Quarashi Hitler's death Alanis Morissette Website Battle of the beams Grey Cup Hash table Australian words Irn-Bru General Dynamics F-111 Solar variation Peruvian cuisine Douglas DB-7 Bomber Belgian beer Turquoise Compact disc Moonshine

are any alcohols a stimulant i heard there is a certain alcohol that is a stimulant rather than a depressant like all other alcohols but i can't remember which one it is no alcohol itself is a depressant not a stimulant any alcoholic beverage is therefore a depressant sometimes you may think alcohol stimulates you but what it does is depress the parts of your brain that you use to make your decisions and the mask the physical effects you are experiencing that explains the loudmouth drunk who thinks he she is impressing everyone with their eloquence and philosophical ideas the don't know they are talking like idiots and everyone is actually laughing at them then there's the drunk who feels stimulated and physically at the top of his game he probably will be surprised that he can't 'perform' for his lady when they go home because he feels like a 'real man' that's also the person who is stimulated and feels very capable of driving home that is the person who gets charged with dui or maybe kills someone in an accident on the way home in the movies the mountain rescue dog carries a small keg of brandy to stimulate and warm up an avalanche victim actually it would slow down the circulatory system and the person would be more likely to freeze to death if someone claims that any alcoholic beverage is a stimulant that person doesn't know what he she is talking about that could only be the case if they used the booze to wash down some powerful stimulant drugs  Moonshine Rum Tea Alcohol The Cure Cocaine Timeline of alternative rock Def Leppard Futurama (TV series - season 5) Beer Suicide methods Orange Order Ethanol Wine Russian cuisine Alcoholic beverage The Marshall Mathers LP Gasoline Homebrewing Vodka The O.C.

so i think i maybe a alcoholic so i am only year old i have been told my many of my close friends and family inculding the guy i am dating that i am a alcohlic i don't think i am i drink almost everynight okay everynight i have a drink i drink very heavly on thursdays sundays i do drink everyday at least one or two beers and no they do nothing for me it takes me around to beers to get drunk and beers to get tippsy most of my friends drink and i work at a night club so i drink at work i don't want to ammit i have a problem with drinking but i think i might and i don't know what to do about it despite all i can say many who are real alcoholics are not going to believe they are in that class by every form of self deception and experimentation they will try to prove themselves exceptions to the rule therefore nonalcoholic though there is no way of proving it we believe that early in our drinking careers most of us could have stopped drinking but the difficulty is that few alcoholics have enough desire to stop while there is yet time we have heard of a few instances where people who showed definite signs of alcoholism were able to stop for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do so to be gravely affected one does not necessarily have to drink a long time nor take the quantities some of us have this is particularly true of women potential female alcoholics often turn into the real thing and are gone beyond recall in a few years certain drinkers who would be greatly insulted if called alcoholics are astonished at their inability to stop we who are familiar with the symptoms see large numbers of potential alcoholics among young people everywhere but try and get them to see it this is just a few selected paragraphs from chapter of the big book of alcoholics anonymous my advice to you is this visit this site and read the big book www recovery org aa bigbook ww and you will know if you have a problem that needs addressed i want you to know that it was written in the s but an alcoholic is an alcoholic regardless of the times you owe it to yourself expecially at your age and you don't have to tell anyone you have looked into it if you don't feel the need to also you can take the advice of some and quit for a week or month and see if you drink its garbage you can quit for a month and think about a drink everyday for a month and succeed but on that st day you have a drink and another and another etc hope this helps i try to read the book and see how you feel its pretty common alot of people that are alcoholics will never admit it ever good luck  Alcoholic beverage Alcoholism Clinical depression Alcoholics Anonymous Ketamine Caffeine The Shining (film) Coffee Alcohol Sin City Dead Like Me Mothers Against Drunk Driving Sleep Drowning Diazepam Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Out-of-body experience Rape Stroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drunk driving (United States) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Free will Shaggy dog story Driving under the influence Sedative Orgasm Theory of conduct Beer Social rule Knots Landing Psychosis Avalanche Prohibition Hypoglycemia Abortion debate Hiccup Methamphetamine Arguments for and against drug prohibition Addiction Drug abuse Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Prostate cancer Bipolar disorder Carbon dioxide The Catcher in the Rye Drink Taxi Driver Tea Anxiety Meditation Lorazepam One Tree Hill (TV series) Immortality Magical thinking Ethanol The Marshall Mathers LP Human sexual behavior Cannabis (drug) Chocolate Moonshine Post-traumatic stress disorder Depressant Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Pisco Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants First aid Brandy Borderline personality disorder Vomiting The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Cryonics Kill Bill Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Berserker Traumatic brain injury Tobacco smoking Distilled beverage Clomipramine Parkinson's disease Hyperthermia Grog Energy drink Neurofeedback Balance disorder Mind control Hypnosis Near-death experience David Bohm Chronic fatigue syndrome Panic attack Avenue Q

which red wine are excellent for use as ingredients in cooking and if use red wine as ingredients can it be stored for a long time after openning the bottle it is an ingredient like any other in your dish so think quality and condition would you use cheap and nasty meat so why consider cheap and nasty wine would you use herbs or fruit that are old dried up and lost all their real taste so why use wine that has been sitting around open for a while if you think opening it and sticking the cork back in keeps the wine ok it only does for a couple of days at most same as sticking the fruit or herbs in a bag simple common sense if you won't drink it don't use it  Alcoholics Anonymous Alcoholism Oasis (band) Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Plame affair Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Alcoholic beverage Social rule Bill W.

wow organic wine is much stronger than regualar wine so i have just tried organic wine and i am telling you that glasses have me feeling all sorts of buzzed do you know if there will be a hangover since it has no chemicals or sulfites in it i am amazed at how strong it is and i drink wine regularly so this is so weird how potent it is a lot of it could do with other factors such as how much you've eaten recently and such wines vary in alcohol content but it all depends on factors that don't have anything to dow ith it being organic wine as well as other fermented beverages can only get to about alcohol non fortified of course this is because the yeast dies off at about that level so no yeast no more alcohol kinda ironic that yeast produces alcohol and alcohol kills yeast anyways wines tend to have alcohol content the amount of alcohol is a result of how much sugar is in the wine and how long the wine ferments yeast turns sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide the longer it goes the more sugar it will convert so these are the reasons that determine wine's strength also just about any wine contains sulfites its part of the natural reactions that occur with the grape skins now this wine may be relatively low in sulfites because lots of wine makers add sulfites because it often makes a more stable wine also hangovers dont occur from added chemicals they occur partially because of chemicals that are a natural by product of alcoholis fermentation they also occur because alcohol is a diuretic which increases urination which causes dehydration dehydration is another culprit in hangovers  Rum Blood alcohol content Hypoglycemia Alcoholism Vomiting Moonshine Beer Pneumonia Cider Drunk driving (United States) Bong Malt liquor Caffeine Suicide methods Narcotic Chocolate Doxepin Legal drinking age Food Hangover Breastfeeding Coffee Systembolaget Stomach cancer Wine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scotch whisky Cannabis (drug) Brewing Homebrewing Tide Addiction Brewery Species Korean cuisine Marathon (sport) Alcoholics Anonymous Paracetamol Mental retardation Ethanol Haloperidol Sauna LSD Atkins Nutritional Approach Cholera Capital punishment Foodborne illness Diarrhea Cancer Human sexual behavior Aspartame Jackass: The Movie Fanta Puberty Single malt Scotch Microeconomics Temperance movement Black Death Clinical depression Rape Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Opioid Pregnancy Person Professional wrestling match types India Pale ale Folic acid Vitamin C Hepatitis Yasser Arafat Ethylene glycol Coffeehouse The Coca-Cola Company Pisco Sleep Sake Rice University Mothers Against Drunk Driving Internal ballistics Drug overdose Carburetor Alcohol E85 Medical cannabis Drug abuse Distilled beverage Trigonometric function Drug addiction Soft drink Fire fighting Adjustable gastric band Dehydration Trainspotting (novel) Urinary incontinence Recreational drug use Driver's license Hormone replacement therapy (trans)

why does this happen whenever i drink hard liquor i get belligerent i grew up in a rural area where it was the norm to get drunk and find a good fight i hated it and left there and like to think that i am more enlightened these days i am one of the friendliest kindest people that you could ever meet and yet if i have whiskey i seem to seek trouble and violence i am really perplexed by this i don't have to struggle to control my temper when i am sober i rarely ever get angry and i don't ever want to hurt anyone i rarely ever drink once last year i think what is going on with me there are happy drunks and angry drunks you are the latter sounds like if you only drink once a year anyway you could just quit all together and avoid the whole problem or drink just a little a little more often and see if you can feel the problem coming on at some point instead of getting rip snortin' drunk just once in a while and not realize you're angry until it's too late sorry for the terrible grammar  New Coke Coca-Cola Soft drink Brandy Daz Dillinger Cognac (drink) Rum Equal Rights Amendment Diet Coke Pete Rock Beer Desire (album) The Marshall Mathers LP Brandy (entertainer) Edward Coke The Relapse United States House of Representatives Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Drink Janet Jackson Vanilla Coke Long Island Iced Tea Pisco Alcoholic beverage Pepsi-Cola Wine Andy Warhol Killing Joke The Coca-Cola Company Prisoner (TV series) Serbian cuisine Grog Parliament of Canada My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Quizbowl Earl of Leicester Barbara Boxer Cuba Libre Britney Spears May 2005 in Canada Louie, Louie Street Smarts (game show) Patrick Star Coffee Sewage treatment The Basement Tapes $ale of the Century Slayers The Glass House (TV series) Whisky Radio Yerevan What's My Line?

how to prevent hangovers i have heard that you are supposed to drink a glass of water for each drink i have also hear that it is good to eat salty food to absorb the alcohol but are there any other tried and tested tricks of the trade eat something before you start drinking something plain that won't upset your stomach later you don't need a glass of water after each drink but definitely have a glass of water sometime during the night be careful if you switch between beer and liquor the best way is to sober up somewhat before bed if you go to bed drunk that's when you'll have a hangover b c your body slows down and can't process all the alcohol i have friends that swear by drinking an ensure before drinking but i've never tried it  Alcoholic beverage Rum Time Out of Mind Bacardi Shaggy dog story Mothers Against Drunk Driving One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Legal drinking age AFI 100 Years series Coffee Hey Jude Marilyn Monroe Futurama (TV series - season 2) Soft drink Big Brother UK series 6 YuYu Hakusho Sin City Blood on the Tracks Grandview, U.S.A.

why do they never make the bottom of wine bottles flat they always have the huge indentation that takes away half the bottom is there a reason for this there does exist many bottles that have a near flat bottom however to the point stability of strength sedimentation other http pweb netcom com lachenm puntfaq html for sure the number one reason is to relieve stress on the bottle's structure the strength gained by the dimple is best observed in sparkling wines which are under pressure in manufacture engineering of many things it occurs that a crease or dimple relives stress improving that items strength in addition it happens to be a remnant of early bottle produce iv what is the purpose of the punt there have been many different explanations proposed on alt food wine and many people are absolutely certain that their explanation is the only correct one no consensus has been reached on what the true purpose is or even if there actually is only one true explanation for the presence of punts in wine bottles here is a list of the proposed explanations along with some analysis of each one it is a remnant of historical glass blowing techniques and serves no real purpose punts certainly were a result of historical glass blowing techniques the blowpipe was attached to the neck of the bottle and then it was transferred to a tool called a punty a k a punt ponty pontil pointel ponto pontil rod ponte th c which was put on the base of the bottle an indentation was the natural result thanks to dan razzell for an explanation of old glassblowing techniques however whether punts have just survived because of tradition or whether they survived because they have some useful function s is still open for debate as the rest of the list suggests it once had a purpose which was that it made the bottle more stable when standing up hugh johnson mentions this theory in his book vintage the story of wine primitive glassblowing did not approach today's standards of precision making a concave surface which will stand on end is much easier than making a flat one since with just a small manufacturing error a flat surface can become convex causing the bottle to tend to tip over while a concave surface would be just a little less concave and would remain stable as a result concerns about stability may have contributed to the development and retention of the punt this explanation and the first are partly supported by the fact that not all of today's wine bottles have punts punts are certainly not absolutely necessary in wine bottles now though they may have been essential in the past it once had and may still have a purpose which was to strengthen the bottle this explanation supposedly accounts for the deep punts in many sparkling wines there is at least a grain of truth to this since early champagne bottles were weak and breakage due to pressure was a problem however on a previous occasion when this explanation came up there was a long debate about whether the punt actually contributed significantly to the strength of the bottle some people claimed that the weak point in modern bottles is where the base joins the sides and that a punt would have an insignificant effect on the stability of this region i haven't done the calculations on how much a punt would strengthen the base of a bottle myself but i am somewhat skeptical of the importance of any such effect does anyone want to volunteer to do the calculations or know of a reliable source where this topic is covered the reasoning and calculations should address how significant the effect on bottle strength would be including whether the punt strengthens the weakest point in a modern bottle's construction details i have not seen in any arguments to date in any event technology has probably rendered the strength question moot since modern glass is much stronger than the glass used in early bottles on alt food wine michael wilson noted a trend toward shallower punts and thinner glass making the wine bottles lighter thus saving shipping costs and increasing profit margins apparently bottle strength is less of an issue than money nowadays also keep in mind that the strength explanation mainly addresses the issue of punts in bottles of sparkling wine as bottles of still wine can be much weaker it has a purpose for sparkling wines aiding in the stacking of inverted bottles on top of each other this explanation was suggested in the oxford companion to wine st ed p which states that this method of stacking is necessary or at least very helpful for traditional sparkling winemaking i have no reason to believe that this use is untrue but it may have originally been more of a serendipitous discovery than the result of a conscious design also like this reasoning doesn't explain punts in bottles of still wine its purpose is to collect sediment to make the wine easier to decant this certainly doesn't explain punts in sparkling wines nor is it helped by the fact that there are some red wines which do not have punts it may be useful for this purpose but i doubt that sediment collection was the original reason for the design again it seems more likely to me that a use was found for something which already existed i also doubt that it makes a signficant difference in the amount of wine which can be decanted easily if anyone has done a relevant experiment i'd be interested in the results its purpose is to aid in pouring the wine in an elegant fashion in case you haven't seen anyone do this the idea is that you can pour wine by placing one hand on the base holding onto the punt with your thumb i seriously doubt that this is the purpose as there seem to be just as many people who think this is awkward and pretentious as those who think it is elegant and sophisticated however a punt is undoubtedly useful if you want to pour wine this way its purpose is aesthetic and or marketing related a to make the bottle look bigger mentioned in the oxford companion to wine st ed as a possible reason for punts in still wines now we're getting somewhere while this may not have been the original purpose i could see that current marketing and packaging gurus might appreciate the illusion of a bigger bottle b because people expect to see a punt in quality wine since they have always been there somewhat related to reason above again this explanation may certainly be true at least in some cases popular perception is certainly considered to be very important in sales of consumer goods conclusion so after all those possible explanations what is the bottom line possibly many or all of the above explanations contribute to the existence of punts in various wines different producers may have slightly different reasons and a single producer may even use different reasoning for having punts in bottles of different wines over the years each one of these explanations has been proposed by at least one person on alt food wine as being the one true reason behind punts who can say that wine producers don't hold opinions which are equally diverse as those of the wine drinking public personally i favor the idea that the punt was at least at first an accident of early glass blowing technique over time punts probably proved useful for a number of reasons bottle stability when standing stacking sparkling wine while not being strictly necessary for most wines today i believe that the reason for the punt is largely aesthetic people expect to see punts in quality wines due to tradition and the illusion of a larger bottle is probably useful for marketing however since nothing about the issue is truly clear you should feel free to form your own conclusions last revised  Jay Gould Long Island Rail Road Corbin, Kentucky Brooklyn Vicky Leandros

should the drinking age go upto as a ex bar person i think the minimum age for drinking should be as i think it would solve a lot of the underage drinking and some of the brawls in our towns and cities that we hear about would stop of a certain age group i also think that the licenceing laws should go back to the old laws as it would also cut down on the binge drinkers plus the fact is that the new laws dont give both the pub landlords and staff a break from there jobs i am in halifax west yorkshire i'm undecided as i see both sides i like the idea of the age being but on the other hand how can you be old enough to go to war and be killed but not old enough to have a beer  Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky W.A.S.P.

why is it that when i pour beer into a cup i get foam why do i have to tilt the cup to minimize foam why is it that when i pour beer into a cup i get foam why do i have to tilt the cup to minimize foam what's the science behind this please explain in simple language the most important part is for me to understand what makes it foam the answer to your question is explained in great detail here http probrewer com resources library bp troubleshooting php but to put it plainly it has to do with the carbonation and the temperature of the beer the colder your beer the more apt it is to hold some of the carbonation also just like with soda the more you agitate the carbonation the more it is released from the drink so pouring the beer at an angle into the cup reduces the agitation and creates a smoother path for the beer to flow  Ap__ritif Beer Alcoholic beverage Cuisine of Argentina Vinegar Chinotto Liqueur Rum Patent medicine Giuseppe Campari Turin Yarrow Tea Absinthe Hustler Magazine v.

how could i find the score for a wine i have no idea about wine scoring does it really show the quality of wine and also i don't know where to find these rankings the other problem is that i am now in ontario canada and i cant get anything i want from lcbo i would appreciate if you help me you can get the ratings at any decent wine store wine spectator magazine is only one of a multitude of trade magazines that give report ratings check out your local book stores have a seat and thumb through the monthlys there are dozens of magazines that will let you know the latest some will have a calendar of tastings the one think to keep in mind is that those ratings are the subjective opinions of the tasters once inside the world of all things grape you'll here infighting about who has the taste buds nose and skills this is the best reason to attend wine tastings decide for yourself many reputable stores and wineries have tastings check with them and ask about local groups who get together and hold their own tasting events some will supply the wines others will require you to bring a vintage for the group to taste i hope this helps  Beer Bong Milk Alcoholism Alcoholic beverage Social rule Bottle Drink Guinness Dr Pepper Coffee Shaggy dog story Grog Systembolaget Miller Brewing Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Shotgunning Australian words Caffeine Aluminum can Snapple __douard Manet Make money fast Cha chaan teng Rum Beverage can Cider Isinglass Moonshine Inca Kola Breastfeeding Energy drink Wine Irn-Bru Can't Hardly Wait The Coca-Cola Company Wedding Crashers Nalgene Tea Drinking game Japanese honorifics Champagne (beverage) Jones Soda Brewing Drinking culture Homer Simpson Fasting Drinking Water Black Books President (game) Wheat beer Polyethylene terephthalate Blood alcohol content Beverage can stove Shasta (soft drink) Drunk driving (United States) Port wine Coffeehouse Beer Hall Putsch Tooheys Afroman Customs and etiquette of Japan The Smoking Room Yerba mate Rape Paternalism Flaming Moe's Pepsi-Cola Fast of the firstborn Sake K__lsch (beer) P__cs Brewery French cuisine Dionysus Newcastle Brown Ale Warhammer 40,000 Dairy Marie Lloyd American Psycho Sprite (soft drink) Sauna Coca-Cola Birthday Akvavit Moe Szyslak Coopers Brewery Draught beer Red Bull Root beer Bacardi Plastic Genericized trademark Withnail and I Australian English Brewery Music Hall Dundas Square

why do you vomit after you drink alcohol in large quantities why does your body throw up alcohol i'm not talking about forcing it yourself why can't it just be urinated out of your system what is it about alcohol that 'upsets' your body you can be poisoned by too much alcohol your body is rejecting anymore of it alcohol depresses nerves that control involuntary actions such as breathing the heart beat and the gag reflex prevents choking a fatal dose of alcohol will eventually stop these functions after the victim stops drinking the heart keeps beating and alcohol in the stomach continues to enter the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body  Alcoholics Anonymous Alcoholism Diazepam Alcohol Goodness and value theory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 10 Things I Hate About You Kim Possible Deep Space Homer English verbs Sub-Zero Arguments for and against drug prohibition Theory of conduct Ontological argument Ludlow massacre Sin City Mickey Mantle Cocaine Highlander: The Series Nirvana (band) Buzz Aldrin Addiction Charles Goodyear Bob Smith (doctor) Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters Maprotiline Vulcan (Star Trek) Humphrey Bogart Brett Whiteley Ranma __ characters Daredevil Kender The Shining (film) Guiding Light Friends Clomipramine Columbo True Crime: Streets of LA Buzz Sawyer E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) Aerosmith Women's Tennis Association God Emperor of Dune Jane's Addiction The Angels (Australian) Liver Caffeine Drunkenness Narcotics Anonymous French Open Retcon Patent medicine Carolina Panthers Endgame Nicomachean Ethics Objectivist philosophy Robbie Williams Motion picture rating system Ex-gay The Drew Carey Show All Things Must Pass Procrastination Beat generation Consensual crime George Harrison The Amber Spyglass Giygas You Don't Know Jack Megadeth Dawson's Creek Chlorpromazine Coca-Cola Alcoholic beverage Incarnations of Immortality Extreme Programming Ferengi The Once and Future King Alexander Alekhine Plutonium 1957 World Series VJ Dead Like Me Toy Story 2 Marcus Licinius Crassus Jiddu Krishnamurti John Coltrane Summa Theologiae Energy drink Hubert Selby Jr. Red Hot Chili Peppers The Joker's Wild Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) The Buzz on Maggie Black Books Limp Bizkit Cancer Anarchism and society Joe Louis Kill Bill

why did my whiskey taste like the cheaper stuff i bought glenlevit year old scotch whiskey which is supposed to be a single malt but why does it taste so rough i usually drink balletines for half the price can someone explain to me how a more expensive malt scotch can be so bad glenlivet is a pretty mild single malt as far as single malts go they filter and caramelize everything except the nadurra single malts are that all malt traditionally malted over peat fires which is a potent flavor nowadays their are maltsters from which distilleries by their product to the peat level they prefer almost no one does their floor maltings anymore ballentiine's is a blend so the grain whisky serves to lighten and soften the final product a more neutral flavor if you will the yr is the french oak finish so it may be that flavor that you find objectionable or you just may not like malt whisky they don't come much less peaty or intense than glenlivet except maybe glenfiddich which is downright fruity if you like your ballentine's then stick with it and save your money my dad could by any scotch he wanted but he's a chivas drinker to the end  Cocktail Drink Beer Mothers Against Drunk Driving Cider Jack Kerouac Humphrey Bogart Driving under the influence Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Toast (honor) Halitosis Michael Garibaldi Lemonade Rum Breastfeeding Toxicity Absinthe Cognac (drink) Energy drink Binge drinking Urinary incontinence Sake Ethanol Heuristic Whisky Drinking game Social rule Cancer Ethylene glycol The Shining (film) Drunk driving (United States) Vodka Traumatic incident reduction Drunkenness Transubstantiation Happiness Moonshine Supernatural Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Urination Atomic Kitten Mead Nicomachean Ethics Rape Pirates of the Caribbean Lager Book of Isaiah Fecal incontinence Cacha__a Bender Bending Rodriguez Alcoholism Russian cuisine Guinness Yoghurt Brandy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Poison Soft drink Yerba mate French cuisine About a Boy President (game) Lucille Ball Microeconomics Dehydration Alcoholics Anonymous Diet soda Atomism Wine Drinking culture Roman eating and drinking Bartender Drinking Samuel Vimes Bl__t Jim Morrison Inca Kola Coca-Cola Alcoholic beverage Trailer Park Boys Grog Red Bull The Marshall Mathers LP Gig Young Alcohol Vomiting Legal drinking age Wine degustation Irn-Bru Brian Griffin Beer Pong Noah Alcopop __uic__ Long Island Iced Tea Chinese tea culture Shaggy dog story Water quality New Coke

which champagne is the sweetest i really dont like wine at all and it took me forever to be able to sip champagne but now that i am getting married i need a champagne that wont make me puke anybody know of a really sweet or smooth champagne thanks you probably don't actually want something that is as sweet as possible it will end up like drinking bubbly syrup instead go for a mass market champagne like cook's or totts that is labeled extra dry i know sounds stupid to label something that is slightly sweet as extra dry but those champagnes are the second level of sweetness behind brut no sweetness at all buying a mass market brand will ensure that it is made in a style pleasing to almost everyone and the hint of sugar helps smooth out the flavor if all else fails and you just can't learn to like it you can also buy sparkling cider or cranberry juice that still bubbles but tastes like liquid candy  Pinot Noir Wine Champagne (beverage) Pinot Gris German wine Varietal Alcoholic beverage Tokaji Pinot meunier Ice wine Rum Beer Burgundy wine Port wine Brandy Grape Fanta Mead Willamette Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Gin Cider German cuisine Gatorade Riesling Sake Tea Soft drink Pisco Martini cocktail Chardonnay Cuisine of Denmark Terroir Wine making Shiraz grape Perfume Yamhill County, Oregon Mountain Dew Lemonade Peruvian cuisine Chambolle-Musigny Chablis wine Lambic Kit Kat Sonoma County, California Cuisine of the Philippines Vodka Ethanol Fruit Country wine Loganberry Moonshine Cava Cognac (drink) Food preservation Anderson Valley Black pepper Powerade Cuisine of Argentina Liqueur Absinthe Watermelon Roman eating and drinking Jones Soda Vinegar Chocolate Cantonese cuisine Vosne-Roman__e Stout beer Phenology Prohibition Almond Shasta (soft drink) Cold Stone Creamery Snapple Chile pepper Cuisine of Greece White Zinfandel Coffea arabica Balsamic vinegar Bong Japanese tea ceremony Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

why do some cultures insist on every beer being ice cold at all times do they not appreciate the taste i mean come on it isn't an ice cream don't get me wrong a cold lager on a hot day is great but there's a line to be drawn it isn't ever good to have ice cold beer the very hot day may be an exception as cold beverages are great indeed some beer styles are meant to be cold examples given above pilsener is a good example it is brewed cold and so is served cold a proper serving temperature being about f american style pilsner are another example other styles are brewed warmer and so are served warmer ales pale ale ipa porters stouts etc i enjoy most all beers and i do not like them ice cold edit soon origin i think you are corect sir it is the marketing of the brewers large brewers and it is tied to the invention of refrigeration back in the day beer was warm due to the fact we had no refer even the cold brewerd pils were served warm the first commercial refers were utilized by establishments such as bars due to their expense brewers ceased upon this and marketed the idea of cold beer and when technology converged packaging cans bottles with home refegeration the cold beer craze hit the brewers ceased upon this and marketed the idea of cold beer at home entertaing etc it was a bit of a status symbol to have a refer we americans really take things to the extreme ales lagers temperature ales are fermented at about f and lagers about f with some variation and so we tend to associate drinking the beers at these temperatures i think it is marketing status and preference that contribute to the myth the ice cold beer is best a beer lesson some people think that the words beer lager ale signify completely different things but that is not true we we talk about beer it needs to be understood that there exists two categories one is ales and the other is lagers ales and lagers are both types of beer beers both ales and lagers have many styles some examples of ales are pale ale india pale ale bitter light ale brown ales porter and stout and alt some examples of lagers are pilsener american style pilsner oktoberfest vienna munich and bock there are many more for each category  Cigar Lager Brewing Mexican beer Nicaragua Toyota Camry Wheat beer Dominican Republic Homebrewing Caribbean PHP Brewery Beer K__lsch (beer) Toyota Corona Queens Samuel Adams (beer) Ribeir__o Preto Punk rock President of Mexico Real ale Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Guinness President of India Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ludacris USS Washington (ACR-11) Prime Minister Taiwan Beer Oktoberfest Make money fast Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Republic of Texas President of Finland Draught beer Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement Cantus Sake Corona, New Mexico Mexico at the 2004 Summer Olympics Weimar Republic Miller Brewing Roger Ebert's most hated films Sun Jos__ Figueres Ferrer Moe Szyslak Stout beer Central African Republic President of the Church (Mormonism) Ultraviolet Roswell UFO incident Corona, California Francisco Pizarro ECW One Night Stand National dish Canadian beer Politics of Brazil Bitter (beer) Wine Frankfurt USS Arkansas (BB-33) German beer Duff Beer Belgian beer British comedy Corona Shandy Norway national football team About a Boy Tap (valve) Munich Grog Gin Guadeloupe European Commission USS Independence (CV-62) Near beer ROC presidential election, 2004 Irish diaspora Double Nickels on the Dime Cologne Pilsener Bread Joke President of the United States Monroe Doctrine Edwin Rosario Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China Dean O'Banion Music Hall Big Brother (TV series) Solar eclipse The Simpsons President of Germany Malt liquor Flag of Belarus Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) ROC legislative election, 2004 Monterrey Abraham Goldfaden

does chilling red wine briefly actually bring out the aroma and flavors of the respective wine if so which of all the red wines category can or best chilled to bring out the aromas and flavors what causes the low temp or room temp to bring out the flavors of red wines is there a difference in aroma and taste if decanted after a brief chill what about spanish wine from spain what makes them special compared to other wine producing countries what is the best way to serve spanish wine chilling any beverage does not bring out flavors rather it masks particularly sweet flavors that's why sweet white wines and super sweet pop beverages are best served cold the same is generally true for beer the sweeter light lagers are best served cold balanced lagers can be chilled and robust dark beers are better when they are not too cold the reason temperature affects the perception of flavors has to do with the sensory apparatus of the tongue in addition to the four main flavor taste buds the tongue also has sensory receptors for heat cold and pain what many people do not know is that the same receptors that sense heat also perceive pain the interesting side effects of this is that the same receptors cannot simultaneously perceive both heat and pain that's why topical pain relieving rubs induce warmth because warmth precludes the skins ability to transmit pain messages to the brain the same is true with the tongue warmth prevents pain to the brain too much heat is pain cold prohibits the fast transmission of sweetness in the normally warm interior environment of the mouth cool or cold prevents the sweet receptors from over firing and so protects the consumer from the excess sugar of adult beverages or the sickening sweetness of popular sodas chilling does not bring out flavor it masks sweetness some spanish wines are known for their sweetness to cut this sweetness they are sometimes mixed with acidic fruit juices as with sangria and or served chilled certain areas of spain have mountainous dry regions that also frost and are well suited to shocking the vines this makes smaller sweeter more intensely flavored wines that is the so called secret magic of spanish wines the same type of grapes and the same soil environment conditions can be found in many other wine producing countries armed with knowledge you can be somewhat more selective in your serving options however all taste is subjective so ultimately your preferences and those of your guests must be the final guide  Inhalant Mojave people Professional wrestling holds Bong Drowning Welding Firefighter Soldering iron Nitric acid Arc welding Coffee Apollo 11 Solvent Manganese Cross-country skiing Battle of Brandy Station Industrial Revolution Pop punk Glass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cannabis (drug) Hydrogen sulfide Christmas pudding Cuisine of Denmark Beat generation Mechanical ventilation Burn (injury) Cannon Krakatoa Locomotive Robin Thicke Buzz Lightyear Chemical warfare Sulfide Gas metal arc welding Cleveland Browns Ironing Cystic fibrosis Laboratory Eldfell Cyanide The Unquiet Dead Phoebe Halliwell Cetacea Penalty shootout (football) Mount St. Helens Brandy Mary Celeste Methanol Breath Timbaland Hiberno-English EarthBound Hydrogen chloride Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Wario Glossary of firefighting equipment Spark plug Stromboli Mandarin (comics) Blood on the Tracks Sulfuric acid Alkyl nitrites Asthma Electrophysiology Pneumoconiosis Limp Bizkit Carbon dioxide Columbine High School massacre Dead Like Me Air pollution Pet Sounds Smallville (Season 3) Clancy Wiggum New Orleans Mint Tic-Tac-Dough Soldering Billiards Ironclad warship The Legend of Zelda series enemies TLC Tredegar Iron Works Super Bowl V Japanese cuisine Children's television series Microwave oven Petroleum Kurt Angle Muraqaba Pulmonology Battle of Iwo Jima 4-8-8-2 CSS Tennessee Shoe Knife American Idol Mitral valve prolapse Rugby union positions Fume hood Shaggy dog story

can 's of a liter of whisky with diet coke make you black out im just wondering im wondering if someone slipped something in my drink or not i drank 's of a liter of whisky the tall slender bottle right above a pint of whisky i mxed the whisky with diet coke because its suppose to hit you faster anyways i drank it within hours i dont remember going home that night or anything i woke up in my apartment in the middle of the night throwing up i can remember throwing up a few times but nothing else that night the next day i felt really bad and dizzy feeling so im saying can only 's of a liter of whisky do this to me with diet coke i have not drank in like months before hand except the week before i had like beers so maybe my tolerance was down oh and im a big guy im ' about pounds i drink about once a week except for that month gap i usually average about a pint of whisky every week dan ive read about it many places for diet coke so i tried it many times look at this link http drunknewsblog blogspot com diet mixers make people drunk faster html they say it makes your blood alchol level higher by and its true i always feel it right away when i start mixing with diet coke drinking ml of any proof liquor within hours is usually enough to make anyone regardless of size quite drunk considering you say you drink a pint a week before and then practically doubled that amount in night tells me that with or without something being added to your drink you would have still likely had the same outcome of blacking out and throwing up i would tend to suspect nothing was added to your drink for a few reasons what is the motivation ghb and other drugs are added for a reason doesn't sound like you woke up with any strangebedfellows a shaved head from a prank or a missing kidney you probably would not have woken up in the middle in the night if something was added i am a moderate to heavy drinker but of a bit smaller stature ' lbs i love whiskey and at times will drink about a liter a week and one thing i can tell you is that the same type and amount of alcohol can have wildly different effects on your body there are a lot of other circumstances that can impact how you handle the alcohol how much did you eat that day drinking on an empty stomach is the surest way to get drunk quickly no need for diet coke using a straw or any other tricks on an empty stomach i can get smashed from a few shots of whiskey if i was eating properly i can drink a ml bottle and only feel buzzed sleep amount of water drank during the day and pacing of alchol intake can also impact it hopefully you come out of this learning a lesson that you can never count on being a certain level of intoxicated when drinking heavily some nights will happen the next night you might wind up in jail with a dui you are extremely lucky nothing happened that night so take that freebie and don't be irresponsible next time  Dallas (TV series) Moe Szyslak Cider Jack Daniel's Bad Wolf Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Empty Child Harvey Award Xiaolin Showdown Flaming Moe's Drink The Invisibles Jack Harkness Milkshake Rum Spider-Man (games) Tekken characters Jack Kerouac Kirby Boom Town (Doctor Who) Knots Landing Diving suit Marvel Comics Bottle Rocket (film) Characters of Lost Public domain Bourbon whiskey Indianapolis 500 Martini cocktail ATI Technologies Marathon (sport) Threads (Stargate SG-1) Plastic The Ashes Jack Thompson Absinthe Big Brother (USA TV series) Ketchup Poker jargon Ninety-seventh United States Congress Colonel Potter 100th United States Congress Ninety-eighth United States Congress Walter Matthau A Prairie Home Companion Fighting Foodons Ascension (Stargate) Cuisine of Denmark Straw Bicycle lighting The Doctor Dances References to Star Trek Terry Pratchett Ninety-ninth United States Congress Apple pie Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Risotto Father Ted Daniel Defoe Humphrey Bogart Jack Benny Neighbours Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Pasta Alias episodes (Season 2) Hobgoblin (comics) Questionable Content The Comics Journal Supporting characters on Will & Grace Indiana Pacers Cocktail French fries The Lovely Bones Sub-Zero A.J.

can tonic water go bad you might want an answer from someone who knows the difference between seltzer which is just carbonated water and club soda which is seltzer with salt and tonic which is carbonated water with quinine and sugar or for diet artificial sweetener so long as the bottle is sealed and the manufacture was not faulty e g no e coli in the vats etc then tonic like many types of soda will keep indefinitely now once there's any tiny leakage from the cap it goes flat and bacteria can get in also if it's diet there's about a six month limit on aspartame unless you keep it chilled other sweeteners i don't think are so subject to breaking down when you go to open your tonic if there's a ffft sound as the carbonation pressure escapes and if you see no floaties in the liquid then you're ok now i don't think i'd want to chance one that's been around for a half dozen years but by then they'd be flat anyhow nothing lasts forever  Wine Champagne (beverage) Tea Refrigerator Tofu Wine making Refrigeration Bread Pasteurization Cider Refrigerator car Cuisine of Denmark Carbon dioxide Vinegar HVAC Pinot Noir Oak Air conditioning Hydraulic machinery Gas absorption refrigerator Brewing Heat Vacuum Heat pump Phase change heat pump Lager Rum Hiberno-English Autonomous building Breastfeeding Coffee Cell (biology) Brewery Wines of Portugal Dairy Cork taint Tire Bong E85 Heat engine Stirling engine Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony Cabernet Sauvignon Siphon Wine degustation Christmas tree Homebrewing Space shuttle main engine Basement Carburetor Emergency preparedness Capercaillie Chicken Sake Madeira wine Softball Room temperature Shelf life Guinness Food science Sun Swingout Mango Cooking oil Cork (material) Geothermal exchange heat pump Planet of the Daleks Polyethylene terephthalate Sea-Monkey German wine Sangr__a Economy of Algeria Diode Ramen Haloalkane Bottle opener Bicycle brake systems Ammonia Fossil fuel power plant Screwcap Operation Petticoat Ton Roman eating and drinking Risotto Beer Weather lore Gas compressor European heat wave of 2003 Aircraft engine controls Thermal power station Lemonade Food storage Swamp cooler Deep lake water cooling Shiraz grape Ethylene glycol Bottle In-N-Out Burger Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir

what other beers brewers use the carbonation device in a can its canned draught guinness launched in contains a capsule of a nitrogen and stout blend this is filled on the canning line and the contents of the capsule are released automatically when the package is broached the opening of the can releases the pressure and this causes the capsule to blow the stout inside the capsule helps to diffuse the nitrogen this device which won them a queen's award last month is being employed in a canned ale guinness draught bitter being test marketed in the anglia central and granada television regions not only does the nitrogen make the beer more creamy and produce a better head it also protects against oxidation the brewer can therefore permit the beer to be less carbonated the canned draught products have levels of carbonation similar to those in cask conditioned ales and less than half those in some bottled beers guinness's rival murphy's will soon be entering the market with its own canned draught dry stout but using a slightly different system this method also employed by whitbread for its newly launched canned ale boddington's draught uses only nitrogen in the capsule it is also unusual in that the capsule is filled before the beer is put into the can the third irish stout beamish receives its dose of nitrogen on the canning line so does courage's canned ale draught directors' one or two regional brewers are also using this technique two nationally famous ales both from burton on trent are getting a dose of nitrogen in a tank before they are canned these are draught burton ale from ind coope and traditional draught ale from bass when i tasted these products alongside one another it was clear that the technique used by murphy's and boddington's creates the creamiest result i felt this enhanced the overall character of the toasty tasting murphy's stout though i am not sure that creaminess is appropriate in a dry austere ale such as boddington's draught guinness is meant to be creamy and was so was that company s new ale very malty but with a powerful hop balance i liked its intensity of flavors but found it somewhat cloying it might benefit from a spicier variety of hop beamish was not especially creamy but had a good roasty stout character courage directors' seemed carbonic with a muddy sweetish palate but some mitigating dryness in the finish because of the effects of pasteurisation i did not feel that any of the ales remotely matched their draught counterparts while stouts are sufficiently powerful in flavour to endure pasteurisation without too much damage ales are less robust because of the effects of pasteurisation i did not feel that any of the ales remotely matched their draught counterparts the splendidly hoppy aromatic burton ale came closest followed by the fruity bass  Beer Brewery India Pale ale Hop (plant) Stout beer Brewing Bitter (beer) Pale ale Bock Bury St Edmunds Guinness Wheat beer Public house Fuller, Smith and Turner Gin Miller Brewing Lager English beer Draught beer Lambic Vinegar Root beer Homebrewing Burton-upon-Trent Trappist beer Malt liquor Keg Samuel Adams (beer) Oktoberfest Mead Alcoholic beverage Redhook Ale Brewery Near beer St Austell Isinglass Smoked beer K__lsch (beer) Mild ale Porter (beer) Moosehead Real ale Bass (beer) Yuengling Barrel (storage) Coopers Brewery Pilsener International Phonetic Alphabet Tea Sake Ginger ale Yarrow Beck's Hip hop culture Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Herbal tea Rum Canada Dry P__cs Brewery Disc jockey Molson American lager Charles Wells Cascade Brewery Codename: Kids Next Door Alternative hip hop Star of David Canadian beer Prohibition Mexican beer Music genre Tooheys Root beer float Stella Artois Microbrew Ballantine Thai language German cuisine Coffee Bruges Widget Australian beer Reinheitsgebot Oolong XXXX Lion Nathan Herbie Hancock Labatt Brewing Company Henry Thrale Hip hop music Belgian beer Small beer Koopa Kid Nitrogen Reading, Berkshire Rolling Rock Diamond

can you mix an alcoholic drink with glycerin i was wondering if i could mix vodka or rum with glycerin and water would this be safe the vegetable glycerine by now foods has a rich oily texture but is water soluble because it is derived entirely from vegetable oil it is hypoallergenic and safe for all uses it is pure enough to be taken internally but there are other not so safe and practical uses for glycerin such as soaps cosmetics etc and these should never be ingested as the glycerin is not pure and will make you ill it is also used to stop diarrhea and to brush your teeth a glycerin extract of grapefruit seed and use a glycerin based tincture or a cooled tea with a dose of drops of the to the body is slightly antiseptic and promotes internal secretions u s scientists have developed a technology designed to convert waste glycerin from biodiesel plants into ethanol another popular biofuel rice university assistant professor ramon gonzalez and colleagues identified the metabolic processes and conditions that allow a strain of e coli to convert glycerin into ethanol it's also very efficient said gonzalez we estimate the operational costs to be about percent less that those of producing ethanol from corn u s biodiesel production is at an all time high but the industry is also facing a significant problem in how to deal with waste glycerin one pound of glycerin is produced for every pounds of biodiesel gonzalez noted the research by gonzalez research associate syed shams yazdani and graduate students yandi dharmadi and abhishek murarka is reported in the journal current opinion in biotechnology so it all depends on the quality and type of glycerin were talking about hope you have a great day  Cephalic disorder Pneumonia Cancer Stroke Haloperidol Clomipramine Diazepam Stomach cancer Tobacco smoking Herpes simplex virus Doxepin 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Alcoholic beverage Tocopherol Caffeine Nutrition Psychosis Multiple sclerosis Anxiety Drug abuse Methamphetamine Coffee Diabetes mellitus Health issues and the effects of cannabis Drug addiction Obstetrics Growth hormone treatment Narcotic Birth weight Venlafaxine Insulin Chronic fatigue syndrome LSD Hangover Maprotiline Propranolol Bupropion Autism Chocolate Anemia Opioid Cirrhosis Omega-3 fatty acid Cannabis (drug) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Decompression sickness Trazodone Bipolar disorder Narcissism Parkinson's disease Childbirth Hypertension Migraine Diarrhea Gastroparesis Psoriasis Charles Darwin's illness Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Amphetamine Anorexia nervosa Obesity Coeliac disease Divorce Atherosclerosis Glycogen storage disease type I Vomiting Chemotherapy Atkins Nutritional Approach Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Word of Wisdom Sleep Chlorpromazine Acupuncture Protein-energy malnutrition Paroxetine Lorazepam Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder Foodborne illness Medical cannabis

does anyone have any wine suggestions we have tried a few recently we prefer sweet wines to bitter or dry just hate to keep buying the same one over and over there are a lot of wonderful wines out there to try you just have to keep on trying to find the wines you might like here are some recommendations from me as for white wines for beginners i usually recommend sauvignon blanc and riesling sauvignon blanc tends to be fruity slightly sweet and crisp and easy to drink i always enjoy drinking a glass of sauvignon blanc such as duckhorn sauvignon blanc caymus conundrum or chateau st michelle as for riesling it is usually sweeter but also plenty of fruit i recommend either californian or german a good one to start is bonny doon pacific riesling either dry or sweet as for red wine i would recommend either cabernet franc or zinfandel cabernet franc is slightly sweet red wine with quality resembling that of cabernet sauvignon or merlot but without such bitterness there are a few good cabernet franc including peju and titus as for zinfandel that is much more reasily accesible and available as well as cheaper zinfandel is the grape that also makes white zinfandel without the grape skin the wine is sweeter with grape skin it is more complex red zinfandel or zinfandel as we call it is a wonderful slightly sweet wine with lots of fruit berry but they also tend to be higher on alcohol content you can try zinfandel from chateau montelena frank's rosemblum and ridge if you want the really sweet wine then try dessert wine white dessert wine such as ice wine inniskilling and sauturnes chateau rieussec or their second wine half are very nice to drink after dinner while red dessert wine hands down is best represented by port sandeman and dow makes some cheaper port costing good luck and keep on trying i hope you will find something you will like from this  Brandy Cognac (drink) Rum Cognac Armagnac (drink) Pisco Wine Beer The Amazing Race Hennessy Single malt Scotch Champagne (beverage) Coffee Plastic Tequila Bock Snap-dragon (game) Scotch whisky Trailer Park Boys Soft drink Pernod Ricard Sake Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire Fortune Brands Allied Domecq Moe Szyslak Make money fast Flat tax Poker jargon Knots Landing AVN Awards Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Chocolate United States dollar Boyz II Men Autonomous building Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

what is a widget i've just found a little ball inside my can of guinness which my mate has called a widget what i want to know is what is a widget and why is it in my guinness i found the us patent by guiness beer foam device no mention of widget perhaps it is in the original patent in britian us beverage package and a method of packaging a beverage containing gas in solution derwent title country us united states of america inventor forage alan j seer green united kingdom byrne william j mount merrion ireland assignee arthur guinness son company limited dublin ireland other patents from arthur guinness son company limited approx news profiles stocks and more about this company published filed application number us ipc code advanced b b b d b d u s class current abstract a beverage package and a method of packaging a beverage having gas preferably at least one of carbon dioxide and inert nitrogen gases in solution has a non resealable container within which is located a hollow pod having a restricted aperture in a side wall the container is charged with the beverage and sealed beverage from the main chamber of the container enters the pod shown at a by way of the aperture to provide headspaces a in the container and a in the pod gas within the headspaces a and a is at greater than atmospheric pressure preferably the beverage is drawn into the hollow pod by subjecting the package to a heating and cooling cycle upon opening the container by draw ring region the headspace a is vented to atmosphere and the pressure differential resulting from the pressure in the pod headspace a causes gas beverage to be ejected from the pod by way of the aperture into the beverage said ejection causes gas to be evolved from solution in the beverage in the main container chamber to form a head of froth on the beverage the pod is preferably formed by blow moulding and located as a press fit within the container which latter is preferably a can carton or bottle primary asst examiners richman barry s mcmahon timothy m first claim show all claims we claim a beverage package comprising a sealed non resealable container having a primary chamber containing beverage having gas in solution therewith and forming a primary headspace comprising gas at a pressure greater than atmospheric enclosure means defining a secondary chamber having a volume less than said primary chamber restrictor means defining a restricted orifice said secondary chamber communicating with the beverage in said primary chamber through said restricted orifice said secondary chamber containing beverage supplied thereto from the beverage in the primary chamber and having a secondary headspace therein comprising gas at a pressure greater than atmospheric so that the pressures within the primary and secondary chambers are substantially at equilibrium said container is openable to expose the primary headspace to atmospheric pressure and wherein the secondary chamber is arranged so that upon opening of the container the pressure differential caused by the decrease in pressure at the primary headspace causes beverage in the secondary chamber to be ejected by way of the restricted orifice into the beverage of the primary chamber and said ejection causes gas in the solution to be evolved and form or assist in the formation of a head of froth on the beverage how does the widget in a beer can work it is in your can of guinness becuase guinness brewery wants you to have a real ale experience it is a device that creates a proper head to your guinness soon other brewers will be using their own versions to answer this question first we need to discuss what makes beer fizzy and how a head forms most beers are carbonated with carbon dioxide co when the beer is in the can some of this co is dissolved in the beer and some is at the top of the can the co that is dissolved in the beer is what makes it fizzy when the can is closed the pressure inside is higher than the pressure outside so that when you open the can the sudden drop in pressure and the agitation of pouring causes some of the co to bubble out of solution forming a head on your beer a stout like guinness has a creamier longer lasting head than a canned lager beer in addition guinness is less fizzy than a regular lager beer guinness is canned with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen nitrogen is not absorbed into the beer nearly as well as carbon dioxide so even though a can of guinness may be at the same pressure as a can of lager it contains less co and is therefore less fizzy because the nitrogen makes up some of the pressure because a beer like guinness contains less dissolved co if you poured it from a can with no widget the head not be very thick because most of the co would stay dissolved the purpose of the widget is to release the co from some of the beer in the can to create the head the widget is a plastic nitrogen filled sphere with a tiny hole in it the sphere is added to the can before the can is sealed it floats in the beer with the hole just slightly below the surface of the beer the guinness widget note the cavity near the center of the ball the tiny hole is located within the cavity just before the can is sealed a small shot of liquid nitrogen is added to the beer this liquid nitrogen evaporates during the rest of the canning process and pressurizes the can as the pressure increases in the can beer is slowly forced into the sphere through the hole compressing the nitrogen inside the sphere when you open the can the pressure inside immediately drops the compressed gas inside the sphere quickly forces the beer out through the tiny hole into the can as the beer rushes through the tiny hole this agitation causes the co that is dissolved in the beer to form tiny bubbles that rise to the surface of the beer these bubbles help form the head  Lemonade Soft drink Chocolate Candy Rum Alcoholic beverage Drink Ice cream Drinking culture Cocktail Vodka

what is the proper psi for a kegerator i just bought a kegerator and i cannot get the beer to pour right it seems to be to foamy all the time i can only relate this to the co tank not being set up right any suggestions hmm trying to remember my college days with a kegerator in my apartment kinda cloudy though if memory serves the lower the better i would set it for about psi purge the current pressure and let it settle if it is still foamy decrees pressure and try again other variables are the temapture of the keg of course and a clean line if his kegerator is brand new as in never been used before then line cleanliness is not the issue but if you bought it used then i would definetly invest in a beer kleen solution which you can get at any home brewer supply store to clean out the lines yeast will build up in the line and pour spout and cause foaming as it interupts the flow and cause air bubbles in the line also taints the beer taste as well so let's review set lowest possible setting and purge tank and adust up or down from there start at about make sure keg is cold don't allow anything else to be store in kegerator mugs funnels ect as this will restrict air flow around keg clean lines if you bought a used kegerator last think i would recomment is not to use straight co your local welding shop gas supplier will have beer gas it's a blend of co and nitrogen this is ideal for draft beer helps eliminate foam and also enhances the beer to make it taste cleaner not tainted hope this helps and pour me a tall one once you get this problem resolved first of course  Tax Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Filling station Alcoholic beverage Alcohol fuel Excise Fuel tax Prohibition Stamp duty United Kingdom corporation tax Value added tax Cigarette Homebrewing Tennessee Gallon Wine Sales tax Biodiesel Life insurance Income tax Liquor store English unit Capital gains tax Taxation in Canada Moonshine Mutual fund Single malt Scotch Article One of the United States Constitution Vehicle excise duty Tesco Wal-Mart Insurance Sake Coca-Cola Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution United States district court Bulk vending Georgia (U.S. state) Expert system Her Majesty's Customs and Excise Pepsi-Cola Economy of India Read my lips: no new taxes Income statement Supermarket Customs and Excise Department Taxation in the United Kingdom Missouri wine Dave Matthews Band Barrel (storage) Hybrid vehicle FairTax September 11, 2001 attack opportunists North Carolina Supply and demand Price discrimination Poll Tax Riots Toyota Prius Inland Revenue College town Southern United States Wine bottle Interstate 95 Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board of Ontario Wine making Progressive tax Surry County, North Carolina Goods and Services Tax (Canada) Microphone Black Books West Virginia Tax haven United States v.

how do you prepare absinthe do you need to prepare it there are special ways to drink absinthe it's not required that you drink it this way but it effects the taste and makes the absinthe easier to drink this information is directly quoted from the greenfairy org website method water ritual the classic method of drinking it involves pouring cold water over a slotted spoon which contains a sugar cube into a glass containing a shot of absinthe as the water hits the absinthe the oils precipitate out and the drink changes from a clear emerald color to an opaque milky white this is called la loucheor louching method fire ritual a variation of the traditional drinking ritual follows in this variation a heaping teaspoon of sugar or cube is briefly wet in the glass of pure absinthe then lit on fire and held over the glass as the alcohol burns off the sugar melts into the glass when the fire gets low the remaining sugar is stirred into the drink and the drink is quickly drunk the fire method looks way cooler but in the end it's the water method that tastes better  Wine Champagne (beverage) Wine making Sonoma County, California Cabernet Sauvignon Anderson Valley Madeira wine American Viticultural Area Missouri Rhineland Terroir Tokaj-Hegyalja Burgundy wine Stellenbosch, Western Cape Pisco Philippe de Rothschild Missouri wine N__gociant HyperText Transfer Protocol Tokaj (region in Slovakia) Rio Grande do Sul University of California, Davis Saint-__milion Napa County, California Zinfandel Appellation d'Origine Contr__l__e Secure Shell Common Unix Printing System Chambolle-Musigny Web browser Livermore, California XML Transport Layer Security Resource Description Framework Wines of Portugal McMinnville, Oregon JavaServer Pages James Busby Chardonnay Ithaca, New York Tokaji Viognier Varietal Ch__teau Haut-Brion Ice wine Master of Wine M__ller-Thurgau Kosher wine Livermore Valley Public key infrastructure Tannin Po__ega Clare Valley S__millon B__ziers Plantation Country wine W__rttemberg Pacific Ten Conference Phylloxera Kosher foods Cognac Grey market WebDAV Halaal Mendoza Province Bet Shemesh University of Adelaide Weinsberg Cava Uniform Resource Locator World Wide Web SAML Nathaniel de Rothschild Semi-generic Spyware Sopron Martha's Vineyard Internet Unified Modeling Language Pinot Noir Malvasia Brandy Chablis wine Klopotec Weinviertel M.I.N.D.

does beer become stale if it is cold becomes warm and then you chill it again generally most people cannot detect the subtle changes that occur in beers treated this way unless the flavor is obvious this is from the beer advocate page listed above with my comments here are some tips when buying beer at your local package store and how to avoid dead beers buy brew from the cooler it keeps the beer fresh beer sitting out at room temperature even for a few months may start to degrade and become stale plus chances are that same beer was transported cold and allowed to warm not good cold storage also slows oxidation in beer even the tightest bottling system will allow minute amounts of air into the bottle which over the months will start to destroy the beer and give it a wet paper cardboard flavor me a few months even the large nation brands recommend the beer is drank within months do not buy old beer these temperatures are extreme or a very long time frame to cause chemical decomposition oxidation will occur only vary rarly from modern brewery packaging systems it is more likely a concern for craft brewers which have less sophisticated packaging systems it is the craft beers we really need to watch for as they do not move off the shelf fast in addtion i would never buy a craft brewed beer that was not kept cold always look for a freshness date some will have a packaged on date and some will have a best before date some breweries will ink print the bottled on date right above the label as well as on each case box some notch the side of their label noting which month to consume the beer by while others will employ the freshness date in different places on the bottle and or packaging if they don't use a freshness date consumer beware me i agree dust it's a sure sign the beer has been sitting dead for a long time put it down and walk away from the beer calmly me i agree avoid buying beer that is kept in direct light which allows damaging uv rays in both excessive direct sunlight and heat can give the brew a skunky stale flavor which is a by product of the delicate hop oils spoiling me note both excessive direct sunlight and or heat this is the cause of skunkyness is beer uv light and this almost always observed in green or clear bottles it will not occur in miller because the brewering scientists have developed the rho hop by borohydride reduction of isomerized iso alpha acids which prevents the chemicsl change what occurs in uv effected beers is a chemical ring compound derived from hops photolysis of alpha acid's isohexenoyl side chain is charged by the uv enegry the ring breaks open and a sulfer compound hydrongen sulfide or a thiol attaches to it the resultant compound isopentenyl mercaptan methylbut enyl thiol is reponsible for the charcteristic sunstruck or lightstruck skunky aroma and flavor heineken there is no such thing as beer on sale it's a package store not a wal mart there's probably a good reason that pack is only don't take any chances by being a cheapskate me know your source and know your brewers of course there are always exceptions to these rules generally speaking the higher the alcohol the longer the shelf life so higher octane beers like barley wines many belgian ale styles german bocks hefty porters and stouts etc do not go bad for the most part these brews tend to gain character with aging for many months even years highly hopped brews also tend to benefit from a longer shelf life due to the preserving quality in the hop oils so think before you grab any old beer buy only fresh beer consume before expiration and make a point to notify package store owners or even the brewer when you come across bad beers respect beer me again i say know your source and know your brewers do not allow beer or buy beer stored in conditions of heat  Alcoholic beverage Champagne (beverage) Wine Public house Soft drink Drunkenness Bar (establishment) Beer Ship naming and

what is a tail chaser a chaser is a follow up drink of lesser alcoholic content for instance a boilermaker is a shot of whiskey followed by a chaser of beer typically beer is served in ounce or larger servings but as the chaser in a boilermaker many bartenders give you a ounce to ounce serving the beer gets the strong taste of the liquor out of your mouth it's a habit of many dogs to turn in a circle times before lying down if you were lying in tall grass or wheat stubble you'd walk around and knock it down first too because if it sticks up it pokes you or at least it tickles you many people laugh at dogs for doing this having never lain in a fresh cut wheat field and talk about dogs chasing their own tails as if they thought the tail was another dog it's not really the dog that's stupid if you catch my drift in bartending a tail chaser is a stupid chaser one in which a stronger beverage follows a weaker one for instance a glass of coke followed by a rum chaser it'd get you the same place as a cuba libre but it'd leave the taste of rum in your mouth instead of the taste of a coke i suppose the idea of a tail chaser is to prove that you're a man or something like that basically it just proves that you're an idiot if you want to drink a liquor and you want to leave the taste lingering in your mouth just order a jigger of the drink neat duh  Alcoholic beverage Soft drink Malt liquor Beer Coffee Australian words Wine Canadian slang Volume Lager Cheese Wheat beer Saint Louis, Missouri Tehran Cockney Plastic Columbus, Ohio Prohibition Newark, New Jersey Oklahoma City, Oklahoma U.S. customary units Hip hop culture PHP Diving suit Oregon Canadian beer Rolling Rock Liquor store 40 (number) M16 (rifle) Ketchup Breastfeeding Joke Hypoglycemia Miller Brewing American Association (19th century) The Jim Rome Show Uptown, Minneapolis Cryptic crossword Lodi, California Madrid Gin Mixtape Metrication De Beers Cable television Clarence Earl Gideon Vending machine Tesco Champagne (beverage) Cuisine of Denmark Gatorade Patent medicine Monterrey Guinness Apple Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Weapons of mass destruction Brewing Brewers Retail Inc.

why does ice melt in alcohol so fast i know the freezing points are different but isn't there another reason basic thermodynamics the ice begins pulling heat energy from the alcohol it is not the ice cooling the alcohol it is the alcohol that transfers heat to the ice solid water the ice draws heat from the warmer alcohol inducing the ice to melt this is because the freezing point of the alcohol is much lower than the ice if we were to keep the ice in the glass by adding more the rate of melting of the ice would slow because the heat energy loss of the alcohol has been reduced but it would indeed continue to draw heat from the alcohol just more slowly this of course would require no atmosphere heat energy from contacting either the ice or the alcohol if we had solid co dry ice it could draw enough energy heat from the alcohol to freeze it solid this of course would require no atmosphere heat energy from contacting either the ice or the alcohol plus a lot of dry ice to replace what has melted or sublimated away  Website HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Web server Apache HTTP Server Uniform Resource Locator HTTP cookie Domain name Wget Wireless Application Protocol Denial-of-service attack Virtual hosting Cross site scripting Representational State Transfer Squid cache Taxi Driver Web browser Uniform Resource Identifier San Jose Earthquakes Web crawler Typosquatting System of a Down JavaServer Pages Web cache Web service CPAN Ajax (programming) Republic Pictures Internet Spyware Port numbers Phishing Intranet Internet censorship in mainland China Gmail MSN Messenger Judo at the 2004 Summer Olympics Mydoom Proxy server Remote procedure call Domain Name System Slash (punctuation) Thumbnail gallery post Fremont, California Depeche Mode Google Web Accelerator WebDAV Genealogy Electronic commerce Winamp Software agent Internet Information Services Burzum MySpace HTML Jeep Deep linking WebSphere Wiki Television network Alex Jones (journalist) Web traffic Monster Rancher monsters Country club Computer Geocaching BitTorrent Apache Software Foundation Internet privacy Gopher protocol SAML Bbc.co.uk Web portal LiveJournal Google Java Servlet Patricia Ford Mecca Slayers Warner Bros.

does ireland serve their guiness cold or at room temperature guinness is indeed served slightly chilled at cellar temperature about degrees f on the emerald isle this is the best range for such a beer style although the serving temperature in europe varies from country to country they are served warmer than in the usa we americans are addicted to cold and cold foods hell we even serve our hot foods cold such as left over pizza okay bit of a stretch beers have specific brewing and aging temperatures ales are about degrees f were lagers f and colder for the actual lagering stage with some variance of temp amoung brewers and so it is found that these beers are best drank about the same temps but usually toward the high end of the range we americans say the beers are warm or some people say hot but they are the correct temperature and we are wro well unique  Lager Guinness Bock Beer Samuel Adams (beer) Stout beer Bitter (beer) Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Brewery Pilsener Ale Miller Brewing Budweiser Budvar Coors Brewing Company Belgian beer American lager Mexican beer Cigar Beer in Serbia and Montenegro German cuisine German beer Australian beer Pale ale Aftertaste Yuengling Tooheys Brewing Vinegar Porter (beer) Draught beer Jewish cuisine Vores __l Guinness Book of Records Cuisine of Denmark Hop (plant) __esk__ Bud__jovice Heuristic Lambic French cuisine Wheat beer Diamond Bong Korean cuisine Sierra Nevada (US) Miller Lite First-person shooter Anheuser-Busch Sam Walton Duff Beer Methos P__cs Brewery India Pale ale Humphrey Bogart Haarlem Diet soda Beck's Ansel Adams Cider Legend of Mana San Gabriel Valley Bread Molson Mild ale Moosehead Charles Wells Rum Basic taste Shandy Kitsch Real ale German grammar Tobacco Ludacris Ultraviolet Trademark Corona Color Beer Pong Jenever Alcoholic beverage K__lsch (beer) Sanskrit Taken Meaning Cantus Wood Cuisine of Austria Moon Sun Chick Corea The Drew Carey Show High-voltage direct current Sunglasses Samuel Smith (brewery) Toyota Camry Lincolnshire Transformers: Cybertron Black Label Leffe Lutefisk

when you have a foaming drink beer soda why does the foam go down quicker when you put your finger in it they are correct indubitably i will continue when i come home tonight with a giant buzz on otay yes the surface tension of the bubble latttice network looses cohesion when disrupted by oil from a finger but interestingly enough alcohol also has negatively effects beer foam stability existing in the beer produced from the grist in the mash are proteins glycoproteins fatty acids and hop substances it is the natural substances in the beer that contributes to its foam instability when the oils of the finger are localized and not disbursed throughout the foam it destablizes the surface network reduces its cohesion leading to foam failure beer is its on enemy as processing mash can negativly effect foam stability this is true because during mashing large molecular weight proteins are degraded and fatty acids produced in summary background information of beer foam a lot of science stuff read at your own leisure the behavior of beer foam can be explained by assuming that beer proteins are the major foaming agents the main component of beer foam are high molecular weight glycoproteins these are derieved from the malted barley and enhanced with use of unmalted cereal adjunts barley and wheat the paradox for the brewer is that the same proteins desired for beer foam are also responsible for haze turbidity in ales the amount of surface active proteins present well exceeds that for reasonable head retention but in lagers the amount is only adequate for satisfactory foam stability lipids fat fatty acids glycesides and phospholipids are also surface active material and will form a mixed surfactant system in beer in competition with the surface active proteins for space in the surface films if the lipid exists in discrete clusters in the surface film the film will lose its uniformity much of its elasticity and will collapse rapidly on the other hand if the lipid is dispersed evenly throughout the film in association with the foaming agent the ensuing foam can have either better or less poorer stability the hop iso alpha acids are also concentrated into the foam addition of iso alpha acids to beer increases head retention but in particular the iso alpha acids are resopnsible are resopnsible for foam adhesion cling or lacing traces of heavy metal ions iron cobalt nickel and copper also improve the head retention of beers but only in the presence of iso alpha acids the physical properties of the film relevant to foam formation are surface tension surface elasticity and surface viscosity the surface tension should be low since it is a measure of the energy required to form a new surface the film should be elastic so that local deformations do not need to create a new surface with an elastic film the ingress and egress in the film is relatively slow so that the surface viscosity is high surface viscosity is a direct measure of the adhesion between molecules in a film and it increases in the presence of iso alpha acids for a foam to be stable once formed some change must occur in the surface active molecules within the film such changes could be brought about either by changes in the conformation of the protein ot by cross linking of the protein with small molecules such as the iso alpha acids or by metal ions the foam stabilizer most commonly used in the brewing industry is propylene glycol alginate the major function of such charged polysaccharides as foam stabilizers is to overcome the detrimental effects of lipids so it is a disruption of the foam forming agents and the actual stuctures of glycoprotein iso alpha acids metals and stabilizing agents that result in its collapse this can be incresed by the localized deposits of oil from a finger  Steve Wozniak Eureka Seven Alcoholics Anonymous Chappelle's Show Austin Powers Peter Sellers New Morning Mike Patton Marcy Playground Mr. Bungle Urine Euphemism Blood alcohol content California (Mr. Bungle album) Eric Cartman The O.C.
