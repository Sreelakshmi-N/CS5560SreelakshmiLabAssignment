bodyboarding vs surfing which one is better only answer if you do one i disagree with the dude above saying that it's easier to duck with a body board a body board is more of a float able device than a surfboard you can run over the waves with a surfboard with a body board you have to push down as hard as you can and hope you don't get sucked back into a foot wave and have a really bad wipeout  Bodyboarding Surfing Windsurfing Kitesurfing Professional wrestling holds Canoeing Wipeout (game) Silver Surfer Kayak Skimboarding Skateboarding trick Bethany Hamilton Surf rock Laird Hamilton San Onofre State Park Boom Town (Doctor Who) Lindy Basic Diving The Parting of the Ways Strap-on dildo Rip current Snowboarding Glossary of climbing terms Drowning Guilherme T__mega Kyle Broflovski Shen Gong Wu Carburetor Swingout Table tennis Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Dundas Square Devo Skateboard The Wedge (surfing) Conker's Bad Fur Day Equine conformation Dude Aerial (dance move) Surf culture Piccolo Junior Saga Mosh Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Maximum Exposure Schlock Mercenary Santa Cruz, California Flag Crowd surfing Eddie Aikau Lifeguard Personal flotation device Alien races from the Godzilla films Kneeboarding (surfsport) Avalon, New Jersey Robot Master Dredge Ski Casualty lifting Scientific method Wave power Trapping Kimi Finster Rachel Corrie R-Type Vacuum cleaner Shit Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling throws Rugby union Fast bowling Gravity Mavericks Australian Senate Swimming Aerosmith Backstroke Press Your Luck AmigaOS Treehouse of Horror IX Volleyball Mouse (computing) Darkwing Duck Fan (implement) Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Skysurfing TaleSpin Doom enemies Monetary policy Expansion chamber African American Vernacular English Sermon on the Mount Condom Syphon Filter Kain (Legacy of Kain) Paragliding Out-of-body experience Escape from New York Triathlon Bong

i want to learn to surf i live in chicago and grew up in minnesota i used to live to snowboard when i was a kid i was wondering if moving away from the city i love chicago was a good idea just because i want to learn how to surf i don't have lots of money so i was wondering if surfing is a good enough reason to move away to califronia if surfing offers what snowboarding offers then yes i will move though wow packing up a moving west because you want to learn to surf is a huge commitment maybe you should go to cali for vacation and go to a surf camp to see if you like it or better yet you can hook up with some of the great lakes surfing groups and give it a try i always encourage people who are interested to try it but moving cross country is a big step also if you don't have much money california is going to be a big problem it's super expensive to live there florida has surf warm water and a more reasonable cost of living  Surfing Cruising (maritime) The Beach Boys Snowboarding Kitesurfing Huntington Beach, California Rocket Power Surf's Up Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Smile (album) Microeconomics Kayak Galactic Civilizations Current teachings of Prem Rawat Minor league baseball Erie Canal Education in the United States Lake District Inflation Peru Satchel Paige James J.
