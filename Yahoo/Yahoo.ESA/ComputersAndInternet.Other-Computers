opening folders to full screen size when i open my desktop shortcuts for internet sites the window opens to a small size and then i have to maximize it to be at full screen size how can i set them to open at full screen size without maximizing them open your window as normal and then drag it so that the top left hand corner of the window is aligned to the top left hand corner of your display then grab the bottom right hand corner of the window and drag it out to the bottom right hand corner of the display finally close the window by clicking on the x in the caption bar or selecting exit from the menu making certain that the window is not maximized when you close it from this point on the window will open at this size windows applications typically save their state in the registry when they close so the trick is to close them at least once in a non maximized state at the size you want them to always open at  Mouse (computing) Screenshot Macintosh Finder Taskbar History of the graphical user interface Windows XP EIA-708 X Window System Windows Vista AmigaOS Windows 2000 IPod Microsoft Windows Opera (web browser) Start Menu Konqueror System 6 Danger Hiptop History of Microsoft Windows Unicode Windows Explorer Drill bit Macromedia Flash Window Maker HTML element Blue screen of death ITunes Pop-up ad Minesweeper (computer game) AppleScript Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Konfabulator Windows registry Google Desktop Multiple document interface Mac OS X v10.4 Teletext Menu (computing) Dance Dance Revolution Apple typography Gmail Cascading Style Sheets Inkscape Laptop System 7 (Macintosh) Library (computer science) Windows 1.0 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Hello world program GunBound Twm Newline Self programming language OpenGL Xlib Mac OS X Professional wrestling holds Cmd.exe File Allocation Table Visual Basic Computer virus Poker jargon QuickDraw PostScript Virtual desktop DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX GNU Screen Loudspeaker IBM PC compatible Stardock Aerial (dance move) The Amber Spyglass Windows Server 2003 Tab (GUI) Tabbed document interface Mac OS history Prank flash NTFS junction point Screensaver Palm OS Lotus Notes DesktopX Internet Relay Chat Stereoscopy Common User Access Apple Computer Kayak Option key Cut and paste Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Mozilla Firefox Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Icon (computing) IBM PC keyboard Halo: Combat Evolved

i hope this makes sense but can you safely delete old upgrades or will it affect the latest upgrade and will it make any difference to space on computer i think it's risky microsoft keeps old versions of programs such as media player so that you can roll back to the old version if you have problems with the new one media player is such an example even if the new version is installed in a different directory i'm not confident that files in the old version may not be used by other programs try a custom uninstall and you will sometimes get messages asking you if you want to delete a file because it may be used by other programs if you want to delete an old version i'd suggest moving it to a temporary directory and waiting a week to check that there are no problems before deleting it it should give you a bit more space on your computer but it might not be that much unless the application contained a lot of video files such as some games  ITunes File system Windows XP Computer virus Windows Server 2003 Macromedia Flash MDAC Windows Installer C programming language Object Desktop Blue screen of death File Allocation Table Steam (content delivery) Spyware Windows 2000 AmigaOS Microsoft Windows Filename extension Internet Explorer Mac OS X Gmail Btrieve Virtual memory Copy protection The Sims 2 Linux Master Control Program Apple Macintosh MSN Messenger Library (computer science) Windows registry Java programming language Uninstaller Computer security Stardock Pretty Good Privacy AOL Instant Messenger Opera (web browser) History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible NTFS NX bit NTFS junction point Emacs Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista Rootkit SonicStage Data General Nova Podcasting Microsoft Plan 9 (operating system) System/36 Microsoft .NET Computer and video games E-mail WordStar Apple II family OS/2 Windows Me DragonFly BSD CP/M Novell NetWare Patch (computing) QuickTime Buffer overflow Enterprise content management Microsoft Jet Database Engine Windows 95 JavaScript X86 Error correction and detection CPU cache 64-bit IPod Mandriva Linux Common criticisms of Microsoft HyperCard System/34 SubSpace (computer game) Kazaa Chess Computer insecurity PlayStation 2 Final Fantasy (video game) Embedded system Perl Computer file ZX Spectrum Mozilla Firefox Linked list Computer History of operating systems Ethernet System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Mobile

can i install a game onto a gb usb drive and play it from that stick on other computers or do i have to install it on that stick while it's plugged in to the computer i plan on playing it at no its not possible coz everygame that you install needs registry entries to be entered in your computer also the vital d engine of the game needs to make ini files and conf files so that it can interact with the d graphics on your computer all this happens when you install any game on any computer when you transfer the installed game folder on a usb drive to a different pc the d game engine doesnt have the registry entries to interact with the d graphics of the other computer also various game components do not have subsequent conf files configured according to the other pc the only way you can carry installed games on your usb drive is if its a flash game  USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Windows 2000 File system Windows registry IPod PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Btrieve Windows XP Computer PlayStation 2 Secure Digital card Knoppix Linux Memory Stick Flash memory Mandriva Linux History of Microsoft Windows Object Desktop USB mass storage device class Hard disk IPod shuffle Nintendo Revolution File Allocation Table Modchip Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Memory card Commodore 64 Apple Macintosh Xbox 360 FreeDOS Laptop Digital audio player Booting Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Apple Computer PHP Digital photography Copy protection Windows Me Computer and video games Bluetooth Plug-and-play Architecture of Windows 2000 Dongle Partition (computing) FireWire Computer software MSN Messenger ITunes Nintendo 64 DVD Amiga Blue screen of death Doom 3 AirPort MDAC AmigaOS Computer and video game genres IMac Digital camera CompactFlash Atari 8-bit family Computer science Emacs Musical Instrument Digital Interface NTLDR Computer forensics OpenGL Game development Windows Installer IBook QuickTime Personal computer History of the graphical user interface Mac OS X Web page Configuration file Commodore International Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic BIOS ReactOS Embedded system Interactive fiction Mozilla Firefox Nintendo GameCube Floppy disk Read-only memory History of computer and video games Creative Nomad Digital Equipment Corporation Windows Explorer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer-aided design

windows xp if you buy windows xp can you load it on more than one computer and also does anyone have windows vista do you like it do you recommend it thanks for the input you have to buy a multi license of xp if you want to install it on multiple computers a multi license version will cost more than a regular single license copy as for vista i used it for a while when the beta was first released and i know a few people who use it right now vista has issues supporting some hardware and it can be hard to find drivers for things however these issues will improve as vista gets older and microsoft puts out more updates if you are planning on buying an operating system right now and your computer can support vista it may be more cost effective to get it now and wait out the bugs rather than buying xp at about then buying vista later i hope this helps  Windows XP Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 History of Microsoft Windows Windows Server 2003 IBM PC compatible AmigaOS OpenGL Apple Macintosh Microsoft X Window System MS-DOS DirectX Blue screen of death Linux IPod History of the graphical user interface Internet Explorer NTFS Timeline of computing 1990-forward FreeDOS Windows 3.x Architecture of Windows 2000 WebObjects Wine (software) MIPS architecture ReactOS Mozilla Firefox Computer virus CPU cache DragonFly BSD Portable Document Format Fritz-chip Universal Serial Bus Vorbis Virtual memory Booting Windows Me Novell NetWare NeXT Browser wars Amiga OS/2 Information Technology Infrastructure Library C plus plus WindowBlinds Perl Atari 8-bit family System 7 (Macintosh) Copy protection ATI Technologies OpenOffice.org OpenBSD Radeon File system Emacs DOS BIOS RISC OS PostScript MDAC File Allocation Table Thread (computer science) Kernel (computer science) Windows 95 Opera (web browser) MAME Mouse (computing) Redundant array of independent disks Plan 9 (operating system) Berkeley Software Distribution Xbox Free software Software bug TeX NX bit Graphical Environment Manager Java programming language Library (computer science) Apple II family Common Unix Printing System Palm OS Macintosh Finder Disk cloning MSN Messenger Windows API MSH (shell) Server Version Stardock Windows Blackcomb Common criticisms of Microsoft SCO-Linux controversies GNU General Public License

do you change your aperture size alot of people i speak to about graphic cards allways go on about their aperture size i know what it is its the setting in bios which is the amount of memory that gets used if your video memory runs out however have you changed your aperture size and have you had any problems when changing it such as system crashes ect cheers guys its not something i've done i've got dual graphics cards with a combined gb memory but it shouldn't cause any problems to increase it its just the more system memory it uses the slower it will go as it needs to transfer between the computer's processor and graphics card to get the job done properly depends how much you want to increase it if its important get a graphics card upgrade  Floppy disk IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh PC Engine Personal computer X86 Mac OS X Central processing unit CPU cache IBM PC Computer bus Microsoft Windows Computer Windows XP CPU design Color Graphics Adapter Cell (microprocessor) Mac OS PlayStation 2 Redundant array of independent disks TRS-80 BIOS ZX Spectrum ATI Technologies Commodore 128 Commodore 64 TRS-80 Color Computer Graphics card 3dfx Radeon History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Nintendo Revolution NVIDIA Windows Vista Virtual memory History of Microsoft Windows IMac History of operating systems 64-bit Hard disk PowerPC OS/2 Mach kernel Mac OS history Computer and video games Apple Computer Linux Amiga PowerBook Java programming language X86 assembly language Compiler optimization RISC Screenshot Trusted computing Windows 2000 Microprocessor Nintendo Entertainment System Overclocking GeForce 6 Series PC motherboard Apple II family Windows 3.x USB flash drive PlayStation 3 Graphics processing unit Front side bus DVD Computer terminal DDR2 SDRAM Nintendo Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Digital camera Sprite (computer graphics) Game programming TurboGrafx 16 Power-On Self Test System/36 Mac OS X v10.4 SIMD Symmetric multiprocessing MAME Apple Newton Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis File Allocation Table Motorola 68000 Supercomputer Canon T90 Nintendo 64 Knoppix Mainframe computer AmigaOS Cray-2 Non-Uniform Memory Access Aperture Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME

about how much space does compressing a file save i'm moving my music collection to online storage if i compress a gb file how much smaller will it be when i compress it if your music is in pretty much any format other than wav it is already compressed an mp file will probably grow slightly if you try to compress it because the compression software adds information to the file the only way to really compress music is to resample it at a ower bit rate which will also reduce the sound quality  MP3 JPEG Audio data compression Data compression PNG WAV Compression artifact ITunes Audio file format Lossy data compression Video codec GIF Image file formats JPEG 2000 Musical Instrument Digital Interface SonicStage Lossless data compression Portable Document Format Digital image editing NTFS Image compression PlayStation Portable ZIP (file format) Digital audio player Streaming media Disk image QuickTime Tar (file format) MiniDisc Macromedia Flash Enterprise content management Laserdisc IPod File format Ebook DVD H.264/MPEG-4 AVC CPU design Advanced Audio Coding ITU-T Psychoacoustics Raster graphics DV Hydrogen economy Wood Vorbis Tagged Image File Format Steganography WavPack StuffIt Movie projector Library (computer science) CPU cache File system Ogg Raw image format Prefix code Modem Redundant array of independent disks FLAC ITunes Music Store Disc jockey Digital photography Sony Podcasting Virtual memory Delta encoding LZW Audio level compression Creative Zen Jet engine Warez Floppy disk Digital circuit UTF-8 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SAS System Bit rate Federal Standard 1037C Audiophile Sound Blaster Mach kernel OpenDocument Speex CD-ROM File sharing Digital audio Comparison of file systems E-mail PlayStation Sound Format TTA XML MS-DOS Carbon dioxide Open-source software Backup America Online Gramophone record ZX Spectrum

how can i raise the volume of my mp files i have an mp player and all my music is in mp format or most of it rather the songs i burnt from cd's to my computer are significantly quieter than the songs i downloaded off of the internet when i put these songs together the normal ones and quiet ones on my mp player you can just assume the frustration of dealing with some songs being too loud because you can't hear the quieter ones well and vive versa so my question is is there anyway to raise or lower the volume of my mp files permanently through the computer to where my songs are all at the same or a similar volume you can use sound editing software such as goldwave to adjust the volume  MP3 ITunes Music Store Musical Instrument Digital Interface Karaoke DVD Commodore 64 Vorbis Macromedia Flash IPod Disc jockey Digital audio player Video game music Apple Computer Dance Dance Revolution Big band Prank flash Windows XP Online music store Marching band Floppy disk PlayStation Portable Multitrack recording Digital rights management Buddy Guy Filename extension MAME Piano Computer virus Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Vista Warez Podcasting Gramophone record Windows 2000 ZX Spectrum E-mail QuickTime Copy protection GIF John Cage ELO rating system Stardock Module file File sharing Peer-to-peer Amstrad CPC Mod (computer gaming) Computer science MiniDisc Psychoacoustics AmigaOS Mixtape Computer History of Microsoft Windows Digital photography Java programming language OpenDocument Oxford English Dictionary Object Desktop Chess Cheating in Counter-Strike GNU General Public License Mute (music) Loudness Synthesizer Dynamics (music) The Waterboys Grateful Dead PlayStation 3 Doom 3 Electric guitar Trusted computing Windows registry Nintendo GameCube Microeconomics Machinima Timpani Super Nintendo Entertainment System TeX Ebook Dave Matthews Band Ray Charles Portable Document Format Rhythm and blues Apple II family World Wide Web Sony Doom Kraftwerk SonicStage Doom WAD Apple typography File Transfer Protocol Sound recording Streaming media Dither

i've lost a file on my computer help it's urgent ok i had this file which i had saved to my flash drive as i needed to work on it on another computer i plugged the flash drive in a said send to my documents i then took out the flash drive and started working on the file in my docs i had it perfect so i saved it and turned off my computer then i just turned on my computer opened my documents and it is gone i have searched everywhere in the recycle bin used the search setting looked in like a million files but is has just disappeared unfortuantly i don't have system restore enabled either please someone needs to help me is there any other way to find a file that has literally disappeared firstly system restore restores you system not your data files you say you took out your flash drive after you copied the document to the computer so there's no way that it would try to resave to there is there so with the flash drive out you opened the copied file from my documents made amendments and re saved did you click on the save icon so that it sved with the same name and would automatically save to the same place from where you opened it or did you click on file save as in which case it could possibly have gone somewhere else i know you said you searched for it which is perplexing sometimes these impossibilities do happen for no apparent reason i presume you have also looked in recent documents if you click on file is it listed at the bottom of the submenu as usually the last few files opened are displayed there if it shows as it should what happens when you try to open from there ok so you've searched looking for it by name and nothing has come up how about doing another search this time putting in so it searches for any type of file but confine the search to say the day before and the day after and see what comes up possibly it saved as a tmp file can't really think of anything else but hope you can retrieve in any event not all is lost because you have the original on the flash drive in future when working on any document save early on make sure autosave is down to perhaps or minutes but don't rely on it and as you are typing just use ctrl s as part of the typing process to keep the document continually updated  Computer virus File system Windows 2000 Gmail Macintosh Finder IPod AmigaOS Windows XP Domain Name System Macromedia Flash CPU cache Backup Mouse (computing) Computer forensics Mozilla Firefox Apple II family File format Computer Digital photography Unicode Btrieve Floppy disk Search engine optimization Emacs WordStar Common Unix Printing System SCO-Linux controversies Knoppix Public-key cryptography Embedded system OpenDocument Linked list Trusted computing Screenshot EMule Product Lifecycle Management Redundant array of independent disks Windows Vista Master Control Program Enterprise content management Killian documents StarCraft Secret Missions PHP GameFAQs Flash memory Translation memory Portable Document Format Xerox Star Universal Serial Bus Virtual memory ITunes Modchip File Allocation Table USB flash drive Copy protection Wiki Daylight saving time Apple Open Collaboration Environment Hard disk Uploading and downloading Perl Web crawler Internet Relay Chat Bubble Bobble HTML element Uniform Resource Locator Ebook Icon (computing) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Read-only memory Computer science E-mail OpenOffice.org Public domain Linux Microsoft Windows Time travel Metadata Malware Ajax (programming) Spyware SETI@home Mac OS X v10.4 CPU design C programming language Apple typography Musical Instrument Digital Interface

motherboard question i have a dell diminsion and i want to change the motherboard so that it has a pci express port what do i need to buy and is there anything i can keep from my old motherboard the diminsion is all original with no new parts i dont want to spend that much money but i do want a motherboard with a pci express port any links would be nice thanks woops i ment i want to buy a motherboard and i want to know what to buy along with it to make it compatible with my computer in your situation if you want to change the motherboard to add a pci express card slot you will most likely need to buy a new case to put the new motherboard in name brand computers are proprietary and a new motherboard may not fit into the dell case take a look at what processor and the type of memory ram your dell computer now uses and buy a motherboard that matches these parts just install the processor and the ram memory from the dell computer onto the new motherboard and install the motherboard into the new case then move everything else from the dell hard drives dvd drives etc to the new case before you start this whole process you need to back up all the data you want to keep that is currently on your hard drive you need to do this because you will have do a fresh install of the windows operating system whether it's xp or vista you will most likely have to buy a copy of the windows os that you want to use because the windows os disk s that came with your dell computer may not let you do a fresh install a fresh install of windows in necessary because of the new motherboard the guts of the computer the new settings and drivers need to be installed fresh in the windows os also video cards that use the pci express slot are power hungry you will need to have a power supply that delivers enough power at least a minimum of watts check the box for the video card it should say what the minimum requirements are for a power supply new computer case to new motherboard to new power supply to windows os to  IBM PC compatible Computer bus PC motherboard IBM PC Apple II family Commodore 64 Sound Blaster Windows XP Atari ST Apple IIGS Windows 2000 Computer hardware Redundant array of independent disks Peripheral Component Interconnect ATI Technologies Apple Macintosh Power Macintosh G3 Overclocking Linux Windows Vista GeForce 6 Series ZX Spectrum Accelerated Graphics Port PlayStation 2 USB flash drive Atari 8-bit family TRS-80 Color Computer PlayStation 3 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 64-bit Graphics processing unit Laptop Hard disk Xbox MicroATX Microprocessor Windows 3.x Amstrad CPC Mac OS X IMac RISC Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC card Industry Standard Architecture Modchip Expansion card Computer case PowerPC MSX PCI Express History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Knoppix Floppy disk History of operating systems Booting CPU cache Commodore PET Patch (computing) Motherboard RS-232 Digital photography NVIDIA Nintendo GameCube Virtual memory Random access memory 3dfx A600 Mac OS Northbridge (computing) Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast IBook PC Engine System/36 Front side bus ATX File Allocation Table Opteron Copy protection Dynamic random access memory System/34 AMD Wintel Fritz-chip NX bit Embedded system

cable dsl broadband ok so i read up a little on each of these but i'm still a little confused apparantly cable and dsl are types of broadband internet but then if a company is offering broadband how do you know if it is cable or dsl i am looking to get a internet service for my new place and only have a lap top basically i am trying to figure out which type and which company would be the best i was also wondering if anyone knew anything about the internet 'card' that you simply but in your laptop and works anywhere i think it was with verizon thanks for all your help in terms of speed dsl and cable are pretty much the same cable will be slightly faster but not worth the extra price so cable is good if you get a good tv cable combo deal with it cable companies are also monopolized in regions as well so you might not have too much of a variety to choose from dsl has different speeds available but one thing which no one realizes is that for dsl you need a base ground telephone line people nowadays keep just cellphones and they cancel the ground lines which means that they can't get a dsl connection so if you only keep a cell phone you can't get dsl nowadays there are a lot of packages cheap ones too with decent speeds are available att is like the best one if it is offered in your region usually you can call it in go to the cable dsl provider's website or visit your local fry's best buy circuit city because they often have some promotion thing and you get the modem for free as opposed to buying it renting it seperately you just go to a store and tell them you want internet service they can punch in your zipcode and show you everything that is available in your area and then check the companies' websites because there maybe some online promotion only which is much better if not then go back to the store and sign now if you are going to use this dsl cable at your home only with your laptop with a wired connection you are good if you want to use the wireless connection so that you can use the internet connection anywhere in the home without plugging it in you are going to need a wireless router as well which will pick up your internet and then send out the signal so that you laptop will pick it up otherwise you will have to plug in the cable to use the internet if you want those all time connected wireless internet access cards verizon makes them you will have to pay for the card and something like a month only for the internet connection this is definitely not worth it i wouldn't get it if i were you the quality signal strength and speed are not worth it yet and besides just anywhere you go there is free internet available in almost all of the public places such as libraries colleges and universities feel free to contact me if you have any more questions  Internet service provider Voice over IP Verizon Wireless Telephone Universal Serial Bus Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Wireless LAN Internet Integrated Services Digital Network Eircom Power line communication Wi-Fi Telegraphy Asynchronous Transfer Mode Router IP Multimedia Subsystem Bluetooth Telephone exchange AT&T WiMAX Ethernet Internet fraud Laptop Cable modem HomePNA Tesco Etisalat Computer Verizon Communications Surveillance Nintendo DS IEEE 802.11 Computer bus Public Switched Telephone Network Nintendo GameCube IPod Frame relay Password Private branch exchange Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telstra 9-1-1 Telephone numbering plan Jack plug Telkom Alcatel IiNet Dialer IBM PC compatible Commodore 64 Mobile phone NTL PlayStation 2 Skype Yahoo!

in access should i store a calculated value in a table if it's used in more than one query form or report is there an easy way to store the calculation logic somewhere so that i don't screw it up in the various places that it's used kinda new to access you might have figured that out by this question here's more detail on what i'm doing i have multiple queries that use the same table and i can think of at least one calculation that must be replicated in each of the queries i've heard you should never stored calculated data but it seems like that might be best since the same calc has to be used over and over again don't want to fat finger it or screw up the code plus if the calc changes i don't want to have to change every single query that it's in maybe i need more than one query to feed my screens reports like maybe i should do a query just for derived data maybe i just answered my own question i dont exactly get your question but all calculations are done in the 'design' screen of the table when your doing a query you need not enter the calculation value again coz tis based on what you entered in the table you get the result in query hope this tutorial link would be useful http www bcschools net staff accesshelp htm  Expert system Domain Name System Microsoft Access OLAP SQL CPU cache Object-SQL mapping Microsoft Jet Database Engine Digital circuit Database management system Active Directory MySQL Computer Web crawler OpenOffice.org Forth programming language Ajax (programming) Hash table HTTP cookie Uniform Resource Locator XML Palm OS MDAC Calculator Geographic information system NTFS CPU design Prolog X86 assembly language System/34 TI-89 series Data processing Internet protocol suite Motorola 68000 Computer numbering formats RISC Oracle database Password Perl Temporal database Windows 2000 Logarithm On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences File Allocation Table Netfilter/iptables Google search Abstraction (computer science) Object database Emacs Internet Group Management Protocol Global Positioning System WebObjects Microprogram Resource Description Framework Burroughs B5000 C plus plus Binary numeral system Bloom filter Copy protection Microsoft Excel PostScript BASIC programming language HTML Hexadecimal Python programming language PlayStation 3 MUMPS PostgreSQL Compact disc GNU General Public License Visual Basic Btrieve Virtual memory Control character Technology in the Stargate universe IP Multimedia Subsystem Database normalization RS-232 Class (computer science) Linked list IDMS ARM architecture Addressing mode Database design Flat file database Lotus Notes Astrophysics Data System Opera (web browser) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Francis Crick HyperText Transfer Protocol

convertxtodvd does anybody know how to use this program i am trying to use it to change my videos from divx to dvd format i can do that now i use roxio to burn them onto a disc but while i am changing the format it is suppose to create a folder where i can get my dvd format video after it is done and i need to know how to make that folder and change the settings to where it is ntsc format and not pal because if it is pal it wont work on any dvd's no need to convert to dvd if you're using roxio i hope you're talkin' about easy media creator or the format will be encoded into dvd while burning if you choose to burn as dvd ntsc or pal is not a problem as you describe it's a matter of screens but i exhort you to burn your movie directly  Business intelligence Artificial neural network History of computing hardware

getting pictures onto your computer internet let's say i draw a pretty picture on a regular piece of paper and i want to put it on my computer internet for everyone to enjoy i'll cut to the chase and ask how do i do that and what kind of technology does it take in order to do that i would really appreciate it if someone answered and i thank anyone who's already read this far d i think you should buy yourself an all in one printer photo printer scanner but try to find one that is economical on ink some of the cheap ones use ink very quickly so they are false economy though you can take out the ink cartridges and give them a shake that makes them last much longer if you only want to copy pictures and you're not interested in printing anything then buy a stand alone flatbed scanner new ones are quite cheap and older used ones are so cheap people are practically giving them away you could probably buy an old flatbed scanner for but the new ones are much nicer to put your photos onto the internet you will need to use some kind of image hosting website be careful many of them are for porn photobucket and image shack are both perfectly safe and not too hard to learn how to use and they're free http photobucket com http imageshack us uploading a picture seems a bit daunting at first but it's very satisfying when you succeed and after the first one it's easy another way of doing it is to put your pictures into emails when you write an email look for the attachments option it will have a paperclip symbol it will allow you to add pictures audio files or even short video clips to your email message always do a virus scan on an email before opening email attachments it's one of the most common way that viruses are spread if you have a genuine copy of windows xp or windows vista you can download photo story http www microsoft com windowsxp using digitalphotography photostory default mspx it's a slideshow maker that can automatically add special effects all you have to do is put in the pictures and it does the rest you can also add music or narrate the slideshow good luck email me if you have any questions  IPod Windows XP IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Embedded system Game Boy Advance SP Personal computer PowerBook Dance Dance Revolution Battery (electricity) Canon T90 Oscilloscope Battery electric vehicle Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Toyota Prius PlayStation Portable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IMac ThinkPad Computer forensics Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Common Unix Printing System Diesel engine Beatmania IIDX Game Boy Atari ST Floppy disk Lithium ion battery Xbox 360 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Microprocessor Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) Danger Hiptop USB flash drive DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX IBM PC keyboard Miami Dolphins Roomba Liquid crystal display Poker jargon Cincinnati Bengals NEC Corporation Taskbar Blue screen of death Nintendo 64 Desktop computer Ford Ranger EV Bicycle lighting Game Boy Advance Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Sega Saturn Gradius Prank flash Hibernation Dodge Charger Hard disk Armored Core Screenshot Stroke Acer (company) 2001: A Space Odyssey Goatse.cx Konami Code Macintosh Portable Sega Dreamcast Guilty Gear DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX New York Giants 2003 North America blackout Commodore International R-Type Jack plug Ecco the Dolphin Bubble Bobble Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Woking Game controller Cheating in Counter-Strike Pump It Up Crown Court Common User Access Peugeot MAME International Phonetic Alphabet Thermal power station MSN Messenger Enigma machine Booting Second Battle of the Atlantic The Time Machine The Parting of the Ways Archos Hybrid vehicle San Diego Chargers

my computer is giving me and error message stating windows system error there is an ip address conflict with another system on the network what does that mean is someone on my wireless network if so how do i boot them off yes i would say so a clumsy one too here are the steps to take from a computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable only log into your router's admin pages from your browser find the page that controls wireless access to the admin pages and deactivate it make it so someone has to be sitting next to the router with a computer and an ethernet cable connecting them to control it find the page in the router's admin pages that defines the ssid essentially the network name turn off ssid broadcasting so the router doesn't announce it to the world you're not running a hotspot and all your machines should know the ssid change it you'll have to change it in all your machines also so it's not using the default for your router find out how to install a network wep or wpa key not a login password for your router do so and set it up there and on all your machines i suggest copying and pasting it there may be four into a notepad or wordpad document so you can accurately copy and paste it to your machines that should throw the interlopers off and keep them from coming back good luck  Microsoft PowerPoint Microsoft Office Macromedia Flash MSN Messenger Slideshow Windows Mobile Computer and video games Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible OpenOffice.org HyperCard ILife Microsoft Google Desktop Presentation program Xerox Star Machinima CP/M Linux Windows XP ZX Spectrum Mac OS X IPod Apple Macintosh Computer virus Icon (computing) Personal computer Blue screen of death Apple II family Atari 8-bit family Buffer overflow Palm OS History of Microsoft Windows Apple Computer MP3 PlayStation Portable Peer-to-peer Mach kernel Film Emacs Computer AmigaOS Commodore 128 PC Engine Perl Library (computer science) TRS-80 64-bit ASCII art ITunes Microsoft Excel Game programming MSX Debugging QuickTime Booting Lotus 1-2-3 Screenshot Editor Synthesizer Commodore 64 Function key Virtual memory Operating system AOL Instant Messenger Ada programming language Skype Common Unix Printing System Game programmer BASIC programming language Spyware Amstrad CPC Need for Speed NX bit Windows registry Domain Name System TeX Patch (computing) RISC Windows Server 2003 Stardock Amiga X Window System Programming language OpenBSD Forth programming language Visual Basic X86 MDAC Text editor OS/2 Pocket PC Windows 3.x Wine (software) SAS System Fritz-chip

what kind of things should i look for in a laptop i dont know much about them what is better mac or pc whats the diffence between ddr memory and hardrive whats a super multi dvdrw with lightscribe whats the diffrence between a regular one and a duel layer one whats a card reader iis it better then a whats a b g wifi what graphics would be the best the bigger numbers the better right what is a media adapter thank you well if you ask me a pc is way better than a mac due to it's price compatibility and flexability i don't think that a mac can run the linux operating system but a pc is very flexable in that area pc's are easier to troubleshoot when there is a problem i had to support mac's in the past and researching what a sad mac code is back then was not easy as far as memory gigabyte should be more than sufficiant my laptop is running with gigabytes only because i run a full version of sql server database for testing my code memory is only for temporary storage whereas your hard drive is much more permanent storage i would get a drive at least gb or larger my laptop has of which i only use gb due to the sql mentioned earlier i wold get a dual layer dvd read write drive the lightscribe drive just allows you to burn an image on the other side for a label and is very pricey most laptops do not have card readers so if you get one get an external one that plugs into the usb port or pcmcia port most laptops now come with g wireless faster transfer rate than b which is just an older technology wireless but your laptop can do both g and b if it comes with wireless as far as graphics most laptops are not known for having great graphics cards but yes the more memory the card has is sometimes better but unless you are a serious gamer or d designer don't waste your money brands toshiba is the original designer of laptop computers and is in my opinon still the best gateway and dell run a close second but hp compaq acer are the bottom of my shopping list as the quality is just not there and neither is the technical support don't spend over a unless you just have to have bleeding edge graphics speed etc i have never payed more than for any computer or laptop in my life but my company that i work for did on my last laptop sigh oh well good luck  ASCII art Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Ajax (programming) Website Mozilla Firefox World Wide Web ASCII Dash Character encodings in HTML MIME Apostrophe (mark) Web server Common Unix Printing System Wget Internet Web browser Gmail HTML Domain Name System HTML element Punycode Base64 XHTML Phishing File Transfer Protocol Quotation mark Apache HTTP Server AmigaOS File format Mac OS 8 Uniform Resource Identifier Unicode and HTML Newline Web application MSN Messenger Slash (punctuation) Domain name Slashdot trolling phenomena AOL Instant Messenger Extended ASCII TOC protocol Hello world program 2channel MPlayer Esperanto orthography Lotus Notes Ebook JavaServer Pages Unicode LOL (Internet slang) HTTP cookie The Cure Windows XP User agent Pipeline (Unix) XML Mac OS X Server Transport Layer Security Unix Microsoft UTF-8 SAML GameFAQs message boards String (computer science) Mozilla Application Suite Cascading Style Sheets BinHex Internet phenomenon WebDAV Streaming media Favicon 10cc Tab Macintosh Finder Web crawler Netscape Navigator MD5 Common Lisp Virtual hosting Digest access authentication Collation Ignatz Awards Stardock Full stop PHP Icon (computing) Konqueror Copy protection Rod Stewart Goatse.cx Jabber U.S. presidential election, 2008 __Okina Slashdot subculture Mac OS X Ultima Online ISO/IEC 8859-1 Google search

my idea for artificial intelligence ok so what is the computer a device able to memorize all the books written in the human history a device with so good logical skills that no chess master can defeat it on chess obviously the computers are something very very smart now you say ok but they don't have a real intelligence and thus we use it only by meaning here is what i suggest assuming the great memory and logical capabilities of computers nowadays once could create a software so powerful to sistematize all of the important information on the planet and use it for the better of humanity imagine a software so intelligent to tell you what is the cure for cancer is our universe indeed infinite what is the best stock to buy and more and this is possible here is a simple example the man cannot fly alone but he invited the airplane for this job and again he can't find cure for aids but invited the computer to do this job thanks bob b georgievv abv bg ive been told by a literal math genius that a computer is only as smart as the person using it i like to think of a computer as a drawing board but yes for stocks a program could be written to predict changes and outcomes based on decades of information and hundreds of variables  Pig The Super Milk-chan Show British comic Smart and Smarter Origin of language Ward Churchill Onomatopoeia Spoink Dennis the Menace (UK) Trade Buster (comic) Economy of Slovakia Alias (TV series) Predynastic Egypt Chinglish Contract Chinese astrology Stingray (TV show) John Mayer (musician) Richard Cobden Foreign relations of Fiji September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Charlie Brooker World Trade Organization Southeast Asia Civilization Neolithic Minoan civilization Organ donation Ottoman Empire Association of Southeast Asian Nations Hohokam John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Agriculture in Australia Colony in Space Neolithic Revolution Kent State shootings Prehistoric Britain Phenomenalism Prehistory of Cyprus Sino-Japanese relations Offer and acceptance Indiana Pacers Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds Sun Wukong Free Trade Area of the Americas History of the Americas Marshall Plan Five Little Pigs Bellary Alec Douglas-Home Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Talking animal Jimmy Carter Speculation Iron Language game Combatant Status Review Tribunal Charmbracelet The Arsenio Hall Show Mark Fidrych Nanban trade period African slave trade Commodity markets Math ap Mathonwy Khanate of Kazan Muscovy Company Steel Tony Kaye (musician) History of Vilnius Luther Allison Treehouse of Horror IV Northern Ireland peace process Livestock Economy of Romania Lord of the Flies 1956 Hungarian Revolution Economy of Taiwan Deforestation They Saved Lisa's Brain Varangian Mad Capsule Markets Vietnam War TaleSpin Linear Pottery culture Responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks Archibald McIndoe History of Crete Mardi Gras Trademark Hong Kong Domestication Jay Leno Minor characters in Seinfeld Garret FitzGerald Pink Floyd pigs Slavery Porky Pig Economy of the Dominican Republic Appeal

new laptop windows vista who's changing my files i have a a folder called 'recently changed' and it lists loads of files that have recently been changed most of them are photos that i have edited but some are music files type windows media player i have not used windows media player i do not listen to music on my computer and i do not recognise any of the songs so my question is this is someone else getting into my computer and tampering with things or is it something simple and less sinister that i haven't thought of thanks in advance windows vista is gd and sometimes can change the formats slightly when it upgraded daily so some of the song formats might change even though u haven't touched them and when this happens it will be listed in the recently changed file however this does not always happen  Computer Computer chess Artificial intelligence Chess Turing machine ELO rating system Fischer Random Chess Artificial consciousness Digital circuit Expert system CPU design Computer Go Turing test Central processing unit Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Mathematics Data mining Game theory History of computing hardware Fermi paradox Intelligence (trait) W.

should we have everyone sign a waiver it seems that there are certain individuals going around just looking for questions to complain about these individuals will moan and groan about every question or answer that they do not agree with they are making it very difficult to get an honest answer or to even ask an interesting question do you think that yahoo should set a limit on how many complaints you can have per day and ban anyone that is using the report function excessively i am just so damn sick of all this crap thats it i'm reporting you just kidding i completely agree some people are just looking to complain and do report abuse simply becuase they do not agree you would think yahoo would find someway to monitor what is actually abuse and what is just overzealous egotistical complaining  Windows Vista Windows XP Windows 2000 Mac OS X ITunes IPod Object Desktop IBM PC compatible History of Microsoft Windows Digital audio player Computer virus Mod (computer gaming) Macintosh Finder Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Macromedia Flash Blue screen of death File Allocation Table Library (computer science) Windows 95 Windows Me Musical Instrument Digital Interface Online music store Vorbis Btrieve Bluetooth Karaoke MP3 Windows Media Player ITunes Music Store Microsoft Office Google Desktop ZIP (file format) Portable Document Format QuickTime File format Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Partition (computing) History of the graphical user interface SonicStage Floppy disk Screenshot Stardock I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Emacs System 7 (Macintosh) Windows registry PlayStation Portable Windows Explorer NTFS Podcasting OpenGL Apple typography Digital photography Web browser OS/2 PNG Mac OS X v10.4 Computer file Tracker Apple Computer AmigaOS Gmail Metadata Windows Media Audio Newline NaturallySpeaking Video game music System/36 Kernel (computer science) Windows Presentation Foundation Domain Name System 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Module file Unicode Creative Zen WordStar Digital rights management WordPerfect Copy protection Windows API Filename extension Icon (computing) Backup Streaming media Personal computer High-definition television Linux C programming language Marching band Windows Media Video Microsoft Word BZFlag DirectShow Thread (computer science) Java programming language

how can i prolong my computer's life without getting into the details i have an hp running windows that i've had since about to and it's started getting quirky today i had to upload an older version of scanreg to get windows to load this computer is critical to my life right now what precautionary steps can i take to help it stick around longer i know it's going to die sooner or later but i'm trying to delay the inevitable like is there anything on it i can change or whatnot have you formatted your computer to rule out if it is a software problem you can prolong the life of it by taking care of the hardware that is really where it becomes unfixable if broken i mean once a cpu overheats there is really no use to buy a new one cause you can pay the money for a new computer you can do little things like use compressed air to spray out the dust inside the case this will stop the dust from insulating your electronic components and causing them to over heat you can install more fans to in the case to help with the air flow you want to get the heat out of the case becareful with this one though cases are already design for air flow and installing a fan can disrupt the flow usually one will pull clean air in the front and spit the hot air out the back if you smoke be sure to keep that way from the comptuer because that will cause the chips and other component to become sticky and collect dust which will not come off with compressed air you can try to take off your heat sink to clean it and whip off the cpu so there is no dust blocking the transfer of heat from the cpu to the heat sink use thermal paste to make the connection better computers are like cars they have peices that wear out over time a hard drive is most likely to be the one that wears out first because it is the most mechanical peice in the computer if you get alot of bad sector errors and such that is a sign of a dying hard drive and should be replaced  Wi-Fi Ethernet Voice over IP Broadband Internet access WiMAX Uniform Resource Locator BitTorrent Digital Subscriber Line Cable television Hotspot (wifi) Broadband Local area network PHP Wireless Wireless LAN Network address translation PlayStation 2 Internet protocol suite Internet Xbox IP Multimedia Subsystem HyperText Transfer Protocol Domain Name System Denial-of-service attack AppleTalk World Wide Web Internet service provider Bluetooth Token ring Telephone Quality of service Ajax (programming) Etisalat Power line communication Transmission Control Protocol Public Switched Telephone Network Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Internet censorship in mainland China MAC address Port (computing) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Wireless access point Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Router GameFAQs Digital video recorder IPTV OSI model Password Cross site scripting Wireless Application Protocol Category 5 cable Wireless community network Commodore 64 CPAN Asynchronous Transfer Mode Sega Dreamcast Windows XP Grand Haven, Michigan Modem Perl British Sky Broadcasting GSM services Broadband Networks Spyware Federal Standard 1037C Coaxial cable Social software Computer bus Wget Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Whois Halo: Combat Evolved America Online Television network Telewest Broadband Chorus Communications StarHub Universal Serial Bus Network switch Computer network Apple Macintosh Virtual hosting Data retention Internet Relay Chat Communications satellite E-mail spam Streaming media Digital divide Austar Common Unix Printing System Telegraphy Integrated Services Digital Network Uniform Resource Identifier Domain name Sky Digital Alex Jones (journalist) Direct broadcast satellite

about my broadband ive done a test and my download speed is kbps and upload is kbps what is this in english terms and is it good or bad good or bad is relative to several things what your service provider indicates your maximum download speed is and the same for upload if you don't know that just contact them and they will be happy to give you that information if the actual speed you are getting is significantly less than the maximum your provider gives for your subscription it generally is the quality of your connection i e in house phone line wiring coax or whatever it is that connects you to and through your service provider the distance you are from their substation and or how busy that dsl or cable line is with other essentially simultaneous uses it also could be a setup problem with your computer if that's the case and you're not comfortable with making os adjustments get a program like optimize from pcpitstop input what your service provider gives you as the maximum download speed the type of broadband connection you have and let 'er rip you'll be optimized very quickly and correctly btw this program is specifically for optimizing internet connection speed and it's inexpensive it not only gives you your actual download speed everytime it's run but also optimizes os registry settings and cleans out cached information you no longer need from the speeds you mention it appears you are on cable broadband but there are some dsl services operating close to that speed too it appears to me at first glance that you have a very fast connection my dsl here in arkansas runs at kbps download and that's darn quick for out in the country hope that helps chuck p s upload speed is always significantly less than download so concentrate on optimizing download speed upload will follow suit  Warez Web crawler Spyware ITunes Internet service provider Broadband Internet access Base pair Kazaa File sharing Commodore 64 General relativity BitTorrent Kepler's laws of planetary motion Dot-com Read-only memory Oscilloscope Computer IEEE 802.11 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Computer virus Voice over IP PowerPC Information Age Dial-up access Faster-than-light Computer network General Packet Radio Service Internet Visual Basic Cyberspace Peer-to-peer Modem Skype Special relativity SubSpace (computer game) Power line communication Comparison of latency and throughput Cache Cheating in Counter-Strike MAME Web accelerator Dot matrix printer Radeon Cable television Uploading and downloading Internet Message Access Protocol Redundant array of independent disks Apple Macintosh Gnutella Volleyball Satellite internet Mac OS X SETI Warp drive Ethernet Energy Firewall (networking) Windows XP Morse Code Distributed computing MOS Technology 6502 Particle accelerator Quake III Arena Bulletin board system Computer and video games ZX Spectrum Central processing unit Inmarsat Planetary orbit Abandonware EMule Nintendo Revolution Supercomputer Japanese copyright law Internet protocol suite Logo programming language Now Broadband TV Dialer Mach kernel Coriolis effect Synchrotron radiation Digital photography Microsoft .NET Drifting (motorsport) PlayStation 3 IP Multimedia Subsystem Linux TCP Offload Engine Chess Jet engine Mario Kart 64 PlayStation Portable Difference between sub-orbital and orbital spaceflights Overclocking Internet Explorer First-sale doctrine Violin Field-programmable gate array

cable vs dsl a friend of mine keeps insisting he gets mb sec with qwest dsl service here in phoenix at a month i have cox cable modem service and the maximum that is available is supposed to be mb sec at a month i asked cox and they tell me that mb sec speed isn't even possible currently but my neighbor shows me this report on his pc that shows mb in one second and he says downloads are really really fast i'm not an expert on this nor a total novice so does anybody know the real stats the mb speed is probably his pc speed to his router from the modem to the isp is probably closer to kb ask them to visit http performance toast net and let you know what the results are most routers offer mb for wired connections and mb for wireless depending on which wireless protocol but g is typical just because the router offers that speed it doesn't mean that they have that speed all the way to the internet the mb speed would only be noticeable for pc to pc transfers when both are plugged directly into their router going to the isps line behind the modem dsl cable or fios is going to be slower than your network on your router  Internet fraud Lens (optics) Single-lens reflex camera The Star Wars Holiday Special Contact lens Escape from New York Richard Nixon Apollo 8 Short selling Binoculars Anamorphic widescreen Digital photography Craps Canon EF lens mount Advance fee fraud Intraocular lens Neopets Canon FD Digital camera Bulk vending Plame affair PayPal Futurama (TV series - season 5) Digital camera back Canon T90 Rangefinder camera Ocean's Twelve Contact (film) Attack of the Show!

putting ares on flash drive make computer faster i have a ' acer computer been using it for a good couple of years now but i have ares installed mp player downloader and more songs that necessary could i copy all of my files and the program onto a flash drive and delete it from my computer to make it run faster then run the program from the drive this program is nearly x bigger than anyother program on my computer thanks storing data on the hard drive has little impact on performance except in cases where you run out of space on the drive then serious problems can occur under normal operating conditions moving the files you are talking about to a flash would not improve system performance in fact it could actually slow things down because data from the hard drive moves through the system than data being read from the usd drive if you want to improve system performance on a machine that old there are a few things i can recommend shut down all non essential processes make sure you have enough ram installed for the programs that you run and close programs when you are not using them other than it's probably time to consider a new machine even the lowest cost pc's on the market right now are going to run circles around anything built in  Macintosh Finder Object Desktop Uploading and downloading Google Desktop Konqueror Screenshot Opera (web browser) Taskbar History of the graphical user interface Google Macromedia Flash Mac OS X Gmail Web traffic Computer virus Windows 2000 P__li Icon (computing) Kazaa Windows Vista Mouse (computing) Twm Search engine optimization Mac OS history Stardock AmigaOS Xerox Star Mozilla Firefox WebDAV Newline Minesweeper (computer game) Computing minimalism System 6 Web page Internet fraud Web browser Pretty Good Privacy Click fraud Computer Uniform Resource Locator Knoppix MSN Messenger Google search X Window System Windows Server 2003 Windows Explorer Stopping e-mail abuse Portable Document Format Start Menu Virtual Network Computing MS-DOS Ajax (programming) HTTP cookie Apple Macintosh Pop-up ad Sun Microsystems Hyperlink Desktop publishing Internet Relay Chat History of Microsoft Windows Computer accessibility Denial-of-service attack MDAC Menu (computing) Common Unix Printing System Website Spamdexing Java programming language Cascading Style Sheets LiteStep Mac OS X v10.4 Xcode Desktop search Aggregator Operating system Bluetooth OmniWeb Laptop Spyware Desktop computer Konfabulator Directory Internet Apple typography Linux Apple Computer Phishing Self programming language Spatial file manager E-mail spam Drag-and-drop Ebook Filename extension Double-click (computing) Digital object identifier DesktopX Klik Microsoft Windows

limewire isn't connecting i have two computers in my house that have limewire downloaded on them and they are both connected to the internet from a wireless connection yet the computer upstairs gets connected to limewire while the other one downstairs is hardly ever connecting the one upstairs is always supercharged and it downloads super fast but now that computer has a virus and i need to get it fixed meanwhile i would like to use the computer downstairs but its not connecting anyone have any suggestions on what the problem might be i'd appreciate it thanks you most likely have a virus on the upstairs from using limewire if its a worm it probably infected the downstairs computer as well your best bet is to uninstall limewire and never look back since it eats up all your bandwidth kills your isp and gives you viruses but if you insist on using it you need to rule out the wireless try taking the computer downstairs to the upstairs or the router modem downstairs if possible run a cable if both devices support it wireless speed is based on signal strength and even a minimal signal on your wireless will be way faster than your internet connection the only time a low signal would be a problem is if it is constantly losing the connection if your house was built in the s or s they used plaster over a wire mesh that for some reason obliterates wireless signals from a command prompt ipconfig will tell you if it knows its next hop to the internet your router and ping yahoo com will tell you if knows how to get there and resolve dns if youre still having problems it could be a browser or your limewire app or a third party program like a firewall not letting you through  Microsoft Jet Database Engine Database MDAC Java Database Connectivity Hash table PL/SQL Database management system File system Isolation (computer science) CPU cache Temporal database OLAP Object-SQL mapping Flat file database Web crawler Internet Group Management Protocol ITunes Virtual memory Microsoft Access SAS System Computer virus SimCity 4 Domain Name System Debugging Ajax (programming) WebObjects PostgreSQL Library (computer science) Texas hold 'em MySQL Database normalization Btrieve Rootkit Search engine Poker jargon HTTP cookie Linked list Windows XP Polymorphism (computer science) Netfilter/iptables Read-copy-update HyperCard Relational algebra Astrophysics Data System OpenDocument Halo 2 Windows 2000 Computer security DVD Associative array BASIC programming language Belief revision Whois Mozilla Firefox Gmail Collision detection Gnutella Resource Description Framework Super Bowl XXVII Dallas Cowboys Join (SQL) Software testing QUEL GSM services Prolog Gnutella2 Java programming language NTFS Copy protection BLAST SAP R/3 SQL injection Dither File Allocation Table Active Directory Filename extension Distributed hash table Bloom filter Perl Array Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Compact disc Objective-C B-47 Stratojet Legal research Oracle database Google search Usenet

how do i install fedra core from a dvd i already burned the iso but when i start up the computer with the disc in the drive nothing happens please help you might have to change your startup order go into the bios on startup there will be some button you need to press could be del f f etc look for the text telling you what to push or just try to get lucky and enter your password if you set one up look through the menus until you see something called boot order set your dvd drive to be the first thing to be read from in the list this will make your computer read from the dvd before reading from the hard drive and booting up windows if this doesn't work it may be that the dvd doesn't install during bootup and you may just have to boot into windows whatever you use and browse the dvd and find the setup exe file or equivalent hope this helps  Microsoft Jet Database Engine Temporal database Database Flat file database Perl Scheme programming language Java Database Connectivity Domain Name System Database management system Object-SQL mapping NTFS SQL Quicksort Windows XP MDAC Linked list Expert system Gmail Associative array XML ITunes MySQL Copy protection Redundant array of independent disks Google search Palm OS Detroit Red Wings Minor league baseball Boston Bruins IPod Pittsburgh Steelers Search engine Binary numeral system C Sharp Monty Hall problem Web crawler SAS System National Basketball Association Tuple relational calculus Resource Description Framework Whois Mach kernel Billboard Hot 100 Microsoft Access Hash table CPU cache Madden NFL National Football League Library (computer science) Join (SQL) Seattle Mariners PostgreSQL Forth programming language UK Singles Chart 0 (number) X86 Lambda calculus Rootkit Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Programming language Prolog Pointer Carolina Panthers EIA-708 Chicago Blackhawks Database normalization Women's National Basketball Association Self programming language Chicago Bulls Mozilla Firefox System/34 Computer virus Skat WebObjects RISC Sorting algorithm Microsoft Project Toronto Blue Jays Windows 2000 Allen Iverson NASCAR Rookie of the Year ALGOL 68 Montreal Canadiens Bubble Bobble New York Rangers Toronto Raptors C programming language Classified information Belief revision Digital rights management Meaning of life Kansas City Chiefs CPU design Cold fusion Idealism Heapsort Billboard magazine

can you get in trouble with internet pornography on computer i have a foster child and recently noticed that on my computer he has been visiting gay porn sites i'm so frustrated with him right now i wanted to take my computer to ggek squad to add a gaming card to it and some memory but i'm afraid that they will see those sickening images and videos and i will get in trouble for his wrong doings even if you could tell me how to get rid of them that would be great also thx plz help me the presence of pornographic content generally isn't illegal unless the content is of minors if they review the content and the age of the subjects is in question you could potentially run into problems too clearing out the browser history and deleting temporary files will remove the easy way of finding information on your computer but it doesn't completely remove it you would need to use an application that is specifically designed to overwrite the files at the disk level so that file recovery programs are unable to recover the data too i would recommend moving the computer into a common location like the living room so that you can observe the content visited if you don't think that will work look for net nanny applications that will block access to certain content you'll also want to ensure that each user in the house has their own login so you can identify each users behavior and set access controls  COMMAND.COM Tcl File system Unix Uniform Resource Locator AmigaOS Commodore DOS Path (computing) Python programming language Cp (Unix) Active Directory DIGITAL Command Language NTFS junction point Chmod Symbolic link Bash Programming language News server TeX BASIC programming language XPath Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Common Lisp Perl PHP Tar (file format) Smalltalk Master Control Program Configuration file Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Apache Ant File system permissions D programming language Job Control Language NTFS File Allocation Table Apple II family Scheme programming language Enterprise JavaBeans Macromedia Flash LiteStep SQL Launchd Drive letter assignment Data General Nova Secure copy Ontology (computer science) Grep English as an additional language Filename Maze Hardware description language Self programming language Eclipse (computing) Orthodox file manager Regular expression Test Drive (video game) Windows registry French Directory Uniform Resource Identifier Rail trail CPAN HTML element Home directory ColdFusion Expert system Java programming language Visual FoxPro Pretty Good Privacy Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Metadata PILOT Forth programming language PONG Partition (computing) Make Hierarchical File System Library (computer science) Second Life XRI MATLAB Podcasting Project management Spanish language Backslash Multics DOS Plus Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Class (computer science) Windows 2000 Comparison of file systems Electronics Open-source software Chroot Space shuttle main engine Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Samba software Directory RPL programming language

what would be a good way to protect private files on public pc yes i have my own account of course this is on vista home edition but my dad is the admin so he can look at all documents any time bleh i know this because i signed into the admin account it's not password protected and there were all my files available to view right now i just change the extension to dll or something so they can't be opened but this is annoying since i work with them pretty often i tried to deny permission to the admin under security for the folder that the files are in but this made it so that i couldn't open the folder either i guess the admin is allowed to view anything no matter what any suggestions hopefully ones that don't require spending because i haven't got any lol the files are just a bunch of plain text files you cannot hide anything from the admin account but you can put passwords your documents there are plenty of free password programs and i'm sure you can find one on download com the other thing you could is use some sort of removable drive like an external hard drive a usb stick and even a cd r w as long as you use the cd in the same computer i hope some of these suggestions help and good luck  Windows 2000 Novell NetWare Object Desktop Gmail Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol LiveJournal Windows XP Windows Installer Password Common Unix Printing System Stardock Spyware MSN Internet Relay Chat Dialog box Btrieve Mozilla Firefox Novell, Inc.

does more system ram increase the amount of video memory in an integrated video card i saw my friend playing halo on high settings and decals and shinyness on an integrated graphics card called the intel gma now if your good the intel gma is one of the worst graphics cards for games on the market right now he told me that's because the computer had so much sustem ram for the graphics card to use since it was integrated and used up the system memory which was gbs it was smooth too so does increasing the ram on a computer improve the integrated graphics if so how much ex from mbs then added gb graphics integrated mb ati xpress radeon thanks ps does that example for the ram make the computer really that much faster or really make only a slight difference in basic computing speed yes more ram does make your gaming experience better as you have already know rendering and all that will need additional juice it can get from your system ram however relying solely on system ram doesn't make the fact that you can set all the settings to high i doubt your friend can play halo with all settings set to high there are things like anti aliasing which is usually not available for lower end graphic card and it's an on board card for god's sake a good graphic card is still the one which plays the main factor for a good graphical rendition  HyperText Transfer Protocol ASCII art Web server World Wide Web PostScript HTML TeX Portable Document Format Unicode and HTML OpenOffice.org Macromedia Flash Apache HTTP Server StarOffice Uniform Resource Locator Web browser Windows XP Wget Windows API Website PHP Web design HTML element Proxy server Gmail Typeface Emacs Unicode Web application Spyware Python programming language Slash (punctuation) Cascading Style Sheets Ajax (programming) Adobe Systems Netscape Navigator TrueType Common Unix Printing System Java Servlet OpenBSD Scalable Vector Graphics XSL Transformations C plus plus HTTP cookie Ebook Domain Name System Secure Shell Qt (toolkit) Internet Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol David A.

how do i remove a icon program from my system tray taskbar next to the clock there is a program running next to the clock in my system tray i want to remove it it opens to a web page for a product that i don't want normally you can right click on the icon and the menu will give you a close option more than likely if the program is in you system tray it is set to auto start every time you reboot your pc if this is the case you can go to your start menu then run and then put in msconfig without the quotes and hit enter this will bring up a system configuration box which has a tab labeled start up go to that tab and locate the program from your system tray and un check the box and hit apply when you hit ok it will probably prompt you to restart your pc after rebooting the program should no longer be in your system tray if it is you might have some thing attached in your system registry and you should take it in to a professional  BitTorrent ITunes Macromedia Flash Comparison of media players Mac OS X RealPlayer IPod Windows Vista System 7 (Macintosh) Windows XP Peer-to-peer Screenshot Mac OS X v10.4 AOL Instant Messenger Azureus Virtual memory Windows registry Macintosh Finder Object Desktop Windows Media Player Kazaa Filename extension Streaming media Vorbis Winamp MP3 Computer virus MDAC PlayStation Portable EMule ZIP (file format) Windows 2000 Trillian (instant messenger) Windows Media Audio Theora Online music store Digital rights management Windows Mobile Musical Instrument Digital Interface Stardock Podcasting HyperCard Windows Me Internet Explorer Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Knoppix H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DVD DirectShow Uploading and downloading Windows Explorer ILife File format Warez Computer and video games Jon Lech Johansen Library (computer science) TiVo Video game music Bluetooth File system Suprnova.org Enterprise content management Microsoft Office Web page Konqueror Opera (web browser) OpenOffice.org Common Unix Printing System Google Desktop ITunes Music Store MIRC Linux Skype Cue sheet NTFS Windows Media Video Ebook Lotus Notes Spyware America Online DeltaAnime SonicStage PHP WordStar Commodore 64 Media Player Classic NPAPI Home directory System/36 Web crawler ROM image Linux distribution Gmail Ogg

i have two hard drives sata i what to install windows xp on one and windows vista on the other joe k is doing it the wrong way for how u can go into your bios and select the st drive as the nd boot device and ur disk drive as the st instal windows vista on one hard drive but make a partition with gb for windows and applets then make the rest of the drive a partition for data go into the bios and select the nd drive as boot device and ur disk drive as boot device same as step on the other drive but for xp to boot from vista or xp select the drive that has the correct os and set it as the st boot device doing it this way will make it so that vista and xp are separated and dont interfere like they can if they are on the same drive also dont touch the partition with xp from vista and the vista one from xp use the non windows partition for data that needs to go between oses like documents make sure to install progams one each drive from that drives os so apps for xp get installed on the xp drive and dont run apps from xp while in vista that might couse corrupt data and the program most likely wont run correctly  Windows Vista Windows XP Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Windows Server 2003 Random access memory Blue screen of death Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows Memory (computers) FreeDOS RAM disk Nintendo GameCube Windows 2000 Virtual memory Acorn Electron Atari ST Library (computer science) Commodore 128 Windows 3.x Personal computer TRS-80 IPAQ Mac OS X X Window System Apple II family Sequent Computer Systems Graphics processing unit RISC USB flash drive Macintosh Finder Browser wars Flash memory History of the graphical user interface Computer forensics X86 CPU cache Booting F-16 Fighting Falcon Dynamic random access memory The Sims 2 Upper Memory Area PlayStation Portable Windows XP Media Center Edition IMac Acorn Archimedes DirectX Windows Blackcomb Windows 1.0 Sound Blaster MSX OpenGL PowerBook PC Engine Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Sinclair ZX81 Google Desktop PlayStation 3 Kernel (computer science) Super Bowl XIV Next-Generation Secure Computing Base AmigaOS 64-bit Front side bus MIPS architecture Windows Presentation Foundation Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Commodore 64 IBM PC IPod Non-volatile memory MS-DOS Fritz-chip Vaporware Bank switching Mouse (computing) BBC Micro Amstrad CPC Emulator Datamax UV-1 Original Amiga chipset PlayStation 2 Apple Newton Los Angeles Clippers Power Mac G5 Radeon Apollo Guidance Computer DR-DOS Sega Dreamcast TRS-80 Color Computer Xbox 360 PowerPC DVD-RAM System 7 (Macintosh) Macromedia Flash MIPS Magnum DDR2 SDRAM Emacs WordStar

sound card won't work i reinstalled windows xp on my computer didn't change any hardware the computer does not recognize any sound card which was working fine before i reinstalled windows and doesn't have any volume controls except for the microphone chances are you probably had windows preinstalled for you when you bought it if it's a brand name go to their website hp com dell com etc and look for the drivers windows installation disc doesn't have all of the drivers for every component so it is usually packaged with the computer it might be included with your computer's reinstallation disc so i suggest you look there first if it's not a brand name you'll have to find out what brand of motherboard it is you can do that by either opening up the case to see if the brand and model numbers are on it or you can try looking at system information by clicking on start then program files then accessories then system tools then system information on the main page under bios version it may contain info about your board to go find the drivers  Windows 2000 Defragmentation File system Data recovery Windows XP Blue screen of death NTFS Fsck Embedded system HyperText Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Defrag Windows Vista System/36 File Allocation Table Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks Web crawler AmigaOS FreeDOS Apple II family Booting Btrieve World Wide Web Exception handling Master Control Program Windows registry File format Debugging Mach kernel System/34 Computer security Domain Name System Linux Gmail Disk image Macintosh Finder Mozilla Firefox Early IBM disk storage Wget Hard disk PC-DOS Backup Web server GameFAQs Partition (computing) MiniDisc Windows 95 XHTML Spyware Opera (web browser) Floppy disk Malware ReiserFS Representational State Transfer Steam (content delivery) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Fragmentation Filename extension Library (computer science) HTML Architecture of Windows 2000 AOL Instant Messenger Rootkit C programming language Page table Objective-C XML Linux kernel Computer CPU design Unicode and HTML Freenet Unix Disk cloning Microsoft Windows PHP DR-DOS Disk formatting CPU cache Melissa worm Error correction and detection Apple Computer MDAC Streaming media Commodore 64 DOS OpenBSD Pretty Good Privacy DragonFly BSD System 7 (Macintosh) Enterprise content management OpenVMS Novell NetWare Transmission Control Protocol Website Forth programming language

why is my computer mouse double clicking on single clicks it's not the control panel mouse settings i've checked them and they are correct i think i may have a virus but i just ran mcafee and it says that my computer is clean yesterday i went to a porn site that started opening new windows repeatedly if the person who created that program were here in this room with me it wouldn't be a pretty sight after that the double click behavior started is there anything else i can do to clean out this double click problem first and foremost these are my opinions and have experience several machines that had these on them as well as users using these product not to mention that i have ran each and every one of these myself so as to not confuse those that think that i have not my findings in these products are useless and sometimes scare the normal user also these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the manuals docs for what they download and or buy they just want to install and use stop using the following software avg avg has been known to report false positives also reports tracking cookies as trojan downloaders this is bad practice to me scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news anymore is about trojans worms and virus' maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would

why dont girls llke to watch porn the top ten reasons most porn out there is produced by men and targeted at a male audience and it has a different aesthetic than that which women generally enjoy although there are many women out there who like raunchy male oriented porn too women generally like storylines plots and softer more romantic sex most of this porn i mentioned has an inherent misogynistic attitude that treats women as b tches sl ts whores and ho's to be used and abused by the men if there's anything to turn a woman off quicker that'd be it most straight porn doesn't feature good looking men now there are of course some nice exceptions but on a whole and particularly the more amateur the production the less appealing the men are compare that to gay porn where the boys seem to all be model perfect while the women are still porn perfect it stems from whom the target audience is of course generally men and the mistaken idea that the only thing anybody is looking at is that inch penis but women tend to enjoy the whole package handsome faces sexy bodies everything no wonder women don't go ga ga for it it makes us feel bad about ourselves women are infamous for our comparisons to pretty much every other woman out there and if that's already a blow to our self esteem then watching porn or knowing that most men out there watch it is the ultimate nail in the coffin because who can measure up to those bleach blonde liposuctioned silicone filled models women worry that the reason men watch porn is because they're dissatisfied with the women that they have at home and wish they could have porn stars instead nobody wants to watch or condone something that makes them feel so insecure and self doubtful most porn doesn't feature much in the way of real female sexuality i once heard a female porn reviewer joke that if you added up all the male on female cunnilingus scenes in the entirety of porn it still wouldn't last longer than five whole seconds and while that's exaggeration it's a sad truth women in porn either don't have orgasms at all or the actresses fake really bad ones the cunnilingus fingering clitoral stimulation if there at all are usually pretty bad and inept in reality women take a while to get aroused and statistics overwhelmingly show that women do not in fact usually orgasm from the ol' in and out pumping but through clitoral stimulation instead try and find that reality in porn though and you won't what woman wants to watch something that doesn't feel real that she can't relate to some women don't like porn on the basis that it's degrading and objectifying to women that the industry is harmful to the actresses etc etc and given some of the porn that's out there and the horror stories i wouldn't exactly say they were off base in that feminist assumption still i very strongly feel that andrew dworkin and her like are wrong not all porn is inherently degrading but women often come from the standpoint that men are perverted horndogs who only want women for sex and their bodies and when they see porn that reinforces that idea they are not only turned off sexually but completely disgusted by the very idea of porn itself some girls just don't like porn just like there are some guys out there who don't it's just a personal preference women may view porn as cheating if it's watched in a relationship i don't agree with that viewpoint but some women believe that by fantasizing about being with another person it is an affair of the heart mind and that isn't cool and if you feel your partner is cheating on you of course you're going to be pretty angry and ticked off women can't connect with a lot of the acts portrayed in porn that is produced for men things that may turn men on like double penetration the concept of c m sl ts who take multiple ejaculations etc etc will probably have most women running for their lives forever branded with a fear of what they think most men secretly want to do to them and understandably so women are socialized to not be interested in sex even as things are getting better than they were say in the 's still female sexuality gets put on the back burner boys are encouraged to masturbate and look at pornographic materials i e the whole fathers giving their sons playboy magazines at puberty or at least their sexuality is turned a blind indulgent eye but girls are rarely encouraged to masturbate are definitely not provided any female oriented sexual materials and their sexual innocence is closely guarded the idea of virginity lauded whereas sexual conquest is expected for boys and basically being a sexually minded female is synonymous with being a sl t or a dirty girl most women don't even begin to seek out porn because they feel ashamed embarrassed don't know that porn made for women exists etc etc many women actually do enjoy porn it just takes a special type you can find porn that appeals to women in a variety of venues nowadays comstock films http www comstockfilms com http erotica readers com era am porn for couples htm softcore erotic productions like those of playgirl tv anything produced by carol queen annie sprinkle candida royalle tristan taorminio nina hartley veronica hart betty dodson is guaranteed to be a pretty good bet but remember that some girls don't like porn or some may have difficulty gettin over their fears and anger about it don't push her hope that helps  Typewriter Ligature (typography) Typeface Word processor Postage stamp Teleprinter Emphasis (typography) Apostrophe (mark) Typesetting

crucial com and running a scan http www crucial com index asp it's important to note that everything takes ram not only security products such as active anti spyware anti virus and firewall eat up memory but your operating system active browser windows running applications such as word gaming messenger photoshop etc and malware all compete for system resources corrupted system files if you computer comes up clean after running your resident security products you may want to consider running a system file checker sfc this can be run in safe mode should you prefer to get into safe mode either hold down or tap the f key repeatedly while the computer is starting up to run sfc close all applications such as office messenger email etc and go to start run type in sfc scannow include the space before the what sfc does is that it attempts to fix or replace critical operating system files sometimes this can be done without the installation disk however it may prompt you for the appropriate operating system installation disk if that is the case then you know that you definitely have file corruption or something missing insert the disk if prompted also you should run sfc using the administrator account if you have the vista operating system the steps are a bit different due to the uac see the link below http vistasupport mvps org system file checker htm don't surf play games or do anything while sfc runs after it is completed reboot your computer one of the major culprits in missing or corrupt operating system files is running a registry cleaner or optimizer they can flag important shared files for deletion or cleanup another cause is malware note before running any registry cleaner or editing the registry always ensure you back it up first if the registry cleaner you are using doesn't have that function you can do it manually http support microsoft com kb  Mozilla Firefox Web page ITunes Mozilla Thunderbird Macintosh Finder Mozilla Application Suite

yeah im having real trouble trying to get videos on to my pc from my jvc hard disk camcorder how do i do it also ive done it once and got the files on my pc but i cant put them on youtube in says theres no film there help plz what model if it is hd you may be having difficulty because of the format of the files a program like nero will allow you to play and convert various file formats like avchd typical to a hd camcorder if you don't own nero here is the procedure in a nutshell for coping files from an camcorder connect the camera to the computer using the usb cable provided by the manufacturer select the option in the menu on the camera to connect to the computer this may be called copy files or one of many different things depending on your model use windows explorer if on a pc and look for a new device it will look just like an external hard drive or thumb drive copy the files using windows explorer what you can do once you copy those files will be limited to the software you have on your computer if you plan to upload files to youtube you'll need a tool to convert to one of these formats wmv avi mov or mpg if your camera doesn't store them in those formats already also some cameras allow you to copy files to an sd card usually the camera will convert to mpg or mpeg automatically when copying to the sd memory you can then put the sd card on your pc if you have a sd reader and access it using windows explorer if you are just learning you'll benefit from a program like nero as it will make things much easier for you  Computer virus Anti-virus software Malware Spyware Windows XP HyperText Transfer Protocol Filename extension Trojan horse (computing) E-mail spam Windows Me Stopping e-mail abuse Ajax (programming) Virus Bluetooth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mozilla Firefox Computer insecurity World Wide Web Mydoom The Matrix Online Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Windows Cross site scripting Blue screen of death Trusted computing Resident Evil Outbreak Spam (electronic) Kazaa Gmail Website Web crawler Computer security Wiki Representational State Transfer Ada programming language Antibody Linked list Peer-to-peer Web server AIDS Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 John Sheppard (Stargate) Windows 2000 Morpheus (The Matrix) Wget Antiviral drug Cytomegalovirus ReBoot Internet security Enterprise content management Resident Evil (film) HTTP cookie Foodborne illness Timeline of notable computer viruses and worms Intrusion-detection system Mozilla Application Suite Thin client SQL Files-11 C plus plus JavaScript Epstein-Barr virus Expert system Copyleft Rabies Everything2 Hacker (computer security) Pneumonia PaX P53 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Software bug Cascading Style Sheets ILOVEYOU Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Proxy server Global Positioning System Denial-of-service attack Anti-aircraft warfare Unicode and HTML Diseases of the honeybee Steam (content delivery) Computer surveillance Titration Deus ex machina Mutation Medicine Gene therapy Forth programming language HyperCard H5N1 Computer worm James D.

when you use a proxy site to register to a site can the site still get your ip address because i used a proxy site to do the registration on the main site but i had to go into my emails to send a reply which i couldn't use the proxy site there so once i send the reply does it get my real ip address or what or does it still hide my real address because i think once you reply with your normal ip address they get your real ip address not the one supplied by a proxy server they dont get your real ip the website thinks the proxy is the actual client you and then the proxy just forwards that information onto you  Uploading and downloading BitTorrent Internet pornography Internet Gmail Vlog Google Video Web hosting CPAN Spam (electronic) Debian General Packet Radio Service Topsite File Transfer Protocol Wikimedia Commons E-mail Stopping e-mail abuse America Online World Wide Web Debian Free Software Guidelines Web page Yahoo!

windows suddenly appeared recently there is a window from firefox appeared to tell me to update my firefox browser but i dont even hav a it it always appear whenever i m using the pc it is such an annoying stuff i tried to block it and restrict it but it still happening to appear on my screen plz help cause this is extremely annoying ty the site address is http www linux com at first i thought your question a disguised advertisement and was all set to report abuse however the url you supplied is broken in a foreign language chinese korean japanese or other language which uses similar graphic characters or a parked domain and from my brief research never used by firefox or any of the others built on the same framework so i guess you are asking a legitimate question after all my problem with the url is scammers who use legitimate domains like linux and append numbers in exactly the same manner as the url you supplied my suspicions of you aside are you sure have you ever installed one of the predecessors mozilla or netscape the core of each is the same and if i remember correctly when i was using netscape it also checked for updates anyway if you had any of the precursors installed in the past and did not uninstall using their uninstall utility it may very well have left something behind which is still active what you might consider doing is searching the registry assuming you are running a version of windoze for mozilla and see what turns up especially in the run and run once sections i do not remember the section names exactly i would not be surprised to see you find a program running as a service in the background which is checking for the updates do a search for startup manager at someplace like http www download com and get a program which will assist you in examining your registry for applications which run when you start or restart your computer some of these start and run completely hidden from view in much the same manner as a virus or trojan horse application i'm not calling firefox a virus just that a hidden application even a legitimate one uses the same features which a virus takes advantage of blame that set of features on bill gates this window is not coming from nothing something is running and making it happen a startup manager will help you find out what it is so you can kill it as an alternative you can trying this install firefox and then uninstall it using their uninstall utility firefox is reputable and follow the rules set forth by ms for install and uninstall in that their uninstall utility undoes most all that the install utility did someone else suggested ad adware and spybot of the two i concur about spybot and use it over ad aware spybot catches things ad aware misses both are free programs and do a reasonably good job at finding adware and spyware  Screenshot Windows XP Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Family Guy Blender (software) Homestar Runner Audio commentary (DVD) Mouse (computing) Hello world program History of the graphical user interface AmigaOS Macromedia Flash IPod Kill Bill Embedded system Nintendo GameCube Xenosaga X Window System Taskbar TV Tome Konami Code 24 (television) Teen Girl Squad Page widening PlayStation Portable Menu (computing) DVD $ale of the Century Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Babylon 5 AppleScript Danger Man COPS (TV series) Ren and Stimpy Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how to i change a limited account in to a admin account my admin account was forced to change into a limited account where i can't do anything on i went into safe mode in the default admin account where i could have deleted the admin password but i can't because as soon as my brother finds out he'll probably take my computer away how can i find out what the admin password is without erasing it or changing it he stole my laptop and messed it up when i ask him to change it back he says no i guess it doesn't really matter because this will all end when i buy another laptop first off i believe in ethics in computing so the best thing i can do since it seems your brother is the administrator and choose to limit your access is to tell you to stop and consider what you're asking those to help you with i would ask your brother to give you reasonable access so that you can use applications legitimately but really if you're willing to hack your own brother's computer i have a feeling you lost admin privileges due to something you shouldn't have been doing in the first place like trying to find out the admins password for that reason and that it isn't your computer my best suggestion to you is to gain back the trust of the admin your brother and work from there  BitTorrent Azureus EDonkey2000 Warez Linux distribution Sigur R__s Uploading and downloading Online music store Peer-to-peer File sharing Suprnova.org Minesweeper (computer game) Kademlia Web crawler Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mandriva Linux Kazaa ITunes Music Store Internet Grateful Dead Wget Download manager Digital photography Mozilla Firefox GIF World Wide Web America Online File-sharing program Hash tree Anti-virus software Microsoft Office Windows XP CPAN Copyright infringement Typeface Sikhism SubSpace (computer game) EMule Web server Download.com Filename extension Gmail Star Wreck Cascading Style Sheets Streaming media AOL Instant Messenger Opera (web browser) Windows Mobile Domain Name System Commodore 64 Skype Democracy Now!

what are some good ways to try to get your money back after buying a piece of junk computer i bought a computer off of the cyberpower website back in february even after i read all of the terrible reviews about them it took forever for my computer to finally arrive but after it did i was fairly happy with it for about two weeks before it started having problems after having had it for six months i am thoroughly sick of it and would like to get all of my money back it cost about though they don't let you return computers after you've had them for over a month so i was wondering what kind of things i should say on the phone to try to get them to give me a refund i wouldn't really want to take legal action seeing as how i'm only fifteen the only reason i bought it was because at the time i was looking for a computer a price equivalent dell would not have even been comparable to the cyberpower i could get so i decided to risk it i did see some good reviews but there weren't very many you'd think i would have been smart enough to just go with a dell since we have seven that all work fine but i wasn't over the phone is not going to get you your money back you are going to have to get all your receipts together for having it fixed and then send them copies with your complaints send the same information copies only to the state's attorney general civil division and send copies to the better business bureau mention you are only it actually helps no one wants to see someone stick it to a kid i did this years ago for a car i had painted that was guaranteed not to split chip or peel well it did all of the above and within days of getting my car back the guy laughed at me and said what are you going to do your just a kid i wrote my letters and took pictures and mailed it to the right people the guy who laughed at me got fired and i got a new paint job a better one and one that did not split chip or peel so hang in there and remember that your age could be your advantage point  Reach for the Top National Certificate of Educational Achievement Wikipedia Family Feud Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

how can you change limewire video files to differnet sources i don't know if that made sense but like the video wants to be played on windows media player but i want it on quicktime for an example firstly stop using limewire torrents are quicker and so much better www bittorrent com to download and www torrentz com to search this sounds like it's to do with the file types and the associated player for them the file type is the last three letters or numbers following from the eg mp or doc or avi you'll need to double click on my computer then from the menu along the top select tools and then folder options that will open up a new window and you'll need the third tab called file types here you need to find the file type by the three letter extension click it once to highlight it and below the list there should be a section called details for 'avi' extension and there is a button that says change that will let you pick a program from the ones installed on your computer once you've made that change the next time you click on that type of file your computer will automatically use the program you selected to open it so to recap my computer tools folder options file types hope this helps  Battery (electricity) Action potential Lithium ion battery Hybrid vehicle Lithium ion polymer battery Solar cell Laptop Atari ST IPod Energy development Liquid crystal display Fuel cell Radioisotope thermoelectric generator T-800 PowerBook G3 IBM PC compatible Battery electric vehicle Game Boy Advance SP Bicycle lighting Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Toyota Prius Senescence Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electrode Torpedo GED Solar car Electric vehicle Volt Spreadsheet Synapse AlphaSmart Wound healing phases Cellular automaton Long-term potentiation T helper cell PowerBook Grid energy storage Digital photography Lead-acid battery Geographic information system Baghdad Battery Service life Macintosh Portable Hearing aid Nickel-cadmium battery Diode Voltage source Virus IBook Brewery Cruising (maritime) Nickel metal hydride Renewable energy Hydrogen vehicle Prostate cancer Internal combustion engine N-Gage Cellular network Conway's Game of Life Artillery battery Cochlear implant Verizon Wireless Puberty Electroshock gun Cell membrane Green Lantern Corps W.

dv file won't play correctly on pc i have about a mb dv movie that was created on a mac and plays perfectly on a mac however it will not play properly on my pc in quicktime about seconds will play until the video stops but even those seconds are very very poor quality i tried it in vlc and the quality is fine there but the video stops after about seconds and i cannot fast forward or anything either is my pc just a piece of junk and cannot handle the file size or format or is there something i am doing incorrectly would converting the file to another format if so are there any free programs any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thanks there is a misunderstanding by many users that think video is video when in fact there are upwards of formats that a video can be produced with now comes the good part most mac's come with the ability to make copys of dvd's that unfortunatly are many times mac specific the reason is the software that is used roxio's toast gives different settings that will allow the user to choose how it is burnt and will give the options for pc only for mac only for pc or mac so as you can see there are several things that can affect your ability to play anything that might have been burned on either pc or mac http www videohelp com dvd above is a link that is a little long but goes indepth as to the differences in the formats available and the confusion that can also accompany burning dvd's my suggestion is to purchase a good software that will enable you to read the options available to burn so that it can be read by pc or mac next another problem could be the media you have this project or movie on dvd media s very greatly in quality and format as well herein lies another issue many users presume that they can just go out and purchase any of the cheapest dvd because it is on sale it may be the media that it was burned on dvd r media is the most widely used and recognized media used as well dvd r media can be played on just about any player or computer whereas if one of the other formats may not be able to play on anything you have especially if r or dl media was used always use the highest quality media and software to be able to read it and write it on anything you might own don  Windows XP Spyware Firewall (networking) Malware HTTP cookie Mouse (computing) Uniform Resource Locator Mozilla Firefox Stopping e-mail abuse File Transfer Protocol Proxy server Internet Explorer Pop-up ad Web browser AOL Instant Messenger Comparison of web browsers Cascading Style Sheets Voice over IP Domain Name System Internet security Google Desktop Netscape Communications Corporation Phishing America Online Opera (web browser) Web design Internet fraud Internet Mozilla Application Suite Java programming language Knoppix RuneScape cheats E-mail spam Screenshot Computer security Common Unix Printing System Trusted computing Visual Basic International Phonetic Alphabet Linux Universal Plug and Play Mac OS X Unicode and HTML BitTorrent Skype Internet forum Netfilter/iptables Mandriva Linux MSN Messenger XML Password Cross site scripting OpenBSD Rootkit Trojan horse (computing) Gmail Windows Server 2003 Embedded system Common criticisms of Microsoft Control Panel (Windows) Server Hyperlink World Wide Web Wiki Web application Buffer overflow Web page Tabbed document interface PNG Danger Hiptop Web crawler Network address translation Instant messaging HyperCard Web service User agent Linux distribution CPU cache Ajax (programming) Google Windows 2000 Peer-to-peer Spam (electronic) Netscape Hotmail HTML element PlayStation Portable AmigaOS

why does my computer do this when i connect to the internet i get a window that says main module has encountered a problem and needs to close then i click okay and it all goes away then i can open my isp program again and get on the internet with no problem but the next time i try to get on the internet it does it again does anybody know if this is an indication of a major problem what type of firewall programs do you have on your computer do you have more than one what is the latest one that you have downloaded or installed are they all up to date first start with last thing that you install downloaded if there is one it is most likely causing the error if not then i would assume the one that you have needs upgrades because it is not reconiging something when you are opening it up the first time then once you restart it it does it without whatever is holding it back and then you are find until the internet connection is lost or you close internet explorer try upgrades and removing problems and see if it works  Trojan horse (computing) Anti-virus software Cmd.exe Computer virus COM file Ebook Filename extension Windows 2000 MegaMan Battle Network Metadata Rootkit Malware File format Macromedia Flash C Sharp Portable Document Format Spyware Magic number (programming) Dynamic-Link Library Digital photography Compiler AmigaOS High Level Assembly ILOVEYOU OS/2 Linked list Stopping e-mail abuse Blue screen of death COMMAND.COM DIGITAL Command Language Pipeline (Unix) Google Desktop Data recovery Btrieve Windows API Pneumonia Windows 3.x MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Dialer Computer file Hello world program ALGOL 68 Perl Disk image Virus classification Geographic information system Gmail National Oceanographic Data Center Translation memory Macro Header file Icon programming language Gene therapy MediaMax CD-3 Double-click (computing) Batch file Computer security HyperCard Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Serialization WYSIWYG WavPack River Exe Icon (computing) Screenshot Intrusion-detection system PaX Portable Executable Unicode Computer forensics Windows 1.0 Cascading Style Sheets Object file Ghost (software) Microsoft Paint Password P__li Copyleft MinGW Screensaver Chess opening REBOL Commodore DOS Game Maker System 6 OpenDocument Musical Instrument Digital Interface Influenza Klik Tagged Image File Format Macintosh Finder Trusted computing Binary and text files E-mail spam Chess strategy and tactics Web traffic Logo programming language Resource fork Microsoft Word

is there such a thing as your antivirus software becoming corrupted and howd you know if its happened probably if you get error messages from the antivirus software then something is probably wrong someone might have been up to no good but it's also possible for part of the hard drive to go bad and the antivirus software may be stored in that area if the antivirus software won't run try booting from something like an antivirus recovery disc perhaps the norton internet security cd for example and if nothing seems to be wrong after a scan for viruses try re installing the antivirus program and it probably wouldn't hurt to use a disk scanning utility to make sure there are no corrupt sectors or clusters on the hard drive a quick scan would be better than nothing but a surface scan would be even better but it may take a very long time i'm more familiar with norton systemworks than i am the other utility suites but it seems reasonable that there are other good programs out there good luck  Naoko Takeuchi USS Skate (SS-305) Post office 1990s Trinity College (Connecticut) United States Postal Service Pretty Good Privacy The Globe and Mail Public-key cryptography Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mail fraud Electronic Arts Michelle Kwan Inspector Gadget Pretty Woman USS Skate (SSN-578) Rachel McAdams Jeff Bezos Royal Mail Mail order Natural language processing April 1, 2005 E-mail Bomberman Inline speed skating Pukkelpop Queens Pretty Sammy Pretty in Pink Cross-country skiing Ice skating Konami Melissa worm Takuya Kimura Totally Spies!

cant log into computer profile i have windows xp and when i went to log into my account profile it said it cant log in due to corrupt or missing files and logged me into a temp account instead is there any way i can fix this i dont want to lose everything on my account although even more important i dont want to lose my entire laptop help please i know i should back things up i just suck at actually remembering too would doing a restore date maybe a week ago or more possibly work or should i even try it i am trying what was already suggested to me though maybe because it redirected me here from the admin account it will let me at the very least create another one to work from forgive me if i get things wrong and seem dense i know just enough about 'fixing' computers to really screw things up p well there is no quick and easy way to do this first you'll have to login and create a new profile then copy all of your data from the old profile to the new one the temp account may not have high enough user rights if this is the case you can usually log in using administrator as the id and leave password blank after that s done read the following from microsoft and it should guide you along the way http support microsoft com kb i don't normally offer extended help to random people but since this has the potential to be a pain in the rear for you feel free to drop me an e mail if you can't get it working charlotteguy yahoo com if you do get it back up and running smoothly you should make it a habbit to backup everything incrementally good luck rick in response to your additional comments you can try to run the restore very easy to do but chances are that this will not fix the issue and may actually cause more damage but it's totaly up to you  Virtual memory Windows 2000 CPU cache Windows XP Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks AmigaOS Mouse (computing) Windows 3.x File Allocation Table Computer virus Linux 64-bit USB flash drive Mac OS X Page table Mach kernel Windows Server 2003 C programming language Btrieve Emacs History of Microsoft Windows Partition (computing) Apple Macintosh DOS System/36 PaX NX bit Hello world program Kernel (computer science) Blue screen of death Knoppix Embedded system System/34 Page replacement algorithms FreeDOS Screenshot RISC Spring operating system Memory (computers) CPU design System 6 System 7 (Macintosh) Forth programming language Windows Vista Macromedia Flash Novell NetWare File system IA-32 Sorting algorithm Atari 8-bit family Computer IPod Architecture of Windows 2000 Central processing unit Booting Universal Serial Bus Kazaa Emulator MDAC Unicode MS-DOS PlayStation 2 Macintosh Finder MIPS architecture Digital photography Object Desktop Compiler optimization Computer multitasking Minesweeper (computer game) Anti-virus software X86 Paging INMOS Transputer NeXT Gmail Digital Equipment Corporation Amstrad CPC Pixel The Sims 2: University Perl HTTP cookie Spyware History of the graphical user interface Cache Disk cloning Hard disk Computer storage Quicksort National Weather Service Thread (computer science) DragonFly BSD IMac Laptop Xbox 360 World of Warcraft Digital circuit

can i use two email programms for same address i like windows mail for my email and outlook express too i aso like the calender better for that is there a way i can set them up so they will both receive emails the short answer is yes you can however it does require a proper setup which will depend on the type of mail account you're using there are two standard types of e mail accounts you may be working with pop imap if you're using a work or college e mail account it may be imap in which case all you have to do is set up both windows mail and outlook express with your e mail account information and you should be set just try to avoid running both programs at the same time to avoid conflicts if you're using a web mail provider like google or hotmail chances are it's a pop account which is a little more tricky to set up with a pop account all of your mail is stored on a server that your mail provider owns client programs like outlook express and windows mail then download copies of the mail from the server the problem is that by default once the mail has been downloaded the client will send a message to your pop account telling it to delete the original source from the server so if you downloaded all of your mail with windows mail it would show up but then if you tried to open outlook express it would tell you there were no messages to download to prevent this you need to configure both microsoft mail and outlook express to leave the messages on your provider's server the steps are similar for both microsoft mail and outlook express so once you've entered your e mail account information just do this on both clients go to tools accounts highlight your mail account by clicking it click the properties button select the advanced tab under the delivery section check leave a copy of messages on server click ok now you should be able to switch back and forth between windows mail and outlook express without having one steal all of your mail unfortunately the two clients don't communicate so even after you read messages with windows mail outlook express will think they're new messages until you open them with outlook express if that doesn't bother you then you should be all set i hope that helps gl  Windows XP Windows 2000 Windows Vista Password Partition (computing) NTFS History of Microsoft Windows Hard disk Apple Macintosh File system Windows registry Redundant array of independent disks Computer virus USB flash drive Oracle database Linux IBM PC compatible DOS Booting AmigaOS Disk cloning Novell NetWare Backup Windows Server 2003 Computer forensics Forth programming language Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Knoppix Domain Name System System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Virtual memory BIOS Atari 8-bit family System/36 Control-Alt-Delete Computer security MDAC Blue screen of death Information Technology Infrastructure Library Personal computer System/34 Rootkit Cache Embedded system Copy protection Steam (content delivery) Phishing Common Unix Printing System Passphrase IPod Wget Kernel (computer science) Microsoft Office Wi-Fi Mac OS X v10.4 Windows API Windows 3.x Btrieve Secure Shell FreeDOS HyperCard Digital rights management Apple II family Malware Mac OS X CPU design File Transfer Protocol Windows Me Architecture of Windows 2000 BASIC programming language Patch (computing) Stopping e-mail abuse OpenOffice.org Enterprise content management Thread (computer science) DR-DOS Files-11 Boot image Federal Standard 1037C OpenGL Disk formatting Computer storage Two-factor authentication TRS-80 Apple Computer Computer SAS System

is there a way of checking if someone has used web cam on your computer i want to do a check to see if someone has used a web cam on my computer does it store a log or copy of the web cam on the pc and if so how do i find it your best bet might be to see if your web cam software maintains some sort of event log if it does then the time and date of the log file should be the last time the camera was used  LimeWire Spyware Malware Web crawler Gnutella Computer virus MGM Studios, Inc. v.

wireless router it is possible to get a router that connects to the computer wirelessly could the black box modem from comcast dsl be hooked up to the router and then i wouldn't have to hook up the router to any computer is it possible to have the modem and router in one room alone and the pc in another room where can i find one of these routers that connect wirlessly yup all this is possible to setup this kind of environment you will need to buy a wireless router and hook that up to your adsl modem which your isp gave you each wireless router comes with a user friendly tutorial on how to connect configure it to work with your isp's adsl modem once that is done you will need to put a wireless networking card in your computer laptop if it doesn't have that already all recent laptops come with it for security you could add the mac address of your laptop's wireless card to your wireless router's access list that will prevent anyone except you to connect to the wireless router or if you have friends come over alot with their laptops you could put a wep password on it and share that password with the person who wants to use it now whether or not you will be able to take it to the other room depends on your house and your wireless router if you are living in one of those houses which are built with conrete bricks you probably won't have wireless signal in adjacent room unless you have direct line of sight with the wireless router's antenna because wifi frequencies don't pass through brick but for houses with wooden walls you shouldn't have any problem most wireless routers have their signal range written on their box so check that out when you are buying it one last thing wireless routers can broadcast three types of wifi signals a b g all of them are classified as wifi but have different speed b g is most common but i think a is the fastest i might be wrong on this one eitherway make sure that the wireless card in your laptops supports the wifi signal type that you wireless router broadcasts  E-mail spam Opera (web browser) Internet Message Access Protocol Domain Name System Pretty Good Privacy AOL Instant Messenger Windows XP Mozilla Firefox Post Office Protocol Hotmail Windows 2000 Mozilla Application Suite Simple Mail Transfer Protocol MDAC Microsoft Office PHP Danger Hiptop Outlook Express HTTP cookie X Window System Webmail Ajax (programming) Linux Cross site scripting MSN Messenger Usenet Computer forensics ITunes Lotus Notes Blue screen of death Spam (electronic) Internet Relay Chat Internet fraud Windows Server 2003 Mac OS X Windows Vista Google Emacs Mozilla Thunderbird Sender Policy Framework Microsoft Exchange Server BitTorrent AmigaOS Macromedia Flash Web crawler Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol File Transfer Protocol SAS System Password Anonymous remailer Unicode and e-mail Python programming language Spyware Screenshot Transmission Control Protocol Data retention America Online ICalendar Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Server Netscape Communications Corporation Perl Microsoft Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Google Talk National Weather Service Mouse (computing) Steam (content delivery) Java programming language MIME JADE programming language MySQL Proxy server Server Message Block Apple Open Collaboration Environment Secure Shell Virtual memory Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Visual Basic .NET Whois Microsoft Outlook Concurrent Versions System Mbox Google Desktop Public-key cryptography Cheating in Counter-Strike AppleTalk Btrieve Melissa worm United States Postal Service Jabber

which unix platform is best and used most sun solaris hp ux linux lindows i have been a tech tl for unix system admins of a large organization as my previous profile and we supported different versions of os aix x hp ux i sun solaris and linux redhat el i have also been an sys admin for novell netware freebsd sco and various versions of windows starting from win x to win have worked on a few others but those os never made it big so which is the best os it depends upon what you need to run do with it an os takes the role of an operator what we had with early mainframe systems and if your task is to just work on word and excel documents windows xp may be good enough for you and if you are doing simple data entry or have a pos in a third world country you may actually be using software made for dos all command line text gui however come to big organizations that have lots of data and processes even business that utilize that data they need powerful systems and high end applications where unix and it's clones come into the picture stable robust with some of the best performance if your work is involved with cheaper hardware non proprietary etc i would say go ahead with linux or solaris if supported on the other hand if you have the hardware to go with it hp ux or aix may be the ones to consider we have run very large oracle databases have designed systems with tbs of storage written network backup apps dr software etc and with the right hardware os combination all the top versions of unix linux perform quite alike the differ only in the cost and quality of support so if you go ahead with a free version of linux you may have a to performance lower compared to aix though a lot of your effort would need to go in to keep it tuned and running well likewise if you go for hp ux and have a support package most of your headache will be limited to the cost of hardware software and upgrades so the key is in finding the combination platform which is right for you and meets your budge requirements hope this has helped andrew  Control key Emacs Modifier key Control-Alt-Delete Vim (text editor) Computer keyboard Unicode Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Internet Relay Chat Blue screen of death COMMAND.COM IBM PC keyboard Dayfree Press Diacritic Wil Wheaton Control character QBasic Common User Access Keyboard layout ASCII Mouse (computing) Amiga Immanuel Kant Webcomic Windows 2000 WordPerfect AltGr key Internet troll City of Heroes Carl and the Passions - "So Tough" Make money fast Jack Thompson Reservoir Dogs Editor war Norton Commander Friedrich Nietzsche Tea GNU Screen Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys The Contender (television series) Made in U.S.A.

old mobos gold recovery i have around motherboards from the mid 's early 's all are either socket or socket all of them have over of the backs and of the front lined with gold inlays i was wonder if anyone knew of a site that explains how to remove the gold from them i have tested the gold and it is k and up or if anyone know how to do it themselves thanks the most gold is actually on the cpus and are the best about will harvest one ounce the amount of gold on the cunductor paths connectors and pins is minimal as the plating is very thin and the supplies and chemicals to extract it will far outweight the amount of recovered gold it is a very dangerous and drawn out process involving strong acids and toxic fumes i do not recommend this procedure at all to anyone without careful research and a strong commitment to proper handling of the chemicals and safety you will do much better selling them as scrap for gold recovery on ebay to soimeone who is already doing this type of recovery  Random access memory System 7 (Macintosh) Hard disk Windows XP Memory (computers) Virtual memory Atari 8-bit family Apple II family Commodore 64 Windows 2000 Atari ST Booting Computer virus Apple IIGS Linux Overclocking Windows registry IBM PC compatible Computer Blue screen of death Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows Vista Apple Macintosh Redundant array of independent disks IPod Library (computer science) Read-only memory Dynamic random access memory PlayStation 3 C programming language Computer forensics IMac TRS-80 Embedded system Apollo Guidance Computer Nintendo GameCube File system Emacs World Wide Web Xbox RAM disk Floppy disk PlayStation Portable MAME Gmail PowerBook Xbox 360 Digital photography AmigaOS CPU cache ZX Spectrum Opera (web browser) CPU design TRS-80 Color Computer Flash memory PlayStation 2 IBM PC NeXT Sega Dreamcast Spring operating system MRAM PC Engine Stardock Spyware Laptop Amstrad CPC Microprogram System/34 FreeDOS TOPS-20 MS-DOS Nintendo 64 Commodore 128 DVD RISC Computer storage Mach kernel Cray-1 Object Desktop Nintendo Entertainment System Microsoft Windows System/36 BBC Micro Nintendo Revolution Buffer overflow Linked list DR-DOS Expert system Acorn Electron Non-volatile memory Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Apple Newton Steam (content delivery) 64-bit Oscilloscope

what does rgb stand for when talking about computers what does rgb stand for i tried wikipedia but it gave me another definition unless if it means the same thing the rgb color model is an additive model in which red green and blue often used in additive light models are combined in various ways to reproduce other colors the name of the model and the abbreviation rgb come from the three primary colors red green and blue and the technological development of cathode ray tubes which could display color instead of a monochrome phosphoresence including grey scaling such as black and white film and television imaging the term rgba is also used to mean red green blue alpha this is not a different color model but a representation the alpha is used for transparency these three colors should not be confused with the primary pigments of red blue and yellow known in the art world as primary colors as the latter combine based on reflection and absorption of photons whereas rgb depends on emission of photons from in the case of a cathode ray tube display a compound excited to a higher energy state by impact with an electron beam the rgb color model itself does not define what is meant by red green and blue spectroscopically and so the results of mixing them are not specified as exact but relative and averaged by the human eye when the exact spectral make up of the red green and blue primaries are defined the color model would then become what is known in science and engineering as an absolute color space such as srgb or adobe rgb see rgb color spaces for more details this article discusses concepts common to all the different rgb color spaces that use the rgb color model which are used in one implementation or another historically in color image producing electronics technology  Regular expression Google search Typosquatting Search engine Search engine optimization Web traffic Spamdexing Yahoo!

computeach misleading adverts my daughter did the ecdl course through computeach and was told they'd help her find a job on completion of the course she passed with flying colours in june and all they've done to help her find work is post her cv on a couple of web sites she had already done this herself am i expecting too much from them to be honest they're nearly all cons of some description or at the very least not worth the money they charge in fact quite alot of them masquerade as computer training companies but are really in the business of getting their 'customers' to sign up for a credit agreement with their company to pay for the course what's left after they've taken their profit from the interest rate is used to register the 'customer' onto the course they applied to do if your daughter actually learnt enough from them to pass the ecdl course then they've fulfilled that requirement which is fair enough relatively few of these companies are organised enough to be able to actually provide enough support to get people through the course s and the small print in their agreements is a minefield but unless they specifically say in writing what steps they will take to try and get people jobs after they're qualified they're not really obligated to do anything major to find people work unless they'll be benefitting in some way from people gaining employment after the course i doubt they'd do much more than uploading cvs to websites since it doesn't pay  AOL Instant Messenger Spam (electronic) HTTP cookie Malware Macromedia Flash Blue screen of death Computer security Windows Vista MDAC World Wide Web Internet Windows registry Proxy server Uninstaller Trojan horse (computing) Linux Pretty Good Privacy IPod E-mail spam Filename extension Ajax (programming) IBM PC compatible Java programming language Mozilla Application Suite E-mail USB flash drive System 7 (Macintosh) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Opera (web browser) Linspire AmigaOS Commodore 64 Cheating in Counter-Strike Domain Name System ITunes Browser wars Mydoom Website Adware Patch (computing) Perl Python programming language Mouse (computing) Web crawler Uniform Resource Locator BitTorrent Internet Relay Chat Mac OS X Phishing Copy protection Mach kernel History of Microsoft Windows Btrieve Comparison of web browsers Trusted computing Streaming media Common criticisms of Microsoft Web application Floppy disk Palm OS Bluetooth Microsoft Office Thread (computer science) Visual Basic Windows API XML HyperCard OpenBSD Warez Pop-up ad Denial-of-service attack Web server Game programming Internet security Ebook C programming language

how to make my windows xp run faster how to make my windows xp run faster following these steps will increase the speed of your computer dramatically clean up the disk uninstall unneeded programs especially those that run at startup and or put something in the system tray run disk cleanup and defragment the drive this is a good first step that will almost always take a few seconds off boot time and application loads for any computer stomp auto starting programs click start run and type msconfig at the prompt click the startup tab and look at all that junk that loads when you launch your pc do you really need adobe reader speed launch probably not turn off anything else that looks useless but be careful not to disable your anti virus and important system components run a full anti virus and anti spyware scan i would recommend using avg free anti virus spybot search and destroy spyware remover and ad aware spyware remover these programs are all free clean up the registry ccleaner available at http www ccleaner com is free and worth running it will also remove unused files from your system allowing windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space those are the easy and free things you can do if your computer is still slow you need to move on to the bigger guns upgrade ram this is the one killer trick that will make almost any computer run faster with an older pc you will rarely have enough ram to run today's memory hogging operating systems and applications and adding a high capacity stick or two of quality ram will give you a quick speed boost adding ram is fairly simple even for a novice and you should be able to do the job in or minutes you can run a free test at http www crucial com and find out what kind of ram memory your computer needs reinstall windows if the above tricks haven't helped it may be time to wipe the slate clean and start again reformatting your hard drive reinstalling your applications and restoring your data files from a backup you'd be surprised how much more responsive a freshly reinstalled windows system can be as you've wiped out years of temp files garbled registry entries old versions of software programs that have been upgraded repeatedly and all sorts of other electronic junk reinstalling is easy if you have the recovery disk that came with your pc and only a bit more involved if you're using a retail copy of windows xp just be sure you back up everything you want to take with you before you pull the trigger upgrade your hard drive this is a more complicated solution but if you're reinstalling windows per the prior tip you might consider upgrading to a bigger and possibly faster hard drive too hard disk storage is a performance bottleneck on every machine and magnetic disks degrade over time some performance issues could be caused by a failing hard drive even and upgrading to a new model could really put some zip back in your system as a bonus you can use the original hard drive for backups or occasional storage if you put it in an enclosure  Life insurance Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Contract Trademark Unemployment Electronic commerce Internet fraud Copyright Credit card Corporation Intellectual property Plame affair Advertising Outsourcing Health insurance Corporate governance Copyright law of the United Kingdom Microeconomics Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Wal-Mart Customer relationship management 401(k) United States Postal Service Kyoto Protocol Bank Dot-com Business ethics Apprenticeship Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Cluetrain Manifesto Open access Annuity Search engine optimization Intel Web hosting Apple Computer Poker jargon Civil rights Trade union Graduate school Labor theory of value Privatization National Insurance Efficiency wages SCO-Linux controversies George W.

can't figure out how to so here is the deal short of a long story workgroup network all xp users pretty basic boss's machine gets eaten hd survives and we've got to re install o s software and re connect him to the network we gave his machine a new name added him to the workgroup and re shared out all of his folders to the network but here is the quandry whenever somebody access a file on his machine through the network for example his my documents and tries to add a new folder they get access denied also if he adds the folder himself then somebody tries to place a file into that folder we get check security access privlidges access denied how to i rectify this so that everybody can add new folders in his my documents and also place files into those folders by default the share level for everything in the my documents folder is restricted to everyone the owner of the file or folder and local computer administrators have read and write permission to the file or folder nobody else may read or write to the folder or the files in it this is the default setting for all the folders and files in each user's my documents folder you would have to add permissions to read write recursively to everybody in my experience sharing folders under my documents is too much pain i prefer to create a dedicated folder somewhere else on the file system and share it  Extended ASCII ASCII ASCII art Uniform Resource Locator Control character HyperText Transfer Protocol APL programming language Computer keyboard Emoticon Goatse.cx Tablature Teleprinter ANSI art Google Maps Strawberry Fields Forever Dash Dream Theater Base64 Umlaut Brainfuck Apostrophe (mark) Website Number sign Control key Keyboard layout Web server UTF-8 IBM PC keyboard Slash (punctuation) Slashdot trolling phenomena Wireless Application Protocol Rod Stewart Tab Gmail Mouse (computing) Function key Digital Unicode Sinclair ZX81 2channel Google Web Accelerator Greeklish Chorded keyboard String (computer science) Esperanto orthography Commodore PET World Wide Web Web crawler Prank flash Mona (ASCII art) MIME Gay Nigger Association of America MSN Messenger Jon Secada Question mark Apollo 11 Synthesizer Musical notation Copy protection Federal Standard 1037C System/36 Ajax (programming) ASCII armor Autostereogram Telegraphy Domain Name System Hexadecimal EIA-708 Jabber The Cure KIM-1 Leet Apache HTTP Server Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Screenshot Newline Space opera in Scientology doctrine Hey Jude BlackBerry TOC protocol Phoebe Halliwell Grave accent Care Bears Quotation mark MD5 Billy Sherwood Character encodings in HTML Baudot code Rastafari movement ISO/IEC 8859 Internet phenomenon Yes Nevada-tan Keyboard instrument Japanese mobile phone culture Talking Heads Typeface ISO/IEC 2022 Cross site scripting

leopard os x is the leopard os x system worth getting as soon as it comes out i know when every new windows os comes out a lot of people wait because there are normally a lot of problems to fix as a general rule is this the same case for new mac os's should i get tiger for now and later upgrade to leopard the main reason i want leopard is for time machine and boot camp is automatically bundled with it from what i've read leopard seems to be more like update rather than a new os altogether would this be why people are saying the transition will be easier i'm looking to get this thing before september that would mean for me to get the tiger os if i did this rather than waitied what would the approximate cost be for upgrading to leopard when it comes out even the mac os's require patches from time to time i'll admit that when apple went from panther to tiger it wasn't a big pain at all but realize that these new os's to to etc aren't true revampings of the os windows to xp or xp to vista were huge reconstructions of the os and thus had many problems in the interum if you remember when apple went from os to os x there were big big problems with the os that took over a year to iron out so this upgrade to leopard won't have that many problems but you'll still get an os update every couple months although time machine is a neat concept there are programs out there that already do that for you though i haven't had the chance to test out time machine also boot camp is available free on apple's website the only reason i see to get leopard now is that you don't have to buy os's  Macromedia Flash Multimedia Streaming media QuickTime H.264/MPEG-4 AVC PlayStation Portable Data compression DVD ITU-T Enterprise content management Windows 3.x Disk magazine Ogg Vorbis Multimedia literacy HyperCard Multimedia Messaging System Mac OS X Windows Vista Authorware XML File format IBM PC compatible OS/2 Mass media Peer-to-peer RSS (file format) Portable Document Format Musical Instrument Digital Interface Iriver MIME Theora Podcasting Flash memory Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Microsoft Moving Picture Experts Group MPEG-4 Internet phenomenon Comparison of web browsers Internet pornography Web browser MP3 Synchronization Deep web Digital photography Graphics DivX Mac OS X v10.4 Screenshot Marching band Thomson SA Archos Computer Webcomic Semantic Web Web design Text editor Digital audio player Vlog Steganography Wikimedia Commons Morse Code Secure Digital card Interchange File Format Matroska MSN Messenger Sega Dreamcast MPlayer Digital television AMD Computer and video games History of Microsoft Windows PNG Blog AVI Markup language Cascading Style Sheets JavaScript Prank flash Computer-assisted language learning Xbox Media Center Scalable Vector Graphics Universal Serial Bus Macromedia Shockwave Spider-Man (games) Disc jockey Lossy data compression Vector graphics Greek language Hyperlink XMMS Multimedia Card Trusted computing Microsoft PowerPoint Television Mouse (computing) Macromedia

weird voices talking coming from computer speakers virus yah i don't know whats' doing it but there is something that is broadcasting voices etc over my speakers even when the internet is disconnected it went away for a while and is now back i'm using an xp with service pack if that makes any difference anybody had a similar issue my isp thought that it wasn't his problem because when you shut the internet off it's still there the internet also shuts off after several hours of connectivity we thought that might be because of a filtering problem with the fax machine that our line is going through so i'm going to pick up a new filter we're running one computer with a modem no router if you have any thoughts etc they'd be apprecitated thanks it is most likely broadcast radio if there is a fm radio transmitter close by the length of wire that connects the speakers to the computer act like an antenna and then the speaker is a speaker and you hear the dj or music or what ever the station is playing to fix this try wrapping the speaker wire into a smaller bundle to shorten it  HyperText Transfer Protocol Object Desktop Google Web browser Common Unix Printing System World Wide Web E-mail Cross site scripting AmigaOS GameFAQs Stopping e-mail abuse Web design Blue screen of death Website Wget Kazaa Mouse (computing) ITunes Proxy server E-mail spam Uniform Resource Locator Web page HTML AOL Instant Messenger BitTorrent Portable Document Format XML Domain Name System HTML element Hello world program International Phonetic Alphabet Emacs Windows Vista Windows 2000 Malware JavaScript Macintosh Finder Steam (content delivery) Screenshot Enterprise content management MDAC Konqueror Pop-up ad Web traffic Internet fraud PNG Google search Search engine optimization Computer virus Password TikiWiki Pretty Good Privacy Wireless Application Protocol Internet Explorer for Mac NPAPI Internet Neopets Minesweeper (computer game) Web server CPAN Mac OS X Danger Hiptop Unicode Internet privacy File system CPU cache OpenBSD Web application Outlook Express Denial-of-service attack Lotus Notes Prank flash Internet Relay Chat Google Talk Expert system Netscape Communications Corporation BlackBerry User agent

system restore question what exactly does it do and do you need it to have a fast computer running windows xp home i noticed the box next to use system restore is not checked will i harm computer if i dont use it you will not harm the computer it helps it to go a slitght bit faster but you wont notice it see system restore is great to have on because if you install something and your computer all of a sudden doesnt work properly and uninstalling the program doesnt work you can system restore and it goes back to the settings before you did the install best bet is if you will install a fishy unknown effects to installing program set a restore point first sometimes it doesnt make the best restore points i find and i go back days in the system restore i have had to use it a few times but not alot and my wife too so for us it helps you can set up how much hd space it will take and the more you give the more you can restore to i find i havent had a virus problem on there yet but i suppose it could happen if you want just leave it unchecked until you want to install something that you dont trust also depends on your computer on the resources used if your computer is slower it will be more noticable but if it's faster you shouldnt notice it i have a p ghz and i dont notice it at all everything works fine for me p  Macromedia Flash Windows XP Portable Document Format Mac OS X Wget Mozilla Firefox Internet Explorer Gmail Common Unix Printing System Windows 2000 Filename extension Web browser World Wide Web Object Desktop Windows 3.x Warez IPod AmigaOS AOL Instant Messenger USB flash drive MSN Messenger Web server Unicode File system Apple Macintosh HyperText Transfer Protocol QuickTime Mozilla Application Suite ITunes Emacs Digital rights management Mac OS X v10.4 WebObjects ASCII art OpenOffice.org Unix File format Opera (web browser) NTFS Mac OS 8 Python programming language Linux Perl Kazaa Windows Vista Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Unicode and HTML Wi-Fi Stardock Computer virus HTTP cookie Netscape Navigator File Transfer Protocol Mac OS Pretty Good Privacy Secure Shell Blue screen of death Metadata Spyware History of Microsoft Windows System 7 (Macintosh) Disk image File Allocation Table Screenshot Windows registry Transport Layer Security Linux distribution Apple typography Macintosh Finder Uniform Resource Locator World of Warcraft WordPerfect Hard disk X Window System TeX Btrieve Proxy server Windows Media Player Apple II family Apache HTTP Server Comparison of file systems LiveCD NeXT Mandriva Linux Mac OS X Server Mac OS history Online music store Microsoft HyperCard User agent Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Apple Filing Protocol Internet Binary and text files Logo programming language CPAN Steam (content delivery)

how can i back up my zipped music onto dvd the already compressed file is on 'my documents' when i click the icon and try to send to the 'e' drive i keep on getting the message windows has encountered a problem i hit retry but that doesn't help either it's only gb onto a gb dvd and help please in plain english uh am i missing something here are you simply trying to copy a file to a dvd disk with drag and drop is your dvd burner your e drive in my experience there are some dvd burners which can use rewritable media which act like a very slow hard disk which will allow drag and drop but the disk has to be formatted and such just like a hard disk the dvd just becomes another drive but with removable media the error you are getting could be the media is not formatted i do not recognize the error i use a program called incd which comes from nero and came with my dvd burner sometimes it fails to load the drive when i insert a disk and it takes an eject open my computer right click on dvd drive then select eject instead of using the eject button on the drive if i use the drive button it fails to load the next disk and reinsert for incd to recognize the disk and load it so it is ready to use newer versions of windoze may have this ability built in either you are using packet software like i do with incd or you are using a burning program to create a dvd data disk either way it appears the dvd drive is not recognizing the media is loaded and ready  Ethernet Modem Digital Subscriber Line Computer bus Universal Serial Bus Wi-Fi Xbox Router AppleTalk Enigma machine Local area network TIA-568A/B PlayStation 2 Laptop Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Power line communication FireWire Jack plug Bluetooth Commodore 64 Password Null modem Computer network Desktop computer Federal Standard 1037C Digital Equipment Corporation Personal computer Category 5 cable RS-232 MAC address Cisco Systems Communications protocol Atari 8-bit family Cable television Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IPod DOCSIS Residual-current device BS 1363 Internet Group Management Protocol Telephone exchange Computer surveillance IMac Coaxial cable Wireless LAN Voice over IP Wireless access point Private branch exchange Integrated Services Digital Network USB flash drive AirPort Denial-of-service attack Broadband Internet access Musical Instrument Digital Interface Network switch Dial-up access Serial port Netfilter/iptables GSM services SCADA Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Telegraphy X.25 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis STS-61 3Com Corporation HyperTransport Advanced Technology Attachment Universal Plug and Play Computer networking device Secure Digital card Computer PowerPC MIPS architecture SCART Electricity meter Spark plug RJ-45 Cable modem IEEE 802.11 10-gigabit Ethernet HomePNA Computer hardware OSI model NSA encryption systems Network address translation Dongle ARPANET Xbox 360 IBook ALOHAnet Nintendo GameCube LocalTalk Mouse (computing) Packet radio Electrical wiring Internet service provider

how does bittorrent work i just downloaded bittorrent and i don't really know how it works i'm trying to download something how long does that usually take i need a thorough explanation here is a link that should tell everything you need to know http dessent net btfaq if you have dial up it'll take you a week or more to download one movie if you have adsl you can still use the phone while on internet then it can take anywhere from hours pretty fast to days if only one or two people uploading seeding the movie a movie with people seeding uploading and to people leeching downloading takes about to hours when you're downloading do not shut down your bittorrent unless necessary because this cuts off the download and even if you start again right again you'll notice that the download speed is considerably slower yo kaliente queer if you want to be a cop go sign up at the police academy we're adults here and we can decide for ourselves between right and wrong we don't need you preaching it's totally legal as long as you only download and do not distribute for profit for example you download a movie burn it and sell it that illegal you think it's kind of wrong are you kidding people are getting killed and tortured this second and you're preaching about downloading preach about something important world hunger war genocide anything for pete's sake  Spyware Trojan horse (computing) Adware Computer virus Pop-up ad Windows XP Rootkit Anti-virus software Dialer AOL Instant Messenger Common Unix Printing System Phishing Spybot - Search & Destroy Stopping e-mail abuse Prank flash MSN Messenger Gmail Steam (content delivery) Microsoft Windows Warez Opera (web browser) Advertising World Wide Web Filename extension Web crawler America Online Port numbers Copy protection Website Proxy server Freeware RuneScape cheats Uniform Resource Locator DCPlusPlus Software cracking Wget Sobig worm BitTorrent Internet security Computer insecurity HyperText Transfer Protocol Internet Explorer Patch (computing) Denial-of-service attack Cross site scripting File-sharing program Web server OpenBSD Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Comparison of web browsers Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DragonFly BSD Hacker (computer security) E-mail spam Peer-to-peer ZX Spectrum Yahoo!

how does light beems transfer data an electrical signal activates a light emitting diode led the light signal is transmitted along a fiber optic cable which works on the theory of total internal reflection light that is transmitted is picked up at a light absorbing diode which generates an electrical signal when it is subjected to certain frequencies of light the new electric signal does what all electrical signals do best it is interpreted from the light transmission much like a morse code but as s and s currently only fiber optic cables use light to transmit process data in the future it may become the case that computers come with fiber optical processing very science fictional at the moment however laser communication is also possible but not widely used as it works very much on the same principles of microwaves both light and micro waves and even radio waves they are all transverse wave types and hence it was just a matter of time before we developed the idea for visible light we use microwaves and radiowaves instead because their higher frequency band while being invisible to human optics can transmit a signal much further without breakup so besides fiber optics you can also send a light based transmission wirelessly via laser the military developed laser comms as a means of keeping communication established even when the enemy had jammed conventional radio and microwave transmissions  Monopoly (game) Live 8 World Wide Web Computer virus CPU cache Daylight saving time Gmail Domain Name System Poker jargon Internet fraud Ron Weasley Theory of conduct Ra (board game) Auction Charmed Legal research Advance fee fraud FoxTrot RuneScape cheats Collision detection United States Postal Service Atomic Kitten Neopets RuneScape economy Columbine High School massacre Outsourcing Computer security The Sims 2 Surveillance Microsoft The Hobbit Phoebe Halliwell Flintheart Glomgold The Amazing Race Oh My Goddess!

can someone check my ip adress from an email i send from yahoo or gmail like an expert hacker or a computer geek i am going to write stuff against military regime to a website anything you send to anyone from anywhere is tracable most of the time an expert hacker isn't even necessary to do so for example anytime you connect to at least a high speed internet provider your computer's ip is recorded as well as the amount of packets sent and received i do not know what country you live in but if it's the us i would advise going to an attorney for help in writing such information because there have been reports of a teenage girl on myspace who wrote against the bush admin and was questioned and i bet you probably do not want a visit from homeland security or the cia or the fbi or whatever  Typewriter QWERTY Computer keyboard Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Killian documents Keyboard layout Teleprinter Computer printer Apostrophe (mark) Enigma machine Writing PDP-1 Control character Quotation mark IBM Selectric typewriter Keyboard technology Diacritic Arabic alphabet Infinite monkey theorem Word processing Paper size Desk Game controller Typeface Emphasis (typography) Dash Colossus computer Stenotype Hebern rotor machine Synthesizer IBM 1620 Optical character recognition Computer PostScript Braille Atari 8-bit family Devan__gar__ Monotype Corporation String instrument ASCII art Dot matrix printer Esperanto orthography Postage stamp Oxford English Dictionary Poker jargon Mail Laptop Jumpstart 3rd Grade Coleco Adam ISO/IEC 8859 Cursive English words with uncommon properties Xerox Unicode Mimeograph machine IBM Ruby programming language Cangjie method C programming language Linotype machine Fairlight CMI System/36 Modifier key The Allman Brothers Band X Window System Piano Texas Instruments TI-99/4A AlphaSmart Prolog Typesetting German alphabet Word processor Photocopying Brainfuck Computer and video game genres History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Medical prescription Screenplay Punch card Musical Instrument Digital Interface IBM PC keyboard Commodore International One-time pad Blood on the Tracks AltGr key Keyboard instrument Mouse (computing) Acorn Computers Downing Street memo Musical notation Roswell UFO incident Bringing It All Back Home British Locomotive and Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification The Shining (film) Manuscript Apple Macintosh TRS-80 Letter Atari ST

how do i make my computer work again okay computer geniuses everywhere i have a question for you a couple of days ago when i was innocently checking my emails on my computer the screen turned black all of a sudden and started restarting over and over again on its own so i shut my computer off and planned on restarting it later so maybe it'll work properly then but when i did try restarting it later it wouldn't turn on anymore now my computer is just dead does any of you know what's wrong with it or how i can fix it although i do have access to other computers i'd really like to have my own one working again i would appreciate it sooo much if someone can help me it sounds like your power supply burnt out you can buy a new power supply at a store like fry's electronics or compusa i would recommend at least watt power supply to make sure it will meet your needs you should be able to get a decent one for it is very easy to install yourself open up your computer case unplug all the power wires from the exsisting power supply from your disk drives motherboard fans etc and remove the old power supply put the new power supply in and just reconnect all the same things that you unplugged the other one from  Adobe Photoshop Drawing Drill bit Stereoscopy GIMP Traditional animation PNG Windows Vista Wireless Application Protocol Color Goatse.cx HTTP cookie Photographic film Digital photography Canal lock Casting Screenshot Cathode ray tube ImageMagick Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March JPEG Resident Evil (video game) Opportunity rover Oasis (band) Fire fighting Paleoclimatology Digital image editing St. Peter's Basilica President of the United States Hot air balloon Super Nintendo Entertainment System Technicolor Graphics Piano Carpenters Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Common Unix Printing System Solar cell JPEG 2000 Google Maps Butterfly Super Mario World Bong Wyoming Printed circuit board Refrigerator car Vehicle registration plate Image file formats Cloud Diode Lemmings (computer game) Transformer Photoshopping Lichen IPod Final Fantasy (video game) Ra (board game) Application-specific integrated circuit Amateur telescope making Proxy server MSN Messenger Journey (band) Photography Sulfur Hawaii Wario's Woods Emotions (Mariah Carey song) Resident Evil Code: Veronica Nintendo GameCube Wallpaper group Graphic design Anonymous P2P Nuclear fuel cycle Lunar eclipse Tux Paint Pottery XML California The Strokes PlayStation 3 Mary Cassatt Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast PlayStation Portable Helen Frankenthaler Airbrush Boyz II Men Glass Macromedia Fireworks Crop circle Amman Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Final Fantasy IV Jon Secada HyperCard ASCII art Spirit rover IPhoto Deep Impact (space mission) Coffee

mode or regular first and foremost these are my opinions and have experience several machines that had these on them as well as users using these product not to mention that i have ran each and every one of these myself so as to not confuse those that think that i have not my findings in these products are useless and sometimes scare the normal user also these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the manuals docs for what they download and or buy they just want to install and use stop using the following software avg avg has been known to report false positives also reports tracking cookies as trojan downloaders this is bad practice to me scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news anymore is about trojans worms and virus' maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine most if not all of your experts will tell you to leave this alone avoid it like the plaque ad aware se ad aware is a dangerous program if you do not know how to set it up although it comes with the basic 'normal' user settings those that go messing about will find after changing the settings will remove things from the windows system and then be stuck in a bad situation spybot search and destroy same as ad aware se ewido made by avg now although avg grisoft bought them out or merged which ever you avgt fanatics prefer this product does the same as their software av and scares the user see above avg mcafee system hog although this product is and has been around for decades it still isn't that great of a product as it eats up resources like a hungry dog housecalls not a bad product but installs while online and no option s to uninstall it trendmicro not a bad product but installs while online and no option s to uninstall it panda not a bad product but installs while online and no option s to uninstall it norton system hog although this product is and has been around for decades it still isn't that great of a product as it eats up resources like a hungry dog also this product has to use it's own uninstaller to get rid of it even if you take it out of add remove and reboot your system this pain in the arse software prompts the user to reinstall or it auto does it etrust now owned by ca ms used to ship this with it's feb security update cd set i know i have it and what a load of rubbish kaspersky maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine most if not all of your experts will tell you to leave this

is it quite easy to take an image from a picture and remove the background i have nero and a few others basically you have to use an image editing program tool to outline the image you want to keep and save it to a separate file the outlining procedure is fairly easy but somewhat tedious then you can paste it onto another image background into another picture or onto a blank background what you need to do after this pasting is to soften the edges to reduce the sharp outline i use an old program designed for windows still works in xp for this but unfortunately it's no longer available  Computer keyboard Keyboard layout Modifier key Screenshot Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Diacritic Windows 2000 WordStar Common User Access WordPerfect Microsoft Blue screen of death Control key IBM PC keyboard Amiga Unicode Control-Alt-Delete History of the graphical user interface Windows Vista Opera (web browser) Windows XP Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Common Unix Printing System Option key AltGr key Object Desktop IMac Emacs Personal computer Dash Dvorak Simplified Keyboard AmigaOS Apple Computer Desktop environment IBM PC compatible Taskbar X Window System Computer Brainfuck Esperanto orthography PostScript Mac OS X Synthesizer Pretty Good Privacy Monkey Island Internet Relay Chat BlackBerry Control character Hello world program Vim (text editor) Oscilloscope Visual Basic Multiple document interface Stardock Dance Dance Revolution Windows CE Apostrophe (mark) Icon (computing) Windows 95 Keyboard technology Extended ASCII Computer terminal Konfabulator Linux Apple typography Perl Computer and video games Windows Server 2003 Question mark Windows Mobile History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Software engineering Computing minimalism Pocket PC Computer virus Password Desktop computer Information Technology Infrastructure Library Forth programming language Crossword Commodore 64 Microsoft Word Apple Macintosh Floppy disk Laptop Control Panel (Windows) HTML element Portable Document Format Xerox Alto Jodi Cheating in Counter-Strike System 7 (Macintosh) Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Beatmania IIDX Embedded system Danger Hiptop The Cure

why does the bottom of a laptop get hot laptops are compact models of the same machines that we use for our desktops they have the same types of parts but many of them are smaller and laptops have no room for cooling ducts and fans like those in a desktop that combined means the heat will build up and since the bottom of your laptop is where most of the components including the motherboard are located and that it is where the heat tries to escape if you place your hand on the side of a desktop computer the side all the connectors are on usually looking at the front it will be the right side you will feel some heat and also if you place your hand on top where the power supply is if the system is built well and has good ventilation it may not be too bad but this will show you how all computers generate some heat laptops are just notoriously worse you can purchase laptop coolers that sit under the laptop and have fans to help cool the laptop from several vendors like tiger direct or newegg  Windows XP Windows Server 2003 RS-232 AppleTalk System/36 Novell NetWare Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth Apple Macintosh Wi-Fi Embedded system Personal computer Microsoft Windows Secure Digital card IPod Ethernet Computer printer IMac System/34 FireWire IBM PC compatible USB flash drive Network address translation Mac OS X Mach kernel Server Computer bus Knoppix AirPort Booting History of Microsoft Windows MDAC Mouse (computing) Integrated Services Digital Network Floppy disk Windows 2000 Apple II family Btrieve Atari 8-bit family PostScript IBM PC AmigaOS Desktop computer Apple Computer Computer Control character Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Hello world program Konica Minolta Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Screenshot Federal Standard 1037C PowerPC ZX Spectrum Digital photography Digital camera Xerox Star Domain Name System Hard disk Musical Instrument Digital Interface Commodore 64 Xerox Alto Timeline of computing 1990-forward Streaming media Spring operating system Silicon Graphics VMware Dot matrix printer Xbox Central processing unit PlayStation 3 Local area network HomePNA Pocket PC Laptop PDP-11 Denial-of-service attack Telephone exchange MIPS architecture X Window System Modem Commodore International Control Panel (Windows) Teleprinter Microsoft Digital rights management PHP Sinclair ZX81 Oscilloscope

how do i find the advanced tagging feature in windows media player windows media player has an advanced tagging feature so you can change information settings for each track i know for certain it is there because by accident i found it when i right clicked on files in the wmp screen but i have lost it again it doesn't seem to appear when you right click on files that you are editing within wmp so where has advanced tagging gone one thing that pisses me off about wmp is that you can only get to that if you right click a file in your library rather than the now playing list you can right click a song in your now playing list and click find in library and then right click that song again when the computer finds it in your library and the tag editor will be there  Macromedia Flash Streaming media Warez Spyware IPod ITunes MSN Messenger PlayStation Portable Machinima Uploading and downloading Pixar Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Three Stooges Star Trek, other storylines QuickTime Internet Gnutella Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Teaser trailer DVD World Wide Web Online music store Digital rights management Microsoft Windows Theora OpenOffice.org Alex Jones (journalist) Wget Java programming language Filmmaking The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy MuggleNet Patch (computing) Mozilla Firefox BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Web crawler Chess File Transfer Protocol Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Film MIRC Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Website Gmail Computer and video games Trailer (movie) IPhoto Nine Inch Nails Contemporary culture of South Korea Canon (fiction) Netscape Navigator Multimedia Messaging System Apache HTTP Server Orson Welles The Star Wars Holiday Special StarOffice Anime music video Weezer America Online HTTP cookie Smooth Criminal XviD Rob Zombie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Disk magazine CNET Doom (film) Doctor Who Podcasting Oxford English Dictionary Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Non-linear editing system Silent Hill Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Internet Movie Database Doctor Who missing episodes ITunes Music Store HyperText Transfer Protocol MP3 The Art of Computer Programming Gorillaz Dragnet (drama) Mandriva Linux Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Spoiler (media) Nintendo DS Web server Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Spread Firefox FFmpeg Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter Copyright infringement Reefer Madness Unix Computer virus Opera (web browser) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)

ok so im starting college next month and i wanna i wanna buy a laptop but i dont know what kind to get which brand is better and doesnt mess up easily is there a specific kind that you use for college i was thinking about buying me an apple laptop please help thanx first ask yourself these questions am i really going to use this laptop in class do i really need this to study in the library common room etc will i really carry this thing with me into every class i have if you answered no for any of them i would recommend just getting a desktop what's the point of bringing a laptop to lecture when you're just going to im your friends and not bother taking notes or even pay attention to your professor the less distractions the better but if you really want a laptop then i would recommend one that is portable and lightweight if you are thinking about buying a mac i would highly recommend a macbook because they are light and their battery life isn't too bad if you decide not to multi task too much while the macbook pros are sleeker and have more processing power i don't think normal college students would need it besides it's a big wider and more cumbersome to carry around in my opinion anyways if you buy a mac now you can get a rebate for back so you can treat yourself to a new ipod for pcs there are the panasonic toughbooks they have slimmer versions and they're made to sustain some damage like dropping it on the floor the dell inspiron is affordable but the xps m looks way better but i don't recommend dell because their customer service is horrible and a few of my friends' dell laptops have stopped working by their junior years there is also the tablet laptops which are quite handy if you need them depends on your major it helped when i took organic chemistry but it would also be helpful if you're an art major or if you like to write your notes rather than type them for tablets i would recommend an ibm lenovo thinkpad x series tablet they're sturdy and reliable overall whichever laptop you choose remember to splurge on an extended warranty trust me you'll need it  Hard disk Uninterruptible power supply Computer forensics ITunes Music Store Team Fortress Classic 2003 North America blackout Copyleft Universal Serial Bus Floppy disk Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Computer insecurity Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Personal computer Laptop Unicode Atari 8-bit family Windows XP Space disaster Carburetor Vacuum tube SL-1 Combine (Half-Life 2) D-subminiature MAME Cheating in Counter-Strike CPU cooling Shadow the Hedgehog Turbocharger File Allocation Table Federal Standard 1037C Data recovery Embedded system Shutdown Nuclear reactor Steam (content delivery) File system G-Man (Half-Life) Protoss Year 2000 problem Frame rate Malware Counter-Strike Crash (computing) Trusted computing Bird migration C programming language File Transfer Protocol Hybrid vehicle Public domain Sub-Zero One-time pad Blue screen of death CANDU reactor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Password cracking Computer Power outage Windows 2000 Starsiege: Tribes Virtual memory File sharing PaX PlayStation Portable Computer security Bene Gesserit Digital photography Surveillance Napster Apple Computer Pump It Up Gmail IBM Computer storage Nuclear power CPU cache Fecal incontinence Arguments for and against drug prohibition System/34 Prostate cancer Classified information Microsoft Windows Space Shuttle program Peer-to-peer SCO-Linux controversies Gradius Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Hybrid Synergy Drive Game programmer Southeastern Anatolia Project Laserdisc Seismic retrofit Cryptography Macintosh Finder Sierra Entertainment Manual transmission Mac OS X

useless and sometimes scare the normal user also these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the manuals docs for what they download and or buy they just want to install and use stop using the following software avg avg has been known to report false positives also reports tracking cookies as trojan downloaders this is bad practice to me scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news anymore is about trojans worms and virus' maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a

can you have the same first part of an email with two different service providers eg if you're called j smith and your email is jsmith hotmail com and you decide to get an email address with say aol then could you have the email address jsmith aol com or is it the case that once a certain form is used on one provider it's no longer available on another provider even though the final part of the address is different btw i'm not talking about transferring your email from one address to the other but rather having both email addresses you can use it as many times as you wish as long as it is with diff service providers so as long as you can find service providers that haven't already had the name being taken you will be fine for eg i have my name on my gmail and also on my yahoo and also on hotmail the diff service provides don't corelate with each other so it is only on their servers that you can't have the same name as then it wouldn't know who it is really meant for  NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series GeForce 256 GeForce FX Radeon X Series GeForce 4 ATI Technologies GeForce 3 GeForce 2 PlayStation 3 GeForce 7 Series GeForce Xbox DDR2 SDRAM Xbox 360 World of Warcraft PlayStation 2 PowerPC 3dfx Voodoo 5 DDR SDRAM Central processing unit Pentium 4 Overclocking Graphics card Nintendo GameCube HyperTransport CPU cache Super Nintendo Entertainment System NForce2 IMac Xeon Counter-Strike World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade PCI Express Graphics processing unit Dynamic random access memory Microprocessor Universal Serial Bus Athlon 64 Doom 3 Pentium D AMD Atari 8-bit family Windows Vista Itanium 2 Front side bus Apple Macintosh 64-bit Rambus Pentium III Nintendo Revolution MIPS architecture NForce PA-RISC family PlayStation Portable Clock rate MOS Technology VIC-II ZX Spectrum Timeline of computing 1990-forward Data General Nova IBM PC Celeron ARM architecture VIA C3 Sinclair ZX81 Binary prefix Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pentium M PowerPC G4 PC Engine Commodore 64 VIA Technologies Bandwidth Digital Visual Interface Commodore 128 Motorola 68000 Bluetooth Vertex and pixel shaders Atari ST Athlon IBM POWER Mac OS X CPU design PC card Apple IIGS Zilog Z80 Nintendo DS INMOS Transputer Random access memory HyperText Transfer Protocol Cell (microprocessor) Windows XP Media Center Edition Pentium

we have one computer connected to cable how do i get my other computer to pick up off that is there a way i thought there was a way to share the connection and allow the other computer to pick up signal from the other computer yes there is there is what the fellow says before internet sharing that is a bit complex for a beginner to set up you need to get a special cable to connect the two they are more expensive than the ordinary ethernet cables called a cross over cable easiest way is to purchase a device called a router big box stores have them on sale all of the time the router will have one line in and cable wired ports out the best deals are usually wireless routers at big box stores you can get a wireless router on sale and turn off the wireless function it will have the wired ports as well the major brands are linksys premium dlink all router brands are ok the router will come with instructions and should have toll free support as well if you need help to set up other help http portforward com your internet provider is not concerned over how many computers you have attached rather how much computer bandwidth or flow you use browsing or email does not take much downloading movies does  Windows 2000 Blue screen of death Internet Relay Chat Emacs Exception handling Common Unix Printing System Virtual memory C programming language Btrieve Mach kernel File Transfer Protocol Booting Master Control Program Computer virus Chmod Spyware Control-Alt-Delete Backup Java programming language Bash COMMAND.COM Commodore DOS Embedded system MDAC System/36 Redundant array of independent disks Mouse (computing) CPU cache Gmail AmigaOS Magic number (programming) Linux Screenshot File system Windows Server 2003 AppleScript Macromedia Flash Debugging Opera (web browser) Macintosh Finder File Allocation Table WordStar HyperCard Apache Ant System/34 Library (computer science) ITunes Architecture of Windows 2000 Trusted computing NTFS junction point Mozilla Firefox NX bit File format Xerox Star Data General Nova Computer security Hello world program SonicStage Anti-virus software Portable Document Format Ethernet Linked list Expert system Malware Job Control Language Filename extension History of the graphical user interface Unix NTFS Plan 9 (operating system) Perl Compiler optimization Missingno.

how to wipe my computer from start up menu hi my mum has just rung me and said her computer wont start up she cant get into the computer at all i no when i had this problem i had to wipe my p c but nothing is coming up to say how we do it its gets to 'windows starting in seconds' and then goes back to the begining basically windows just doesnt start up what does she do to delete everything she cant actually get into the computer as windows doesnt load please help as she is disabled and the p c is her only lifeline she doesnt have any disks either which makes it a bugger we tried hitting f but nothing worked okay this is very easy to do there are ways to recover the files but they would involve having another computer attach cables directly to the hard drive and that would become a mess if you don't need to get the files then go ahead and put in your windows xp cd boot it from the cd you need to go into the bios and then tell it to boot from cd when you boot up the computer it should say 'setup f ' or something similar for more instructions post the computer manufacturer please get to the setup screen then chose 'r' meaning repair install once this is finished pull out the cd and try booting the computer again if it doesn't work you have to do a complete wipe place the cd back in and boot from it then do 'install' instead of repair good luck hope this helps chris  Gnutella Peer-to-peer EMule ITunes File sharing Warez Uniform Resource Locator Spyware Azureus Mozilla Firefox Computer virus Whois Windows XP Wget Macromedia Flash HTTP cookie Podcasting Gmail File-sharing program Web traffic LimeWire Windows Vista Windows 2000 Kademlia Linux distribution Web crawler CPAN Suprnova.org Jon Lech Johansen World Wide Web Web server HyperText Transfer Protocol EDonkey network Uploading and downloading Gnutella2 IPod Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Google Kazaa Common Unix Printing System Linux Vorbis MDAC AOL Instant Messenger PHP Search engine optimization Freenet Btrieve Opera (web browser) Malware Proxy server Mouse (computing) AppleTalk Streaming media PlayStation Portable SubSpace (computer game) Magnet link Representational State Transfer Distributed hash table Internet Cache EDonkey2000 DCPlusPlus Chess Secure Shell Perl Mozilla Application Suite Steam (content delivery) Server HyperCard Stopping e-mail abuse UK Singles Chart Network address translation Forth programming language TikiWiki E-mail E-mail spam File Transfer Protocol Konqueror VideoLAN MIRC Object Desktop We Belong Together Something Awful Forums GunZ The Duel Cheating in Counter-Strike X Window System I2P Emacs Website

picture formats file extensions now i have figured the other things out but now i'm wondering does it matter if i just rename pictures using a picture format so that they show up in the thumbnails if i'm only using the pictures for desktop backgrounds emailing myspace and things like that nothing fancy will they still be usable for those simple things and another thing how do i know which picture format is the one i want any help is very appreciated also neither photoshop nor paint will allow me to open the files so the format can really be changed i just wondered if i will still be able to use the pictures once i rename them with a format even though it really doesn't change the format if you are only using them for simple things i would recommend that you either use bitmap bmp or jpeg or jpg as the others have mentioned changing the suffix will not change the file format it is something you do when you save the file it has the save as name then the save as type the save as type is a pulldown menu and the differing types of formats will depend on the program you are using the most common on the internet would be either jpg or jpeg same format slightly different extension or gif gif is a global image format pretty well does anything you will ever need an image to do and if you were to try and be fancy there are programs that make animations out of gif formats for a desktop background also known as a wallpaper i would recommend bmp or jpg bmp would be for simple designs and patterns like you would see in the ms paint program jpg would be for more detailed photos as for emailing and myspace i would say jpg would be your best bet gif is a little more advanced and i merely mentioned it to help you understand a little more hope this helps if you have any further questions the help section in windows may have a slightly more detailed explanation  Computer and video games Computer hardware Ethernet Digital video recorder Computer bus Password Modem Universal Serial Bus Computer Floppy disk Personal computer Random access memory Nintendo Revolution Sound card Digital photography Commodore International Internet Motion capture Sound recording Quake Internet service provider FireWire Computer network Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Telegraphy Bluetooth IPod Broadband Internet access DVD SCSI PlayStation 2 Graphics card RS-232 Game show Dynamic random access memory Coaxial cable Sega Dreamcast Videoconferencing Surveillance Wargaming Desktop computer Local area network Computer terminal TiVo Apple Computer S-Video Atari 8-bit family IBM PC Pirate decryption Randomness High-definition television Film Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Public domain Amiga Secure Digital card Minimum spanning tree Lag Chess variant HomePNA Cable television Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Civilization III PlayStation 3 D-subminiature Federal Standard 1037C Fischer Random Chess Board game Serial communications Television Read-only memory Digital video It's a Wonderful Life Multiplayer Screenshot AirPort Trusted computing One-hit wonder Card game Distributed computing The Walt Disney Company Copy protection Galactic Civilizations IBM PC compatible Pump It Up Wireless LAN Wi-Fi OSI model ITunes Memory Stick Scalable Link Interface Digital camera Neil Young All your base are belong to us Digital television TRS-80 Color Computer

why does my cpu run so high when i use the internet especially on yahoo q a it fluctuates from to on average it stays at its getting annoy how i can i get ride of this i've scanned my computer several times it says nothing is on it the most likely cause for this is if your computer is infected with spyware spyware typically does things like watch all of your keystrokes and send them to someone's server or it might replace ads on web pages with ones for their own products unlike viruses spyware often slips through virus checkers companies that make spyware eventually get their servers shut down or blocked and when this happens the badly written spyware applications spend heaps of cpu time constantly trying to phone home applications like spyware blaster and spyware blocker prevent spyware from being installed on your machine but once you've got one they can be difficult to get rid of a good test is to run the freeware program hijackthis hijackthis will scan your internet explorer registry settings and show everything that is currently installed most of what you see should look familiar i e internet messenger adobe plugins google taskbar etc but if you see unidentifiable ip addresses i e number sequences that look like then that's often a good indication of an infection if you're feeling very adventurous you can use hijackthis to remove these things but i wouldn't recommend doing so without the help of someone who knows a bit more about it you can break explorer altogether if you're not careful best advice is to take the machine to a local computer store for servicing good luck  Witchcraft Troll Magic (paranormal) Elf Norse mythology The Hobbit Races in the Warcraft universe Satan Discworld gods Aleister Crowley Internet troll Neopaganism RuneScape quests Wicca Demon Devil Celtic polytheism Orc Alaga__sia Christian views on witchcraft Dark elf Supernatural Incarnations of Immortality Witch-hunt Tamriel Viking Satanism Druid Locations in the Warcraft Universe Narnia Angel Henry VIII of England Middle-earth RuneScape locations Shannara creatures The 10th Kingdom Final Fantasy IV Hogwarts Slashdot trolling phenomena The Death Gate Cycle Illuga saga Gr____arf__stra European witchcraft The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Minor Discworld concepts Fiend (Dungeons & Dragons) Witch trial Unicorn Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Goddess Malleus Maleficarum Exorcism Satanic ritual abuse Origin belief Greyhawk Vampire Vow Wizard Hell The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Beowulf Bigfoot Necromancy Mary, the mother of Jesus Warhammer Fantasy Battle Harry Potter Fire Emblem Ayya Vaikundar Picts Curse Amulet Characters of The Sandman Goatse.cx Norse dwarves Isis John the Baptist Odin Hecate Conan the Destroyer Anglo-Saxon literature Book of Esther Elric of Melnibon__ RuneScape gods Elizabeth I of England Pentagram Deity Pok__mon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Merit Minor Discworld characters Salem witch trials

picture formats okay so now how do you change the format of a picture you already have saved into your pictures without downloading any converters or anything when i try opening it in an image program it just says things like cannot be found so i can't open it and save it under a new format i even tried photoshop and will it matter if i just rename it with a different format if i'm only using the picture for desktop backgrounds emailing myspace and the such if you're running windows xp you should have an application called paint it's usually under start all programs accessories paint if you open the image in paint you can change it to any of the following formats bmp jpg jpeg tif tiff png or gif other than that you'll probably have to look into using another piece of software don't just rename the file as was suggested by the previous post you may render the file unreadable if you're on a mac there should be an application like paint but i wouldn't know what it is if you're looking for the best picture converting software use photoshop or photoshop elements available for both mac and pc once you use it you'll never want to use anything else to modify pictures again good luck  Windows XP Malware Stopping e-mail abuse Kazaa Computer virus Windows 2000 Gmail AOL Instant Messenger Central processing unit Microsoft Windows Denial-of-service attack Adware History of Microsoft Windows Domain Name System Rootkit Internet Explorer Peer-to-peer PaX Opera (web browser) RISC Trojan horse (computing) Compiler optimization Buffer overflow Internet security Voice over IP MDAC Pretty Good Privacy Macromedia Flash Proxy server NeXT Computer Surveillance Linux Trusted computing Computer surveillance NX bit Musical Instrument Digital Interface Perl Mozilla Firefox Instant messaging Mach kernel Website Virtual memory Apple Macintosh Computer security Internet fraud Cache Portable Document Format Embedded system Fritz-chip Component Object Model Host file X Window System NPAPI IBM PC compatible Windows Server 2003 Web browser PeerGuardian Justin Frankel File sharing 64-bit Linked list CDC 6600 Thread (computer science) Password Common Unix Printing System Windows registry Computer forensics Netscape Communications Corporation CPU design Java programming language Novell NetWare Transmission Control Protocol Google Client-server E-mail IP address Sinclair ZX81 Trademark Microsoft Redundant array of independent disks Software cracking Bluetooth Firewall (networking) PNG

computers what is the difference between application testing and acceptance testing nah it just means this is a homework question as i've always understood it as a developer application testing is where you run it through the paces and make sure it doesn't crash and doesn't damage anything and does what it attempts to do acceptance testing is when a client outside the company or perhaps inside the company tests it to certify that it actually is what they asked for this may include application testing for robustness example client asks for program to connect to a server and download data and display it on screen in a certain way application testing is running it through its paces see how it behaves when the internet connection is lost for instance or this or that happens make sure it works under various scenarios acceptance testing may include that but also is part of the certification process to make sure that the client is getting what they thought they were getting and paying for undoubtedly they want to make sure it doesn't crash etc but at a minimum they want to make sure it does what they asked for that it's acceptable and meets their specifications  Optical character recognition Enterprise content management Portable Document Format Automatic number plate recognition Ebook Document management system Gmail Computer virus Captcha Astrophysics Data System Paper Greek language GNU Free Documentation License Uniform Resource Locator Digital photography Web crawler HTML Comment Warez Emacs Optical mark recognition Spell checker Mouse (computing) File format Unicode MDAC Passport Tagged Image File Format Stopping e-mail abuse Distributed Proofreaders Machine vision Laserdisc Word processor Cocoa (API) Killian documents Windows Vista OpenOffice.org Digital video Domain Name System Wiki Ada programming language Wikipedia Search engine optimization Goatse.cx Sudoku Software testing Unix C plus plus Internet pornography Revision control Eiffel programming language E-mail spam Freenet Project Gutenberg United States Constitution PNG Natural language processing Jacob Neusner Handwriting recognition Object-oriented programming Digital circuit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Podcasting Bluebook REBOL High-definition television Translation memory Amazon.com Proxy server Computer security Comics OpenDocument Fagan inspection Blog UTF-8 Geographic information system Chu nom Melissa worm Google Website ZX Spectrum XML Encyclop__dia Britannica WYSIWYG Mac OS X 2D computer graphics Image scanner Pages Macromedia Flash Hyderabad, India False positive OpenDoc Open Directory Project Magnetic ink character recognition Everything2 Interlace Qt (toolkit) LaTeX

replacing my mouse for photoshop i have been doing alot of experimenting with photoshop and the one thing that i have had the most trouble with on any project is when it comes time to draw something freehand with the mouse someone once told me that there is something available that is similar to using a pen on a flat surface that would give me more control in drawing more precisely and i was wondering if anyone could tell me what this product is called so that i could order it and try it out also would i have to disconnect my mouse each time i wanted to use this or is there a way that i could use both and simply switch back and forth as needed wacom tablet they're amazing i have a wacom intruos tablet it comes with a pen and a mouse but it plugs into the usb drive so you can use the pen and your regular mouse without having to unplug either mine was but it was so worth it they take some getting used to but once you get the hang of it you have so much freedom for computer art d i loves my tablet cuddles it  Computer virus Spyware Anti-virus software Windows XP Filename extension Trojan horse (computing) Malware AOL Instant Messenger Stopping e-mail abuse MSN Messenger Computer security Gmail Kazaa Rootkit Common Unix Printing System Internet Explorer Microsoft Windows Wget Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Skype HTTP cookie E-mail spam Warez Ebook Representational State Transfer Website Opera (web browser) Trusted computing Mydoom HTML element BitTorrent Common criticisms of Microsoft Portable Document Format OS/2 Emacs Melissa worm Norton AntiVirus Wiki Adware Hotmail Apache HTTP Server Microsoft AntiSpyware Web browser Jabber Linux MAME Internet File sharing Spybot - Search & Destroy Windows Vista Internet Relay Chat Macromedia Flash Peer-to-peer Miranda IM File Transfer Protocol Cross site scripting Spam (electronic) Blue screen of death Java programming language Instant messaging Freeware Trillian (instant messenger) Streaming media World Wide Web Web crawler Batting average USB flash drive HyperCard Free software E-mail ITunes Konqueror Lotus Notes File format Secure Shell EDonkey network Google Desktop ZX Spectrum Gnutella Bluetooth Pretty Good Privacy Stardock Unicode OpenDocument Browser wars Charles Ives Python programming language Mac OS X v10.4 Host file MS-DOS XHTML IPod Web server

where can i get an external graphic card external video cards wound't work very well the whole reason behind having a video card is taking all the video processing off the cpu and having all the calculations done by themselves on a gpu graphics processing unit the reason you don't see any usb or firewire video cards is despite the speed of the connections it would still tax the cpu and it's bus down so much sending information back and forth from that external port  Mac OS X Apple Macintosh Apple Computer QuickTime Microsoft Office Mac OS X v10.4 System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Windows WordPerfect Stardock Wine (software) MAME Linux IPod Windows XP ITunes History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS Windows Vista ITunes Music Store Macintosh Finder OpenOffice.org Mac OS X v10.3 IBM PC compatible Halo: Combat Evolved Mac OS 9 Konfabulator Macromedia Flash Sherlock (software) Mozilla Firefox Timeline of computing 1990-forward Radeon Spyware Digital audio workstation Internet Explorer for Mac Steam (content delivery) Windows 3.x MSN Messenger Perl Microsoft Microsoft .NET Windows registry X Window System Digital rights management FreeBSD Marathon (computer game) Online music store Mouse (computing) OpenGL WebObjects LimeWire Leopard AOL Instant Messenger Computer virus Wintel PHP Commodore 64 Minesweeper (computer game) Linux distribution Apple II family RollerCoaster Tycoon IMac PowerPC Kazaa Mac OS X v10.2 Operating system OpenStep Pretty Good Privacy Wget Copy protection Computer and video games AppleScript Unicode Vorbis The Sims 2 History of the graphical user interface Taikyoku shogi History of operating systems Xbox Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Netscape Navigator Internet Explorer Adobe Acrobat System 6 Mac OS history Qt (toolkit) LiveCD Prince of Persia TrueType Wipeout (game) RealPlayer Emacs User agent Widget Mac OS X v10.1 Carbon (API) Classic (Mac OS X) ScummVM

is it possible for someone to hack into your phone line through dsl an officer just came and said they had a disconnect from my house but everyone including me was asleep at the time all phones were on receivers but no dialtone minutes later i had a dialtone no an internet connection cannot be 'broken out of' into the phoneline in the correct sense of the meaning however a pc with an old dialup modem connected to the line can be made to dial a telephone number either 'live' or scheduled if the machine has been hacked you also shouldn't rule out the telephones themselves cheap wireless cordless telephones with poor security can easily be eavesdropped on nearby with a fairly standard radio or even phones outside of your house 'tuned in' to the base station in your home which of course also means your phone line as a slimmer possibility it's not impossible for someone to clip a handset to your line outside of the house at the maintenance box and be connected in that sense  Computer bus Xbox NVIDIA IBM PC Accelerated Graphics Port Apple Macintosh Advanced Technology Attachment AMD IMac PowerPC Motherboard Timeline of computing 1990-forward Sound Blaster Celeron Windows XP IBM PC compatible PCI Express Radeon Laptop 3dfx Pentium M Athlon Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Expansion card Universal Serial Bus Amiga Cisco PIX Front side bus Apple II family PlayStation 3 Commodore 64 Pentium D PowerBook 64-bit MicroATX IBM Personal System/2 Serial ATA BIOS HyperTransport Apple IIGS Power Mac G4 Pentium II Xbox 360 ThinkPad Xserve PC card Pentium III Redundant array of independent disks Opteron CPU cache Microprocessor NForce2 Atari 8-bit family Dell Axim PC Engine Windows 2000 A600 Nintendo Revolution Dynamic random access memory Overclocking VESA Local Bus Sega Dreamcast X86 ZX Spectrum EMac Computer hardware Pentium MIPS Magnum Wi-Fi PlayStation 2 Amstrad CPC Pentium Pro Radeon X Series MOS Technology 6502 Intel GeForce FX AmigaOS BBC Micro History of Microsoft Windows DDR2 SDRAM
