will just playing chess anything else help me improve will just playing chess without analyzing reviewing my past games and looking at my mistakes reading up tatics etc just plain playing over and over again will this help me improve because i love playing chess but i don't really feel like studying it just playing for fun it will help you but not a lot because we all tend to reproduce the same patterns and the same type of moves if you don't know for instance that having bishops in an open position is an advantage over knights you will never take advantage of this element even if you play a lot of games because you just don't know the concept when you analyze a game that you played with fritz or a stronger player for instance it enables you to reassess your chess and this helps you to discover the flaws imbedded in your play if you don't like reading books i would recommend chessmaster th edition good luck  Computer chess Chess terminology Chess Chess strategy and tactics Two Knights Defense Ruy Lopez Shogi Fischer Random Chess Kasparov versus The World Chess variant Baroque chess ELO rating system Chess problem Advanced Chess Correspondence chess Game theory Shatranj Paul Morphy Sample chess game Surreal number Backgammon Arimaa Draw (chess) Garry Kasparov Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Bishop (chess) Cannon shogi Slav Defense Go ranks and ratings Howard Staunton Rules of chess Nimzo-Indian Defence Vienna Game Chessmaster Yari shogi Board game Match of the Century Pawn (chess) FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Checkmate Capablanca Chess Giuoco Piano Final Fantasy XI Fran__ois-Andr__ Danican Philidor Tenjiku shogi A Course In Miracles Stalemate Gambit Bishop's Opening Extreme Programming Helpmate Game Check (board game) Deep Blue Antichess Chess piece Peer review The Game of the Century Alekhine's Defence Galactic Civilizations Punctuation (chess) Taikyoku shogi Anatoly Karpov Magnus Carlsen Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tai shogi Monopoly (game) Chess (musical) Computer Go Blindfold chess Rook (chess) Cheating in Counter-Strike Go (board game) Opening book Judkins shogi Vladimir Kramnik Knight (chess) Combinatorial game theory Pin (chess) Chess problem terminology Dai shogi Reversi Maka dai dai shogi JavaScript Petrov's Defence Chu shogi King (chess) Mikhail Tal Grob's Attack Portable Game Notation Aikido Fairy chess piece Minimax SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs

what is the fastest way the checkmate using knights and a king verses a king as has been noted two knights and king can't force checkmate against a lone king oddly enough though in certain positions it is possible for the two knights to force checkmate against king and a single pawn the strategy is to have one of the knights blockade the pawn while the other knight and king gradually force the other king into a corner eventually the king is stalemated in the corner and the knight that has been blockading the pawn rushes to the corner to force checkmate because the pawn is no longer blockaded it will be advancing to its queening square while the second knight moves over to assist checkmate if the pawn queens too soon the strategy fails so it's critical for a knight to blockade the pawn as far away from the queening square as possible this is a complicated subject with an extensive literature  Checkmate Chess terminology Endgame Shogi Chess strategy and tactics Chess Baroque chess Rules of chess Chess opening Kasparov versus The World Knight (chess) Stalemate Sample chess game Algebraic chess notation Cannon shogi Nimzo-Indian Defence Pawn (chess) Check (board game) Chess variant Tai shogi Shatranj Fairy chess piece Computer chess Xiangqi King (chess) Yari shogi Helpmate The Game of the Century Heian dai shogi Chess problem Queen (chess) Judkins shogi Wa shogi Ruy Lopez Microshogi Tenjiku shogi French Defence Descriptive chess notation Chu shogi Dai shogi Minishogi Pin (chess) Bishop (chess) Immortal game Rook (chess) Smothered mate Kyoto shogi Chess piece point value Sicilian Defence King's Gambit Taikyoku shogi Dai dai shogi Chess piece Zillions of Games Arimaa Eight queens puzzle Circe chess Maka dai dai shogi Portable Game Notation Lucena position Draw (chess) Fianchetto Ko shogi Hand shogi Castling Slav Defense Paul Morphy Through the Looking-Glass Endgame study Two Knights Defense Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1997, Game 6 Grimshaw FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Antichess Parcheesi Chessboard Claude Elwood Shannon Janggi Bratislava Castle Solitaire Martian Chess Wars of the Roses The OMAC Project Queen's Gambit Accepted Gambit Fire Emblem Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Final Fantasy IX Computer Go King's Indian Defence Four Knights Game Queen's Gambit Declined Caro-Kann Defence Elizabeth I of England Dog agility Retrograde analysis Naboo

defense against e i am about a rated player most of the time i play the caro cahn but playing the main line bf all the way through seems to give white a nice space advantage can anyone tell me information about the nd line instead and then playing ngf after that if this doesn't seem to be that effective could anyone name a new defense i should learn against e the alekhine seems a little risky the french defense has the big drawback of the light squared bishop the sicilian defense leaves a weak pawn on d most of the time although i have started learning the dragon which at first seemed to be the most reckless defense but it seems to work pretty well i just want another defense besides this though thanks i'd take the french or the sicilian over the caro kann all the time the problem is the caro kann does not give white much of an advantage but it is there because of the nature of the opening you usually don't see the wild complications of the sicilian or the sharp play of the french the caro kann is a very solid opening that means the black position has no structural weaknesses white can exploit that is probably why you like that opening most openings aren't like that you have to give white something so you can get counterplay through the complications and the imbalance of the position you're worried about the light squared bishop in the french most people are but it's not hopeless there are several ways for it to escape black attacks on the queens wing and places a knight on c covered by pawns on b and d if this strong knight is taken after dxc the bishop goes to c and has a wonderful long diagonal the bishop gets to d and b and is exchanged off for whites good bishop black breaks the white centre with c and f so the e pawn can advance if not the bishop can get to e and g so you can't sit back and relax you must counterattack the white centre untill you get play the c bishop may not be very active at first but it's a usefull defender of the e pawn i can't say very much about the weak pawn on d in the sicilian because objectively it is weak this is usually rather difficult to exploit the bishop on e usually defends it and you can always play a to prevent a knight going to b you should look at a concrete variation yourself and you'll see the pawn is not what white is after like i said the french and the sicilian are sharp replies if you play very calmly like you might be used to in the caro kann you'll be overwhelmed i don't really play the alekhine defence but i do know it's a quite solid reply it gives white more space but black has a solid position maybe this suits your style better also the normal e is a very solid reply but you'll never know what white plays next edit i was thinking if this really isn't what you were looking for why not try the pirc defence all the black pieces can get out and are developed pretty quickly you can even vary your setup using either d and e or d and c it's not as sharp as the dragon but still there are some pretty wild variations like the austrian attack ok there are no other standard replies for black besides the scandinavian centre counter this gives a similar centre as the caro kann white gets the pawn on d and black has no pawn on the fifth row and puts some pressure on the halfopen d file if you want to try something totally offbeat look online for ideas of eric schiller or joel benjamin good luck  Sample chess game Slav Defense Baroque chess Fischer Random Chess Chess Cannon shogi Endgame Yari shogi Alekhine's Defence Pawn (chess) Queen's Gambit Declined Xiangqi Judkins shogi FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Pirc Defence Dai shogi Caro-Kann Defence Chu shogi Taikyoku shogi King's Gambit Tenjiku shogi Computer chess Tai shogi Bishop (chess) Chess variant Checkmate Queen's Gambit Accepted King's Indian Defence Dai dai shogi Minishogi Immortal game Heian dai shogi Rugby union positions Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Ko shogi Rules of chess Algebraic chess notation Chess problem terminology Maka dai dai shogi Chess problem Semi-Slav Defense Poker jargon The Game of the Century Wa shogi Arimaa Shatranj Philidor Defence Fast bowling Glossary of American football Gambit Queen's Gambit X3D Fritz Petrov's Defence American football strategy Theory of conduct Chess piece Team Fortress Classic Battle of France Pin (chess) Center Counter Defense Helpmate Kyoto shogi Giuoco Piano Capablanca Chess Baseball Football (soccer) positions Danish Gambit Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Eight queens puzzle Fairy chess piece Descriptive chess notation Backgammon Strap-on dildo Castling Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Contract bridge Professional wrestling throws Stalemate Computer virus Chessboard Grimshaw Gameplay of StarCraft

do you prefer checkers or chess has that changed over your lifespan both games are good chess is obviously a more complex game of people who dismiss checkers as boring do so because they don't know the rules almost nobody understands that in checkers capturing is not optional if you can capture a piece you must do so therefore a big part of the strategy of checkers is to force your opponent to capture in such a way that it weakens his position this is why most people who claim that checkers is too boring end up getting their tails whipped by a good checker playing program they set up this elaborate plan and then see it destroyed because the program forces them to make a capture they'd rather not make and their position falls apart they try to make the move they'd planned on making and can't figure out why the program won't let them do it so both chess and checkers are good strategy games chess is a lot more complex but checkers can get a little tricky as well if one actually plays by the rules i've always preferred chess but both games are fun for different reasons  Draughts Backgammon Computer chess Chess variant Chess strategy and tactics Chess terminology Chess Reversi Chinese checkers Rules of chess Go (board game) Arimaa Fischer Random Chess Board game Xiangqi Zillions of Games Ruy Lopez Sample chess game Baroque chess Draw (chess) Shogi Check (board game) Martian Chess Endgame Richard's Play By Email Server Advanced Chess Chess problem Cannon shogi Solved board games Antichess Game theory Algebraic chess notation Kasparov versus The World Shatranj Yari shogi French Defence Chess piece Chu shogi Maka dai dai shogi Dai dai shogi Blindfold chess Tai shogi World Chess Championship Poker Game Ko shogi Fairy chess piece Tori shogi Deep Blue Game mechanic Paul Morphy Chu-Han contention Judkins shogi Pawn (chess) Taikyoku shogi Tafl games Wa shogi Hand shogi Bitboard Chess problem terminology Nimzo-Indian Defence Dominoes Computer Go Stalemate Abstract strategy Pin (chess) Prisoner's dilemma Rules of Go Go strategy and tactics Checkmate Janggi The Game of the Amazons Ra (board game) Dai shogi Tenjiku shogi Three-dimensional chess Threefold repetition FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Whale shogi Punctuation (chess) Slav Defense Hex (board game) Microshogi Heian dai shogi Garry Kasparov Chessboard Risk (game) Minishogi Circe chess Stratego Correspondence chess Poker jargon Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Aron Nimzowitsch Tic-tac-toe The Game of the Century

what are the different opinions of grandmasters on learning chess openings i'm no grandmaster but reading what they have to say suggests to me that they think learning openings is very important in the opening of a game it is very difficult to think ahead like in the middle game or end game because there is still many different possibilities grandmasters learn openings so that they know each one's advantage and use them appropriately and also be able to defend against the opening of the other player by using its disadvantages since they know the openings by heart they dont need to think and they can use the time saved later in the middle game and end game which cannot be learned like the openings the same thing also goes for chess ai artificial intelligence usually the programmers gives the ai an opening database to work with so that it knows how to properly attack and defend in the early game quickly  Chess strategy and tactics Computer chess Chess Ruy Lopez Chess opening Endgame Chess terminology Fischer Random Chess Xiangqi Kasparov versus The World World Chess Championship Nimzo-Indian Defence Shogi French Defence Arimaa Paul Morphy Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Anatoly Karpov Sample chess game Garry Kasparov Computer Go Tony Miles Immortal game Viktor Korchnoi Viswanathan Anand Volleyball Advanced Chess Two Knights Defense Mikhail Botvinnik Frank Marshall ELO rating system George Koltanowski Aron Nimzowitsch Mikhail Tal Deep Blue Match of the Century Paul Keres Chess prodigy Backgammon Susan Polgar Alexander Alekhine Magnus Carlsen Reversi Maia Chiburdanidze Board game Internet Chess Club Bobby Fischer American football strategy Contract bridge Reuben Fine Pawn (chess) Chess problem Go (board game) Slav Defense Team Fortress Classic Peter Leko Judit Polgar Artificial neural network Artificial intelligence William Lombardy Draw (chess) Correspondence chess Punctuation (chess) Chess tactic Game theory Unreal King's Indian Defence Tiger Woods Vasily Smyslov Arthur Bisguier Data mining Akiba Rubinstein Mikhail Chigorin Hydra (chess) Emil Sutovsky The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Ksawery Tartakower Joseph Henry Blackburne Chu shogi Chess variant Alexander Kotov Samuel Reshevsky Gambit Cannon shogi Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Rules of chess Queen's Gambit Water polo Larry Evans Propaedeutic value of Esperanto The Game of the Century Esperanto as an international language Svetozar Gligori__ Baroque chess Chess (musical) Gata Kamsky Bishop's Opening Game

chess what's the t answer for white to d c i usually play the knight on f but you'd like to have your advices white usually pushes his d pawn with d followed by c for the reasons explained below nf is also a good move but the problem is that black can either take d play d or nf and this could lead to totally different games and totally different pawn structures you should therefore be ready to transpose among others into the english opening or queen's gambit variations d c nf nf c often leads as a transposition into the english opening symmetrical variation with d you know more or less where you go and decide the direction of the game d c d nf c leads to the benoni system and benko system if black plays b with a very though game for both black and white many chess players play d because they like the fight that occurs with the benoni finally it is really up to you to decide what kind of pawn structure you like and what type of game you like to play  French Defence Chess terminology Nimzo-Indian Defence Chess strategy and tactics Endgame Slav Defense Bishop's Opening Chess variant Checkmate Shogi Queen's Gambit Sicilian Defence Queen's Gambit Declined Two Knights Defense Fianchetto Baroque chess King's Gambit Petrov's Defence Fischer Random Chess Computer chess Sample chess game Chess Gambit Kasparov versus The World Immortal game Pawn (chess) Queen's Gambit Accepted Algebraic chess notation Alekhine's Defence Stalemate Chu shogi Caro-Kann Defence Four Knights Game FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Knight (chess) Giuoco Piano Scotch Game Yari shogi Semi-Slav Defense Shatranj Xiangqi Vienna Game Rules of chess Center Counter Defense Tenjiku shogi Dai shogi Pirc Defence Bishop (chess) Cannon shogi Danish Gambit Chess problem Descriptive chess notation Chess piece Judkins shogi Fairy chess piece Frank Marshall Helpmate Dai dai shogi Heian dai shogi Arimaa Pin (chess) Bobby Fischer Magnus Carlsen Capablanca Chess Martian Chess The Game of the Century Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Ko shogi X3D Fritz Taikyoku shogi Endgame study Viswanathan Anand Circe chess Chessboard Portable Game Notation Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1997, Game 6 Wa shogi Queen (chess) Philidor Defence Maka dai dai shogi Grob's Attack Eight queens puzzle Through the Looking-Glass Microshogi World Chess Championship Gr__nfeld Defence Punctuation (chess) Evergreen game Kyoto shogi Evans Gambit Chess opening theory table Match of the Century Retrograde analysis

how do you play yourself in chess i want to be able to practice chess by playing blitz games in my mind blind fold style against myself a problem arizes it is probably not too difficult to learn how to play blindfold chess but the question is how do you play yourself in chess i have problems doing this i guess this is partially due to my style of thinking my move mentality usually goes like this this move doesnt lose me anything and if my opponent doesnt see this nifty tactic i win a piece however this doesnt work toward winning when you play yourself since you know all your tactics does anyone know of any resources or maybe advice that you can give me to help me learn to play myself in chess the skill is worth acquiring if you play in events where adjournments are involved you can use the time you have before the second session and resumption of the game to try out various moves that the opponent might try and how you would reply if they did but you don't have to do that in your head you can move the pieces around on a board you need to develop tactics that win material even if your opponent does see what you are up to then your problem about not being able to surprise yourself disappears your goal must be to win against best play  Chess terminology Chess Chess opening Computer chess Chess problem Chess variant Arimaa Shogi Paul Morphy Rules of chess Backgammon ELO rating system Ruy Lopez Endgame World Chess Championship Go (board game) Joseph Henry Blackburne Blindfold chess Garry Kasparov Xiangqi Go ranks and ratings Kasparov versus The World Check (board game) Game mechanic Reversi Punctuation (chess) Fischer Random Chess Taikyoku shogi Yari shogi Tenjiku shogi Sample chess game FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Cannon shogi Advanced Chess Fran__ois-Andr__ Danican Philidor Maka dai dai shogi Viswanathan Anand Martial art Poker jargon Correspondence chess Dai shogi Betting (poker) Draughts Draw (chess) Anatoly Karpov Board game Immortal game The Game of the Century Judkins shogi Computer Go Stalemate Archon (computer game) Chu shogi Free Internet Chess Server George Koltanowski Viktor Korchnoi Chess problem terminology Tori shogi Algebraic chess notation Computer and video game genres Helpmate Match of the Century English draughts Tournament Harry Nelson Pillsbury Hand shogi Dai dai shogi Magnus Carlsen Scientology beliefs and practices Wa shogi Tai shogi Checkmate Baroque chess Zillions of Games Martian Chess Sheepshead Wheel of Fortune Game Volleyball Whale shogi Mikhail Tal Chaturanga Frank Marshall Samuel Reshevsky You Don't Know Jack Capablanca Chess Dualism (philosophy of mind) Hollywood Squares Antichess Tony Miles Boris Spassky Two Knights Defense Tic-Tac-Dough Bobby Fischer Football (soccer) Heian dai shogi
