xp or vista i have a new computer but i have a older one upstairs and it still has win on it works fine just seems to run slow like real slow even with cable hookup now some say i should waint on getting vista as they need to get the bugs out first or most of them they say xp will be smart for now computer is old so maybe vista wont work on it hp or close to it its old i also heard not sure if its true the up grade for vista has the complete vista on it is this true and what do you all think about xp for now for my old computer thanks for any help points for the best nice post with information on this yes my old computer does have the space to allow xp to run well that i know it was updated like years ago the person who had this computer before me said he used xp but it wasnt legal it couldnt download updates or anything it work well he said but i took it out went ran the old cd that came with it as you know we must update our systems i didnt want any boot leg xp im buying a new cd today ill go with xp would be smart i thank you all if i could give everyone the points i would do so your all a big help im sticking with the first post for the points i have waint for hours it said before i can allow the points thank you everyone ill post more later for more points and help thanks xp or vista humm compatible hardwares or non compatible hardwares simple as that if you have hardwares that are compatible with vista have vista drivers then why not dual boot both and about your old pc well i think u should try xp on it surely put on some more ram and it should work just aok i have p mhz running xp and booting is faster then xp on dell dimension which has dual core ghz don't ask me how d there are other things on the net called thin xp or lite xp those are stripped down version of xp you can manually do that by n lite program but if you want to download readymade ones you should know where to find them it's not available on microsoft website d x edit hi again i think it's time we should all talk about linux these day's as it better then windows and installs on almost every system and driver support for your old pc would be great i tried ubuntu last month and frankly speaking i learn so much more about linux and my laptop i last used linux way back in and it wasn't a preety picture but now i can say it's good if not better you can download ubuntu from their website took me about an hour kbps burn it into cd rw and install was just about mins it boots shutdowns and works faster then windows try it to see it yourself good luck  Linux Windows XP Microsoft Windows Windows Vista IPod Windows 2000 Mac OS X PowerPC OpenGL Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows AmigaOS FreeDOS 64-bit Bluetooth Radeon Hard disk Computer virus DOS DR-DOS ITunes PowerBook USB flash drive Windows Server 2003 Personal computer BIOS Ubuntu Linux Xbox DirectX LiveCD Timeline of computing 1990-forward Blue screen of death PlayStation 3 Mach kernel SUSE Linux System 7 (Macintosh) MS-DOS Microsoft Wi-Fi DragonFly BSD NX bit Operating system Linux kernel Redundant array of independent disks User agent Windows 3.x X Window System Forth programming language WordPerfect Java programming language Wine (software) Virtual memory Atari 8-bit family Laptop Berkeley Software Distribution Upper Memory Area Spyware OS/2 Kernel (computer science) Wintel Online music store Visual Basic Portable Document Format Perl GNOME Microsoft Office Pentium 4 Xbox 360 Microprocessor Apple II family MSN Messenger PaX Mozilla Firefox Atari ST Kazaa Apple Computer TRS-80 Color Computer Steam (content delivery) BASIC programming language Nintendo Revolution File Allocation Table Mouse (computing) Supercomputer CPU cache SAM Coup__ MUMPS Emacs NTFS Sega Dreamcast

where's the radeon x xt gone to i cannot seem to find the radeon x xt video card nowadays on the production line ups of gpu manufacturers it's specs are good mainstream to performance specs has pixel pipelines and has mb bit memory what i've read and seen on several benchmaks and performance ratings on venerated websites gamespot tom's hardware gpureview com etc the x xt performs well it even beats nvidia's gt performance wise did they stop producing this video card in the market what happened in pc magazines the x xt cannot be found for retail distribution if what i've heared and concluded is true did the x series took over the x series well unfortunately yes the did discontinue this model due to the x series i agree with you on the preformance of the x xt but ati has the tendency to make a new model that may not be better but replace an older one just so they can compete with nvidia's continuous products for example just like your situation there was the x that was replaced by the x after some research i found little and no difference one just has vista certified on it the x xt and the x are similar to this if you plan on buying the x xt or x i would recomend you not if you are one of those i need more graphic card power guys then i would recomend the powerful but overpriced nvidia ultra i've been a fan of ati but due to the latest benchmarks i think ati has gone down the ultra is top of the line and does fantastic for gaming and multimedia ati's oponent the hd is still a great card with preformance a little less good than the ultra ati though made a stupid card it uses alot more power than nvidia cards and is louder in conclusion the x xt was a great card but thanks to ati it was scrapped the ultra is a good card for now but it is overpriced the ati hd just sucks for that price cause it not worth it the x is ok if you want a decent card for a good price that will do most of todays applications these results were all based by my cole summers testing corp these cards have been tested by me based of fear need for speed carbon c c ghost recon advanced warfighter adobe cs unlead studios and all runing vista and xp hope this helps comp expert cole summers  3dfx IMac GeForce 2 GeForce Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Counter-Strike PlayStation 3 GeForce 3 OpenGL Graphics card Xbox Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Revolution GeForce 7 Series Xbox 360 Overclocking IBM PC compatible DDR2 SDRAM Doom 3 Vertex and pixel shaders PowerVR Graphics processing unit GeForce 256 AMD Nintendo 64 Scalable Link Interface Nintendo History of Microsoft Windows TurboGrafx 16 Shader Sound Blaster Microsoft ZX Spectrum Digital photography EMac High-definition television Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon VIA Technologies Amiga RISC Computer and video games The Sims 2 S3 Savage Timeline of computing 1990-forward Atari ST Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Computer Game Boy Advance Atari 8-bit family Sega Dreamcast Teletext PlayStation 2 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Commodore 64 CPU cache ThinkPad Hard disk PlayStation Portable Topps First-person shooter Sears Holdings Corporation Sega CD Dawn (demo) NForce Universal Serial Bus Silicon Graphics NForce2 History of computer and video games Benchmark (computing) DVD Computer and video game industry CPU design Modem Game programming Microsoft Windows Pentium 4 The Price Is Right PowerBook G4 Internet fraud Microeconomics Floppy disk M16 (rifle) Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family DirectX TRS-80 Mainframe computer Panavision

hard drive defragment i tried the defragment option of the pc but after i did a defragment and it finished i pressed analyze and it said that it needs a defragment whats the problem if you reboot into safe mode and clear up temporary internet files or any other temporary files and then do a defrag in safe mode it will do it slightly faster as no other services or background apps are running and it will be cleaner and easier to do the defrag then start in normal mode and it should be fine  Windows 2000 Windows XP Defrag Virtual memory FreeDOS File system Redundant array of independent disks System/36 Windows 95 Mach kernel MiniDisc Pump It Up AmigaOS C programming language System/34 Internet Relay Chat Universal Serial Bus Floppy disk Beatmania IIDX Hard disk Mouse (computing) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Microsoft Windows Garbage collection (computer science) Windows registry Carburetor Windows Server 2003 Blue screen of death Ext3 IBM PC compatible Enterprise content management Resident Evil 2 NeXT Atari 8-bit family Linux Booting Norton Utilities Emacs E85 IPod Toyota Prius Windows Vista Dance Dance Revolution Apple IIGS NX bit Drill bit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction GunZ The Duel Computer virus Palm OS USB flash drive Mod (computer gaming) PNG Windows Me REBOL Advance Wars: Dual Strike Anchor Amiga Mac OS 8 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Knoppix Digital circuit Gravity Probe B File Transfer Protocol Mozilla Firefox Thread (computer science) E-mail Motorcycle Embedded system In The Groove (game) Normal distribution Vi Data General Nova RISC Cheating in Counter-Strike Control-Alt-Delete Gameplay of StarCraft ReiserFS ALGOL 68 BZFlag Ethernet Apple II family M16 (rifle) MS-DOS CPU design Common Unix Printing System Novell NetWare Sonic R Windows 3.x VMware Ashton-Tate WordStar Bluetooth Gradius Macromedia Flash Sonic the Hedgehog 2 IBM PC Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Minesweeper (computer game)

what is the best file type for a flash drive fat or fat and whats the difference between the two fat is the file system that was created for use with msdos back in the old days a fat is a more modern variation of fat which was introduced by microsoft in windows release b to address some issues with the way diskspace was allocated to files resulting in disks being full when in realitly they only had of the amount of data stored on them that their capacity allowed to understand this we need to look how the filesystems work fat fat work by reserving part of the disk for the directory structure and file allocation table the directory structure tells the pc where to find the start of the file on the disk while the file allocation table fat tells the pc which blocks are used by the file and tracks how many blocks are in use the basic difference between fat fat is how much of the disk they allocate to the file allocation table fat allocates more diskspace to the allocation table than fat one of the benefits of this is that it can handle bigger disks than fat withouth the need for partitioning this is because there is a limit on fat of gb imposed by the amount of disk allocated to the allocation table the other feature of the fat file system is that the allocation table is a fixed amojunt of disk space irrespective of whether the disk is mb or gb the result of this is that as disk size increases the size of the blocks that data is allocated in must increase because the number of entries in the file allocation table is fixed therefore a gb formatted fat disk will allocate blocks to files in multiples of k this means a k file will occupy k of disk space and k file will occupy k of disk space you can see how you can rapidly allocate diskspace as dead space due to the overheads of the file system as fat allots more disk space to the allocation table a gb formatted fat disk will allocate blocks to files in smaller multiple making more efficient use of the disk with the overhead of more disk reserved for file allocation tables which suits larger disks better the best way to format your flash drive depends on its size if its less than or equal to mb format fat if its more or than mb format fat formatting smaller drives with fat decreases the overhead of the file allocation tables on the disk and gives you more usable space for files formatting larger drives with fat gives you better use of you disk and the cost of the extra space taken up by the allocation tables becomes insignificant to the size of the disk  Redundant array of independent disks Comparison of file systems Windows 2000 Virtual memory CPU cache Hard disk HFS Plus Linked list Library (computer science) Files-11 Hash table C programming language AmigaOS Hierarchical File System Page table DragonFly BSD Windows XP Apple II family Digital photography USB flash drive Flash memory Forth programming language Compact disc File format DVD Binary prefix Btrieve Compiler optimization System/36 ReiserFS IPod System/34 PNG Defragmentation Computer Mach kernel Atari 8-bit family Fragmentation Spring operating system Computer file Disk image XML Computer virus Disk cloning Filename extension RISC Master Control Program Disk formatting Commodore DOS PaX Amiga Old File System Paging CPU design Amiga Password RSTS/E MDAC NX bit Computer storage ZIP (file format) Cache Stream processing Novell NetWare DOS History of Microsoft Windows Backup MS-DOS Linux ITunes ALGOL 68 Embedded system Reference (computer science) BitTorrent Explosive material EIA-708 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus MP3 Pretty Good Privacy Database management system Metadata Symbolic link Microsoft Windows

what is the point of formating a storage device if i was to get a gb micro sd card should i format it to fat or fat what is the difference why do you need to even format disk drives what does it do most memory cards come pre formatted anymore fat is the way to go though it actually stands for file allocation table it's like the index of a book it tells the computer camera or whatever how and where to place files and their information it also includes the information such as name and size fat is for bit systems and fat is for bit systems which is what anything that's within the past years can read if you get the memory card for a specific device you can use it to format the card and it will chose the correct version  File Allocation Table Flash memory File system Compact disc USB mass storage device class Floppy disk Memory Stick Computer Virtual memory NTFS Atari ST Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Read-only memory C programming language USB flash drive Computer storage Disk image PlayStation 2 CPU cache Binary prefix Windows Vista Files-11 Memory card Secure Digital card AmigaOS Partition (computing) TRS-80 SmartMedia System/36 Atari 8-bit family Windows 3.x IBM 1620 Punch card System/34 Btrieve DVD Personal computer Enterprise content management IBM PC Data recovery Hard disk Apple II family Hierarchical File System Memory (computers) Linked list Windows XP PlayStation Portable Creative Zen Portable Document Format Database PDP-11 Pixel Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus IPod Computer forensics CPU design X86 assembly language System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Server 2003 Magic number (programming) Federal Standard 1037C MiniDisc ZX Spectrum IBM 700/7000 series IBM 1130 Disk cloning Computer hardware Computer bus Macromedia Flash PlayStation 3 Storage area network Random access memory Page table Magnetic tape Nintendo 64 Sony Advanced Technology Attachment Sharp Zaurus HFS Plus Apple IIGS Metadata Data remanence Digital audio player IBM 7090 Digital camera Nintendo GameCube ITunes SCSI BBC Micro Amstrad CPC

does the x xt consume a lot more power than the x pro cause i am wondering which one i should buy hi and thankyou for the replies just felt i should add that my psu is a q tec watt but i have heard that its power is less than watt though my system specs aren't exactly huge athlon gb ram gb hd yes it does consume more power direct quote from the tomshardware com july roundup of gaming video cards the x pro is similar to the x gt the main difference being that it is not based on the x xt but a whole new and less power hungry core the card's main competition is the gs which the x pro will beat in most benchmarks at stock speeds if you have a good power supply go for the x xt there's only like a difference between the two and the x xt blows away everything around the price point if you've got a weak power supply like a dell w go with the x pro or upgrade the psu  Radeon Overclocking ATI Technologies Pentium 4 CPU cache Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible AMD Cyrix PlayStation Portable Personal computer PlayStation 3 Atari ST Front side bus NVIDIA Athlon Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 2 Windows XP PC motherboard Laptop Nintendo Revolution GeForce 4 Timeline of computing 1990-forward ATX Nintendo GameCube PC Engine Athlon 64 Zerg Sound Blaster Power Macintosh G3 GeForce 6 Series Apple II family Acorn Electron 3dfx Atari 8-bit family Amiga Mac OS X Best Buy GeForce 2 IMac Microprocessor GunBound Universal Serial Bus Commodore International Pro Tools Capacitor plague PowerPC Monopoly (game) TurboGrafx 16 Transformer Microeconomics Neo-Geo History of Microsoft Windows Supply and demand 64-bit Digital photography New York Giants Natural monopoly Pok__mon Trading Card Game CPU electrical consumption Magic: The Gathering Windows Vista Sega Master System Audiophile ZX Spectrum Power supply VIA Technologies Inflation MSX Transistor IPAQ SGI Octane Economy of the Republic of Ireland Mainframe computer CPU design National Football League Nintendo 64 Nintendo DS VIA C3 StarCraft Game Boy IBM PC Switched-mode power supply Sega CD Sound card Sega Saturn PlanetSide Protoss Gradius Total Annihilation Subwoofer Voice over IP Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microsoft Paintball Terran (StarCraft) The Amazing Race Xeon

will this graphics card work for r vegas and fear i just got a new stystem asus striker extreme core quad q gb ram ocuk psu w i have all new except my old radeon se can i still run fear and rainbow six vegas but just have it on low quality my quad core has been overclocked to only ghz so it should still play shoudldnt it i payed for all the best parts that i didnt have enough cash for a radeon graohics card i might hopefully get a radeon mb card in if i play stalker shadow of chernobyl or fear can i crank the settings for every single thing to maximum without lagging if not can you tell what else i have to do your system is the very definition of bottleneck it doesn't matter how powerful your cpu is when your graphics card can only process frames per second the processor just has to sit around waiting on it before sending more data your overall performance is limited by the slowest link in the chain which is your se i agree at least get a geforce gt if money is tight but if you can afford a top notch a system like that go for a nice radeon x xt or geforce gts the latest gaming video card ratings from tom's hardware  Radeon ATI Technologies GeForce 2 Overclocking GeForce 6 Series GeForce 4 3dfx Radeon X Series NVIDIA Doom 3 GeForce FX Central processing unit IMac GeForce 7 Series PlayStation 3 Graphics card Counter-Strike Apple Macintosh DDR2 SDRAM Graphics processing unit PowerPC CPU design GeForce GeForce 3 Pentium 4 The Sims 2 Cell (microprocessor) GeForce 256 CPU cache Xbox MIPS architecture Atari ST Windows Vista Personal computer Athlon Far Cry Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Microprocessor Poker jargon Voodoo 5 Nintendo GameCube RISC Celeron Apple Computer High-definition television Super Nintendo Entertainment System AMD PC Engine Xbox 360 Mac mini Nintendo Revolution Acorn Electron IBM PC compatible Original Amiga chipset Sega Dreamcast Redundant array of independent disks Atari 8-bit family Opteron PlayStation Portable SIMD Intel iAPX 432 ZX Spectrum Front side bus Windows XP Sprite (computer graphics) First-person shooter Sega Saturn Slot machine NX bit SETI@home Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic VIA C3 ARM architecture Nintendo 64 Game Boy Extreme Programming PC motherboard Atari 2600 TRS-80 Control Data Corporation Texas Instruments TI-99/4A ThinkPad Computer multitasking Commodore 64 History of Microsoft Windows Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mainframe computer Game Boy Advance QuickDraw Virtual memory IEEE 802.11 Neo-Geo Commodore 128

reasons for hardware maintenance new drivers and driver updates must be programmed and distributed to handle new innovations in software for example when mp first came out a driver had to be made to govern how your sound card interpreted the data into a playable music file cleaning the physical inside of a computer removes dust and other particles which can cause shorts in freak circumstances and much more likely cause your computer to overheat dust is a pretty good insulator of heat new innovations in software like mp can for the most part be backwards compatible but as newer parts come out from these competing companies software developers come up with new ways to take advantage of the improvements for example being able to play full length movies on a disc required upgrading to dvd standard the number one cause for advancement though is processing search engines like google get exponentially more efficient as their hardware improves to seek and process websites maintaining your computer files is a key area of maintenance as well you will always first encounter this as a first time user when your desktop becomes cluttered with shortcuts and your start bar explodes to ridiculous sizes at some point you have to see reason and re organise your files folders and shortcuts simply for user egronomics ease of use in lamens terms an issue known as disk fragmentation causes the s and s on your hard disk to be thrown about like a teenager's used clothing when it is written every once in a while you need to run the disk defragmenter so the system can move all the seperate chunks of any one file into a single solid chunk per file and then from there keep the files of the same folders in the same physical space on your drive all of this can dramatically increase how quickly your hard drive can seek data your drive will always fragment itself to a degree each time it writes new data so defragmentation should be done frequently especially after large installations or bulk file additions replacing very old parts will eventually become necessary the reason you dont see many year old computers isnt just because of modern upgrades sometimes it can be attributed to wear and tear dust as i said and heat can over time seriously affect to well being of your computers integrated circuitry and at a point it will eventually break down if left to operate under poor conditions such as being very dusty however if treated well its possible to run a pc for many years my record is years and my replacement pc has been running for nearly now with only one performance upgrade graphics eventually certain upgrades are simply required for a machine to be of any more use to us for example you would not run a machine with windows anymore because it is simply too old to support current versions of software such as windows explorer firefox video games office etc another good reason to upgrade is newer software like windows prove to then be more secure to use less prone to viruses especially when microsoft stopped offering security updates for maintenance isnt always about corprorate conspiracy most of the time there are big advantages to upgrading in years time for example almost all computers will support hd dvd or blu ray by default much in the same way as dvd  PlayStation 2 Knoppix Macintosh Finder X Window System Copy protection Amiga Visual Basic Personal computer Apple II family MS-DOS Windows 3.x Linux kernel MDAC Internet Explorer RISC DragonFly BSD Windows Server 2003 64-bit History of computing hardware (1960s-present) ITunes Windows Me Btrieve MAME Laptop Central processing unit Architecture of Windows 2000 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Amstrad CPC Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) ATI Technologies Perl Musical Instrument Digital Interface Novell NetWare Java programming language Spyware ZX Spectrum Library (computer science) CPU cache PNG Screenshot Gmail PlayStation 3 Radeon IPod Software engineering Universal Serial Bus History of the graphical user interface OpenOffice.org X86 Apple Computer Gramophone record Digital rights management IMac Mac OS Modchip Mac OS X v10.4 Enterprise content management XML Emacs Cheating in Counter-Strike TRS-80 Color Computer

what is the equivalent of intelcore duo e ghz is intelcore duo e ghz faster than pentium iv ghz what is the single core equivalent eg piv ghz of intelcore duo e ghz tnx in terms of processing power the intel core duo e ghz processor will actually handle applications faster than the pentium ghz in that regardless of the fact that the pentium is running at slightly more than double the clock speed it can still only handle processor instruction per clock cycle where the dual core will handle instructions in the same clock cycle also processor speed is not the only consideration of the speed of a system any system is only as fast as it's slowest rated component the pentium is only rated at an mhz front side bus the e dual core is rated at mhz front side bus thus communications through the front side bus will also speed up programs running when communicating with other components installed in your machine  Pentium III Pentium M Central processing unit Xeon Pentium Clock rate PowerPC VIA C3 Celeron CPU cache CPU design RISC Pentium II Front side bus Pentium Pro Cell (microprocessor) Microprocessor Itanium 2 64-bit PR rating Opteron Duron Apple Macintosh Athlon 64 MIPS architecture PowerPC G4 Cyrix Apple Intel transition CDC 6600 Intel 80486 Intel i860 Supercomputer IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series INMOS Transputer Northbridge (computing) Computer architecture PC motherboard Montecito X86 PlayStation 3 IEEE 802.11 PowerBook HyperTransport CPU electrical consumption Xbox 360 3dfx IBM PC AMD K6-III IBM POWER AMD K6-2 IBM PC compatible Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer Radeon AMD K6 Software-defined radio Stream processing Simultaneous multithreading Super Nintendo Entertainment System ARM architecture Magnetic core memory Windows XP Motorola 68000 Data General Nova Zilog Z80 Microprogram Athlon 64 X2 Intel iAPX 432 Symmetric multiprocessing Apollo Guidance Computer RCA 1802 Distributed computing AMD64 Xbox SGI Visual Workstation NX bit ThinkPad AltiVec Cray-1 Computer bus Transmeta Branch predictor Digital circuit X86 assembly language VIA Technologies Mac OS Power Mac G5

how do i get my disc clean up to work propertly i run my disc clean up or times a day even though it does not delate everything it should what stays in disc clean up is compressed old files every time it is checked off and they dont go away why the option is to compress not delete old files which are designated old when they haven't been used in a specified amount of time the object being to save disk space by compressing them these files are just like normal files with the exception of being uncompressed before they are opened those files could be things you don't want deleted run disk clean up as often as you want but you should also run defrag occasionally to maintain performance if one of your desires is to get rid of the temporary internet files there is an option under tools internet options to have them automatically deleted every time you close internet explorer  File system Windows 2000 Virtual memory Computer virus Hard disk Enterprise content management Windows XP Defragmentation PNG Backup Data compression GIF MP3 Fragmentation Macromedia Flash Novell NetWare NTFS System 7 (Macintosh) MiniDisc Mozilla Firefox Library (computer science) Redundant array of independent disks XML Disk image JavaScript Commodore DOS C programming language Disc jockey DVD ITunes ZIP (file format) Java programming language Objective-C Visual Basic Carburetor Super Nintendo Entertainment System Image file formats AmigaOS WAV JPEG Data General Nova Macintosh Finder Freenet Jet engine Knoppix Tar (file format) Microsoft Jet Database Engine MAME System/36 Object Desktop Cache Ext3 File Allocation Table Partition (computing) System/34 Computer security History of Microsoft Windows Gmail MS-DOS Gramophone record Laserdisc Audio data compression Embedded system Federal Standard 1037C Files-11 High-definition television Multics HyperText Transfer Protocol USB flash drive Job Control Language The Sims 2 Spyware Bootable business card Rootkit CPU design Windows registry PlayStation Portable Emacs Movie projector Blue screen of death Pipeline (software) ReiserFS CPU cache Spring operating system Audio level compression Master Control Program Microsoft Windows Compact disc ISO image Mouse (computing) Shred E-mail Ball (mathematics) Tagged Image File Format NTFS junction point Digital rights management PlayStation 3 Concurrent Versions System Wget

how can i permanently delete deleted files my problem started when i tried to put all my music onto itunes but my computer said that i didnt have enough room on the c drive for it to finish i have a storage drive with a lot of space on it and i was trying to put it onto that i tried to free up more space on the c drive deleted unwanted programs temp internet files etc but its still pretty much full theres really nothing else i can find to delete so im thinking maybe theres some things that werent really deleted whenever i see my computer scanning for spy ware viruses etc i see it scanning things like sims which took up a huge amount of space that i thought i deleted so im wondering if anyone knows how to do this or if this isnt even my problem is there another way to fix it lol im not very good with computers so i could defintely be wrong about it yup the storage drive is e sorry and i did all of these things but none of them work haha and i tried to delete the restore points but it hasnt even been saving any because there isnt enough room even though things don't really get deleted when you delete files etc they do not take up disk space becuase they simply get overwritten with any new data so thats not your problem you've already used uninstall now go into windows explorer and look for left over files file folders for programs you uninstalled deleted already then right click on your hard drive icon in my computer and choose the disk clean up option select everything and remove then download ccleaner and use it to clean all your temporary junk files then run disk defragmentor this should get you some more space but you may be coming to the point where you need to install a nd hard drive  Computer virus Windows XP Macintosh Finder File system ITunes Windows 2000 Gmail Floppy disk IPod NTFS Virtual memory Computer security Hard disk Partition (computing) System 7 (Macintosh) Object Desktop Malware USB flash drive Computer storage System/36 Anti-virus software Macromedia Flash Steam (content delivery) Data remanence Plaintext Enterprise content management The Sims 2 Mozilla Firefox ALGOL 68 Mouse (computing) Rootkit Linux Library (computer science) Disk cloning Linked list Computer Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows File Allocation Table Backup File format Trusted computing Microsoft Windows Windows Installer Uploading and downloading Disk formatting Computer forensics Trojan horse (computing) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction System/34 Emacs HyperCard Windows registry Redundant array of independent disks NeXT CPU cache Internet Explorer Files-11 Booting ZX Spectrum Apple Computer Stopping e-mail abuse Video game music NTFS junction point Bluetooth Kazaa Symbolic link Commodore DOS Memory (computers) MDAC Blue screen of death Embedded system Apple II family Page table Early IBM disk storage Knoppix MP3 Java programming language Data recovery Disk image Job Control Language Fragmentation WordStar Atari 8-bit family HP BASIC for OpenVMS Ebook Mac OS X PNG Opera (web browser)

what is this shiny disc thing pic included http farm static flickr com a f f m jpg i see pics of these things all the time in articles that talk about computer processors they're shiny gold and holographic looking about inches in diameter they're always being help by people in a clean room i guess the rectangles have something to do with chips i think they have something to do with the development process those are silicon wafers if you look at bit closer you'll see that they actually contain chips a laser cut them into smaller pieces then a packager robot pick up a small piece and put it on a chip base with all the feet under it then using micro movements it puts in the tiny connections that connects the chip to the individual pins as you can see a wafer is really fixed size not going to get much larger than that they tried larger size but it became too delicate and imperfections started messing it up they grow a silicon crystal and then use a laser to cut a tiny perfect round slice and etch the chips on the entire process is a bit big to go into detail read more about it here http www elume com semiconductor manufacturing htm  Integrated circuit Solar cell Semiconductor fabrication CPU design Drill bit Semiconductor device AMD MEMS RISC Application-specific integrated circuit Semiconductor Microprocessor Central processing unit Field-programmable gate array Holography Transistor MOS Technology 6502 Floppy disk USB flash drive Diamond CPU cache NVIDIA Programmable logic device Gramophone record Light-emitting diode Random access memory MOSFET Silicon Acorn Computers Dynamic random access memory Nintendo GameCube Nanotechnology Carbon nanotube Laser diode Machine vision Opportunity rover Commodore 64 CMOS Photolithography Metalworking Atari ST Radiation hardening Screw Xbox 360 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Compact disc Atari 2600 Nintendo Revolution Mouse (computing) PlayStation 2 Ion implantation Diode PIC microcontroller Liquid crystal display Laser engraving Moore's law Nintendo 64 Cray-2 Glass Laser Sinclair ZX81 Silicon Valley PlayStation 3 Laptop Internal ballistics Sound Blaster Operational amplifier Knife Atari 8-bit family Stepper Very long instruction word Solar panel Betting (poker) Diamond cut Movie projector Texas Instruments Cartridge (firearms) Printed circuit board Motorola 68000 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sapphire Silicon carbide CDC 6600 Embedded system Virtual memory TRS-80 Memory (computers) PowerPC Laserdisc Depth of field Digital photography Sega Saturn Nintendo Entertainment System Modem

for a game that's minumum required mb gpu is i am downloading world of warcraft its minimum mb gpu is and thats exactly what my computer has will the game work all right or should i just upgrade it depends on what the gpu is if it is an integrated gpu it will be sharing memory from you installed ram note most integrated gpu's are not ideal for gaming but in most cases will work on lowest setting but usualy don't work well if your gpu is an add in card then it usually has dedicated ram and will perform much better than an integrated gpu but with only mb or ram for video you will still need to turn down the graphics of the game to a minimum the other thing you need to look at is how old the card is wow requires a graphics card with support for at least directx recommended directex c that means that your looking for something along the lines of a radeon and up or an nvidia geforce mainly something that will suport transform and lighting  ATI Technologies Graphics processing unit Radeon NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series Graphics card Windows Vista PlayStation 3 3dfx GeForce Xbox GeForce 7 Series GeForce FX Doom 3 Radeon X Series Xbox 360 GeForce 256 GeForce 3 GeForce 2 Counter-Strike IMac IBM PC compatible Nintendo Revolution DirectX World of Warcraft Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Far Cry PC Engine The Sims 2 Vertex and pixel shaders Scalable Link Interface Shader Windows XP OpenGL Cg programming language Game programming Stream processing Apple Macintosh Atari 8-bit family ThinkPad Dawn (demo) TurboGrafx 16 PlayStation 2 Windows XP Media Center Edition Atari ST Sega Dreamcast Nintendo GameCube PowerBook G4 Redundant array of independent disks Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sinclair ZX81 Apple IIGS S3 Savage Commodore 64 Game Boy Advance Apple II family H.264/MPEG-4 AVC World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade TRS-80 Color Computer Random access memory ZX Spectrum Commodore 128 Deus Ex: Invisible War Microprocessor First-person shooter Amstrad CPC NForce4 Linux Read-only memory Windows 3.x Color Graphics Adapter Frame rate Mac OS X v10.4 FLOPS Source engine Mac OS X History of video games (Sixth generation era) Original Amiga chipset TRS-80 Mac mini Computer bus Betting (poker) IBook Commodore PET Diablo (computer game) Power Mac G4 Cube BBC Micro Acorn Electron Nintendo 64 Knoppix AmigaOS History of operating systems Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories FIFA Series PlayStation (original)

what is the best software for migrating my old ide drive to a new sata drive i'll be getting a oem hd so no software will come with it it doesn't come with any software because you don't need any sotware besides windows explorer or whatever file manager you are currently using the fastest way to transfer the data is by sonnecting your old hd as a slave secondary hard disk and copy the files from one disk to another another option is by making an image clon of your old hd and then copying it into your new hd however this will require additional software like norton ghost this way will take at least twice as much time as the first option  Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Windows XP Serial ATA Virtual memory Windows 2000 AmigaOS NTFS Apple II family MS-DOS Advanced Technology Attachment Floppy disk File system Computer virus Disk cloning Cache Linux PNG Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows ITunes System 7 (Macintosh) Creative Zen Domain Name System MAME Early IBM disk storage Library (computer science) Enterprise content management File Allocation Table TiVo IPod Computer forensics DVD Copy protection Creative Nomad Xbox Digital video recorder Booting Power Macintosh G3 SCSI Disk image Apple IIGS Digital rights management Digital photography Commodore 64 Disk formatting System/36 GIF Windows 3.x Macintosh Finder Computer hardware Data remanence Warez IBM PC Partition (computing) Oracle database Windows Server 2003 Revision control Btrieve PlayStation 3 Knoppix DOS FreeDOS Blue screen of death USB flash drive Bluetooth Macromedia Flash Microsoft Norton Utilities Stardock Computer bus MSX QuickTime PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Anti-virus software Screenshot Computer Amstrad CPC LiveCD CP/M PlayStation 2 Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Symbian OS Computer storage Computer file PDP-11 BIOS SAS System Trusted computing PlayStation Portable CPU cache Universal Serial Bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Object Desktop

how can i speed up my computer whether im connected to the internet or not it seems to be seriously slow and getting slower sometimes a system message appears saying something like 'there is a script running that may cause your computer to run slow do you wish to abort this script ' i press abort and it still runs s l o w i done all the usual things defrag virus check cleared the cache etc cleared out thee spyware used cc cleaner its a reasonable spec pc ram any ideas here are a couple of things you can do to make your computer faster you may want to print the following instructions first step click on start menu programs startup remove any programs that appear in the startup menu if you are using windows xp then do this close all programs press ctrl alt delete click on processes you'll see a list of programs if you have a program called iexplore exe running then click on it and click on the end task button second step click on start menu run type in msconfig and press enter a new window will appear click on the startup tab you will see a list of programs with checkboxes next to each these programs automatically start every time you turn on your computer chances are that you do not need any of these so you can disable them by removing the check marks uncheck each and then restart your computer third step click on start menu control panel add remove programs remove all unwanted softwares remove all toolbars from your computer as well internet explorer toolbars are convenient to have but they can slow down computers terribly especially if you have more than one toolbar fourth step this is a recommendation for windows xp users only if you use windows or windows or vista skip this click on start menu run type services msc and press enter a new window will appear you'll see a long list of things here if you maximize this window you'll see the list better this is a list of program functions that are activated on your computer if you see the word started appear somewhere it means that particular service is running right now each service is slowing down your computer there are some services which you need for windows to run but of them are completely useless and all they do is slow down the computer so you can disable them to disable a service double click on the service and change startup type to disabled you have these three choices automatic means it will run all the time manual means it will run only when it's needed and disabled means it's not allowed to run at all you can go ahead and disable all the services except the following these should be set to automatic dhcp client internet connection firewall ipsec services plug and play print spooler remote procedure call rpc shell hardware detection system event notification themes windows audio windows management instrumentation these services should be set to manual automatic updates application layer gateway service application management com event system com system application cryptographic services distributed transaction coordinator distributed link tracking client event log imapi cd burning com service logical disk manager logical disk manager administrative services network connections network location awareness office source engine remote access connection manager telephony windows image acquisition wia windows installer if you see a service which is part of your anti virus software do not disable it just leave it alone once this is done you can restart your computer again and you'll probably feel the difference by then fifth step this is only for windows xp users as well download tunexp this software can speed up your computer i use it every time i install windows xp http www softpedia com progdownload dh tunexp download html when you first start the program select the windows folder click on memory file system menu faster shutdown enable click on memory file system menu file allocation size tweak enable click on memory file system menu increase ntfs performance enable if you have very little memory in your computer less than mb of ram then click on memory file system menu accelerate dll unloading enable click on hardware menu speed up windows irq handling enable click on internet menu dns cache increase enable close all programs except tunexp and click on the memory file system menu ultra fast booting rearrange boot files a small progress bar will show up on the screen when is done a black window will pop up just close that window and close tunexp restart the computer and then uninstall tunexp tunexp changes certain settings on your computer to make it run faster after the changes are done you don't need it anymore if your computer is still slow then run msconfig again and go to startup tab and review the list of programs that are running if you unchecked all of the programs yet some of them still have a check mark then the software which has a checkmark next to it is possibly a spyware go to control panel add remove programs and uninstall it if you can't uninstall it there then run your antivirus software and remove infected files from your computer if you have spywares or viruses on your computer then don't be surpirsed that your computer is slow if you are using windows xp you can follow these steps to check if your computer is optimized for best performance press ctrl alt delete click on processes you should see a list of programs here these are the programs that are currently running on your computer on the right side you can see how much memory each program is using usually people have about

what happens when i defragment my computer my brother has told me that once i defragment my computer all my files will be erased is this true that is false you brother is probably thinking of reformatting your hard drive which will certainly erase your data defragmenting your drive will simply pack the files so that they are not spread out over various sections of your drive it makes your hard drive operate more efficiently  Defragmentation File system Windows 2000 Defrag MiniDisc Virtual memory Windows XP File Allocation Table Fragmentation Computer virus Floppy disk Hard disk Data remanence Redundant array of independent disks Computer ReiserFS Flash memory Computer storage USB flash drive FreeDOS IPod Disk formatting C programming language Shred Mach kernel Logo programming language Mod (computer gaming) System/36 Anti-virus software Partition (computing) Ext3 Laptop ALGOL 68 AmigaOS Master Control Program Windows 95 Debugging Macintosh Finder Early IBM disk storage Atari 8-bit family Embedded system Garbage collection (computer science) Amiga Malware Ebook Binary prefix Polymorphism (computer science) Thread (computer science) DOS Xerox Star MP3 CIH virus Logic MAME NeXT Data recovery Disk cloning RT-11 Hybrid Synergy Drive Computer forensics Memory (computers) Ontology (computer science) System/34 Library (computer science) Abstraction (computer science) DVD Lossless data compression Computer file NX bit Megabyte Norton Utilities File format Proxy server History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Novell NetWare Expert system Quantum computer Linked list CDC 6600 File sharing MS-DOS Coleco Adam CP/M Apple II family Plaintext 0 (number) RISC 64-bit Enterprise content management Read-only memory NTFS USB mass storage device class Atari ST Computer hardware Spirit rover Copy protection Digital circuit Cheating in Counter-Strike System 7 (Macintosh)

i have just got a second hand cpu that runs windows profesional but it has really poor resolution it only has colours any ideas on how to fix it have you tried to adjust the display settings for your computer right click on the desktop and go to settings where you see color quality select colors or bit or bit if you see these options if you can't see colors option then the problem is probably that your computer is missing the video driver that's the software for your video card usually this program can be downloaded from the internet for free i would say it takes no more than about minutes to find this software and install it i suggest you take your computer to a repair shop and ask them to fix it for you if they can't find the software on the internet then they should just replace the video card with another one you can get a second hand video card for about and replacing it takes about minutes it shouldn't cost a lot  Windows XP IPod Mac OS X Windows Vista Linux Computer and video games Object Desktop Microsoft Windows AmigaOS TRS-80 Color Computer Atari ST Amstrad CPC Screenshot History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo Entertainment System Apple Computer Commodore 64 Digital photography Personal computer Bluetooth GIF Macromedia Flash Apple IIGS Spyware Computer TRS-80 Commodore 128 Apple Macintosh OpenGL System 7 (Macintosh) IBM PC CPU design Laptop PlayStation 2 Color Graphics Adapter Blue screen of death Redundant array of independent disks Nintendo DS Virtual memory OpenBSD ZX Spectrum Video Graphics Array Palm OS Mouse (computing) 64-bit Microprocessor Google Desktop Steam (content delivery) Embedded system MP3 Common Unix Printing System Knoppix X86 Modem TeX Windows 3.x MDAC IBook Sinclair ZX81 Television Amiga MSN Messenger PC Engine Mozilla Firefox ATI Technologies Central processing unit N-Gage AMD64 Graphical Environment Manager Digital audio workstation Patch (computing) Windows Server 2003 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Radeon History of operating systems Portable Document Format MAME Skype Computer terminal Booting 2D computer graphics High-definition television PostScript Mandriva Linux Unicode

computer problems help my sony vaio desktop just stopped working out of nowwhere i am pretty literate in computers so don't worry about hard words i checked all of the connections and they are all fine whenever i push the power button it doesn't make any attempts to start up none of the fans turn on no beeps no led light my best guess is that the power supply died the computer is years old i was just wondering if anybody could confirm that it is the power supply try running it on the battery try using a different outlet on a different circuit to use house current for ac power if you are using a surge protector make sure it is working properly you can check the power adapter with a volt ohm meter and see if it is giving juice to the machine plug in the adapter to the house power outlet check the outgoing power just after the brick to see if it is putting out any juice it also could be that the cmos battery has died which is easily replaceable  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Laptop Residual-current device IPod CMOS Battery (electricity) Volt Transformer Thermal power station Universal Serial Bus Electricity Floppy disk SCSI Personal computer Circuit design BS 1363 PlayStation Portable Three-phase electric power Toyota Prius Windows XP Embedded system Carburetor Oscilloscope Electricity meter Copy protection Bicycle lighting USB flash drive Computer forensics Atari ST Electrophysiology Apple Macintosh Sega Saturn Electrical generator X Window System Sega Hybrid vehicle Tungsten Handheld Digital circuit IMac Desknote Fuse (electrical) IBM PC compatible Digital photography Ethernet Vacuum tube Mach kernel X10 (industry standard) Poker jargon Electric motor Diode Surveillance Baroque chess Nintendo Entertainment System RFID Commodore 64 Light switch Power strip Spark plug Spark gap Relay Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ohm's law Super Nintendo Entertainment System 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Nintendo DS Wheel of Fortune Transistor Uninterruptible power supply Series and parallel circuits AmigaOS Thermostat Current source Battery electric vehicle Power-On Self Test Computer Pinball Enigma machine Loudspeaker PlayStation 2 The Amazing Race Operational amplifier Circuit breaker PowerBook Voice over IP Solar power Radiation hardening Game controller Blue screen of death Fluorescent lamp Nintendo GameCube Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Overclocking Desktop computer Switch Logic gate

what is raid and is it better to what is raid if i want gb in raid do i need two gb hdds or two gb hdds last question is it better to have hdds or gb hdd i'm not sure which raid config i would be using but if i use raid or raid would i need two gb hdds for raid or two gb hdds if i want gb of raid or would i need two gb hdds or two gb hdds i have room for seven hdds in my tower and it does have decent cooling raid is simply say the work structure of combination of more than hardisk you can make them work together assigning for backup purpose or simply adding more storage space it's just like how you want your hdd to work together there are some type of raid the most common for home user are raid basically adding hdd storage to the other so it means gb gb gb it is the most usual one but it have no backup so if there is some error on drives the data is cannot be retrieved anymore raid making a shadow of drive in this case gb gb gb however if there is an error the data is quite secure because there is always a backup available for you second question again see the explanation above which one do you need most storage space or data safety and reliability if you are a gamer or multimedia type of person a raid is better as it's offer more space but if you are a business user raid is much more reliable for the third question it depends on the space on your computer hdd's mean if one broken you only lost gb but the electricity and temperature inside you computer will certainly make some problem hdd's mean if broken you lost gb but its's more space efficient and possibly prolong the equipment ages so except you have a very good cooling system or leaving in north south pole i recommenc the x one  Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Floppy disk Enterprise content management Virtual memory Computer Expert system Windows XP Embedded system File system Datatype DVD NTFS Modchip Backup File Allocation Table Sharp Zaurus Windows Vista Mainframe computer Pointer CPU design Pebble bed reactor Solar power Database C programming language Unicode Computer science PlayStation Portable Linked list Transmission Control Protocol Computer forensics Thermal power station Password System/36 PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay XML MAME Compiler optimization Data center Reliability engineering Lisp programming language Copy protection Debugging Computer virus Central processing unit Hubble Space Telescope Error correction and detection Multics Files-11 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Compact disc Computer storage Federal Standard 1037C Transformer Apollo Guidance Computer Data recovery Nuclear weapon design Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting MMORPG Bicycle lighting CPU cache Personal rapid transit MDAC Gmail SCSI Power station Classified information Sega Saturn Dynamic random access memory Buffer overflow Amstrad CPC Class (computer science) IBM PC Algorithm Autonomous building Personal computer Oscilloscope USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus MySQL Python programming language Loudspeaker Laptop Domain Name System Spacecraft propulsion Shell (projectile) Page table Perl Password cracking Extreme Programming Data remanence

whats the difference between ram and video card ram i just started playing world of warcraft and when i installed the game it showed a message that said the minimum requirement for ram wasn't met but the game runs fine usually i have every setting on the lowest possible and the game usually runs between fps and fps just depending on what area i'm in ex a city full of people compared to an empty room i was just curious if increasing the amount of ram in my computer would improve performance or if i would have to buy a video card with more ram on it my current one is a geforce fx with mb of ram i think also would i have to switch from my current video card back to the motherboard one if i just increase the computer's ram sorry if this doesn't make much sense but thanks in advance for any help you can give the message you received means that you do not have sufficient system memory your video card should work fine as it meets the minimum requirements for wow you need to check your system specifications sheet for your motherboard to determine what type speed and maximum capacity of memory it supports it wouldn't hurt to know how much you currently have installed and what speed it is then add more memory to reach a minimum total of gig but gig would be better provided your motherboard supports that much what you are looking for on the spec sheet is does your motherboard use sdram ddr ddr speeds like pc pc pc pc etc it might list speeds like mhz mhz or mhz also these are represented by the first three listings i showed of pc above respectively video cards with dedicated memory do not increase the normal system resource memory which you are failing to meet that is entirely different memory for a specific purpose  Radeon DDR2 SDRAM Overclocking Dynamic random access memory NVIDIA Redundant array of independent disks Opteron Pentium 4 PlayStation 3 Apple IIGS Windows 2000 IBM PC ZX Spectrum World of Warcraft Ethernet PowerPC GeForce 6 Series TRS-80 Color Computer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Random access memory Sound Blaster IMac Atari 8-bit family DDR SDRAM Apple II family Commodore 128 Poker jargon Nintendo GameCube Rambus Windows XP Power Macintosh G3 Counter-Strike Super Nintendo Entertainment System Xbox Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBM PC compatible INMOS Transputer Universal Serial Bus MSX Dance Dance Revolution Musical Instrument Digital Interface AMD Betting (poker) Central processing unit Neo-Geo PlayStation 2 Amstrad CPC AmigaOS GeForce 4 VIA Technologies RISC Computer bus Mac OS X Slot machine PlayStation Portable Acorn Electron Celeron PC motherboard History of computer and video games Embedded system System/36 Amiga Commodore 64 Computer CPU design Atari ST Mouse (computing) Cyrix Computer and video games GeForce FX Computer and video game genres Athlon Front side bus In The Groove (game) PC Engine Windows Vista BBC Micro Nintendo Revolution Modchip Graphics processing unit Digital photography Microprocessor Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Cray-1 Blackjack GeForce 256 Magnetic core memory DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Global Positioning System

importance of hardware maintenance as long as the everything inside the cabinet is clean and working properly you don't need to mind about hardware but do take the time in say to months to clean the inside of your pc by a serviced technician or you can do it yourself by reading the hardware service manual that came along with the pc i clean my system every month making it look new from the inside to the outside and i am doing this for the past two and a half years and i have faced no problems whether it be software or hardware  Linux Windows 2000 Nintendo Entertainment System Device driver Cray-1 Redundant array of independent disks Virtual memory Floppy disk Data recovery IBM PC compatible Trusted computing Motorola 68000 Modem X Window System NX bit Computer software Hard disk Screenshot Information Technology Infrastructure Library Embedded system DVD Operating system Software engineering Computer hardware Microsoft Windows CP/M Laserdisc Hardware description language Debugging Windows XP Emulator Atari 8-bit family Page replacement algorithms Compiler optimization Game programming C programming language AmigaOS Mercury Atlas 6 OpenGL Berkeley Software Distribution Server System 7 (Macintosh) BIOS Blue screen of death Architecture of Windows 2000 Buffer overflow Copy protection Kernel (computer science) Software testing Computer virus Mach kernel Software development process Endianness Markup language Reliability engineering Perl Enterprise content management Punch card SCADA NeXT PlayStation 2 Nintendo CPU cache Apple Newton VMware Unix time Computer security Test plan Commodore 64 Sega Saturn Atari ST Technical support Software bug W.

can someone explain the clockspeed of a core duo for me so i just bought a laptop with a core duo merom which runs at speed of ghz but my own pentium prescott runs at something ghz isn't a core duo suppose to be faster than pentium as others have said it is the better architecture that allows it to be faster even at a lower clock speed but let me go ahead and explain a little bit why this is true while clock speed is the most widely known measure of a processors performance it is in reality only one half of the equation the other half being instructions per cycle ipc here is how the two combine together clockspeed tells you how many clock cycles there are per a given amount of time ghz means billion clock cycles per second ghz means billion clock cycles per second etc ipc is how many instructions are actually done on each of those clock cycles the new core duos have much higher ipc than the pentium s meaning they are more powerful you won't ever see actually ipc numbers listed for a processor but think of it this way if a p running at ghz only does instructions per cycle but a core duo running at ghz does which does more work in a given amount of time doing the math would tell you the core wins billion to billion this incidentally is also the same reason amd processors were outperforming intel processors for years even though they had much lower clockspeeds amd focused on ipc while intel focused on clockspeed but now since we have hit a wall on clockspeeds at around ghz intel has started to focus more on ipc as well  Xeon Athlon AMD Celeron CPU design RISC Microprocessor Pentium III CPU cache Central processing unit PR rating Athlon 64 Pentium D Clock rate IA-32 PowerPC Pentium Overclocking NVIDIA X86 AMD64 Cyrix 64-bit MIPS architecture Transmeta Apple Intel transition Moore's law IBM PC compatible Timeline of computing 1990-forward CDC 6600 X86 assembly language Intel i860 Pentium Pro NX bit PowerPC G4 Northbridge (computing) PC motherboard Intel 80486 AMD K6-III Laptop Mach kernel Branch predictor Duron Computer PowerBook PlayStation 3 CPU electrical consumption Pentium II AltiVec Radeon DEC Alpha Intel 3dfx Cray-1 Montecito IA-64 ATI Technologies Intel 80386 IBM POWER Mainframe computer Supercomputer L4 microkernel family Magnetic core memory Symmetric multiprocessing Dual-core Microprogram Computer architecture Simultaneous multithreading IBM PC Wintel GeForce 6 Series Benchmark (computing) VIA Technologies Windows XP Stream processing AMD 5x86 Speed of light Efficeon HyperTransport Data General Nova Motorola 68000 Linux kernel Word (computer science) Sun Microsystems Intel XScale Control Data Corporation Intel i960 Vector processor

i bought a new keyboard it isnt working on my pc but works in my cousin's whats wrong we really need more info for this kind of question but here are some general tips you may need to install the drivers for the key board if the keyboard gives you a choice of connecting with p s round plug usually purple on keyboards or usb i would recommend using usb if you are using the p s make sure you are plugging into the keyboard port and not the mouse port the mouse port is usually green if you're using a usb connection you could always try a different usb port if you are switching from one brand to another logitech from microsoft make sure you uninstall the drivers for the old keyboard start settings control panel add remove programs then find the keyboard software try downloading the most recent driver package from the manufacturer's web site even if you just purchased the keyboard the drivers could be months out of date depending on how long it sat on the store shelves if all that fails you may need to check your bios settings this is a bit more advanced and kind of a shot in the dark  Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) IPod IMac Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation 2 Xbox Secure Digital card PlayStation Portable Apple Macintosh Apple Computer Bluetooth Mozilla Firefox Atari 8-bit family Knoppix Floppy disk MDAC Booting Copy protection Digital photography Danger Hiptop Object Desktop IBM PC Device driver Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Emacs Modchip ZX Spectrum Microsoft Windows Texas Instruments TI-99/4A WordPerfect Sinclair ZX81 AmigaOS Xbox 360 Mac OS X Linux FreeDOS Nintendo ReactOS Mandriva Linux Personal computer Slackware IPod shuffle X Window System Hard disk Architecture of Windows 2000 Synthesizer MAME IBM PC compatible RS-232 Sound card Apple typography History of Microsoft Windows BIOS Control Panel (Windows) Desktop computer Sound Blaster Common Unix Printing System Atari ST Modem Spyware Commodore 64 Laptop Digital audio player Computer bus Stardock Password D-subminiature Computer virus Rootkit Perl File Allocation Table Timeline of computing 1990-forward Blue screen of death Game controller Nintendo 64 Apple Desktop Bus TRS-80 Color Computer Commodore 128 Digital rights management Apple Newton PlayStation 3 Toyota Prius Central processing unit Nintendo DS 64-bit Port (computing) IBook Screenshot Embedded system Opera (web browser)

how important is fast ram speed i have gb of ram on my pc right now clocked at mhz i want quality over quantity here but mhz pc ram is more expensive is it worth it to get the faster one note i cannot get any faster ram than pc or standard ddr you will definitely benefit running the fastest ram you can get if it has a low latency since you are using ddr something good to look for would be pc with a cas latency of if the latency is high like it takes twice as many cycles for the memory to retrieve the data so the extra frequency speed wouldn't do you much good now as far as size most people think they need a ton an average user won't even utilize over kb of memory look at your processes list when using your computer and add up the amount of memory used xp will also alert you if you are out of memory and starting to rely too much on hard disk for memory also called virtual memory make sure your motherboard supports faster memory though another note most computers are choked by the speed of the hard drive cpu's and memory are way faster than a hard drive and have to wait for it to load data into the memory fast hard drives will allow your system to boot in seconds and programs to load extremely quick however if the program is cpu dependent such as recoding video then cpu speed is more important i know i kind of rambled on but i hope this helps you  CPU design Dynamic random access memory Atari 8-bit family Central processing unit RISC Computer architecture Pentium 4 Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Nintendo GameCube Apple Macintosh Virtual memory Computer Microprogram Apple II family TRS-80 Color Computer Atari ST Windows 2000 Commodore 128 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 64 Windows XP Athlon MIPS architecture Random access memory Sinclair ZX81 Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum Advanced Technology Attachment Booting CDC 6600 Opteron IBM PC compatible INMOS Transputer PowerPC Front side bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DDR2 SDRAM PlayStation 3 Celeron Embedded system IBM PC Personal computer DDR SDRAM BBC Micro MOS Technology 6502 Amstrad CPC IMac PlayStation 2 Clock rate Compiler optimization Cray-1 Data General Nova GeForce 6 Series AMD AmigaOS Motorola 68000 NVIDIA Web crawler Super Nintendo Entertainment System SAM Coup__ Power Macintosh G3 Memory (computers) USB flash drive Xbox 360 MSX Computer bus Timeline of computing 1990-forward Radeon Computer multitasking Apollo Guidance Computer System/36 Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Entertainment System Linux Stream processing 64-bit Rambus File system NX bit Forth programming language Supercomputer DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Original Amiga chipset BBC Master HyperTransport Sega Dreamcast Nintendo 64 Windows 3.x Mach kernel Vector processor Computer virus

if i professionally clear my computer out and start over would i get my ram back if i professionally clear my computer out and start over would i get my ram back if so how would i professionally clear my computer out and start over if you want to start over as you put it you would probably want to format your harddrive and reinstall your operating system when you bought your system be it a laptop or desktop usually they'll send with it a reinstall disk you can do this one or two ways st have your computer turned on and just insert the cd into the drive it should pop up automatically click to install the o s at some point it should ask you where you want to install the new o s there should be an option to format the current disk do that then click on that same disk to install the new o s or have the cd in the drive restart the computer and boot from the cd then just follow the same steps since it is a factory cd all the drivers should be installed with the new o s install if not just insert the drivers and utilities cd and install the missing drivers hopefully that helps out  Windows XP Hard disk Windows 2000 AmigaOS Knoppix Laptop Windows Vista Blue screen of death Floppy disk Apple Macintosh Computer virus Booting Linux IPod Windows 3.x File system Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Object Desktop DOS Personal computer Disk cloning Atari ST Mac OS X LiveCD IBook Microsoft Windows IA-32 History of Microsoft Windows Commodore International Embedded system Screenshot Forth programming language System/36 Disk formatting Universal Serial Bus NTFS MS-DOS Virtual memory FreeDOS Malware TRS-80 File Allocation Table Windows Server 2003 CPU design Bluetooth Windows 95 Computer Mouse (computing) Computer hardware System 7 (Macintosh) PlayStation 2 Common Unix Printing System SUSE Linux System/34 NeXT Kaypro Cache Apple Open Collaboration Environment IBM RAM disk Disc jockey Copy protection Amstrad CPC Mandriva Linux Spyware DragonFly BSD Novell NetWare Commodore 64 PDP-11 Puppy Linux Nintendo Entertainment System Commodore PET Computer software Commodore 128 Wi-Fi BIOS NX bit Surveillance Stardock Atari 8-bit family INMOS Transputer Zip drive Acorn Archimedes Computer file IBM PC Page table Apple II family Mozilla Firefox DR-DOS Commodore 1541 Read-only memory 64-bit Apollo Guidance Computer Windows registry

external hard drive a or server question which is better here is the deal i have been downloading lots of torrents lately i have a laptop and use a usb gb external hard drive after that porn o tronic was full i got a gb firewire hd now that is full of music and anime and other crap now i am out of room i want to get more hard drives i know that i can daisy chain them to each other but won't that make them slower my tech i friend suggested i buy a server but that seems a bit over the top i really just want a metal case that houses anywhere from hard drives and i can connect to my laptop via firewire and accecss the information that easily i would like to drop my hd my hd into it and possibly get some extra hd anywhere from tb anyone else done this can you picture what i am asking does this housing project exist are there any better suggestions i am leaving the country soon so i would like the ability to access everything should i get a server and do it remotely or just stack hd what to do i appreciate all of the fast answers from the community i am not interested in burning to dvd i just don't wanna i dont like cd and i hate flimsy ass dvd rom drives they may hold some info but it is poop they are cheap crap and i hate them sorry to go off i guess i really just want a huge housing for hd anyone know of a good one of these thanks i would not recommend a server b c they're too slow noisy take up too much space and power hungry they do have their advantages but i find i can't stand copying files across the network but i don't have a gigbit network if you do then it might be worth the try don't even think about it on wifi for large files like the ones you're talking about you also might not have the performance overhead from when multiple people are accessing the server so performance might be improved for a single user by the way if you're going to build a server you might as well run everything on it since it'll essentially be a under utilized desktop by the way the definition of server i think in your mind is just a junk desktop there are some very effective storage solutions using servers but they really don't make sense for your application they also still don't beat a usb or firewire connection but allows you the ability to put on lots of data i can't imagine you having that much porn and anime or whatever to need that much here are my suggestions deal with multiple externals get stackable ones purchase a external case that houses multiple drives check newegg out purchase an enclosure that allows you to swap drives in and out check newegg out replace your current drives with tb gb or gb drives a gb can be had for around buy two with and put them in your old externals or buy new enclosures for each and you can have a terabyte of storage for definitely a cleaner solution and essentially triples your current capacity i've seen some gb externals selling for around total so it's possible to have the setup for around build a custom enclosure using an old case or whatever and just pile them on and using adapters and hubs to connect to your old computer be creative there are several ways to do this don't have to go to newegg but i'm not going to look at every retailer to find every product for you http www newegg com product product aspx item n e http www newegg com product product aspx item n e http www newegg com product product aspx item n e http www newegg com product product aspx item n e http www newegg com product product aspx item n e http www newegg com product product aspx item n e you can use something like this with a enclosure buy a few of these and you can swap them in out but i don't see how this is any more beneficial than having several externals it's good for desktops b c of performance http www techsunny com generic eide metal cover mobile partinfo id html note some of the above will need adapters to work with your notebook i e esata to pcmcia or whatever  Computer bus

windows xp on a proliant server hi there i want to install windows xp on proliant ml g to use it as a normal pc so is there any performance issue or any issue related for using a desktop os on a server instead of use w server regards the only thing that i can think of is that you may run into driver issues for the hardware although windows xp and windows server are written very closely the may be some issues of drivers for one not working for the other i am especially thinking about motherboard drivers and if you are using any type of raid controller that may come with the system i would do some research on hp's website and see if there are drivers out there for windows xp if not try the w k drivers good luck  Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 X Window System Redundant array of independent disks Architecture of Windows 2000 History of Microsoft Windows Windows XP Server Windows Server 2003 IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Mac OS X Linux ReactOS Personal computer Hard disk AmigaOS ATI Technologies Novell NetWare Kernel (computer science) 64-bit Operating system Common Unix Printing System MDAC Microprocessor Windows Me Blue screen of death Microsoft OS/2 Wintel Sun Microsystems Open Database Connectivity Windows Driver Model SUSE Linux OpenBSD WebObjects Thread (computer science) PowerPC Spring operating system Device driver Windows 3.x OpenGL Cooperative Linux Perl Windows CE Windows NT 4.0 Comparison of file systems Windows NT Free software Booting BIOS Silicon Graphics Supercomputer Common criticisms of Microsoft Windows registry Computer hardware Microsoft SQL Server Apple Macintosh Steam (content delivery) NeXT Computer virus Microsoft Jet Database Engine Novell ZENworks Windows 1.0 Modem Pretty Good Privacy Apple Computer Mach kernel Symbian OS NTFS Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Ultrix Universal Serial Bus Computer software Windows 95 RISC NX bit Extensible Firmware Interface Btrieve Portable Document Format Microsoft Access Object Desktop Windows Update Internet Relay Chat Graphical Environment Manager OpenStep Proxy server Embedded system Screenshot Xerox Star FreeDOS File system DirectX Transmission Control Protocol World of Warcraft Control Panel (Windows) Patch (computing) Mac OS Windows Mobile

can a computer recognize the difference between usb ports if i turn off my computer and switch which port a device is plugged into will the computer get all huffy about it when i turn it back on in most cases it should be fine if you turn the computer off it won't communicate with the device if you put it back into a different drive then it will try finding the device and see it's attached however if it's like an external hard drive you are running programs off of example your drive i or something and you switch it it might get assigned a different name and the computer doesn't always switch it's references so i guess if you pay attention to that you should be ok  Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh Booting Computer hardware Musical Instrument Digital Interface IPod Ethernet Computer forensics Hard disk FireWire Modchip Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Personal computer Laptop Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System Serial ATA Port (computing) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets RS-232 Windows XP Computer bus Secure Digital card Desktop computer AmigaOS Amstrad CPC Windows 2000 IMac Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Digital audio player Advanced Technology Attachment Digital photography ZX Spectrum Central processing unit Architecture of Windows 2000 Dongle Apple IIGS FreeDOS Atari ST Modem DOS USB mass storage device class Computer SCSI Atari 8-bit family Power Macintosh G3 CompactFlash Table tennis IBM PC Common Unix Printing System Acorn Electron Computer storage Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART PC card Mac mini Parallel port System/36 Apple Computer Sound card Apple II family PowerPC PlayStation 2 Mach kernel File system Sinclair ZX81 Screw Xbox Computer virus Acorn Archimedes Commodore 64 Bluetooth ALGOL 68 Electric motor Device driver C programming language Strap-on dildo Apple Newton Enigma machine Atari 2600 Flash memory TIA-568A/B Power Mac G4 Cube Commodore International System/34 Archos BIOS VMware NeXT Memory (computers) Danger Hiptop Programmable logic controller Residual-current device Computer and video games IPod shuffle Xbox 360 Knoppix Microsoft Windows

as an overall high spec processor which is the best choice out of a pentium d or an amd x in my experience it depends on what you want to do in the past i've used both intels and amds and here's some comparisons i won't make any judgment just offer what i've noticed amd chips run a lot hotter than intels intel chips usually have higher clock speeds and bus speeds however amd processors often out perform intel chips despite a lower speed for instance my amd athlon xp ghz outperformed my p ghz this was while the cpus were being used for gaming amd chips are generally cheaper from what i gather intel's business philosophy is to make the bleeding edge fastest processors while amds is to offer the most stable though not necessarily fastest processors again these are just what i've found in my experience having built a dozen or so personal pcs and a couple of servers my box now is an intel box and i've had no problems at all thanks to the commoditization of computer hardware these days you'll probably not be disappointed either way as long as you stick to the mid to high end processors and not the budget range duron and sempron for amd celeron for intel  Pentium III Pentium M Xeon Athlon 64 Cyrix PC motherboard NVIDIA IBM PC compatible Duron CPU design Opteron AMD64 Overclocking PR rating X86 64-bit PowerPC Apple Intel transition Central processing unit Pentium VIA C3 VIA Technologies Clock rate X86 assembly language AMD K6-III Transmeta Symmetric multiprocessing Intel CPU electrical consumption AMD K6-2 ATI Technologies Sempron NX bit Wintel Windows XP Cell (microprocessor) Laptop Pentium II History of Microsoft Windows Linux kernel IBM PC Apple Macintosh Front side bus Benchmark (computing) Northbridge (computing) Am386 IA-64 Intel 80486 PlayStation 3 Radeon DEC Alpha Sun Microsystems Moore's law Computer IA-32 AMD 5x86 Athlon 64 X2 Pentium Pro Microsoft Windows Supercomputer Mac OS X FLOPS Itanium 2 GeForce 6 Series AMD K5 Bluetooth Motorola 68000 AMD K6 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Montecito GeForce 4 Sequent Computer Systems Xbox Intel 80386 3dfx Stream processing AltiVec Zilog Z80 Sound Blaster Hewlett-Packard IBM POWER Digital Equipment Corporation Embedded system

how can cpu power affect the performance of database system i guess it might have an affect on how many hard drive operations could be handled at one time on the digital end of things a faster processor could handle more data queries and be able to interpret the raw hard drive data quicker i wouldnt wager the difference would be terribly significant unless you were speaking about a fairly sizeable database  Central processing unit CPU cache Redundant array of independent disks Computer Embedded system Thread (computer science) CPU design CDC 6600 Apple Macintosh Overclocking 64-bit IBM PC compatible Microprocessor NeXT Mach kernel PDP-11 MUMPS Atari ST PlayStation 3 Control Data Corporation Tandem Computers Vector processor Modem Virtual memory ILLIAC IV Sega Saturn Database XML Computer bus CP/M SIMD Global Positioning System PowerPC Intel i860 INMOS Transputer Hard disk History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Mainframe computer Optimization (computer science) MIPS architecture Supercomputer Amstrad CPC IA-32 File Allocation Table Computer numbering formats Microprogram Assembly language Cray-2 Opteron Btrieve Digital Equipment Corporation Cell (microprocessor) Speech synthesis NX bit Multiprocessing PaX IA-64 Advanced Technology Attachment Computer multitasking Superscalar Windows XP Windows 2000 System/34 Commodore 128 Coleco Adam Quantum computer Burroughs B5000 Digital Motorola 68000 Compiler optimization Password cracking Assembler Emulator Web crawler File system USB flash drive Context switch FireWire VAX Benchmark (computing) Personal computer Data General Cache Endianness Phase-locked loop ZX Spectrum MS-DOS UNIVAC Reconfigurable computing Atari 8-bit family MDAC Symbolics Movie projector X86 assembly language Intel iAPX 432 AS/400 Binary numeral system

what's the difference between intel processors intel processors come in all shapes and sizes so i'll try to be brief by discussing only the ones that are current on the market the market for intel processors are currently divided into sides one side if for single core processors while the other is for multi cores single cores pentium pentium m celeron core solo not very common these cpus are single cores meaning that they only have one processor they are relatively cheap compared to multicores the difference between these are clock values hyper threading bit support and fsb pentium and celerons are cores found in desktops while the m is found in laptops single cores generally have low fsb but high clock speeds think of it as having a lot of water pressure but only a straw to dispense it that's how fsb and clock values work so single cores should provide you with a lot of raq power but they're not good at multi tasking or jobs that requires it divide it's attention games like crysis will be better with multi cores because the pc has to generate so many different things at once while focusing on countless calculations and processes the hyperthreading support does help the single core pentium s with multi tasking but it's not as much as multicores so if you're just looking for something with a lot of raw power these are for you multi core core duo core duo core quad these are multi core processors developed by intel they are used in both laptops and desktops except for the quad it's used in desktops only the first processors are dual cores while the last is quad cored these processors have a high fsb rating and generally lower clock speed so you have to be careful when looking at these the high fsb means that the system does really really well with dividing and transferring it's processing power but if you get a low clock speed then there's not enough power to begin with for the assignment example you may have a large hose but if you have low water pressure it's useless that's why multi cores are great for the modern pc user who multitasks way too much but if it's under ghz in clock speed you should be worried about not having enough raw power to get you through intensive work multicores generally cost a lot more than single cores since they're relatively new technology btw the core duo is faster than the core duo by about meanwhile the quadcore is the ultimate in processor goodness but costs i hope these facts helped  Xeon AMD X86 Dual-core Apple Macintosh Hyper-threading VIA C3 PowerPC Computer 64-bit ATI Technologies Laptop IBM PC compatible Pentium Opteron MIPS architecture Apple Intel transition Front side bus Clock rate Pentium II NVIDIA Cell (microprocessor) Pentium Pro Athlon 64 PR rating Cyrix IA-32 Overclocking Transmeta Duron Supercomputer Moore's law NX bit Mac OS X 3dfx Linux kernel Itanium 2 Personal computer X86 assembly language Burroughs B5000 Computer workstation VIA Technologies Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC motherboard Symmetric multiprocessing Conroe PowerPC G4 Thread (computer science) PlayStation 3 Mach kernel Northbridge (computing) History of Microsoft Windows MOS Technology 6502 Distributed computing Intel iAPX 432 Dynamic random access memory Mac OS X v10.4 CDC 6600 Mac OS Power Mac G5 Universal Serial Bus GeForce 6 Series PowerBook Multicore Process Atari ST Apple Computer Extreme Programming Windows Vista Sempron Redundant array of independent disks Embedded system Compiler optimization IMac INMOS Transputer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sun Microsystems History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Intel Montecito Bluetooth IBM PC Simultaneous multithreading Xbox Novell NetWare

many devices into a usb port will devices plugged into a usb hub that is plugged into a usb port slow down since all devices are transferring data into the original port it first depends if your usb hub is designed for if it is not it will still work on your port but it will only go at the hubs speed if it is a hub it will have a small lag if devices aren't working in parallel if the devices are working in parallel then it will have to share the bandwidth with the other devices thus making it slower  Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive Computer bus FireWire Secure Digital card Ethernet Serial ATA Floppy disk RS-232 PlayStation 3 Port (computing) Parallel port Bluetooth Musical Instrument Digital Interface IPod Xbox 360 Serial port Dongle SCSI Apple Macintosh Modchip AirPort PCI Express Plug-and-play Hard disk PlayStation 2 USB mass storage device class IMac AlphaSmart ACCESS.bus Digital audio player Serial communications Nintendo Revolution Ripping HyperTransport Modem Commodore 64 Game port Mach kernel CompactFlash PIC microcontroller CPU cache Architecture of Windows 2000 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Peripheral Component Interconnect General Packet Radio Service Supercomputer IEEE 1284 Desktop computer Common Unix Printing System Sound card Mouse (computing) PC card Apple Desktop Bus Satellite internet Memory Stick MicroATX Power Macintosh G3 PowerPC CPU design Computer networking device Digital photography Computer hardware Extension Cord Microcontroller Laptop Archos Power line communication Broadband Internet access Universal asynchronous receiver transmitter Digital Visual Interface Nintendo GameCube Nintendo 64 Armored Core Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Lag Ditto drive Digital camera Electric motor Advanced Technology Attachment Computer forensics Image scanner Digital Subscriber Line Software-defined radio IBook D-subminiature Random access memory ReactOS Bit rate Sega Dreamcast Atari ST Xbox Universal Plug and Play Central processing unit Security token Network address translation Wireless access point Danger Hiptop Turbocharger

what does disk boot failure means and what should i do disk boot failure appear on my screen whenever i start my computer it means your hard drive can't start because the boot sector which is the part of the hard drive which stores startup data is corrupt or damaged this also might happen because your hard drive is not configured correctly in the bios you might want to let the bios autodetect the hard drive and reboot if it is still the same you might try to use a bootable disk or cd and try to fix the problem manually before things get worse you might also consider backing up your data to a cd of a flash drive goodluck  Booting Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Partition (computing) Floppy disk USB flash drive Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible File Allocation Table File system Advanced Technology Attachment Commodore 64 AmigaOS Windows XP Computer virus Disk formatting FreeDOS Flash memory Modchip Apple II family Disk cloning Data remanence Disk storage Digital photography Dual boot IPod Disk image Atari 8-bit family Cache System 7 (Macintosh) Computer forensics Read-only memory HFS Plus RAM disk GRand Unified Bootloader PlayStation 2 Embedded system IBM PC Power-On Self Test Universal Serial Bus Bootable business card Backup Blue screen of death Windows registry Atari ST System/36 Puppy Linux System/34 Copy protection Computer storage Zip drive Personal computer Sega Dreamcast Virtual memory Nintendo 64 Surveillance Sega Saturn Non-volatile memory Early IBM disk storage NTLDR USB mass storage device class Western Digital DVD SAM Coup__ Data recovery TRS-80 Screenshot CIH virus Debugging Thin client Upper Memory Area Memory (computers) Forth programming language Secure Digital card PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Random access memory Hierarchical File System Drive letter assignment NTFS Files-11 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore International DragonFly BSD Commodore 128 Page table Solid state disk Coleco Adam Amiga Fritz-chip Ethernet Amiga Old File System CP/M NeXT

radeonx pro radeonx pro plus and minus points cause i just bought it what are the pros and cons of the graphiccard it has mb memory and gddr pci express is it a good choice cause i just bought the card it has crosfire gigabyte proudly announced that they will be the first vga card maker to bundle sid meier's civilization iv edition with the radeon x pro for strategy game enthusiasts the package enables users to experience the thrilling challenge of creating the ultimate civilization while maintaining your pc cool with gigabyte's unique silent thermal solution slot space required slot port type pci express x system type pc connectivity and additional features functionality crossfire parent card dual dvi hdtv encoder multi monitor support interface type video pin high density d shell vga video pin mini din s video video dvi i digital analog graphics chipset ramdac speed mhz video chipset ati radeon x pro memory installed video memory mb memory technology gddr more info url www gigabyte usa com picture quality color depth at maximum resolution million colors bit grayscale mask bit resolution x quick glance functionality crossfire parent card dual dvi hdtv encoder multi monitor support installed memory interface type video pin high density d shell vga video pin mini din s video video dvi i digital analog slot type pci express x video chipset ati radeon x pro warranty warranty information day limited warranty this is yours this is my chioce and the difference between the better two on the market the main difference between geforce and geforce families is the adoption of directx on geforce family what this means is that they will support the next generation of games to be released starting this year it also means that instead of using separated shader units for each kind of shader processing pixel vertex physics and geometry video cards from this family use a unified shader architecture where the shader engines can process any one of these tasks on our nvidia geforce series architecture article you can find a more in depth explanation about this so far amd has announced their ati radeon hd family which also supports directx and uses unified shader architecture however mid range products will be only available in late june i e one month from now this leaves mid range cards from geforce family like geforce gts without real direct competitors we can find this model from msi costing around usd and at this price range there is no mid range video card from ati amd available we call mid range all video cards that use a bit memory interface and high end all video cards that use a bit memory interface or higher however there are entry level high end video cards at this price range like radeon x pro so we may somewhat consider radeon x pro to be a competitor to geforce gts as they are in the same price range even though geforce gts uses a bit memory interface and radeon x pro uses a bit one the basic difference between geforce gts and geforce gt is the clock used thus we can consider geforce gts a turbo geforce gt as both cards have processing engines the standard geforce gts runs at mhz and accesses its mb gddr memory at ghz ghz transferring two data per clock cycle thru a bit interface so it can access its memory at a maximum transfer rate of gb s this model from msi comes overclocked with the graphics chip running at mhz and its memory running at ghz with a maximum memory transfer rate of gb s so this video card has its gpu running faster than the standard geforce gts and it accesses its memory faster than the standard model so this overclocking is not that high also if you install the drivers that come with this video card you will have access to d o t or dynamic overclocking technology where you can overclock your video card simply checking a box on the video properties so this video card is a product targeted to users that want an overclocked video card to achieve a higher performance but don t want to go thru the hassle of overclocking the video card themselves geforce gts has shader processors running at ghz the same amount used on geforce gt on gt they are running at ghz though for a full comparison between geforce gts and other chips from nvidia please read our tutorial nvidia chips comparison table on ati chips comparison table you can compare them to competitors from ati amd

video card okay i have a windows xp computer that is pretty new i purchased within the last three years i was wondering why i don't have a video card inside of it i have tried installing which worked and playing the sims body shop but i can't make it work becasue i don't have this video card help me out please and tell me if i should have this thing pre installed in the computer i don't quite understand what you're asking but let me see if i can guess you don't see a video card in your computer i take it it's probably a on board video card which means that your motherboard the big board that all of your computer parts are typically connected to has one built in or another way of putting it the video processor is part of the board that may be why you don't see a video card if you are plugging your monitor to a port that's next to your sound card and your keyboard ports that's usually an indication that you have an on board video processor either that or you're trying to get your game working and it says that you don't have the right kind of video card that can be fixed by getting a new one that will fit on your board if your computer is about years old you'll need one that has a agp slot connection not pci e although regular pci without the e will work as well but they are usually not powerful enough for majority of d video games such as sims  Personal computer PC motherboard Computer bus IBM PC Accelerated Graphics Port Sound Blaster Computer and video games Amiga GeForce 6 Series Computer hardware Universal Serial Bus Graphics processing unit Atari ST Creative Technology Power Macintosh G3 The Sims 2 MicroATX Laptop Sound card 3dfx Expansion card Atari 8-bit family IMac Motherboard Apple II family Modem ZX Spectrum PCI Express Cyrix TRS-80 Color Computer PowerPC Xserve History of Microsoft Windows Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Apple Macintosh Northbridge (computing) PlayStation 3 AmigaOS PlayStation 2 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Industry Standard Architecture IBM PC compatible HyperTransport Overclocking Apple IIGS Acorn Electron Slot machine ATX Computer and video game genres Wheel of Fortune Windows Vista Front side bus Sega Dreamcast Xbox NVIDIA SGI Octane USB flash drive HP 9000 Amstrad CPC IPod Graphics card RISC Windows 2000 Poker jargon History of computer and video games Computer Nintendo GameCube NForce4 Cisco PIX Automatic teller machine Power Mac G4 Cube Intellivision Wi-Fi Computer case Microsoft Windows Nintendo Revolution Intel BBC Micro Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC card Game Boy Advance Apple Computer Computer and video game industry Sinclair ZX81 Commodore Plus/4

my computer keeps turning off and i have window xp i deleted my intel extreme graphics help me i disabled my intel extreme graphics because it doesnt work and it doent function well their is always an error is it because of this i can't use this graphic can u give me a different one i need help it seems you have two things here the first is that your computer keeps turning off and the second that you deleted your integrated graphics if your computer keeps turning off it might be that your computer is overheating i would suggest that if it is not under warranty to open it up and blow out all the dust it might also be your power supply especially if it happens randomly or after a specific amount of time in that case the power supply will need to be replaced i would take it to a computer shop to have them tell you what power supply will work on the pc to get a new graphics card you have to get a new piece of hardware which is completely depending on what kind of computer you have you would have to give the make and model number of your computer if you just need a new driver for your integrated video card then you will still have to give the make and model of your computer because they are all different  IBM PC compatible Personal computer Computer NVIDIA ATI Technologies Apple Computer Windows 2000 OpenGL History of Microsoft Windows Windows XP CPU cache Atari ST X Window System Microsoft Windows Atari 8-bit family Mac OS X GeForce 6 Series Graphics card Universal Serial Bus Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Graphics processing unit Central processing unit Amstrad CPC Linux 3D computer graphics Embedded system Cheating in Counter-Strike Architecture of Windows 2000 Xbox IMac PowerBook Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC motherboard Kernel (computer science) Amiga Intel Capacitor plague MS-DOS Linux kernel Device driver OpenStep Sound card NX bit AmigaOS Java programming language Apple Macintosh CPU design Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Desktop computer Windows 3.x IPod Coprocessor History of computing hardware (1960s-present) X86 2D computer graphics Sprite (computer graphics) Microprocessor IBM PC Modding Laptop History of operating systems Digital photography Mouse (computing) Mac OS X v10.4 Computer software Bluetooth Floppy disk Nintendo Entertainment System Apple IIGS Buffer overflow RISC Trusted computing Computer virus Computer and video games S3 Graphics TRS-80 PlayStation 3 Wintel History of the graphical user interface PowerPC Booting ThinkPad Portable Document Format Wi-Fi BIOS Mac OS Windows Server 2003 Power Macintosh G3 Counter-Strike Hard disk Library (computer science) MAME Mac mini CP/M Windows API

why is mac better than windows i just want to know what features it has that windows doesn't and no windows sucks mac rocks or anything like that btw i love windows and have no experience with mac i just want to know why people say it is better and thanks for the answers so far esp ans very informative comparing a mac to windows is like comparing a car to a steering wheel microsoft makes an operating system windows apple makes a computer the macintosh line a lot of the benefits that apple claims to have justifiably such as reliability ease of use etc come from the fact that apple sells specific models of computers with their operating system on it if you want something portable get the macbook if you want a small computer get a macmini if you want a more powerful computer get the workstation they have different products but for the most part your selection is limited windows on the other hand is just an operating system it may come pre installed on a lot of computers but microsoft doesn't sell computers therefore you can put windows on computers with an infinite number of configurations older computers newer computers computers with hardware that you specifically pick out for a computer you can build yourself this flexibility makes an os like windows a lot more flexible in the eyes of some people and therefore a lot more desirable especially in the business world where cto's don't feel like being locked in to a hardware vendor while this locks them into an os choice the fact is that the os overall cost is far cheaper than the hardware costs so it's the lesser of evils so the question of whether a mac is better has to do with the needs of the customer it's better for some worse for others some people like cars others like trucks  Apple Macintosh Mac OS X Microsoft Windows History of Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Mouse (computing) Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Mach kernel Windows XP PowerPC Microsoft Windows 2000 X Window System RISC Computer Linux Amiga Apple II family Personal computer Mac OS Floppy disk NeXT Operating system Laptop OpenGL Atari ST Game programming Unicode Sun Microsystems Computer workstation Visual Basic Digital rights management Mac OS history PowerBook IMac Vorbis Embedded system History of the graphical user interface AmigaOS System 7 (Macintosh) MIPS architecture Windows Server 2003 Microsoft Office Radeon Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Digital Equipment Corporation Unix Steve Jobs Library (computer science) Copy protection Hard disk Mac OS X v10.4 Linux distribution File Allocation Table Blue screen of death History of operating systems Macromedia Flash Modem Ashton-Tate Wintel HyperCard Timeline of computing 1990-forward Apple typography History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Screenshot WebObjects LiveCD Dot matrix printer Common criticisms of Microsoft Xerox Star Windows 3.x Wi-Fi Novell NetWare Lisp programming language Mac OS 9 Supercomputer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Microprocessor VMware BASIC programming language 64-bit Bulk vending Open Database Connectivity OS/2 Linux kernel Mac OS X v10.2

video games cpu video card or ram i am very confused with all this cpu video card and ram stuff let's say i want to play a game like half life or doom mostly d fps games my computer currently is running on a pentium r cpu ghz a sis video card and mb of ram which should i be upgrading to be able to play these games smoothly also how do these cpu video card ram affect my gameplay thanks to be honest you'll probably need to upgrade all three to be able to play games like that smoothly the video or graphics card vga is probably the most important thing when gaming is your key concern as it does all the d rendering of the graphics and without certain features you won't be able to play many modern games ram is pretty useful stuff when gaming too gb is about the minimum you'll need to be able to run most modern games but i'd go for gb if you can afford it your ghz processor just about scrapes through minimum requirements but if you're in the mood for upgrading it go for a dual core core duo processor and that should speed things up quite a bit other than that if your games are running jerkily low frame rate causes this try turning all the graphics options off or to their lowest settings and play at the lowest resolution available i'd suggest reading the back of the game boxes you want to be able to play and looking for the minimum recommended is better requirements and building a system around that there's a really good article on games and the technologies behind them on wiki link in sources hope this helps  Pentium 4 IBM PC compatible Xbox 360 ATI Technologies PC Engine Doom 3 PlayStation 3 Xbox Nintendo Revolution First-person shooter Atari 8-bit family Original Amiga chipset 3dfx PowerPC Cell (microprocessor) Amiga PlayStation Portable Pentium M Mac OS X TRS-80 Color Computer Apple Macintosh Computer and video games X86 Windows XP History of computer and video games IMac Personal computer Sega Saturn CPU cache Microprocessor PlayStation 2 Amstrad CPC Sinclair ZX81 PowerBook Atari ST Laptop Windows Vista TurboGrafx 16 RISC AMD Graphics processing unit Opteron Game Boy Commodore 128 Nintendo GameCube MSX Mouse (computing) PC motherboard Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Apple II family Color Graphics Adapter Athlon Texas Instruments TMS9918 Counter-Strike IBook Computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of Microsoft Windows MIPS architecture NVIDIA Computer workstation Random access memory IBM PC TRS-80 Timeline of computing 1990-forward High-definition television BBC Micro The Sims 2 Cyrix Apple IIGS Frame rate Video Graphics Array Poker jargon Far Cry Game programming Atari 2600 Mac mini Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Computer and video game genres Quake Nintendo 64 Athlon 64 Front side bus Radeon VIA C3 NX bit PlanetSide Power Macintosh G3

which do you think is better a mac or a pc why please respond asap and thanks i need info because i am considering switching from a pc to a mac and i am very into media things like making movies and music etc these properties further justify me get a mac but i need a second opinion windows has the market share advantage and an abundant array of software but thats where the advantage ends they're a huge target for viruses and spy ware and generally a security risk even microsoft uses unix servers which shows they're lack of confidence in their own products plus you need an expensive computer to run that overpriced vista comfortably macs are computers any grandma could use with no known viruses and very little security threats pointed at it based on a variant of unix called bsd so essentially it is linux with a pretty interface and pampers its users not very customizable though and not a very good selection of games but that is changing plus you can multi boot with windows and various flavors of linux on the new intel macs ubuntu is my favorite flavor of linux for one its free super customizable software is free very few security problems if any at the moment my only beef with it is that it has the biggest learning curve of the three and you have to break the law just to play certain codecs like mp wmv mov m a  Microsoft Windows Operating system Mac OS X Linux Windows XP IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Berkeley Software Distribution Computer virus Mach kernel History of Microsoft Windows Linux distribution Macromedia Flash Unix Mac OS X v10.4 Thread (computer science) Mozilla Firefox Windows 2000 X Window System File system Peer-to-peer Skype Sun Microsystems Library (computer science) NeXT USB flash drive Wi-Fi WordPerfect History of the graphical user interface Perl Kernel (computer science) Linux kernel Microsoft OpenStep Timeline of computing 1990-forward ITunes PowerPC Windows Server 2003 Python programming language Opera (web browser) Mandriva Linux Common criticisms of Microsoft IPod Spyware Common Unix Printing System FreeBSD Server Windows Vista Microsoft Office OpenOffice.org Digital audio workstation Novell NetWare HyperCard Computer and video games Free software Emacs Bluetooth Mozilla Application Suite Mac OS QuickTime 64-bit Blue screen of death GNU General Public License Computer workstation OpenGL Slashdot subculture Session Initiation Protocol MAME Unicode GNOME Common Lisp Ethernet Buffer overflow DragonFly BSD Mouse (computing) Amiga SCO-Linux controversies Internet Explorer SUSE Linux Mainframe computer Trusted computing Copyleft Microsoft Word Online music store MMORPG Debian Java programming language Filename extension PHP Digital Equipment Corporation User agent Warez

why i get new driver found wizard whenever i reboot my windows xp laptop in device manager it says windriver virtual device driver code error sounds like something was not installed correctly or is incompatible with your system here are some things you can try uninstall any software or hardware you recently installed maybe a scanner or a printer do one uninstall at a time and see if the problem goes away use system restore under all programs accessories system tools system restore to return your system state to a date prior to when your problem started write down exactly the error messages you are getting and then google them putting them in quotation marks so that your search engine only shows pages with the exact error messages you are looking for you may have to try different combinations of words in the error messages often this will take you to a website that will tell you why you are getting the error message and what you should do to fix it good luck  Windows 2000 Computer virus Debugging Common Unix Printing System Booting Device driver Windows XP Linux History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Computer software Universal Serial Bus X Window System Windows Vista Rootkit Mach kernel Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Apple Macintosh Modem Objective-C DragonFly BSD Pretty Good Privacy Blue screen of death Embedded system ZX Spectrum Portable Document Format System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Computer Spyware Virtual memory One-time pad C programming language Kazaa Plan 9 (operating system) Internet Explorer Mac OS X MDAC Redundant array of independent disks Windows Installer Control Panel (Windows) Forth programming language Architecture of Windows 2000 Unicode Gmail Windows Server 2003 NX bit CPU design System/36 Mac OS Apple IIGS OpenBSD Perl Software testing Computer program Windows API RPM Package Manager Kernel (computer science) Spring operating system Buffer overflow Windows 3.x Enigma machine Digital circuit Commodore 64 Real-time operating system Musical Instrument Digital Interface PostScript Patch (computing) Extreme Programming Visual Basic PaX Control character Emulator Hello world program Windows Me FreeDOS Computer bus Optical character recognition Bluetooth VMware Mozilla Firefox DirectX Java programming language Motorola 68000 Floppy disk Terminate and Stay Resident Btrieve Personal computer OpenGL Page table Nintendo Entertainment System Information Technology Infrastructure Library IPod

what games will take advantage of quad core cpu's specific games is what i was looking for none to take advantage of a multi core cpu software has to be written to use more than one thread no current games are and neither is most software multithreading is difficult and requires different development methodologies and tools i wouldn't expect to see multithreaded games appear any time soon maybe in years time the only advantage you get from a multi core chip as a gamer is that if you are running other software at the same time like teamspeak or winamp or windows wants to do something in the background then it will run on another core and not interrupt your game  CPU design Thread (computer science) IBM PC compatible Pentium 4 Xbox 360 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Central processing unit CPU cache Computer multitasking 3dfx MIPS architecture Dual-core RISC Simultaneous multithreading Opteron Microprocessor Windows XP Computer 64-bit X86 Hyper-threading AMD Computer and video games Mach kernel Embedded system MAME Athlon 64 X2 Mac OS X v10.4 ATI Technologies Commodore 64 Atari ST NX bit Game programmer Extreme Programming Cell (microprocessor) History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS X Management information system Symmetric multiprocessing Sega Dreamcast Symbian OS Software architecture PowerPC Zilog Z80 Apple IIGS Radeon Linux Field-programmable gate array RISC OS PlayStation Portable Distributed computing Windows Vista Quake III Arena IBM POWER Sega Saturn Pentium D Sinclair ZX81 Operating system PlayStation 3 Burroughs B5000 Nintendo Entertainment System AMD64 Mouse (computing) Mandriva Linux PlayStation 2 DragonFly BSD ZX Spectrum MP3 Cheating in online games Nintendo Revolution Windows 2000 Forth programming language Rational Unified Process Intel iAPX 432 INMOS Transputer WebObjects IA-64 Computer bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Original Amiga chipset Montecito Microsoft Apple Computer Software testing Perl Rapid application development Copland Wintel BIOS Computer program World of Warcraft Read-only memory Motorola 68000 Game programming Software engineering Neo-Geo Windows API Linux kernel

how do i place important files on the edge of my hard disk what programs and where can i get them do i need in order to move some files to the edge of my hard disk for faster access sure it will as the system does not need to shearch the whole hard disk in order to find it ok drew u almost got the question i know i can do this but i forgot the long lost link to how there was a program that fragmented just like the windows defragmenter utility the much needed parts of the system to the edge of the hard disk for much faster access i'm just asking about the name of that program or something similar p s anyone can say you can't do it but not everyone can say how you can do it when i say faster access in terms of hard disks i mean faster access for the system aka windows to the hard disk not about desktop shortcuts btw colinc what if the edge of my hard disk is empty how could i move a special file there now we are getting there i have hdd and partitions windows partition programs files huge files the files i want to move are basically system files and maybe game files in the future p here is some clear up the question info correct me if i m wrong as we know windows writes information on the hard disk this information often becomes fragmented and disorganized the information is written in any way but still widows reads them fine slower but fine due to special files that redirect the system windows to the correct clusters of the file also as we know windows reads the hard disk from beginning to end and that if the file is located at the beginning of the hard disk and i mean the sequence of the magnetized dots on the hard disk so if the dots info is located at the start of the hard disk my pc will be able to find it significantly faster which will provide a better system user experience this means that i can move the magnetized dots on the hard disk to the edge of the hard disk so that it takes windows less time to find them while the information on the files location in windows explorer remains the same now the question how can i move the files magnetized dots and huge files i use a lot on the hard disk to the edge of the hard disk let me try again how do i move the files which are directly on the hard disk to the edge of the hard disk while windows explorer will not notice any difference in the files position how can i do this and or what program can do this as i have two had disk's one gb other gb i would prefer my most used programs windows and fav games to be at front i an a pc enthusiast becoming a pig question s i would really appreciate links to websites with step by step instructions or any relating info izzy hehehe yeah that might be an idea creating a separate partition just for a game as i already have one for windows but ill only do that when ill be reinstalling windows which will be in some time you are talking about a defragmentor windows includes one at start programs accessories system tools disk defragmentor you click defrag and it will do it for you there are alternatives such as o o defrag or diskkeeper edit defragmenting does this automatically for you it moves them so the files are not defragmented for faster file accessing most of the time unless it's huge files mb you won't notice it very much even if you do have it moved to the front  Windows 2000 Hard disk Windows XP Defragmentation NTFS AmigaOS Redundant array of independent disks MS-DOS Mouse (computing) Computer virus IBM PC compatible Enterprise content management Computer Atari 8-bit family Linux Floppy disk System 7 (Macintosh) Forth programming language Object Desktop Windows 95 Partition (computing) RISC CPU design Spring operating system Windows registry Commodore 64 Macintosh Finder Windows 3.x CPU cache Defrag Mozilla Firefox Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Operating system Garbage collection (computer science) Library (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Linked list Portable Document Format Microsoft Windows Emacs Amstrad CPC Apple IIGS X Window System FreeDOS Early IBM disk storage Atari ST MiniDisc Visual Basic NeXT USB flash drive MAME Spyware Symbolic link Minesweeper (computer game) HyperCard Computer file ZIP (file format) Files-11 Stardock Novell NetWare Cache OpenOffice.org MDAC History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Booting Database Logo programming language Extreme Programming Gmail System/36 C programming language Data recovery Disk cloning Microsoft Office TeX Thread (computer science) Knoppix ITunes Windows Server 2003 Disk formatting Personal computer Random access memory Nintendo Entertainment System Java programming language File format

a good cpu what make a good cpu when you look at their specifications at this time speed is no longer an issue the reason being is that cpu manufacturers have hit a wall in their ability to make even faster cpus reason being is because of the size of the cpu itself the board they make has gotten so small that the electrical paths are so close together yet so tiny they are interfering with each other a smaller sized cpu would result in a faster performance because the electrons would have travel less distance but since we are at that wall no faster cpus are forthcoming for a while reason being is because they just can't get the tiny connections any closer these connections are a lot smaller than one of your hairs cpus are currently at the end of third generation i do not know when the fourth generation will arrive but till then the manufacturers are tweaking with what they have now that is why you are now seeing dual and quad core cpus just more tweaks to get more performance out of the same older tech to keep sales going until fourth gen can arrive bit cpus are out there which do perform much better than bit but not too much software has been written for bit cpus so if you are a gamer best to stay with bit cpus for now best to get the dual core bits ones with a large level cache this level cache is a memory storage for the cpu on frequently used commands it is extremely high speed because it sits on the cpu thus not having to fetch those store commands from main memory which is about times slower level cache is also expensive bus speed is also something to consider the faster the better intel's is faster but amd processors tend to be faster and use more electricity on the other side intel's faster bus has bugs in it at this time and people are having to reduce bus speeds on their mother boards because of those bugs general rule is that if it costs more it performs better  Computer Celeron Microprocessor 64-bit PowerPC Pentium 4 AMD Cache Athlon Microprogram Compiler optimization MIPS architecture IBM PC compatible VIA C3 Cyrix PlayStation 2 Dual-core IBM PC Redundant array of independent disks Clock rate Virtual memory CDC 6600 Branch predictor PDP-11 Opteron Cray-1 Motorola 68000 AMD K6-2 INMOS Transputer Cell (microprocessor) X86 NVIDIA Computer bus Xeon ARM architecture Pentium D Drill bit Moore's law Intel 3dfx Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel AMD K6-III Radeon Dynamic random access memory Digital circuit VIA Technologies Computer workstation Overclocking Integrated circuit NX bit GeForce 6 Series Commodore 64 Pentium M Intel iAPX 432 Hash table Memory (computers) ZX Spectrum Field-programmable gate array Supercomputer Radiation hardening Atari ST MOS Technology 6502 PC motherboard Pentium Pro Laptop Data General Nova Pentium II Sega Saturn Hard disk HyperTransport Buffer overflow History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Athlon 64 Quicksort Xbox 360 Tandem Computers PlayStation 3 TRS-80 Register renaming Sinclair ZX81 Personal computer Computer architecture Wintel Nintendo Revolution Xbox

do you understand this mac os x error message i have a powerbook g running mac os x and it's been having problems so i ran repair disk and it said the disk could not be repaired see below for the detailed message question if i use apple's migration assistant to move my files to another mac will i carry this error with me in other words will moving my files to a new mac fix this problem details i booted with my install disc and went to disk utility first aid repair disk and i got this error message overlapped extent allocation file overlapped extent allocation file volume bit map needs minor repair checking volume information invalid volume free block count it should be instead of repairing volume the volume macintosh hd could not be repaired error the underlying task reported failure on exit hfs volume checked volume could not be repaired because of an error repair attempted on volume volume could not be repaired the overlapping extent allocation error means that there are some lower level problems the first step would be to run repair disk from the install disc which you did after that you might have better luck trying to repair it from what's called single user mode to do that reboot the machine while holding cmd s wait until text stops showing up type sbin fsck fy without the quotes and hit return when it lets you type again type reboot without the quotes and hit return admittedly that is doing more or less the same thing as repairing the drive from disk utility but i've had luck getting work when disk utility wouldn't if that doesn't work boot off you're install disk but hold d instead of c this should let you run an apple hardware test which'll tell you if your hard drive is physically screwed up or if it's a problem with your data if the hardware test is clean you need to run something like alsoft's diskwarrior or later as to the original problem odds are that the migration assistant will not carry over the problem to a new mac but whatever files are causing the problem might not work correctly the error you're getting mostly means that there are two files trying to be in the same spot this might mean that those two files will be unreadable when they move to the new machine it shouldn't cause any problems though aside from those two files being unusable  Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks File Allocation Table Embedded system Apple Macintosh Floppy disk Computer virus System 7 (Macintosh) Mach kernel File system Hierarchical File System Virtual memory HFS Plus C programming language Apple II family Digital circuit IBM PC compatible System/36 Windows XP Blue screen of death AmigaOS Mac OS Disk image Debugging Data recovery Commodore 64 System/34 Booting USB flash drive IPod Macintosh Finder Atari 8-bit family Apple Computer Linux kernel Mac OS X Copy protection Linux Page table CPU cache NTFS Forth programming language Universal Serial Bus PDP-11 DragonFly BSD IBook Perl Data General Nova Ethernet Compact disc PowerBook G4 Files-11 Apollo Guidance Computer Mac OS 8 Windows Vista MS-DOS Apple IIGS VMware Objective-C File format LiveCD PlayStation 2 Master Control Program MP3 Windows 3.x Computer forensics Pretty Good Privacy BASIC programming language AppleTalk History of Microsoft Windows Spring operating system Original Amiga chipset DOS Unicode DVD Amiga Logo programming language Mac OS history Error correction and detection Motorola 68000 Fsck Xerox Star Partition (computing) Digital rights management NeXT Computer multitasking Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Disk cloning Buffer overflow Expert system Exception handling ZX Spectrum Computer Atari ST Opera (web browser) Apple typography

how do i boot windows from an external usb hard drive i have a hp pavilion dv i cloned my internal hard drive on to my external hard drive my bios allows me to try to boot from the external usb hard drive but the bios checks to see if the hardware is working because the text on the screen says its searching for the ethernet port on my computer and when it doesn't find it it tries again it keeps doing this until i turn it off what do i do thanks i used acronis true image to copy the hard drive windows cannot boot from an external hard drive this has been researched countless times and nobody has been able to boot windows from an external without a crash on startup the most you can do is boot into dos command prompt from a floppy or flash drive and then u can enter certain commands but sorry try cloning the external to a new hard drive using a program like norton ghost regular copying the files over will not work only a program like ghost will do it  Booting Apple II family DOS BIOS Hard disk File Allocation Table AmigaOS Floppy disk MS-DOS Disk cloning Computer virus Apple Macintosh FreeDOS IPod Windows XP LiveCD Universal Serial Bus Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family Partition (computing) ZX Spectrum Ghost (software) Windows 3.x Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows IMac IBM PC CP/M PlayStation 2 File system Screenshot Personal computer Apple IIGS History of the graphical user interface History of operating systems SAM Coup__ Commodore International MAME COMMAND.COM Redundant array of independent disks History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Commodore 128 Computer hardware Microsoft Amstrad CPC Xbox NTFS Forth programming language Flash memory Puppy Linux Atari ST Desktop computer WordStar Computer forensics NTLDR Xerox Star Timeline of computing 1990-forward System 7 (Macintosh) Digital audio player USB mass storage device class TRS-80 DR-DOS NeXT Macintosh Finder Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System Laptop Drive letter assignment Disk formatting PlayStation 3 Graphical Environment Manager MSX Bootable business card IBook Acorn Electron Atari 2600 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore DOS Power-On Self Test PlayStation Portable Creative Zen IBM Windows Me Digital photography Bluetooth X86 DOS Comparison Dongle Mozilla Firefox IA-64 Dual boot

why are the letters on the computer keyboard not in alphabetical order i've wondered ages found this on answerbag com the qwerty keyboard layout was designed so that successive keystrokes would alternate sides of the keyboard so as to avoid jams in manual typewriters is frequently said that the design was also created to make people type slower first designs of manual typewriters using keyboards with letters on alphabetical order could not keep up with the speed of fast typers and the qwerty keyboard layout was designed to reduce jamming see http home earthlink net dcrehr whyqwert html later a layout called dvorak was introduced to allow faster typing and reduce fatigue but has never got widespread use see http en wikipedia org wiki dvorak simplified keyboard the qwerty keyboard layout survived the era of electrical typewriters and the digital age because it was the first standard design being first counts  QWERTY Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Keyboard layout Computer keyboard Mouse (computing) Dash Emacs Diacritic Esperanto orthography Arabic alphabet Jumpstart 3rd Grade Apostrophe (mark) Carpal tunnel syndrome IBM Selectric typewriter Maltron keyboard Cangjie method Keyboard technology Enigma machine International Phonetic Alphabet Electronic organ Devan__gar__ Uniform Resource Locator Transmission Control Protocol Airbus A380 Manual transmission TI-92 series Hebern rotor machine Mozilla Firefox Computer Typeface Stenotype Universal Serial Bus Teleprinter Internet Quotation mark Telegraphy IBM PC Game controller Synthesizer Apple typography TI-89 series Atari 8-bit family C plus plus Apple II family Pinyin M16 (rifle) Wiki Central processing unit History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Apple Macintosh Infinite monkey theorem Common Unix Printing System Punch card Welding RISC Scalable Vector Graphics Web browser AltGr key Digital circuit Python programming language Organ (music) CPU cache Membrane keyboard Home computer Leet Coleco Adam Wget Braille Control character Modifier key Windows 2000 Markup language Transliteration of Russian into English CPU design BASIC programming language TRS-80 Color Computer PostScript WordStar Wind turbine Killian documents Paper size Word processing Opera (web browser) Guns, Germs, and Steel Web design PDP-1 Transliteration UNIVAC System/36 English words with uncommon properties Digital Ethernet Musical keyboard IBM Ajax (programming) Dot matrix printer

to what extent are usb leads interchangeable if at all i have a freecom external drive with lots of my data on it it connects via a usb port but is no longer recognised on either my work or home pc windows helpfuly suggests i replace the device but do i have any other options i've loads of spare usb leads lying around are any of these likely to help my problem nb no drivers were required as i use winxp sp i know that often these devices are billed as driverless but what it really means is that it utilises the default windows drivers that are already present in your os my first suspicion is as the person above has suggested try different usb ports it sounds like you just have been plugging it into a port that no longer supplies sufficient current to run your device btw i have the freecom external drive too they are extremely great when they work second thing to try is if you know anyone with a powered usb hub try plugging your external drive through the powered usb hub to your computer that should solve any issues regarding quirky power requirements but i'm going to bet that the real problem is a misconfigured windows driver and if that is the case the solution is to plug your usb device in wait until windows detects it tries to install it and then reports that installation failed then you go to the device manager under system icon in control panel and you look for the external hardrive drivers that windows has tried to mount to read your hardisk remove those drivers unplug external hard drive and try plugging in again hopefully this time it will do a proper device detection and install the right set of drivers something similar happened to me for some reason my freecom hardrive when plugged in kept making windows load a faulty driver that would not allow me to access my drive fixing the issue was a matter of figuring which faulty driver was being loaded and getting rid of it  Windows XP IPod AmigaOS History of Microsoft Windows IMac Windows 2000 Architecture of Windows 2000 Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Computer bus Floppy disk Common Unix Printing System USB mass storage device class Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Atari 8-bit family Modchip RS-232 PlayStation 2 Linux IBM PC compatible X Window System Mouse (computing) Embedded system Digital photography Bluetooth Commodore 64 FreeDOS Advanced Technology Attachment Secure Digital card Xbox Apple Macintosh Windows 3.x Knoppix Computer hardware Loudspeaker Mozilla Firefox Device driver FireWire Laptop Modem Plug-and-play Virtual memory Personal computer Microsoft Windows Blue screen of death 64-bit NTFS Cheating in Counter-Strike Atari ST Sound card PlayStation 3 Btrieve Linux kernel Carburetor Spark plug Computer Computer forensics File system Serial ATA ReactOS Enigma machine Musical Instrument Digital Interface OpenBSD Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Novell NetWare File Allocation Table Windows Vista BS 1363 BIOS Residual-current device Sinclair ZX81 Apple Desktop Bus Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Flash memory Visual Basic CPU cache Disk cloning Desktop computer PowerPC DragonFly BSD The Sims 2 Apple IIGS Rootkit VMware Sega Dreamcast NX bit Power Macintosh G3 Digital rights management

i think my screen driver got ruined or something any ideas i was going to record the screen but this time an error message popped up i tried reinstalling but an error message popped up saying it cannot install the screen driver i recently downloaded a new theme but i don't think that has anything to do with it but if you know something about themes please correct me if i'm wrong i went to device manager display adapters and video graphics accelalator had a caution icon on it does anyone have any ideas what's wrong my graphic card is amd athlon the screen recorder is zd soft but i don't think that info will help i went to the driver website and downloaded updates same problem oh geez i looked at the wrong sticker it is nvadia there's not enough information in your description to know exactly what problem you are encountering so here's how to do either of what sound like could be your problem first you need to know what graphics card you have or if it is built in what graphics chip set it uses you will also need to know what monitor you have go to each piece of equipments manufacturer website and download the most current drivers if it's an nvidia based graphics card you can just get the most current drivers from nvidia start by running the installation on the drivers for nvidia if that is what you have and see if that corrects the problem if not then i would recommend you try to remove the device through device manager and restart the machine follow the prompts and reinstall your video card drivers that way if this still doesn't work then you might have a bad monitor driver and need to update it but that's unlikely you can update the driver through display settings under the advanced tab if none of this works i would need to know more information on the problem to help further good luck  Windows XP NVIDIA ATI Technologies Blue screen of death Windows Vista AmigaOS Radeon Windows 2000 Graphics card ZX Spectrum History of Microsoft Windows OpenGL Apple IIGS GeForce 6 Series Commodore 64 IMac Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family AMD Linux Embedded system PlayStation 3 X Window System Microsoft Windows Screenshot Opera (web browser) 64-bit Object Desktop Spyware IPod Atari ST PC motherboard DirectX X86 Mac OS X Graphics processing unit MAME Common Unix Printing System 3dfx Apple Macintosh Knoppix Laptop Oscilloscope CPU design GeForce 4 MDAC Amiga Copy protection CPU cache Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Sound card Computer display Microprocessor Teletext Xbox Steam (content delivery) Device driver TRS-80 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo OpenBSD Computer Surveillance Musical Instrument Digital Interface VIA Technologies Macromedia Flash Cheating in Counter-Strike Timeline of computing 1990-forward Rendering (computer graphics) Sega Dreamcast Doom 3 AOL Instant Messenger NForce4 DragonFly BSD PostScript Commodore 128 GeForce 7 Series Computer bus PlayStation 2 Pinball Modem Counter-Strike MSN Messenger Prank flash Stereoscopy Secure Digital card Amstrad CPC Computer display standard Slot machine Nintendo Entertainment System DDR2 SDRAM Trusted computing Mozilla Firefox QuickDraw

can i run a game without pixel shaders cause i passed everything until i got to the pixel shaders on system requirement and didnt pass that for black white pixel shader is what makes every graphic more realistic as possible by rendering its details if black white requires certain level of pixel shader it means it needs at least that level of pixel shader to properly render its graphics so i guess you can't play black white  Shader Vertex and pixel shaders Xbox 360 DirectX Far Cry Rendering (computer graphics) Color Graphics Adapter Game programmer ATI Technologies PlayStation 3 Cg programming language Radeon GeForce 6 Series Game programming First person shooter graphics engines GeForce Graphics processing unit GeForce FX Xbox Direct3D Computer graphics Pixel Anti-aliasing Pixel art First-person shooter Overclocking GeForce 4 Amstrad CPC Raster graphics Atari 8-bit family OpenGL TrueType Map Portable Document Format BRL-CAD Ray tracing JPEG QuickDraw RenderMan Cell (microprocessor) Procedural texture Vector graphics PNG Quake II GeForce 7 Series Sinclair ZX81 GLSL 3dfx Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within Scene graph Radeon X Series AppleScript Liquid crystal display OGRE Engine Dawn (demo) GeForce 3 Game Boy Advance Hercules Graphics Card Digital Visual Interface Nintendo 64 Apple IIGS Geographic information system High-definition television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Minesweeper (computer game) OpenGL ES History of the graphical user interface Intellivision PostScript Game Boy Digital camera Pixelation Half-Life 2D computer graphics Nintendo DS Neverwinter Nights 2 Original Amiga chipset Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Nintendo Revolution Nintendo Entertainment System Computer display MPEG-2 PC Engine Apple typography Doom engine Katamari Damacy Z-buffering In The Groove (game) The Sims 2 Digital photography Deus Ex: Invisible War Mouse (computing) Wolfenstein 3D Digital image editing SAM Coup__ 3D Studio Max Timeline of computing 1990-forward Clipping (computer graphics)

my computer speakers were working fine and now they play to quietly and it has bursts of loud is it a short it seems as though there is a loose connection somewhere but i have replugged all the cables in i uninstalled the sound card and reinstalled it so i have no idea why it is doing this i do not think i blew the speakers because they sound fine in music quality its not a short or you would be having hardware issues you probably have one of two problems the volume knob can go bad and cause an issue like this sometimes you can trouble shoot this by wiggling the volume knob and seeing if the volume level changes if it does change then you need to buy new speakers if the first trick doesn't work then look for broken or loose connections in the wiring for the set  Musical Instrument Digital Interface Ethernet Synthesizer Electric guitar RS-232 Computer hardware Harp IBM PC compatible Spyware Amstrad CPC IPod Effects unit Modem Atari 8-bit family Sound Blaster Acorn Electron Television Audiophile Sound card Loudspeaker Windows XP Shader Password GSM services Poker jargon Electronic organ Computer Digital photography Fender Telecaster Sound recording Multitrack recording Electrophysiology NTSC Internet fraud Modular synthesizer Shit MOS Technology SID Universal Serial Bus Advanced Technology Attachment Audio level compression Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Nintendo Entertainment System Musical terminology ZX Spectrum Non-native pronunciations of English Oscilloscope Laserdisc Cable television Trusted computing Embedded system Computer and video games Timpani Stage lighting Bubble Bobble Digital circuit Bluetooth Overhead lines Dyslexia TurboGrafx 16 ITunes Music Store Yu-Gi-Oh!

ram clock speeds mhz vs mhz i bought an alienware pc about two years ago the motherboard that shipped with it was defective and it was replaced by compusa not recommended with a motherboard who's memory standard was mhz i was able to keep my memory mhz but at an increasing rate i realize that is far too little memory so i am determined to buy more ram which brings me to my question is ram clocked at mhz effective for gaming or would it be wiser to buy a motherboard that is capable of holding ram clocked at i would be buying at least gigs of ddr ram low cas and timings hopefully please note my budget is rather low i can buy a new motherboard but would prefer not to don't worry whether it's mhz or you do want at least a gb of ram though if you plan on using your pc for games gb would be even better and probably cheaper than you think get it at newegg com ddr is very cheap right now since ddr came out you can get gb at newegg for less than  DDR SDRAM Dynamic random access memory AMD DDR2 SDRAM NVIDIA Overclocking Radeon Commodore 64 PowerPC Opteron Celeron Athlon Atari ST IMac GeForce 6 Series Timeline of computing 1990-forward Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME TRS-80 Color Computer Rambus Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple Macintosh VIA Technologies IBM PC Acorn Electron BBC Micro MSX PlayStation 3 Sound Blaster Atari 8-bit family Athlon 64 Xbox 360 Amiga Personal computer Front side bus MOS Technology 6502 Xeon Power Macintosh G3 Pentium M Apple IIGS Nintendo GameCube PC motherboard Commodore 128 Atari 2600 Clock rate Peripheral Component Interconnect Power Mac G4 A600 Hard disk Cyrix Oscilloscope Northbridge (computing) Sharp Zaurus Redundant array of independent disks Central processing unit PowerBook EMac Amstrad CPC DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Global Positioning System GeForce 256 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX PlayStation 2 Radeon X Series TI-83 series 3dfx Pentium D ABIT CPU design Accelerated Graphics Port PR rating Voodoo 5 PlayStation Portable Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Sinclair ZX81 PC Engine Dance Dance Revolution VIA C3 ZigBee Xbox MOS Technology VIC-II MOS Technology Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Magnetic core memory Acorn Archimedes Sega Dreamcast MIPS architecture Static Random Access Memory Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) NTSC Nintendo DS Computer architecture Cisco PIX History of computer and video games Nintendo 64

why arent my speakers working they were fine this morning and now you cant hear one thing and not even my headphones work did you turn windows media player down all the way before you shut it off this can cause the rest of the system sound to be too low to hear sometimes if that's not it the first thing that i would do is to check to make sure that it is not something pertaining to the software in winxp go to start control panel in the control panel go to performance and maintenance then open system in the systems property window click on the hardware tab at the top click on the button that says device manager look for your sound card in the list everything is listed in categories so you may have to click the next to audio devices to actually see it if it has a red or yellow mark by it it has a system problem possibly driver or something if it has no marks it is not the pc doing it on it's own it is something you have changed somewhere if it does have a mark double click right on the name of your sound card the property window will open click on the drivers tab in the next window click on roll back driver if this does not work go back to the device manager and highlight the sound card at the top is the actions menu click it tell it to uninstall agree to the warning once it has been removed restart your pc windows should put the drivers back when it restarts this may take a little time so let everything load completely when it restarts i hope all this helps  Windows XP Mouse (computing) IPod Windows 2000 Screenshot Blue screen of death Virtual memory Object Desktop X Window System Embedded system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Macromedia Flash IBM PC compatible Booting Nintendo GameCube Control Panel (Windows) Windows Vista Architecture of Windows 2000 Palm OS Windows 3.x AmigaOS MAC address System 7 (Macintosh) Computer and video games Apple IIGS Taskbar Macintosh Finder Poker jargon Nintendo Entertainment System Headphones Kernel (computer science) Universal Serial Bus Modem Musical Instrument Digital Interface Device driver MSN Messenger Hello world program OpenGL Windows API Mozilla Firefox Guitar Creative Zen Audiophile Rootkit Stardock Common Unix Printing System ZX Spectrum Ethernet Bluetooth Sega Dreamcast CPU design Knoppix Gramophone record International Phonetic Alphabet Double-click (computing) Sony Prank flash Computer hardware History of the graphical user interface Computer software Bass guitar Fischer Random Chess File Allocation Table SonicStage Cheating in Counter-Strike CPU cache Xbox Digital rights management Dice Computer and video game genres Amstrad CPC Emacs Mac OS X v10.4 Spyware Danger Hiptop Game Boy Indianapolis 500 Linux kernel Mac OS X Computer bus NeXT Nintendo DS PlayStation Portable Digital audio workstation Windows Mobile Sound Blaster NX bit Redundant array of independent disks Windows 95

hard drive failure what can i do ok so i'm new to the world of hard drive failure when i turn on my computer i get the error message primary hard drive failure and i hear a slow clicking noise and very loud spinning which i can tell is coming from my hd the spinning starts and stops a couple of times then it just stops so i'm pretty sure the drive is screwed two questions is there anything i can do to try to get the drive working again or is hd failure a completely non reversible thing and second is there any way i can get my data back without sending the drive into a computer store thanks unfortunately that clicking metal sound you speak of is the death rattle of a hard drive if you hear it your hard drive is fixing to die and most likely already doesn't work fully so to answer your question no there is nothing you can do to get the drive going again unless you know how to refurbish a hard drive you may be able to save bits and pieces of your data but it sounds like the bios can no longer even recognize the drive so you wont be able to do that either there is a service available that will get your data off of a failed drive but it is very expensive almost never a consideration for a failed drive unless the data is crucial sorry to be so wordy but i didn't want to answer you by simply saying your screwed even though that is pretty much the case on the bright side hard drives are getting pretty cheap i saw a gb for the other day  Floppy disk Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Modem IPod Digital photography Atari 2600 Drill bit Embedded system Digital circuit CPU cache Computer virus Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Compact disc Cache Commodore 64 Windows 2000 Pinball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gramophone record Analog-to-digital converter Computer forensics Computer Prank flash Table tennis DVD System/34 AmigaOS Manual transmission Apollo Guidance Computer MP3 Theory of conduct System/36 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Advanced Technology Attachment Dither Bicycle lighting Amstrad CPC Telegraphy John Cage USB flash drive Booting Partition (computing) International Phonetic Alphabet NeXT Hash table Pretty Good Privacy Disk storage Professional wrestling throws Radio Screw Extreme Programming Hearing impairment Early IBM disk storage Morse Code Debugging File Allocation Table Kasparov versus The World 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mouse (computing) Knoppix Halting problem Cray-1 Burroughs B5000 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Error correction and detection Video game music Volleyball Computer numbering formats Mach kernel Hubble Space Telescope Friends The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Compact audio cassette Lathe Galileo spacecraft MAME Swingout Toyota Prius Overclocking Mars Exploration Rover Computer storage Ethernet Personal computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows XP Communications protocol Sound effect Shaggy dog story One-time pad CPU design Time Out of Mind Apple Open Collaboration Environment

installation of a nd harddrive does it need an operating system to run i've been thinking of adding a nd harddrive to my computer i know i need to designate one as a master and the other as a slave but do i need to install windows xp or whatever os on the new harddrive can i install a different os linux first assuming you are referring to an ide drive and not setting up a raid since it sounds like you merely want to toss on a unix version for the new drive no it doesn't need an os all it needs is a connection to the mobo using the ide you seem to understand that one needs to be designated as master and slave using the jumpers so i'll spare you that explaination once physically connected you'll need to enter your bios and tell the system you have a drive most mobos have an autodetection option for finding drives so look for that if it doesn't have that option you'll need to manually enter the pertinent information heads sectors etc save the settings once windows boots check if you can see the new drive in my computer if so feel free to format it partition it as you see fit also this might be of some help to you as it is an step by step instruction set with pictures for adding a nd disk http www perfectdrivers com howto seconddrive html  Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Partition (computing) Booting Linux USB flash drive Advanced Technology Attachment BIOS Blue screen of death File system Computer virus Knoppix Emacs AmigaOS Virtual memory NTFS Disk cloning Wget IBM PC compatible Unix Floppy disk MS-DOS Operating system DOS FreeDOS Apple II family Gmail OpenBSD Microsoft Windows Macromedia Flash HyperText Transfer Protocol Domain Name System DragonFly BSD ReactOS Mozilla Firefox TRS-80 Disk formatting IA-32 Modchip Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mac OS X PDP-11 Unicode and HTML MIPS architecture Computer bus Xbox Server Rootkit Drive letter assignment Apple Macintosh World Wide Web LiveCD Mouse (computing) Windows registry Library (computer science) Forth programming language Universal Serial Bus MAME Atari 8-bit family WordStar NX bit Commodore 128 LaTeX Atari ST OpenOffice.org Linux kernel CP/M Commodore 64 Fdisk Linux distribution Mandriva Linux Bluetooth SAS System Visual Basic PHP Comparison of file systems Dual boot Comparison of web browsers IBM PC Amiga PlayStation 2 AS/400 Supercomputer Mach kernel

overclocking and adding new memory i bought a new memory module an mb kingston i already have two ones the second one is a no name the third is the same as the first mb kingston my motherboard is msi kt v three memory slots available my processor is amd but i down clocked it about one year before it was a working on mhz in the first slot is an kingston the same one in the second and the no name in the third did i do it right and how can i overclock amd again to work on mhz having a bit of trouble understanding the question seems that you added memory you now have sticks of meg on the system that seems fine the board supports gig so you can add more in the future but you have all slots filled so you will need to replace a stick or two you use to have the processor amd over clocked to which seemed a bit aggressive overclocking is not for everyone you need to be very careful that you know exactly what you are doing or you will damage your components if you haven't any background in overclocking or have a limited knowledge of system configurations i would not overclock that system you would be better served adding a newer faster processor to gain more speed your motherboard will support up to a i would suggest that as an option first http www msicomputer com product p spec asp model kt vl class mb  Overclocking Athlon Celeron Pentium 4 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Opteron Radeon Front side bus IBM PC Cyrix Central processing unit GeForce 6 Series Power Macintosh G3 PlayStation 2 Sound Blaster NVIDIA Timeline of computing 1990-forward Apple Macintosh Xeon NForce4 AMD K6-III CPU cache Atari 8-bit family MSX VIA Technologies Apple II family Personal computer RISC Commodore 64 PlayStation 3 Linux kernel AMD 5x86 MIPS architecture ATI Technologies CDC 6600 Data General Nova TRS-80 Color Computer VIA C3 DDR2 SDRAM IBM PC compatible Amstrad CPC MOS Technology 6502 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Windows XP NX bit Radeon X Series Clock rate Northbridge (computing) IMac Atari ST X86 CPU design DDR SDRAM Reconfigurable computing Xbox 360 Computer bus Nintendo DS Apple IIGS 3dfx Dual-core 64-bit Amiga AMD64 Secure Digital card Pentium M PowerBook PR rating Pentium D Motherboard X86 assembly language Sempron Power Mac G5 Cisco PIX Nintendo GameCube HyperTransport ABIT AirPort Duron USB flash drive Cray-2 IA-32 Power Mac G4 INMOS Transputer Pentium III Integrated circuit Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Pentium Pro AMD K6-2 Dynamic random access memory SGI Indy

buying a psu for a pc after visiting pc world they have sold me a psu that has slightly less watts than the one which was installed already they say this should make no difference to the running of the computer is this correct to be frank if you don't mind me changing my name for a few seconds lol you probably won't notice any difference in performance having said that however it limits your expansion capability in that the more hardware you connect to your motherboard the more power wattage you'll need i e if you add more hard drives more powerful graphics card etc you'll need more wattage  Personal computer Apple IIGS Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking IBM PC Hard disk Apple Macintosh Atari ST Amiga IMac Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AmigaOS Computer hardware Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum PlayStation 2 Windows XP PC motherboard Universal Serial Bus Commodore 64 Laptop Commodore 128 TRS-80 Color Computer Desktop computer Graphics processing unit ATX Sound Blaster ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Bicycle lighting Nintendo Entertainment System Computer BIOS 3dfx Graphics card Commodore PET Texas Instruments TI-99/4A PlayStation Portable Nintendo GameCube PC Engine IPod Ethernet PlayStation 3 Computer bus Windows 2000 Knoppix Computer and video games MicroATX Mac OS X Apple II family Xbox Modchip BBC Micro NVIDIA Amstrad CPC Xbox 360 Sound card Copy protection Transistor SETI@home Computer forensics NeXT Musical Instrument Digital Interface File system Scalable Link Interface TRS-80 GeForce 6 Series Expansion card Power Mac G4 Digital photography Video Graphics Array Radeon Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cisco PIX Switched-mode power supply Disk cloning PowerPC Nintendo 64 Microprocessor Motherboard History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Commodore International Celeron Power Macintosh G3 Sprite (computer graphics) Wi-Fi IBM Personal System/2 Super Nintendo Entertainment System S3 Graphics Computer virus Patch (computing) Embedded system Desknote A600 Advanced Technology Attachment Portland State University Linux Computer case Microsoft Windows

can adsl modem accommodate fax reception sending i use adsl modem connected to my computer can i configure to receive or send faxes what other options i have with adsl the adsl connection is a completely seperate fixed connection to the internet using an adsl modem to directly dial a fax machine directly is not possible however there are two ways to send a fax option you can retain your old dial up modem on your pc though you will not be using it to connect to the internet you will be using your adsl of course you can use it to dial a fax machine directly and then send a fax option as you have a connection to the internet it is worthwhile to look at the many internet to fax gateways that are available these gateways take the information that you want to fax via the internet and dial from their server the destination fax machine to send your fax the advantage of this is that the cost of the fax call is often billed to them not you a major advantage for international faxes the disadvantage is that the free gateways commonly append an advertisment for them or their sponsor to the beginning or end of the fax the free gateways may also have a limit on the number of faxes you can send over a given period of time probably the best example of an internet to fax gateway is http www tcp int note check first to make sure that the phone no that you want to send the fax to is covered by the gateway for more details on how to use internet to fax gateways plus a comprehensive listing of free and commercial gateway addresses take a look at http www savetz com  Digital Subscriber Line Voice over IP GSM services Broadband Internet access HyperText Transfer Protocol Internet Fax Whois Telegraphy Denial-of-service attack Domain Name System Bluetooth IP address Network address translation X.25 Transmission Control Protocol Data retention E-mail UK telephone numbering plan Ethernet Internet protocol suite North American Numbering Plan Federal Standard 1037C Differentiated services IP Multimedia Subsystem Web server Integrated Services Digital Network Cable television HTTP cookie FidoNet Private branch exchange E-mail spam Stopping e-mail abuse Spam (electronic) ITU-T Network Switching Subsystem Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Computer Internet Group Management Protocol Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Dial-up access Bulletin board system Telephone numbering plan Intranet Apple Open Collaboration Environment Proxy server Surveillance Web crawler World Wide Web Secure Shell IPv6 Uniform Resource Locator MSN Messenger Telephone call National Weather Service Common Unix Printing System Routing Steam (content delivery) Open mail relay Wireless Application Protocol Gmail Firewall (networking) Predictive dialer Teleprinter News server Transport Layer Security Telephone number Netfilter/iptables HomePNA Spyware Telephone exchange MIPS architecture Control Panel (Windows) Router Vertical service code AppleTalk Skype History of the Internet Windows XP Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Port numbers Phreaking Telkom Telstra Wi-Fi Electricity meter Computer network Delrina Client-server Wireless LAN

lan card i know this is to do with the internet is it just the hole at the back of the computer can you also just use a usb port instead with a different cord to connect to a modem the lan card doesnt mean that it can be wireless to the internet does it thanks what is a lan card an ethernet network adapter nic that supports both baset mbps and baset mbps access methods at startup the card auto negotiates the speed based on the adapter at the other end and the hubs switches and routers in between all ethernet cards today are cards can you use a usb port to connect to a modem yes but this depends on the modem the modem must have a usb port on it also connection this way is slower than the card dose this mean it can be wireless no if you want to connect wirelessly then you need a wireless network adaptor instead of the card if this is for a laptop it might be built in to the computer already  Ethernet Universal Serial Bus AirPort Local area network Wireless LAN USB flash drive Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 2 Xbox Secure Digital card Modem IEEE 802.11 Computer network Cisco Systems Computer bus IMac IBook PlayStation Portable HomePNA MAC address Router 3Com Corporation Digital Subscriber Line PlayStation 3 Network switch Desktop computer Windows XP Voice over IP Floppy disk Laptop Sega Dreamcast PCI Express Nintendo GameCube Apple Macintosh Hard disk Wireless access point Telegraphy Satellite internet Asynchronous Transfer Mode Power line communication Wireless FireWire GSM services Timeline of computing 1990-forward Computer hardware Mouse (computing) Broadband Internet access Internet Null modem LAN party Atari 8-bit family Universal Mobile Telecommunications System AppleTalk Nintendo DS RS-232 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Quality of service Internet service provider Game Boy Advance General Packet Radio Service CompactFlash DOCSIS Hotspot (wifi) HyperTransport Wireless network Sharp Zaurus Apple IIGS Power Macintosh G3 Novell NetWare Xbox 360 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Memory Stick Serial port Digital audio player Softmodem PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay PC motherboard Computer networking device Internet protocol suite Wireless mesh network Computer ALOHAnet History of Microsoft Windows WiMAX X.25 10-gigabit Ethernet ZigBee

is there a way to check if your ram memory is ok and compatible i got memory cards from different manufacturers is there any way program or list to check if they are compatible with one another the pc freezes many times and i believe the ram is the cause of it it is probably not the ram if they did not work together then of things would happen total memory would be less that what is installed your computer would not run you may be running more than your system resources can handle do some clean up look at what applications are running when it freezes what is running in the background  IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Commodore 128 Windows XP Windows 3.x 64-bit System 7 (Macintosh) Library (computer science) Personal computer IA-32 TRS-80 Color Computer Random access memory IBM PC CPU cache Apple IIGS DOS Flash memory History of Microsoft Windows RISC Microsoft Windows Upper Memory Area ZX Spectrum Computer virus Booting Nintendo Entertainment System CPU design NX bit USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Master Control Program Motorola 68000 Mach kernel Mainframe computer Windows Server 2003 PlayStation 3 Virtual memory Knoppix AmigaOS Linux Java programming language Debugging Fritz-chip MS-DOS Datatype System/36 Atari ST Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DR-DOS Memory (computers) Mac OS X Mac OS PC Engine Terminate and Stay Resident BBC Master MSX Super Nintendo Entertainment System Copland TRS-80 DirectX History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Computer program Hard disk X86 Expanded memory PlayStation 2 Blue screen of death System/34 PaX PowerPC FreeDOS History of operating systems UNIVAC Python programming language Read-only memory Embedded system Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family DragonFly BSD X Window System PHP Symbian OS Windows 1.0 Wine (software) Btrieve Spring operating system Supercomputer INMOS Transputer Timeline of computing 1990-forward Emulator MOS Technology 6502 Commodore REU Sega Saturn Acorn Electron Exception handling Computer multitasking Windows API Game Boy Wintel

can you ruin a hard disk by turning the power on and off many times it certainly can't be good for the spindle motors to keep spinning the drive up and then letting it spin down but probably not too hard on it the real problem is if the read write heads move out over the surface of the disc and just as they do so you power off it could lead to an actual hard drive crash where the heads should smash into the drive's surface and make the drive pretty much unusable  Hard disk Floppy disk Disk storage Lathe Early IBM disk storage Motorcycle Table tennis Phonograph cylinder PlayStation 2 Gramophone record Copy protection Data remanence Electric motor Cache Compact disc Redundant array of independent disks DVD Seagate Technology Phonograph Embedded system Professional wrestling throws Commodore 64 CD recorder Computer storage Drill USB flash drive Magneto-optical drive Quantum Corporation Iomega REV Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Data recovery Computer forensics CD-ROM Magnetic tape Theory of conduct CD-R Differential (mechanics) Aerial (dance move) Partition (computing) Two-stroke cycle Bubble memory Equine conformation Advanced Technology Attachment Swingout Professional wrestling attacks MiniDisc Electricity meter Enterprise content management Atari ST Drill bit Professional wrestling aerial techniques Disk read-and-write head Video game music Optimization (computer science) Mouse (computing) Anchor IPod Wire Memory (computers) Electrical generator Fast bowling Ecco the Dolphin AIM-9 Sidewinder Bullet NTFS Sega Saturn DVD-RAM Four wheel drive Commodore 1541 Hendrick Motorsports Membrane potential Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Zip drive Piledriver (professional wrestling) Crash test dummy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Recumbent bicycle Nintendo 64 Drifting (motorsport) Apple II family Bicycle lighting Disk cloning Crookes radiometer Enigma machine Original Amiga chipset Lawn mower ZX Spectrum Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Freewheel Boy's surface Atari 8-bit family Solid state disk GunBound Large numbers Computer bus Mars Exploration Rover Sound recording Skateboarding trick Disk formatting

when gb is erased from the recycle bin what size does it become on the hard disk i e a gigabyte of data is deleted from my documents to the recycle bin and from there i use an eraser tool i would like to know how much space on the hard disk that original gigabyte is now using up ultimately it will depend on whether you are using fat fat or ntfs it will also depend on whether it is a single gb file like a video file or a lot of smaller files there is a phenomenon called 'slack' that needs to be understood the drive is divided up into hundreds of thousands of identically sized chunks called blocks for example each block may be k in size if you only save a k file it will always consume a k block slack is the k that's left over if you right click on the file and select properties you find size k bytes size on disk k bytes if you save a k file then the slack is k in a k block if you right click on the file and select properties you find size k bytes size on disk k bytes so if your block size was set at k and you deleted a k file you free up k of space and if you deleted a k file you free up k of space if you save a gb file how much space does it actually occupy you need to right click on the file and select properties you will usually find three answers the size of the file in bytes the size of the file in megabytes or gigabytes the actual space used on the hard disk if you have your drive divided into k blocks ie under ntfs then you will need at least blocks to house the file but then each of those blocks does not contain k of data maybe k of actual data and k of location information where the last block is located and where the next block is located and parity information so you may be using blocks for the gb file that's a whopping of the space is given over to tracking info and not actual data so your file properties may read size gb bytes size on disk gb bytes there's a difference of bytes if ntfs uses a larger block say k or k which is better for large files like video there will be less slack space this is because the tracking information still only takes up k of the block leaving a huge k for the actual video data okay if you're still with me let's move on your hard drive will need at least k blocks to house a gb file quite a change from the needed for the k block this time your properties may read size gb bytes size on disk gb bytes there's a difference of only bytes so the answer to your question is this the space freed up when you completely delete gb from your hard drive will be the size on disk figure that you obtained by right clicking and selecting properties regarding the file or folder containing multiple files on which you want info  CPU cache Virtual memory Floppy disk File system Windows 2000 Disk image Fragmentation Comparison of file systems Flash memory Partition (computing) Compact disc Gigabyte HFS Plus Files-11 Binary prefix NTFS junction point Unicode CPU design USB flash drive PNG Computer virus Dd (Unix) Megabyte Digital photography Enterprise content management Defragmentation System/36 Symbolic link Musical Instrument Digital Interface System 7 (Macintosh) Apple II family Atari 8-bit family Page table Macromedia Flash Computer Backup DVD Commodore DOS Plaintext Password CD-ROM Malloc ITunes ALGOL 68 RISC Mouse (computing) Magneto-optical drive Disk cloning ZIP (file format) Tagged Image File Format Forth programming language Filename extension Universal Serial Bus Computer storage HTTP cookie Original Amiga chipset Gramophone record Windows Vista IPod Macintosh Finder Linked list Image file formats Knoppix Amiga Old File System Memory (computers) AmigaOS Error correction and detection CompactFlash Logo programming language C programming language Coding theory Mach kernel Domain Name System Data remanence Brainfuck 64-bit Atari 2600 Commodore 64 Advanced Technology Attachment Java programming language TiVo System/34 Streaming media Hierarchical File System BitTorrent Large numbers MDAC IBM PC compatible Data recovery

is bloom or hdr better for gaming with a crt monitor i'm somewhat savvy about gaming and graphics but oblivion has different lighting options bloom and hdr and i've never seen these before and my buddy said it depends on the monitor can anyone set this straight thanks your buddy is unfortunately incorrect there is more than that to it it has to do with how your graphics card actually renders the lighting in the game not the monitor bloom lighting is based on the older shader model while hdr or high dynamic range lighting is based on the newer shader model and now with directx we'll soon have shader model some older cards like some agp cards even though still able to run games like oblivion lack support for sm ati x x if you have a newer graphics card like the ati x family or the nvidia g family you will have sm so if your card supports it and has a playable frame rate while gaming put it on hdr lighting if it gets a little slow put it on bloom since you say your graphics savvy hdr does look visually more realistic than bloom so hdr all the way  ATI Technologies Radeon NVIDIA Far Cry GeForce 6 Series Xbox 360 Shader 3dfx Vertex and pixel shaders OpenGL Radeon X Series DirectX GeForce FX Graphics processing unit GeForce 7 Series Rendering (computer graphics) Xbox Counter-Strike Doom 3 GeForce Computer graphics 3D computer graphics High dynamic range imaging IMac Windows Vista Dawn (demo) Graphics card Cg programming language PlayStation 3 Nintendo GameCube Game programming GeForce 2 Apple Macintosh EMac Direct3D Atari 8-bit family Cathode ray tube Frame rate Source engine Game programmer Personal computer GeForce 256 Deus Ex: Invisible War Power Macintosh G3 GeForce 3 Half-Life 2 IBM PC compatible Scalable Link Interface Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis S3 Savage Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within RollerCoaster Tycoon DDR2 SDRAM Computer and video game genres Computer-aided design First-person shooter Autodesk Media and Entertainment Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond) Windows XP ZX Spectrum PlayStation 2 Cheating in Counter-Strike In The Groove (game) Computer animation Visual Basic Computer display PowerBook Windows API Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories DirectShow Windows 2000 Stereoscopy Sega Dreamcast Microsoft Windows PC motherboard Digital Visual Interface First person shooter graphics engines Teletext Final Fantasy Amstrad CPC Computer and video games RenderMan PCI Express Amiga Vector graphics Laptop Gamut Ethernet QuickDraw 3D Mac OS X The Sims 2 GDI Motion capture
