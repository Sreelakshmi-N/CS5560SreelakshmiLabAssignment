is the at t blackjack worth it my dad doesn't see a point in me getting a blackjack especially since i wont be allowed any internet capabilities i understand that the online aspect is important if you want a blackjack but are the redeeming qualities that good such as microsoft windows for phones or windows media player plus video and pictures and texting with the qwerty pad and i've heard nothing bad about calling quality i all seems worth it even without the internet am i wrong and if so why i was just recently going to upgrade to one of those i wanted mp player and a better camera video phone i was going to get one of those for dollars after mail in rebates but in order to get it for instead of dollars i would have had to sign an additional a month for two years for data contract but instead i got a samsung sync for dollars and it is good much better camera mega pixels and you have to buy a small micro sd for music and storage but so far i love it one other important thing about the blackjack is its not insurable for damages that means if you break it you buy another one but i would only buy one if i was in to business one other thing you have to consider is that if you are not too much in to roller balls on the face of the phone its hard to navigate the screens as well for programs you have to have fairly small fingers but thats my opinion good luck  Blackjack Digital photography IPod Mouse (computing) BlackBerry Windows Mobile Palm OS Windows XP Floppy disk ITunes High-definition television Nintendo Pixel Microsoft Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ITunes Music Store Creative Zen Computer and video games Danger Hiptop Windows Vista Craps Commodore 64 Xbox 360 Neopets Intellivision Verizon Wireless Atari 8-bit family Mobile phone XML Atari ST Game show Super Nintendo Entertainment System Acorn Electron Gmail IBM PC compatible Game Boy Advance Nintendo DS Xbox Apple II family Copy protection Game Boy History of computer and video games Digital camera File Allocation Table Sinclair ZX81 ATI Technologies Nintendo 64 Hard disk Sega Handheld game console Television Microsoft Office Linux HyperCard Enterprise content management Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 Movie projector Vorbis Wheel of Fortune QuickTime Stereoscopy The Amazing Race Video Blog Screenshot Game programming Digital rights management Macromedia Flash Computer and video game genres PlayStation 3 Microeconomics Nintendo GameCube Winning Streak Orders of magnitude (data) Need for Speed DVD Skype Jumpstart 3rd Grade Final Fantasy XI Oscilloscope Cable television Poker jargon Hearing impairment Smartphone Mac OS X v10.4 ZX Spectrum H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Broadband Internet access TiVo Modem

what phone has the best pda like features i have a palm z that just died on me i absolutely loved all it's features i'm thinking of replacing it with a smartphone i don't need a smartphone that can go on line and all that stuff basically i just want a phone that also has the same capabilities as my z i was thinking of getting a blackberry pearl but i'm a verizon subscriber and they don't offer it i'm a little leery of getting another palm product since mine just died after months for no apparent reason should i switch to cingular also if i do get a smart phone can i just use it as an organizer without purchasing the data plan check out the htc and the newer version the htc it is the absolute best phone i have ever used or seen or even read about in all my years of product reviewing to answer your other question no you do not have to switch to cingular and i strongly recommend against it because it sucks even worse as at t than it did as cingular because verizon has their own version of the phone the mda something google around for it and ull find that proper name im too lazy it wouldnt make sense for the company to force you to buy the data plan because hardly anyone would want to buy the phone so as long as you make sure and tell them you dont want the data plan you will be okay  Smartphone BlackBerry Verizon Wireless Windows Mobile Pocket PC Personal digital assistant Tungsten Handheld Cingular Wireless Palm OS T-Mobile Bluetooth Sprint Nextel Corporation Verizon Communications Symbian OS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System GSM services Treo 650 Windows CE Treo Global System for Mobile Communications Best Buy Push to talk Modem Short message service SBC Communications Voice over IP Flash memory XML Broadband Internet access Palm Pilot Mobile phone RISC AT&T Phreaking Telephone numbering plan N-Gage Surveillance Handspring IPAQ Opera (web browser) New Coke Integrated Services Digital Network Advanced Mobile Phone System Windows 2000 Digital photography IPod Skype General Packet Radio Service Zire Handheld Toll-free telephone number Gmail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Telephone exchange International Mobile Subscriber Identity Avenue Q Vodafone 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Ebook Telephone Telephone number 9-1-1 ITU-T Palm, Inc.

a good converter does anyone know of a good converter i need to change my mpeg and mpg video files into avi or mepg in order for it to be transferrable to my t mobile wing step by step please i am no good with this sort of stuff thanks in advance i would need to know what operating system you use and whether you are comfortable using command line tools in order to recommend specific software but the process in any case will be that you need software which can read your video source then you will need software with an encoder that can transcode that source video into the output format you want i don't know anything about what video types your phone accepts but i bet it will want some for of mpeg video in an avi container perhaps low profile on macintosh use ffmpegx to convert your video to mpeg avi xvid encoding you can also encode to mpeg using ffmpegx on windows you can use virtualdub mod to open mpeg videos install the xvid or divx codecs and then you can conver the video you might want to verify first that you require an avi or an mp container format video remember avi is not a type of video it is just a type of package that can store several different types of video if you need a mp file you will need to convert your mpeg to xvid or divx video with aac format audio if you need avi you might be able to use mp format audio but i don't recommend it good luck follow up in email if you need more help  Video codec MP3 XviD AVI Theora Ogg QuickTime Streaming media Advanced Audio Coding H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Portable Document Format ITunes MPlayer MPEG-4 DVD MPEG-2 PlayStation Portable XML Unicode Digital rights management File format Creative Zen Linux Vorbis Digital video recorder Moving Picture Experts Group Data compression Analog-to-digital converter Windows Media Video High-definition television Blu-ray Disc DV Audio file format IPod Xbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface OGM Karaoke Game programmer Mac OS X FairPlay ImageMagick Audio data compression Windows Mobile Bluetooth Ebook Laserdisc USB flash drive ATSC Spyware Winamp Emacs Xbox 360 AviSynth Pretty Good Privacy Podcasting GP2X OS/2 VirtualDub WAV Enterprise content management Voice over IP Microsoft Digital video Apple II family VideoLAN Speex System 7 (Macintosh) Lossless data compression Embedded system Computer software Computer virus ATI Technologies Digital audio workstation Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Non-linear editing system Knoppix Modem Linux distribution ITU-T Iriver Scalable Vector Graphics Computer Common Unix Printing System Usenet ITunes Music Store SAS System MPEG-4 Part 14 ZX Spectrum

psp problem the internet on my psp runs really slow like ot takes mins to get from one page to the next so how do i get it to run faster and i dont want to have to buy anything really expensive i dont know if its possible to hook up a router to a dial up modem but im going to assume no so then what you can do change the channel of the routers broadcast you may be getting interference with other networks in your area to change the channel click the start menu on your computer hooked to the router in the search box type 'cmd' without the ' a black dos window will open with a c type in 'ipconfig all' without the ' and a space between fig and this will show you the ip address of your router of the time it will tell you the ip address is start the internet browser on the pc type that address in the addy bar this will take you to your routers set up page find 'channel' or something similar and then change it if this doesnt solve the problem turn off 'ping blocking' if your router has that option if that doesnt work change the settings in the psp more then likely you set up the network connection automatically you want to set it up manually go back to the dos window ipconfig all and enter all the info that is there on the psp primary dns default router subnet etc however the ipconfig will give you an ip address of of the time and of consumer based routers have an ip range from through so you need to assign the psp an ip address outside of that range so will be fine my connection looks like this ip address primary secondary dns subnet default router proxy server do not use if that doesnt work do you have problems with your pc being slow it may be possible that the router and isp connections arent set the same so the router is using a dynamic setting and the isp requires a static setting but this is going to be pretty unusual for todays isps  Denial-of-service attack Domain Name System Network address translation IP address AppleTalk Internet Group Management Protocol Wi-Fi Federal Standard 1037C Stopping e-mail abuse Spyware Windows XP ITunes E-mail spam Modem Uniform Resource Locator Windows 2000 Broadband Internet access Web crawler Voice over IP AmigaOS Router Mozilla Firefox Internet service provider MAC address Email authentication PlayStation Portable Telegraphy Internet Relay Chat IPv6 Digital Subscriber Line MIPS architecture Proxy server Differentiated services Border Gateway Protocol Visual Basic Ethernet MDAC Novell NetWare Mozilla Application Suite Mouse (computing) Whois Netfilter/iptables Spam (electronic) Gmail IPv4 Microsoft Windows Embedded system Emacs Java programming language X Window System America Online Atari 8-bit family Opera (web browser) IBM PC compatible System 7 (Macintosh) Virtual memory World Wide Web Session Initiation Protocol Routing Windows Server 2003 Common Unix Printing System Internet privacy History of Microsoft Windows History of the Internet Streaming media Password Server Message Block Hello world program Lag Internet protocol suite HTTP cookie Asynchronous Transfer Mode PHP Open mail relay Open Shortest Path First DESQview Distributed computing Ping Zeroconf Universal Plug and Play Commodore 64 Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X Transmission Control Protocol Nintendo DS Wireless LAN PowerPC Mach kernel Internet security BitTorrent

pda touchscreen im a little confused with the touchscreen capability of a pda smartphone as when it has a stylus included does it mean that you have to use the stylus to touch the screen or can you use your own fingers when you want to dial numbers when you have a pda phone with a touchscreen you can use your fingers to dial numbers the stylus is there only to allow for greater precision with the touchscreen for example drawing or tapping on a small onscreen qwerty keyboard and to keep fingeprints off the screen with the large phone keypad input finger is fine as long as you're not eating fries with mayonaise at the time  Touchscreen Windows Mobile Game.com Nintendo DS Apple Newton Smartphone Tablet PC Pocket PC Game controller Computer keyboard Ebook Tungsten Handheld UK telephone numbering plan Handheld game console Rotary dial Mouse (computing) Kirby: Canvas Curse User interface Handwriting recognition Treo Palm OS Dial Telephone numbering plan BlackBerry Personal digital assistant Laptop Bluetooth Mobile phone IPAQ QWERTY Opera (web browser) WarioWare: Touched!
