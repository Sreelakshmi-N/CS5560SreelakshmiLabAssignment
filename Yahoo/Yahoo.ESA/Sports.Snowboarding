what's the differences between freestyle and freeride what's the difference in snowboards that's freestyle and freeride and what's twin park what are the other differences snowboards might have although there isn't a single definition freestyle is more about being dedicated to doing tricks like jibs butters and jumps freeriding is more about taking it all over the mountain groomers powder and a few jumps and hits the way that translates to boards is that freestyle boards tend to be slightly shorter and have more flex both longitudinal and torsional to be more forgiving on rails and hits likewise many freestyle boards are twin tipped twin park to allow easier switch landings and riding the ride dh would be one of many many boards that fall into this category freeride board tend to be a bit stiffer to facilitate better edge hold for carving likewise the board tends to be directional twins meaning they can be ridden switch as well but have a geometry that's optimized for going forward binding mounts set slightly back etc these are boards that are designed to go all over the mountain the burton custom is probably a good example of this type of board they say if you're just learning to ride a freestyle board is easier to learn b c they can be more forgiving but i think either type is fine it's just a matter of preference and what kind of riding you want to progress to in the future hope this helps  Skateboarding trick Windsurfing Ski Mountain bike Skiing Kitesurfing Bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain biking Pump It Up Car handling Golf club (equipment) Parkour Horse gait Equine conformation Powerbomb Freestyle music SSX 3 Unicycle Parachuting Central processing unit Anchor Volleyball Wakeboarding TGV Fast bowling Violin CPU cache Musical Canine Freestyle SSX Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Cross-country skiing M16 (rifle) Swimming BASE jumping Professional wrestling throws Billiards Circuit breaker Paragliding Glossary of climbing terms Prisoner's dilemma Internal ballistics Screw Sail-plan Dressage Compiler optimization Ethernet Skateboard Poker jargon Taikyoku shogi Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tire Knife Skateboarding X Games Messerschmitt Bf 109 Winter Olympic Games Kurt Angle Snooker Butters Stotch Mountain bike racing Strap-on dildo Mouse (computing) WQHT (FM) Heinkel He 100 BMX Roller skating Tai shogi Sailing Mario Kart 64 Amateur wrestling Lawn mower Aerial (dance move) Double bass Figure skating Fixed-wing aircraft Horse tack Python programming language Vector (spatial) Handloading Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Sermon on the Mount Rigging Quake III Arena Bodyboarding Motorcycle Einstein-Cartan theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Go (board game) Calgary, Alberta United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Typewriter English grammar School bus Medley swimming Yacht Electric guitar
