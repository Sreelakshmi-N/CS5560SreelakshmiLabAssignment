financial aid okay so fall semester is coming i messed up last and lost financial aid for a semester not enough completed hours they said if i do good in the fall i will get it back for the spring well guess what i don't have enough money to pay for fall out of state so i'm wondering if i can't get private student loans despite losing my financial aid eligibility for the fall also if i can't enroll this fall do i have to start loan payback i plan to enroll in the spring if so i might be screwed did you appeal your financial aid suspension with an extenuating circumstance or did you just goof off last year if you just goofed off you may be out of luck and really need to pay for fall but find out if the aid office requires you to be full time if you can swing a part time semester you may be able to stay in school or you can consider transferring to a more local community college for a year and doing better there are alternative loans for students who are on suspension so if you haven't applied for one get your butt in gear if you aren't in school for fall yes you will go into repayment on your loans in november december if you were in classes till the end of the spring semester you may be able to ask the servicer about forebearance however if you really will be back in school for spring you'll have to pay the interest due but your principle will be deferred just remember if you come out of repayment on this loan you won't get a grace period again on it so if you aren't enrolled again you need to be prepared to pay immediately  Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Academic term Education in Germany Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) Lend-Lease Mortgage Graduate school College admissions Islamic banking Tertiary education fees in Australia United Kingdom corporation tax Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Credit card Professor Kwantlen University College Juris Doctor Stock American University Education in Romania Princeton University Voluntary Student Unionism Bond Education in Portugal Tulane University Jeb Bush Debt Marshall Plan Dalhousie Student Union Brown University Community college Education in New Zealand University of Central Florida Money Deflation (economics) Education in Hong Kong Bretton Woods system Hyperinflation Microcredit Scholarship Cafeteria Bank Education in Australia Financial aid Annuity Walt Disney World College Program Social Security (United States) Developing countries' debt Paul Martin Virginia Military Institute Education in Taiwan Life insurance GED Gwinnett University Center Montgomery Blair High School U.S. public debt University of Houston Education in Japan University of Tennessee Hampshire College Chiropractic Bush v.

does financial aid pay your whole tuition if you are a part time student want to start going to school parttime but im not sure if financial aid would pay for it or do i have to come out pocket the answer is possibly depending on your eligibility for aid overall your actual enrollment most students who enroll less than half time usually less than credit hours per term are generally though not always not eligible for enough aid to cover whether or not you are in a degree program and the cost of your school it is a common misconception that students who are not full time are not eligible for aid and not eligible for coverage for tuition fees and books the best way to find out is to do the application and enroll most schools will allow you to drop or withdraw from all courses in the first week without penalty although you do need to ask to ensure you know the policy at your school  Student loan Graduate school Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Hong Kong Kwantlen University College Law school Education in Australia __cole Polytechnique Education in Germany Quizbowl Education in France Tuition GED British universities Medicaid Credit card Students' union Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Physician Medicare (United States) Taxation in the United States Community college Brown University Juris Doctor College admissions Virginia Military Institute School choice University of Michigan Unemployment benefit Cornell University Social Security (United States) Professor Life insurance University of British Columbia Alma Mater Society California Polytechnic State University Education in England University of Pretoria North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Centrelink Financial aid Insurance Queen's University 401(k) Higher Education Bill Glossary of American football Education in Malaysia Conscription Affirmative action Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Pennsylvania State University Dalhousie Student Union Education in New Zealand Berea College Public education Food Stamp Program Wal-Mart University of Rochester Higher education in Japan Nurse Certificate of deposit Emerson College Program for the Exceptionally Gifted Primerica Financial Services Education in Singapore Berklee College of Music Education in Japan Seneca College Dalhousie University Franklin W.

where can we find money for college i'm trying to help my friend get money for college we've tried loans my friend is getting some financial aid but not much at all not even of a semesters worth total income is under and we cant find anything to help us what should we do where can we find the money most important is how he filed his fafsa is he an independent student meaning he claims himself and his parents dont it sounds like that may be the case because of his income and he than qualifies for sub and unsubsidized federal perkin loans if he is a freshman it's really tough getting money the first two years you have to go plop yourself down in the fin aid office and make them find money options for you in seeking financial aid being a pain in the ass and persistence is not only a virtue it's the only way you get anywhere every college has loans for guys like your friends you have to apply early enough to get the money they have alloted also try finaid com i believe that's the site you can get to it from fafsa try all his families affiliations they have scholarships for every ethnic and union member it requires an essay but you just might get it if your friend is still be claimed by his parents then things they have to apply for a plus loan and if they are denied due to their financial obligations he will then qualify for both the sub and unsub federal loans if he was claimed by them for this year get him to become and independent student based on his earnings and the fact that he will not be living wit his parents he must not reside with them for one whole year so that means when school is out he needs another address to put down for the rest of the year maybe go to summer school i wish i could help more i know how hard it is i got daughters through college and it was pulling teeth to get money for them other sources of income for him he can give plasma it varies from state to state but he can make about a month whatever he does do not let him do the credit card fiasco he will never get out of debt and they want monthly payments immediately so he will have to pay while in school good luck ps work study which is given by the school and is nontaxable and part time job  Education in the United States Financial aid Education in Germany Graduate school Monetary policy Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bond Tuition Unemployment benefit 401(k) Interest Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Personal finance Scholarship Debt Taxation in the United States Life insurance Mortgage Credit union Unemployment Divorce Princeton University Tax Law school College Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Article One of the United States Constitution Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Hyperinflation Affirmative action Education in Romania Money supply Tertiary education fees in Australia Bank fraud Credit score FairTax Insurance Bretton Woods system Marshall Plan Deflation (economics) Capitalism Gold standard Students' union Schabir Shaik Trial Internet fraud Economy of El Salvador Finance National Insurance U.S. public debt Security (finance) Capital accumulation GED Microeconomics Economy of the United States Great Depression Barrister No Child Left Behind Act Culture of the United States Brown University Primerica Financial Services Food Stamp Program Undergrads Child support George W.

what could be reason as to why i'm not getting much money out of my school loans i'm not getting any asnwers from why my school and they are only lending me should it not be easy to get the amount you need from a school loan the federal government has limits to the amount you may borrow in a given year first year students are limited to a maximum of second year and third and fourth year students or i haven't dealt with those levels in a while if you are a dependent student while independent students may borrow additional funds there are still limits to that as well please keep in mind that grade levels are not measured by the number of years you are in college but by the number of credits you have successfully completed you can be in college for years but if you haven't successfully completed credits you are still a first year level student the reason it is not easier for you to get a federal student loan of greater amounts than this is that many students borrowed in the past with no concept of the total amount of the debt they were amassing the default rate failure to pay soared and the government stopped runaway lending your parents can borrow more than you can through a plus loan or one of you can borrow possibly through an alternative loan for more educational funds  Student loan Predatory lending Education in the United States Economy of Russia Deflation (economics) Money supply Debt Microcredit Bond Monetary policy Government debt Bank Inflation Money Islamic banking Gold standard Federal Reserve Interest Debt levels and flows Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Tertiary education fees in Australia Capitalism Corporation Security (finance) Savings and Loan crisis Education in New Zealand Usury U.S. public debt Debt consolidation Savings and loan association Bretton Woods system Economy of Pakistan Annuity Students' union Financial markets Fiat money Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) National Certificate of Educational Achievement History of the United States (1918-1945) No Child Left Behind Act Education in Portugal Capital accumulation Life insurance Unemployment benefit Finance Money creation Mortgage-backed security Education in Germany Bank fraud Hyperinflation Higher Education Bill Derivative (finance) Islamic economics Charter school Developing countries' debt Great Depression Tuition Fractional-reserve banking Affirmative action Betting (poker) Culture of the United States Short selling Slot machine Credit derivative Citigroup Corporate finance Free trade Taxation in the United States Deficit spending Education in Japan College United Kingdom corporation tax Education in Finland Marshall Plan Private school Tax School of Salamanca Credit score Hillary Rodham Clinton Annual percentage rate Money market Lend-Lease School accreditation Redundant array of independent disks Social Security debate (United States) Education in Austria Elections in the United States School choice Subsidy Juris Doctor

loans vs future ok i'm trying to transfer from my current college i hear people say all the time that it's an investment don't worry about the loans because they'll pay themselves back in either salary or happiness is this true or should i settle for the school that gives me the best financial aid package another important consideration is how much debt you would take on versus what your career plans are it isn't a huge problem for someone going to school to become a doctor to rack up tens of thousands of dollars in student debt because as a doctor they will likely pull a good salary once they graduate however if say you are getting an art history degree it doesn't make a lot of sense to rack up that much debt because your career prospects likely do not pay particularly well especially early on  Student loan Economy of Cuba Economy of Russia Bond Debt Education in the United States Government debt Graduate school Marshall Plan Economy of Africa School accreditation Bretton Woods system Donald Trump Education in the People's Republic of China Gross domestic product Social Security (United States) Mortgage Money College admissions Economy of the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economic relations of Japan Financial markets Economy of Argentina Theory of conduct Life insurance Princeton University Capital accumulation Asian financial crisis U.S. public debt Capitalism Higher Education Bill History of the United States (1918-1945) Stock Flat tax Professor The College of New Jersey Philosophical skepticism Security (finance) Avenue Q University of Pennsylvania Law School Unemployment Education in Japan Finance Derivative (finance) Citigroup Personal finance Warren Buffett Interest Economic inequality Health insurance Great Depression Economy of Fiji Economy of Niger Annuity Education in Germany Economy of Pakistan Developing countries' debt Economy of Brazil Bank University of Washington Economy of Chile Insurance Investment bank Academia Juris Doctor Education in Australia Piccolo Junior Saga Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Pitaten Goodness and value theory Financial analyst Live 8 Microeconomics Savings and loan association Tuition Seneca College Short selling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mensal__o scandal Assignment (law) Inflation Collateralized debt obligation Corporate finance General practitioner Hillary Rodham Clinton Temasek Holdings Economics Bank fraud Laura Ingalls Wilder FairTax Software patent debate Charles Ponzi Boston College Economy of Ghana Deficit spending Economy of Nigeria University of Central Florida

help on fafsa i live with my dad but he wont give me his information or pay for my school can i put my moms info cause she will give me it but i dont live with her what else can i really do unfortunately you have to have your legal guardian's information to fill out the fafsa which i assume is your father since you said you don't live with your mom many schools will actually require both parents' information in order to make a decision even if they won't help you with payment in order to be fair to students looking for financial assistance my suggestion would be have someone talk to your father and assure him that giving the information does nothing to him but it will help you get money for school the government uses it only for that reason and nothing else otherwise you need to look for scholarships  Child support Student loan Divorce Tuition Financial aid Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Insurance Fathers' rights Scholarship Bond Credit card Corporate governance RuneScape quests College admissions Tertiary education fees in Australia Free trade Graduate school Mr. and Mrs. Turner Education in the United States Adoption Mediation Establishment Clause of the First Amendment United Kingdom corporation tax Kyle Broflovski Terri Schiavo Fathers' rights movement in the UK Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Springfield Elementary School School choice Intelligence quotient Father Law School Admissions Test Transsexuality Independent school (UK) Economics Cindy Sheehan Advance fee fraud Guinevere Jones Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Affirmative action Grandview, U.S.A.

question about being poor and paying for college i graduated high school a few years ago however decided at that time not to go to college now i am in a few months and live on my own and have a very limited income i am considering going to college once again i was wondering due to my very low income if it would be possible to have my college expenses paid for by the government or some other organizaiton or if i would have to take out loans and pay them back at a later date thanks all of my income goes towards paying my current bills student loans good luck with the debt as for what the gentlemen a few avatars below me said he must have went to school eons ago you may be able to get a pell grant which means you don't have to pay anything back but ha good luck it's nearly impossible to get one thanks to our current president yes fill out a fafsa form from your school's financial aid office but beware student loan interest rates are not low they are above right now for a government loan i couldn't imagine how high the rates are for a private loan there are types of loans subsidized and unsubsidized with one you are paying interest while you are in school with the other the government is paying it for you with all it's true you don't have to pay anything back until you've been out of school for months be very careful only take out as little as you need  Financial aid Credit card Tuition Subsidy Gross domestic product Debt College admissions United Kingdom corporation tax Education in the United States Economy of Pakistan FairTax Education in New Zealand Mortgage Money Students' union Federal Reserve Interest Government debt Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Short selling Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Top-up fees History of the United States (1918-1945) Annuity Microcredit Debt consolidation Economy of Russia Barbara Boxer Real estate bubble Inflation 401(k) Unemployment Corporation Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Princeton University Security (finance) Municipal bond Tertiary education fees in Australia Islamic banking Bretton Woods system Gold standard U.S. public debt Capitalism Lend-Lease Education in Japan Insurance Tax Bank of England Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Tennessee State Constitution Health insurance Price discrimination Life insurance Economy of Cuba Deficit spending Social Security (United States) Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Cornell University Education in Germany Economy of Nigeria Deflation (economics) Debt levels and flows Interest rate Economy of Haiti Evan Mecham Sam Walton Corporate finance Personal finance Health care in the United States Taxation in the United States University of Rochester Bank Hillary Rodham Clinton GED Member of the European Parliament Economy of El Salvador Usury Capital accumulation Georgetown University Financial markets Economy of Mexico Deficit Springfield, Massachusetts Graduate school Money supply Higher Education Bill Small business Treasury security Economy of Chile Developing countries' debt Economy of India School of Salamanca British House of Commons

what's my best bet with student loans i am returning to school full time i've never taken out student loans before what's my best bet i don't particularly need a whole lot of money just something to help ease the strain of paying for tuition fill out the fafsa and have the results sent to your school they will tell you what you qualify for you may qualify for pell grants or some other form of aid you won't have to repay that will decrease the amount of money that you need to borrow make sure that you talk to the financial aid office about the fact that you'll be in school full time and will not have the same income that you used to when you fill out the fafsa they will ask about your income for last year which can cause you expected contribution to be high even though your income will probably decrease once you're in school usually the financial aid office has been through this before and has a procedure through which you can prove that your income has decreased and appeal the award amount as far as lenders when i went back to school the financial aid office gave me a list of lenders to choose from for my student loans look for a lender who covers the origination fees using one of the lenders on their list meant that they got my money electronically and i got what was left after tuition sooner they'll tell you the maximum you can borrow but if you need less you don't have to take that much good luck  Student loan Tuition Financial aid Bond Betting (poker) Mortgage Finance Short selling Bank Predatory lending Insurance Debt Financial markets Graduate school College admissions Annual percentage rate Education in the United States Tertiary education fees in Australia Craps Poker jargon Interest rate Subsidy Usury Education in the People's Republic of China Gold standard Education in New Zealand Unemployment benefit Government National Mortgage Association Economy of Pakistan Inflation Bretton Woods system Deflation (economics) Lender of last resort Stock Top-up fees Government debt Life insurance Developing countries' debt Islamic economics Economy of India Real estate broker Gross domestic product Students' union Money Education in Germany Corporation Debt consolidation Money supply Hyperinflation Dalhousie Student Union Central bank Personal finance Price discrimination Economy of Russia Mergers and acquisitions Payday loan Yield curve 2003 California recall Bank fraud Baccarat Rational pricing Social Security (United States) Monetary policy Scholarship Princeton University __cole Polytechnique Temasek Holdings Public education Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Gambling Article One of the United States Constitution Blackjack Variable universal life insurance Primerica Financial Services Law school Deficit Citigroup Title insurance Debt levels and flows Education in England Barack Obama Higher Education Bill British universities Municipal bond Anarchism and capitalism Margin (finance) Repurchase agreement Fixed income Barbara Boxer Education in Finland Sports betting Tony Blair

are private student loans a viable supplement to federal loans and scholarships i see alot of private student loan companies being advertised on tv these days i was wondering if these companies are legit and if this is a good idea for supplement funding when federal loans and scholarships don't cover everything first always make sure to exhaust scholarship and grant options first secondly i would not get involved with the companies that send you unsolicited offers in the mail the ones that are legit you will recognize because they will probably be through a well known and reputable bank or financial institution most programs that administer federal loans like sallie mae also have a private loan division this is good because when it is time for repayment you can get the same grace period for your federal loan that you receive with your federal loans and consolidation will also be easier i recommend going to sallie mae's website www salliemae com or contacting one of their customer service representatives with any questions your school's financial aid office is also an excellent source of information or your guidance counselor if you are still in high school good luck  Student loan Scholarship Education in the United States Bank Mortgage Citigroup Financial aid Education in the People's Republic of China Bond Soci__t__ G__n__rale No Child Left Behind Act Islamic banking Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Financial services E-mail spam Tertiary education fees in Australia Debt consolidation Security (finance) Savings and loan association Education in New Zealand Ross School of Business Marshall Plan College admissions GED Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology Credit card Finance Advance fee fraud Bretton Woods system Spam (electronic) Graduate school Ivy League Tuition Students' union University of Rochester Unemployment benefit University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Primerica Financial Services Federal Reserve University of Toronto Enron Corporation Education in Japan Debt World Bank Group Toronto-Dominion Bank Investment bank Dalhousie Student Union Education in Germany Wells Fargo Short selling Independent agencies of the United States government University of Pretoria Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Monetary policy History of the United States (1918-1945) Money supply Pharmaceutical company Corporation Cable television Internet fraud Canadian National Railway 401(k) The Standard British universities Small business Price discrimination College Mergers and acquisitions University of Virginia Culture of the United States Interest Education in Malaysia Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Independent school (UK) Elections in the United States Grameen Bank America Online Annuity Probation officer Legal aid Life insurance School choice European Union Fulbright Program Economy of Russia Stock Duke University Charter school Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan

having financial hardship student loan should i apply for a forbearance or deferment it is in your best interest to keep your loan in a payment status as to not extend the life of the loan and therefore increase the amount of interest you repay back if you can afford smaller payments call your student loan servicer to find out if you can change your repayment plan and if you can if there is a repayment plan that you can currently afford if you cannot afford a smaller payment and need to stop payment on your loans for a period of time a deferment is more beneficial to you than a forbearance however a deferment is usually harder to get as you have to meet specific eligibility requirements again call your student loan company they are trained to go over your options with you and advise you of what you qualify for during a period of deferment interest only accrues on the unsubsidized portion of your balance you will see no interest accruing on the subsidized portion technically the government pays that interest for you but that is behind the scenes hence why there strict eligibility guidelines also deferments have a limitation most are months cumlative for the life of your loan during a period of forbearance interest accrues on the entire balance you will get quarterly or bi annual interest statements while paying the interest during your forbearance or deferment is optional any unpad interest will capitalize add on to your balance when the deferment forbearance ends this creates the mess of interest on top of interest accruing some student loan companies have a cumlative cap on forbearance time too while some do not currently direct loan servicing center does not have a cap on how many monthsyour loan can be in a forbearance you will have to reaply as they can only be approved for month periods i hope this helped  Student loan 401(k) Annuity Life insurance Interest Credit card Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Mortgage Tertiary education fees in Australia Islamic banking Economy of Russia Marshall Plan Bank Taxation in the United States Mutual fund Lend-Lease Education in the People's Republic of China Government debt Bretton Woods system Deflation (economics) George W.

moving to tampa i want to move to tampa florida i currently live about hours away from tampa so it's not going to be such a huge change i just need some advice on how to go about doing it i'm so obviously i don't have much money i'm in college so most of my money goes to tuition and stuff i know i can get student loans and things like that but what about the apartment and living expenses i don't want to live in campus by the way i'm planning on getting a part time job but i don't think that will be able to pay for everything i will also be living with someone else so my rent won't be so much do you know any nice areas in tampa preferably close to the airport where i will work and close to fsu the college i want to attend any other advice about moving out for the first time student loans are intended to help pay all the costs of attending college not just the tuition when you apply for aid fill out the fafsa online and have the information sent to fsu they should tell you exactly what types of aid and how much you're eligible for consider all of your options you may be able to live more cheaply off campus but you may get more financial aid if you're on campus as far as moving advice save as much as possible before you move even if its only a little it'll help if you have more stuff to move than you can fit in the car consider greyhound you do more work you have to take it to a terminal and go get it on the other end but its cheaper than mail or ups look around your room and think about the things that you are used to having and won't be able to take with you those are the things you will need however talk to your roommate before you buy things so that you don't waste your money this includes shipping things to tampa if you don't need it don't pay to get in there if you change your mind later you can go get it or have somebody send it and you'll know you really needed it managing your money when you're on your own for the first time can be tough write everything down and think long term if you get loan money that's supposed to help pay your living expenses for the semester keep track of how much those bills are going to be so that you'll have enough to pay them this is especially important if you're trying to go to school and work since if you have to pick up extra hours because you didn't manage your money well it could cut down on the time you have for studying sounds like you're already thinking ahead so just keep doing that good luck  Student loan Education in Germany Florida State University Education in the People's Republic of China Tuition Education in the United States Graduate school Mutual fund University of Central Florida Financial aid College admissions Credit card Life insurance Internet fraud Mortgage Microeconomics Economics Gross domestic product University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign The Apprentice 2 Poker jargon Personal finance Price discrimination Florida International University Stock Seneca College Unemployment benefit Leeds United F.C.

would it be wise if i save my financial aid refund checks for fall spring save them for summer session so i won't have to take out loans for summer that sounds like a good idea i know you don't want to finish school and have a lot of debt however you are not getting much income now and i know you said you really ran short a couple of months you need to keep enough money to pay the co pay on any medications you need and you need to keep enough food in your house so that you will not become anemic again it might be nice to save that money as a little nest egg in case of an emergency after all what if you get hurt and need to take cabs places instead of walking you will need a little extra money i hope nothing happens to you but we have to expect the worst in order to prepare  Money FairTax Keynesian economics Student loan Hyperinflation Economy of Africa Deflation (economics) Personal finance Bond Poker jargon Debt Credit card Marshall Plan Inflation Short selling Mortgage Leeds United F.C.

is there any benefit to not consolidating student loans i graduated from college two years ago and never consolidated my student loans i believed possibly wrongly that consolidating was only important if i wanted to lower my monthly rates but it wouldn't have made a difference in the total cost of my student loan my plan was to pay off large chunks of the loan and to have it paid off quickly would consolidating have made a difference in my loans and will it make a difference now even though i've been paying the loans back for two years already there's a lot of hype out there about consolidation most of it from companies anxious to get hold of your loan volume the fact is consolidation isn't the right option for every student particularly if they're not having trouble meeting their monthly payment as you seem to be doing best thing to do is call your lender have them run your numbers and see if there is a benefit to you by consolidating rates have increased since you graduated so you may actually be better off if you don't consolidate most lenders can also include your separate loans on one bill so if that would make things easier for you you can ask them about that as well bottom line you're doing a smart thing by paying off more than the minimum monthly payment this will help you pay less interest over the life of your loan and set you on the way to financial health  Student loan Mortgage Bond Debt Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Life insurance Bank Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Annuity Government debt Annual percentage rate Redundant array of independent disks Subsidy Government National Mortgage Association 401(k) Primerica Financial Services Education in the United States Credit score Finance Capitalism Social Security (United States) Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment Security (finance) FairTax Interest rate Health insurance Economy of India Unemployment benefit Privatization Financial markets Gross domestic product Predatory lending Variable universal life insurance Graduate school Gold standard Central bank Tertiary education fees in Australia Personal finance Anarchism and capitalism Credit rating agency Compensation of employees Economy of Russia History of post-Soviet Russia Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Flat tax Bretton Woods system Hillary Rodham Clinton Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Donald Trump Short selling Economy of Argentina Payday loan Pension Free trade Usury Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Social Security debate (United States) Refinancing Derivative (finance) Citigroup Publicly funded medicine Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Universal life insurance Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Economy of El Salvador Affirmative action Islamic economics Federal National Mortgage Association Mutual fund Health care in the United States Economy of Nigeria Mortgage-backed security Divorce Call centre Money Cable television Savings and loan association Inflation Lehman Brothers Microcredit Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Barbara Boxer Financial services

can i pay back my student loans without interest so me and this guy at work both owe more than in student loans and we both dropped out of school i've been paying mine i have them consolidated so i have a lot of interest and i'll be paying them for a long time but he says he's not gonna pay his until the lenders hand the loan to the government and then he'll be forced to pay them back but he says the government won't charge interest they'll just ruin his credit for awhile so basically he's saying that i could just refuse to pay back my loans until the government gets a hold of them and then i don't have to worry about any interest the only consequence being my ruined credit and i don't plan on buying a house or new car anytime in the near future so that doesn't bother me is this guy out of his mind or is this the perfect scheme the reason it's called ruining your credit is because it lasts forever if you are in a difficult situation you can plead with sallie mae they can defer 'principle' payments for a while you'll just be paying interest but the debt will not be decreasing i cannot believe that the govt will not try to recoup all of their loast interest they certainly do it with taxes according to their website the consequences of default are severe the entire loan balance principal and interest can be immediately due and payable you ll lose your deferment options you won t be eligible for additional federal student aid your account might be turned over to a collection agency if so you ll have to pay additional interest charges late fees collection costs and possibly court costs and attorney fees these costs will really add up and it will take you even longer to pay off your student loan as mentioned earlier your account will be reported to national credit bureaus and your credit rating can be damaged you might find it very difficult to receive other types of credit such as credit cards car loans or mortgages because many landlords do credit checks it might be hard to rent an apartment some employers check to see if you re responsible by looking at your credit rating so bad credit could even affect getting a job on top of this your default will remain on your credit report for up to seven years your federal income tax refunds and in some states your state income tax refunds might be withheld and applied toward your loan repayment this happens a lot to defaulters and it can really hurt if you were counting on that refund your employer at the request of the loan holder may withhold garnish part of your wages you might be unable to obtain a professional license in some states  Annuity Insurance Deflation (economics) Debt FairTax Life insurance 401(k) Microeconomics Interest United Kingdom corporation tax Islamic banking Money Bank Unemployment benefit Child support Tax Economy of the United States Education in the United States Mutual fund Personal finance Flat tax Credit score Government National Mortgage Association Inflation Derivative (finance) U.S. public debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Citigroup History of the United States (1918-1945) Primerica Financial Services Tertiary education fees in Australia Federal National Mortgage Association Compensation of employees Subsidy Plame affair Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Debt consolidation Economy of Russia Great Depression Income tax Gold standard Leasing Payroll Tennessee State Constitution Bretton Woods system Schabir Shaik Trial Bank fraud Short selling Health insurance Mortgage-backed security Value added tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pension Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 United States Postal Service Conscription Credit repair Capitalism Money supply George W.

is it too late to get into college this spring hello i was looking at the fafsa website and it seems it's too late for me to get financial aid for the spring semester does this mean i can pretty much forget about going to school this spring i've never been to college before so i'm clueless about this process are there any other steps i should have already completed i know it probably depends on the college but in general thanks the deadline for fafsa is the preferred date to get your application in this is to be sure you get the most money in grants you can they do save some of the federal grant money for students who begin classes in the spring but the pot is a lot more empty than full you should apply for fafsa and may very well get a grant to assist with your schooling if you qualify you need to apply also if you were interested in taking out loans to help pay for school by completing the fafsa application you will then be eligible for federal stafford loans these are the best loans you can get to pay for school as they usually have the lowest interest rate and if you were to get unsubsidized stafford the government pays the interest while youre in school saving you some money go to http fafsa ed gov to complete your application for federal aid as for other steps to complete if you havent already apply to your school now within the next week that way you have enough time to get everything ready to attend in the spring then talk with the school you are going to attend to see what else they need you to do you will likely have to complete some additional paperwork at your college to finish the financial aid process  Student loan Financial aid College admissions Tuition Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in Germany Education in the United States Juris Doctor Credit card Walt Disney World College Program Annuity Taxation in the United States 401(k) Mortgage Academic term Life insurance GED Physician Education in Portugal Unemployment benefit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Princeton University Money Money supply Deflation (economics) Affirmative action Professor Keynesian economics Education in Romania Tulane University Education in Japan Grove City College Kwantlen University College College and university rankings Social Security (United States) Law school 2003 California recall Dalhousie Student Union Corporation Brown University United Kingdom corporation tax Capitalism Tertiary education fees in Australia Students' union British nationality law Interest rate Credit union Federal Reserve Islamic banking Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Savings and loan association College Minor league baseball Virginia Military Institute Microeconomics Monetary policy Legal aid Bond Georgetown University Charles Ponzi Economy of Pakistan Inflation Food Stamp Program Savings and Loan crisis Education in Australia Financial markets Public education Betting (poker) Primerica Financial Services United States Postal Service Economics Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology No Child Left Behind Act School accreditation Interest Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Subsidy United States Air Force Academy Undergrads Immigration to the United States Government debt Patent Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Barrister U.S. public debt Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Marshall Plan Community college Bologna process University of Central Florida Driver's license Barbara Boxer Enlargement of the European Union Economy of the United States Gold standard Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bretton Woods system

i filled out a fafsa application in may for the summer semester and because i was still living with my parents i didn't qualify for any financial aid it's still technically the school year but i'm not longer living with my parents i changed the information on my fafsa form but it's been a week and i see no change in how much they think i can pay out what am i doing wrong btw since i live on my own and besides that i'm old enough in the eyes of the government my parents' income has nothing to do with it so why aren't they seeing me as being poor unless you can answer yes to one of the dependency questions on the fafsa and you know what they are since you've already filled it out your parents income will be used to calculate your financial need yes it sucks but we all go through it my parents kicked me out when i told them i was a lesbian that didn't change the fact that i had to use their tax information in order to submit the fafsa of course i could also go into the fact that since my partner of years and i are not allowed to be legally married i'm viewed as a dependent student when i would have become independent a long time ago if we were an opposite sex couple but i digress i do empathize with your situation my suggestion would be to talk to a financial aid adviser if you can get one of them in your corner it could do wonders explain your situation as honestly as possible and ask what they can do for you as you really want to continue your education good luck  United Kingdom corporation tax Financial aid College admissions Same-sex marriage in Canada Tuition Theory of conduct Marriage Education in the United States Divorce Student loan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sex education Human sexual behavior Education in Romania God Emperor of Dune Plame affair Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Gross domestic product SAT Same-sex marriage Life insurance Social rule Transsexuality Education in Germany Little Britain Separation of church and state Child sexuality Civil union Paul Martin GED Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Abortion debate Ex-gay Infantilism Tax Scientology beliefs and practices Motion picture rating system Civil unions in the United Kingdom Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Laura Schlessinger One Tree Hill (TV series) Economics Juris Doctor Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Adoption Education in England Piccolo Junior Saga British House of Commons Social Security (United States) Economic inequality Education Karl Rove Legal aspects of transsexualism Polyamory Productive and unproductive labour Jean Grey 2000 Australian Grand Prix Breastfeeding Sharon Tate Academic term Same-sex marriage in the United States French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Expert system Section 28 Contract Normal distribution Supply and demand Capital accumulation Education in Japan Age of consent Sexual orientation Aesthetic Realism National Insurance German student movement Password Code: Lyoko Unemployment Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Democracy Domestic violence MPAA film rating system Professor Strap-on dildo Federal Marriage Amendment Copyright law of the United Kingdom British nationality law Barrister Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Same-sex marriage in Spain U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Inflation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sin City Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Haven (TNG episode) Negima Futurama (TV series - season 5)

financial help unforseen circumstances have caused my family and i to move to the us we just got here so i am just starting to send in my applications for college for this fall semester i'm so glad some colleges have rolling admissions anyways i'm so worried about the cost of it all its too late to apply for financial aid for this semester is there anything i can do in order to lower the cost of the tuition we moved from singapore and that's where i've been for years but i am an american citizen if that helps my parents want me to get into an actual university as opposed to a community college though please help i'm going to get a job but what else can i do about the cost loans what else please let me know thanks since you missed the deadline for filing the fafsa federal student aid you can only go after scholarships and loans most scholarships will also have been designated at this point so you probably can only get loans for this semester my suggestion would be to put off school for a year it isn't ideal but you can't get federal loans without filing the fafsa on time and private loans have much higher interest rates if you qualify then you can also get government grants many schools also look at the fafsa to determine your financial need i didn't qualify for government assistance but my school was expensive enough that they used that form to determine my need for them if you really must start this year determine the university you are most interested in and ask them what community college courses they will accept then take those courses for a much cheaper price and transfer into a school next year  Student loan Tuition Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Financial aid Graduate school Education in Germany College admissions Affirmative action Education in Hong Kong Juris Doctor Kwantlen University College Education in New Zealand Culture of the United States Community college Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Scholarship Brown University Price discrimination Education in Portugal Life insurance Tertiary education fees in Australia Law school Subsidy Asian financial crisis GED Princeton University College Inflation Taxation in the United States Education in Australia University of Rochester Cornell University Academic term Grove City College Credit card Insurance Tulane University Divorce Privatization Appeal Professor 401(k) Students' union Education in Taiwan Pitzer College Middle Tennessee State University Higher education in Japan Bond Hopkins School Physician Microeconomics University of Central Florida Franklin W.

student loan interest i have balance for student loans at interest i have a fixed payment plan for months after months what is the total amount of interest i would have paid is this to much and is there a way to reduce this amount i went to a website that said i would pay in intrest and thats a lot of money i hope this is incorrect this loan is also consolidated through aes wow has anyone else noticed the exponential growth of spammers on these boards lately just in this page alone there's of them with their affiliate hyperlinks leading to whatever loan page as mentioned earlier paying more than what's listed on your minimum due greatly reduces interest later on also make biweekly payments instead of just a monthly payment for example if your payment happens to be each month send one payment every two weeks of the month instead of just one payment every four weeks what that does is make the first go straight into principal since interest hasn't accrued just yet for the month while the second payment goes into principal interest if your school loan accrues interest monthly which it more than likely does doing this simple procedure can reduce your total interest by over over the full course hope this helps  Student loan Interest Mortgage Annuity Credit card Bretton Woods system Bond Primerica Financial Services Deflation (economics) Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Annual percentage rate Islamic banking Refinancing Economy of Russia Collateralized mortgage obligation Tertiary education fees in Australia Debt FairTax 401(k) Personal finance Marshall Plan Life insurance Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance Gold standard Certificate of deposit Short selling Keynesian economics Schabir Shaik Trial Hyperinflation Athenian democracy National Insurance Government debt Unemployment benefit Weimar Republic Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Salary cap Free trade Surplus value Savings and loan association Universal life insurance Municipal bond Collateralized debt obligation Pension Deficit spending Economy of Argentina History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of El Salvador International Monetary Fund Treasury security Leasing Leasehold estate Social Security (United States) Treaty of Versailles History of post-Soviet Russia Security (finance) Lend-Lease London Congestion Charge Islamic economics Income trust Dog agility Bank fraud Credit score Minimum wage Graduate school Stopping e-mail abuse Mensal__o scandal Advance fee fraud Dividend Fixed income Tennessee State Constitution Internet fraud Education in the United States Education in New Zealand Tax Wal-Mart Euro Mutual fund Economy of Pakistan Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Exponential growth Actuarial notation Brady Bonds Social Security debate (United States) Stock Octopus card E-mail spam Futures contract Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Derivative (finance) Mortgage-backed security Variable universal life insurance

student loans anybody use atstrive do you really not have to pay until after you graduate or is there a catch is a student loan a good option most student loans allow you to pay after you graduate but remember most of them charge you interest while you're in school some of the private lenders charge a fee for not paying while in school so make sure you read the fine print before you apply for a private student loan make sure you get federal student loans first they generally have the lowest interest rates and most generous repayment terms you must start by filling out the fafsa fafsa ed gov if federal aid doesn't cover all the cost only then should you get a private student loan private loans are not guaranteed by the government so the lender takes a greater risk by lending the money because of this most of them are credit based meaning you qualify based on your credit rating if yours isn't good having a cosigner with good credit can help the better your credit is the better interest rate they'll offer you best to stick with a large reputable lender who has a lot of experience with student loans good luck  Student loan Mortgage Predatory lending Bank Bond Debt Deflation (economics) Government debt Interest Education in the United States Usury Credit card Insurance Government National Mortgage Association Financial aid Tuition Money Monetary policy Debt consolidation Finance 401(k) Short selling Financial markets Life insurance Graduate school Subsidy Education in Germany Corporation Microcredit Annuity Citigroup Tertiary education fees in Australia College admissions Top-up fees Payday loan Lender of last resort Inflation Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of Pakistan Annual percentage rate Privatization United States Postal Service Interest rate Gold standard Capitalism Mortgage-backed security Municipal bond Donald Trump Deficit Federal National Mortgage Association Title insurance Economy of the United States Stock Repurchase agreement School of Salamanca Poker jargon Islamic economics United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of India Savings and loan association Unemployment benefit Financial services Refinancing Anarchism and capitalism Savings and Loan crisis Bretton Woods system Hyperinflation GED Fractional-reserve banking Developing countries' debt Capital accumulation Rational pricing Credit score Economics Public education Publicly funded medicine Gross domestic product Barbara Boxer Education in Australia Primerica Financial Services Temasek Holdings Futures contract Great Depression Microeconomics Credit union Security (finance) Education in Portugal

how can i make extra money with my student loan is there any way that i can make some money with my student loan so i can buy a cheap car after you've covered tuition room board books then you might consider investing of course you can just as easily lose money rather than make money if you want to do it quickly then you need to focus on assets that can be liquidated easily like stocks or commodities like oil pork bellies foreign currencies etc in order to generate profit you're going to have to be able to predict what's likely to go up quickly which means you're going to be looking at something that is likely to be volatile in price that means the investment is likely to be more risky as well all in all unless you have experience in trading and a good sense of the market unlikely if you're in here shopping for advice on this topic you're better off using the leftover for a small down payment on an inexpensive car and financing the rest just get a decent part time job to cover the payments and expenses of owning a car insurance gas maintenance etc  Arbitrage Commodity markets Bond Derivative (finance) Futures contract Insurance Monetary policy Mutual fund Inflation Deflation (economics) Money Finance Security (finance) Stock Economy of the United States Bank Corporate finance Economy of Russia Gold standard Gross domestic product Capitalism Personal finance Great Depression Hyperinflation Government debt Microeconomics Keynesian economics Short selling Speculation PE ratio Money supply Economy of Pakistan United Kingdom corporation tax Stock market Economy of Romania Life insurance Economy of Nigeria Bretton Woods system Corporation Economics Interest Supply-side economics Asian financial crisis Free trade Surplus value Citigroup Tax Debt Financial markets Health insurance Federal Reserve 401(k) Investment bank Economy of Africa Privatization Economy of Venezuela Temasek Holdings Economy of Kuwait Toronto-Dominion Bank History of the United States (1918-1945) Financial capital Euro Economy of Chile Foreign exchange market Warren Buffett Institutional fund management Economy of the Philippines Day trading Annuity Balance of payments Economic relations of Japan Student loan Tesco Economy of the Netherlands Monetarism Rational pricing Mortgage Eugene Fama Predatory lending Wal-Mart Graduate school Mergers and acquisitions Economy of Argentina Economy of Bulgaria Gold as an investment Mikhail Khodorkovsky Hedge fund Technical analysis Fractional-reserve banking Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Exchange rate Anarchism and capitalism Collateralized debt obligation Productive and unproductive labour

at what age in california are you considered an independent in terms of financial aid ok i'm wondering since i'm pretty old now and was denied financial aid when i was younger b c of my parents can i ever get it again i have no job no money to speak of in my bank account but it seems they always look at my dad's work and say forget you am i old enough yet to apply again and not get denied our govt is so screwed sometimes i have a gpa well unfortunately i can honestly answer no to all those questions next year i'll be starting my ma does that mean i'll get cut from funding for that federal financial aid is the same across the u s the age that you become financially independent from your parents is however there are also other factors which are considered at the beginning of the school year will you be working on a master's or doctorate program such as an ma mba md jd ph d edd or graduate certificate etc as of today are you married do you have children who receive more than half of their support from you do you have dependents other than your children or spouse who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you now and through june are a both of your parents deceased or b are you or were you until age a ward dependent of the court are you currently serving on active duty in the u s armed forces for purposes other than training are you a veteran of the u s armed forces if you can answer yes to any of these questions you will be considered an independent student for federal financial aid purposes the only difference i am aware of when it comes to state aid in california is that students who are in registered domestic partnerships or students whose parents are in registered domestic partnerships are supposed to have those unions treated the same as a legal marriage in other words for state financial aid a student who is a registered domestic partner would be considered independent however because the federal government does not recognize domestic partnerships they are still considered dependent when it comes to federal student aid i understand your frustration believe me i wish you luck with school by the way when you do become an independent student i would highly recommend applying for the cal grant with no money and a gpa like yours i can't imagine how you wouldn't receive one  Same-sex marriage Graduate school Civil union Divorce Marriage Domestic partnerships in California Student loan Education in the United States Same-sex marriage in Canada Education in Germany Civil unions in the United Kingdom Corporation Domestic partnership Federal Marriage Amendment Law school Same-sex marriage in the United States Separation of church and state Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Polyamory Social Security (United States) Common-law marriage Annuity Child support Legal aspects of transsexualism Political subdivisions of New York State Culture of the United States Taxation in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Life insurance Alimony No Child Left Behind Act Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Gross domestic product University of Southern California Age of consent Family College admissions Education in Hong Kong Insurance Scholarship Fathers' rights Charter school Domestic violence Professor Theory of conduct GED Pledge of Allegiance Same-sex marriage timeline Notary public Conscription College Civil rights Juris Doctor Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Tax Who is a Jew?

if you are set to recieve a federal student loan do yu still have to pay tuition and just wait to get it back because of my income they say i dont qualify for grants but they did say that i will be recieving federal student loans but i just want to know if i have to pay first and then wait to get paid back or if once they know i am recieving student loans if they just wait the thirty days till they release it or if i still have to pay it and jsut wait to get it back this all depends how long before classes start that you applied and were approved for the loan if it were after the classes started you would have to make payments to the school until they received your loan money since classes typically start late aug for the fall semester you probably have enough time to wait for the loan to be dispursed check with your financial aid office to be sure though they would be able to give you a more specific answer to your situation  Student loan Graduate school Education in the United States Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Tuition Credit card 401(k) Students' union Financial aid Dalhousie Student Union Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Bond Unemployment benefit Article One of the United States Constitution Princeton University Credit score Tertiary education fees in Australia Mortgage Money Mutual fund Cheque Professor Tax Debt Personal finance Predatory lending Franklin W.

i recently received a scholarship that will pay for tuition and books i also have a pell grant and a stafford loan plus another student loan from sallie mae i found out that the college cancelled the sallie mae student loan why did they do this and why wasn't i able to keep it i will be the one to have to pay it back the financial aid office would have been the one's to cancel your sallie mae signature loan and be glad the reason we cancel or adjust loans and other aid when you receive additional scholarships and grants is because we can't allow you to have aid over your cost of attendance depending on the types of aid and amounts the school will determine what gets cancelled adjusted first in most cases the private loan will always be adjusted first again be glad private loans have high variable interest rates that are not tax deductible and are just plain a bad bargain if you have other options  Student loan Education in the United States Financial aid Tuition Education in New Zealand Taxation in the United States Life insurance Scholarship Insurance Tertiary education fees in Australia Subsidy Education in the People's Republic of China 401(k) School choice Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Germany Bond United States Postal Service Debt Interest Federal National Mortgage Association United Kingdom corporation tax Bretton Woods system Mortgage-backed security Gross domestic product College admissions Supply and demand Students' union Price discrimination FairTax Graduate school Debt consolidation Education in Japan Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Money Public education Surplus value Affirmative action British universities Government National Mortgage Association Capitalism Interest rate Dalhousie Student Union Variable universal life insurance Inflation University of Rochester Cornell University GED Weighted average cost of capital Top-up fees Health insurance Food Stamp Program Flat tax SAT Evan Mecham Keynesian economics Culture of the United States Islamic banking Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Neocolonialism Economy of El Salvador Bank Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Capital gains tax Microcredit Deficit spending Gold standard Financial endowment Pitzer College Economics Collateralized mortgage obligation Barbara Boxer Grove City College Personal finance Labour economics Citigroup Developing countries' debt Employee stock option Economy of Pakistan Deflation (economics) Tax Higher Education Bill Savings and loan association Corporation Capital accumulation Profit Atari 8-bit family Federal Reserve History of post-Soviet Russia Security (finance) Education in Hong Kong Donald Trump

what the worst that can happen financial aid i took a federal loan years ago for college under my parent name because i was not eligible to take it under my name when i took the loan the financial aid office told me that if my mom is not able to pay back the loan i will be transferred to my name i did not have a problem with that b c my mom is really old yrs it was all fine untill six month ago that the loan people start calling i called them back and tell them that my mom is not working now i will pay the loan back when i graduate but they are forcing me to make a payment plan now treatning me that if this loan is not paid for they are going to take a federal action against my mom i have two little brother in th grade the other in th grade they might need financial aid later if they decide to go to college what the worst that can happen if payment plan is not made now i will be graduating spring next year and plan to pay this loan back what the worst that can happen this loan is uder my moms name the loan people are actually treatning her to make payment she wanted me to talk to the loan people the question is what the worst that could happen to her if i decide not to make a payment plan now this could negatively affect your credit and any current and future financial aid i would first go to your school's financial aid office and talk with them and see if they can do anything from their side so you can get it deferred but depending on the type of loan it is that may not be a possibility if that doesn't work try talking with the company organization directly that the loan is through and explain the situation to them and see if they can work something out with you in regards to deferment or smaller payments until you graduate whatever you do do not decide to just not worry about it until you graduate because by then it could be too late to fix or take too long to fix the damage that may be caused by not paying on it  Student loan Bond Mortgage 401(k) Life insurance Deflation (economics) Citigroup Debt Insurance Annuity Credit score Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the United States Money Derivative (finance) Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Education in the People's Republic of China Bretton Woods system Short selling Interest Islamic banking Asian financial crisis 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Freeters Health insurance Gold standard Government National Mortgage Association Marshall Plan Graduate school Donald Trump Taxation in the United States Treaty of Versailles Martin J.

my husband and i have poor credit we own a house and we make about a month can we get a loan we just got behind and now we can't catch up i think that you should visit a debt consolidator it sounds like a loan would only add to your troubles in the meantime you should eliminate all expenses you don't absolutely have to have ie cable television entertainment such as eating out and watching movies at theatres curb your food preferences and eat more simply a few times a week its amazing how focusing on tailoring your expenses can really work in your favor so that you can more quickly pay off your bills figure out what you can live without and then give it the ax at least for now if you have a really high car payment consider selling it and getting something real econimical until you are in a better position to pay high monthly payments for a car if you have kids its a good time to teach them about living within their means and looking at their spending habits turn down your air conditioner and summer and your heater in the winter and turn off lights when they are not being used all year long every little bit adds up if you can cut a month and that's less than of what you bring in less than a day from your monthly budget by prioritizing and cutting down on unnecesary expenses you will have saved a year this should go a long ways toward paying your bills and hopefully helping you catch up the thing about loans is that you will be paying interest on it that probably isn't what you really want especially if you are now paying interest on your credit cards it just doesn't make good financial sense  Mortgage Credit card Gross domestic product Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hyperinflation Personal finance FairTax Economy of Russia Money Student loan The Amazing Race Debt Deflation (economics) Interest Insurance Bond Economy of the United States Annuity Credit score United Kingdom corporation tax Primerica Financial Services Government debt History of the United States (1918-1945) Capital accumulation Life insurance Great Depression Internet fraud Keynesian economics Debt consolidation Microeconomics Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Inflation Animal Crossing EastEnders Short selling Social Security (United States) Government National Mortgage Association Home Box Office Gold standard Donald Trump Theory of conduct Leasing Leeds United F.C.

is it ok to use the same essay when applying for diffident scholarships can i just write one or two essays and submit them to a number of different scholarships as long as the topics coincide with what the scholarship is asking for or should i write a new essay for each one i apply for you could do this but i wouldn't recommend this even if the question is the same the scholarships are different if one scholarship is for just an example left handed students and the question is how have you overcome discrimination in your life the best essay would likely discuss the problems with being left handed in a righty world but if you are also applying for a scholarship for children of immigrants and they asked the exact same question your essay should address the discrimination you faced as a st generation american know your audience not just the topic  GED Theory of conduct SAT C.

stafford loan i am enrolled in courses credit hours and have completed all the federal requirements to obtain a federal stafford loan i am slated to begin classes on however in applying for my financial aid stafford loan the fin aid dept states that i have to take a partial compass test before disbursing any monies to me from a stafford loan stating the admissions process is incomplete the reasoning for a compass test is that all my education is more than years old is in contrast to the degree that i am seeking therefore requiring the compass test however i am seeking a waiver of the remaining portions of the compass test based on work history etc my question is if i am not admitted how is it possible that i am able to enroll take classes if the federal government doesn't require a test for loans as long as i have met the requirements fin need eligible degree program enrollment etc am actively pursuing a degree can the school not disburse the it sounds like the compass test is required to complete the admission process at your school and since you havent completed it they havent been able to check off that box on their form to say you are fully admitted you will need to talk with the person at your school where you are seeking the waiver to let them know that this decision is holding up the dispursement of your financial aid award they should get the decision finalized before your classes start if the government will not dispurse the money to them until all admissions paperwork is completed then they do not have the money to give you yet and what is the problem with taking the test anyway if you have work experience with the material then you should be able to pass a test on it good luck and it will likely be figured out before you start classes  Education in the United States College admissions Law school Student loan Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Education in Australia Education in Germany United States Naval Academy Financial aid Master's degree Medical school Community college Immigration to the United States Unemployment benefit Education in Romania Monetary policy Credit card Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Portugal Grade (education) Extreme Programming Money supply GED Appeal Cornell University Attorney at Law Physician School accreditation Brown University Annuity Education in Malaysia Lawyer Architect IB Diploma Programme United States Air Force Academy No Child Left Behind Act Affirmative action Economy of the United States Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Driver's license SAT Expert system The Amazing Race College Education Education in Austria Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Equal Protection Clause Middle Tennessee State University Economy of Nigeria Economics 401(k) Homeschooling Virginia Military Institute Halting problem Capitalism Education in Finland Bretton Woods system Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Law School Admissions Test Stevens Institute of Technology Education in Sweden Marshall Plan Bush v.

le cordon bleu is it worth the money i am thinking of attending but i do not know what type of financial aide is available i was wondering once graduated can you come out as a soux chef my son will be attending in october taking the baking and patisserie class this school is extremely expensive but you have to consider that this is a private school think about all what you're getting and that will somewhat ease your mind about the tuition the first person who answered you said it wasn't worth the cost and to attend a community college my son did this for two years while in high school and though he learned the basics in the kitchen he didn't learn enough being a graduate from le cordon bleu will get you a foot in the door in any food industry in the world if you want to move to another city and there's a school in the area all you have to do is walk in and say you're a graduate and they will assist you in getting a job as for financial aid my son is applying for financial aid and he just got approved for the first fiscal year including his rent for the time he'll be in school sallie mae is handling everything if you live near a le cordon bleu make an appointment with an admissions counselor to tour the school you will be impressed as for the soux chef i don't know about that because like i said my son is taking baking and patisserie but it wouldn't surprise me if you could get hired as one my husband flew my son to new york in november for the chocolate show and my son met keegan food network and jacques torres famous chocolatier he has pictures with both of them and it was the highlight of his trip you'll get much more respect being a grad from le cordon bleu than a regular community college i highly recommend you look further into this to let you make your own decision  Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Julia Child Epcot Le Cordon Bleu Education in Romania College admissions Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany GED Tuition Education in England Japanese tea ceremony Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Community college Education in Australia University of Bristol Berkshire Hathaway Economics Education in Portugal Friends Warren Buffett John J.

student loans i have a couple of questions regarding loans and schloarships here is some background info i want to transfer to transfer to a less expensive college in the winter term so i would be leaving my current school after this month having just earning my associate degree in computer information security my grace period to my best knowledge would start in sept march months so if i attend school in the winter at the other school and pay up front would my loans halt since i am in school with the grace perid or would i have to pay them back after the grace period while attending another school if i were to earn a scholarship grant could i apply that towards my loan debt any help would be apprecaitedtowards some of my decisions in this matter if i understand your question i think i am in a good position to answer as long as the school you are transferring to is accredited or to simplify things as long as the school you are transferring to is set up to receive federal funds you will not go into repayment you won't go into repayment until after you complete your degree or withdraw and there is probably some fine print stuff i am not familiar with if you got a scholarship that paid you cash you could use it as you pleased but it would have to be huge money otherwise you'd have to take out debt to pay for the remainder of your education and then what would be the point if you are worried about debt and you should be and you are lucky enough to get a scholarship use it to pay tuition and expenses and save anything left over that debt isn't going anywhere and you have a grace period before interest comes due assuming all your debt is currently in subsidized staffords any grants you get institutional or otherwise aren't going to make for a surplus that would allow you to pay down your previous debt i don't care how low your efc is but if that should happen write a book explaining what you did and than save that surplus until you go into repayment or begin accruing interest there's no need to pay it back until it starts costing you money in interest to clarify the first point the federal government doesn't give grant money ect to just any school calling itself an institution of higher learning that's not to suggest that higher education at accredited institutions isn't a scam to some degree but i digress anyhow make sure your new school is set up to receive federal aid that is is recognized by the federal government as an institution worthy of aid funds and meeting its degree granting requirements  Bond Education in the United States Credit card Tertiary education fees in Australia Mortgage Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Tuition Education in the People's Republic of China Debt Monetary policy Life insurance School accreditation FairTax Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Financial aid Gross domestic product Tax Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Government debt Education in Germany U.S. public debt Interest Insurance Scholarship Federal Reserve Marshall Plan Trust (Law) USA Deficit spending Unemployment benefit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Bretton Woods system No Child Left Behind Act School choice Taxation in the United States Financial markets Flat tax Social Security debate (United States) Academia Community college Treasury security Education in New Zealand Security (finance) Money Barrister 401(k) Keynesian economics Money supply Education in England Education Juris Doctor Divine grace Price discrimination Labor theory of value Inflation Education in Australia Economy of Pakistan School of Salamanca Bank Stock Microcredit Philosophical skepticism Savings and loan association Top-up fees Higher Education Bill Islamic banking Advance fee fraud Short selling Ra (board game) Developing countries' debt Bank fraud College Predatory lending History of the United States (1918-1945) George W.
