animals on the titanic i have just read somewhere that there were animals perhaps elephants that survived the titanic i cant find anything to confirm this so assume its not true can anyone comment i know there were a couple of dogs that survived being on the first few lifeboats that went out but elephants film and books about the titanic have primarily focused on the lives of people on the ship very few have made note of the animals and rightly so since most people believe that human life is more important than the lives of animals but was this the belief of the survivors if the titanic had not sunk in the early hours of monday april first class passengers would have participated in a dog show latter that day many pets were on the fatal voyage francis millet noted with some irony that the ladies in first class carried tiny dogs and lead husbands around like pet lambs a french bulldog newfoundland dog chow airdale pomeranian and pekinese were some of the dog breeds on board it is not surprising that there were animals on the titanic ships have always transported animals between the east and the west during slavery animals and slaves were placed in the same cargo hold on sail ships the subsequent years saw steamships carrying animals in the lower deck that was known as steerage in the nineteenth century when steamships started to move many immigrants from europe to america third class passengers were placed in steerage with the animals the owners of these animals paid for their transportation but some animals most notably rats took a free ride consequently ships tried to control its rodent population by bringing cats on board at the beginning of the twentieth century shipping companies built bigger and bigger steamships in order to make as much money as possible from transporting the many immigrants to america the idea to build the titanic was conceived in the summer of the great ocean liner was constructed in ireland and launched on may sea trials followed when the steamship set sail from southampton england on its maiden voyage on april it is believed that there was a significant rodent population on the vessel the liner struck an iceberg in the late evening of april th and forever changed the lives of people an estimated rats many dogs and at least one pig on board the chivalry of the day required that women and children be placed on the lifeboats first this act doomed many men to an early death the women were understandably scared but some were also self centered and selfish referring back to francis millet s remark that the ladies in first class carried tiny dogs and lead husbands around like pet lambs it may come as no surprise to learn that women took their dogs and a pet pig with them into the lifeboat while husbands were left to drown with thousands of rats having said the above one should note that one animal actually earned his right to be rescued when it became evident that the ship would sink men released the dogs from their kennels most of the dogs eventually drowned but rigel a black newfoundland dog was able to swim until the rescue ship carpathia arrived survivors in one lifeboat were too weak to shout when the ship was about to run them over but rigel who had been swimming in the icy water for three hours was still strong enough to bark captain rostron heard the dog and ordered the ship to stop swimming in front of the lifeboat the dog led the survivors to the starboard gangway the first officer of the titanic was the owner of rigel this officer went down with the ship so jonas brigg a sailor on the carpathia adopted the dog rigel was called a hero and did not seem to have any ill effects from the disaster hero status cannot be attributed to the other four dogs and the pig which were rescued it can also be noted that some survivors did not earn that status as well in the end all that can be said is that people met their doom upon the high seas with approximately two thousand rats while survivors choose to save dogs and a pet pig  RMS Lusitania Ship TSMS Lakonia General Slocum J.

why do you sneeze when you stare up at the sun well at least i do it's called the photic sneeze reflex it's a defined entity and about of the population have this when you look at a bright light after coming out of a dark room and you have this irresistible urge to start sneezing this has been investigated by the us military because they were a bit worried about their fighter pilots flying towards the sun and going into a sneezing fit they don't know exactly what's happening at the nerve level but what we think is happening is that there's a bit of cross wiring going on when you look at the sun your pupil closes up and it gets much much smaller in order to stop as much light getting into your eye but sometimes this can get a bit muddled up with the bit of the brain that thinks that your nose must be irritating this triggers a sneeze instead in the old days people used to think that when you look at the sun it made your eyes water and the tears trickled down your nose making you sneeze they did some experiments to test this and found that the tears would trickle too slowly to make you sneeze so we think at the moment that it must be cross wiring  Photic sneeze reflex Sneeze Eye Light Sun Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Milton H.

where did the expression your name is mud come from a friend of mine said it has something to do with a relative of hers so i was curious if anyone had any ideas about the origin of the term john wilkes booth broke his leg while escaping after shooting abraham lincoln in he was given medical help by dr samuel mudd who didn't then know about the assassination mudd was convicted of being booth's conspirator although he is widely believed to have been innocent actually whether mudd was innocent or not is of little consequence in regard to the origin of this phrase it was in general circulation before lincoln was assassinated this comes from john badcock's aka 'j bee slang a dictionary of the turf etc mud a stupid twaddling fellow and his name is mud ejaculated upon the conclusion of a silly oration or of a leader in the courier the phrase appears to be one of the many that when a news story arises match the gist of the story and later become associated with it  John Wilkes Booth Samuel Mudd Abraham Lincoln Gettysburg Address Assassins (musical) John F.

where does the phrase hold down the fort come from i got this one off website i think it did a good job of explaining and i quote hold the fort holding the fort take responsibility for managing a situation while under threat or in crisis especially on a temporary or deputy basis or while waiting for usual additional help to arrive or return 'hold the fort' or 'holding the fort' is a metaphor based on the idea of soldiers defending holding a castle or fort against attack by enemy forces fort and fortress are old english words that have been in use since the 's in their present form deriving from french and ultimately latin fortis means strong which gives us several other modern related words fortitude and fort for example the first recorded use of 'hold the fort' is particularly noteworthy and although earlier use might have existed there seems little doubt that this story was responsible for establishing the expression so firmly and widely the expression seems first to to have come to prominence in american civil war newspapers and other reports notably that of daniel webster whittle us civil war army major evangelist and writer of semaphore flag messages exchanged on october between general sherman and john corse a commander of th division fifteenth corps who defended a crucial position because it contained a million and a half rations with men reports vary at the battle of altoona pass near atlanta ga when attacked and outnumbered by men and heavy artillery of the confederate army under the command of general samuel french corse's men suffered casualties of between a third and a half but against all odds held their position inflicting huge losses on the enemy forcing them to withdraw after the battle newspapers reported that sherman had sent a semaphore message from a distant hilltop to corse saying 'hold the fort i am coming wt sherman ' according to these reports the message had a stirring effect on corse's men although corse it seems maintained that he had successfully held the position without sherman's assistance and ironically sherman seems later to have denied sending such a message at all whatever the story of the battle and sherman's message and its motivating effect on corse's men established the episode and the expression in american folklore  Franco-Prussian War Franklin-Nashville Campaign Vicksburg Campaign Price's Raid American Civil War Military history of Canada Irish Guards Battle of Shiloh Battle of Gettysburg Napoleonic Wars Battle of Chancellorsville Jubal Anderson Early William Tecumseh Sherman John Bell Hood Battle of the Somme (1916) Yom Kippur War Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Trench warfare Battle of Stones River Battle of Kock (1939) Second Battle of El Alamein Culp's Hill Modoc War Philip Sheridan II Corps (ACW) Red River Campaign Battle of Waterloo Nathan Bedford Forrest Battle of Iwo Jima Battle of Kursk Battle of Fort Donelson United States Army American Revolutionary War Ulysses S.

how rice cookers know when to stop how simple rice cookers ones with no electronics know when to stop cooking my cooker does a pretty good job and i suspect it is by weight because when it has no water no cover the on off button jumps back to off however if it is really based on weight then how can it know if i have a little rice with water or a lot of rice and no water i am of course talking about an electrical rice cooker it does not build any steam pressure so this is not he answer during cooking the rice water mixture is heated at full power the full power temperature cannot go above the boiling point of water f c as any heat put into the rice water mixture at that point will only cause the water to boil at the end of cooking some of the water will have been absorbed by the rice and the rest is boiled off once the heating continues past this point the temperature exceeds the boiling point the thermostat then trips switching the rice cooker to low power warming mode  Rice cooker Slow cooker Thermostat Brewery Pressure cooking Solar power Rice Water (molecule) Idli Heat Boiling Steam engine Boiling point Ocean thermal energy conversion Carburetor Nuclear power Hydrogen Hydrogen economy Kitchen Phase (matter) Microwave oven Explosive material Alkane Diode Thermal power station Water vapor Temperature Bread Barbecue Spark plug Stove Helium Tofu Pebble bed reactor Ramen Plutonium Internal combustion engine Diesel engine Stirling engine Japanese cuisine Geyser Food preservation Portable stove Heinkel He 100 Fossil fuel power plant Chopsticks Soldering Glossary of firefighting terms Cuisine of Brazil Carbon dioxide Power station Energy development Gas absorption refrigerator Solar box cooker Fire fighting Alternative biochemistry Refrigerator Rice congee Transistor Autoclave Cajun cuisine Degree Celsius Welding Distillation Ice cream Avalanche Phase change heat pump Superconductivity Furnace Personal rapid transit Coffee percolator Bengali cuisine Fractional distillation Acetic acid Aluminium Internal ballistics Battery (electricity) Uranium Titanium Turbocharger Coal Water Water purification MOSFET E85 Steaming Ironing Dumpling HVAC Fluorescent lamp Rail terminology Turbojet

can someone please explain the saying with a grain of salt thx with a grain of salt is a literal translation of a latin phrase cum grano salis a pinch of salt may also be used in common parlance if something is to be taken with a grain of salt it means that a measure of healthy skepticism should be applied regarding a claim that it should not be blindly accepted and believed without any doubt or reservation according to the oxford english dictionary to take 'it' with a grain of salt means to accept a thing less than fully it dates this usage back to another meaning is 'with moderation' and it is related to the way someone uses something it probably refers to the activity of cooking where only a pinch of salt is sufficient to enhance the flavour of a dish in this sense using something 'cum grano salis' means to use it with moderation the phrase comes from pliny the elder's naturalis historia regarding the discovery of a recipe for an antidote to a poison in the antidote one of the ingredients was a grain of salt threats involving the poison were thus to be taken with a grain of salt and therefore less seriously  Apicius British Isles Vegetarianism Bread French fries Natural History (Pliny) Pliny the Elder Nostratic languages Soy sauce Crossword Fugu Cooking Medical prescription Bacon Indian English Res publica Tofu Food preservation Matthew 5:13 Dictionary Spanish verbs Nicomachean Ethics Shit Biblical inerrancy Jewish cuisine Scientific method Kashrut Kosher foods Veganism Cheese Zinc Mormonism and Judaism Food Common bean Cyanide Pasta Patent medicine Biblical studies Aluminium Risotto Trademark Predestination Penda of Mercia Ketchup Tomato Sushi Soap Rice Hipparchus (astronomer) Alcohol Atheism Chinese language Begging the question Edible salt Korean cuisine Ice cream Curry Philosophy of mathematics Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Roman eating and drinking American and British English differences Morphology (linguistics) Fundamentalism Chile pepper Garlic Japanese cuisine Foodborne illness Salary Recipe Fuck Bengali cuisine Encyclopedia Cooking weights and measures Cantonese cuisine Common sense Organic food Salt Taiwanese (linguistics) Emperor Foie gras Epistemology Hamster Omega-3 fatty acid Liberalism Cocaine Flour Couscous Ham Catholic Historicity of Jesus Chili con carne Meaning Fish and chips Japanese tea ceremony New Zealand English Sodium chloride Kanji Salad Names of large numbers Nicene Creed

why is it so hard for diebetics to do what they are suppose to do like eating right staying motivated and exercising just doing the right thing and making the right choices i can't believe i spelled the word diabetics wrong i just had to add this the answer to your question has nothing to do with the fact that you are or are not diabetic it doesn't matter what the situation is people do or do not do the right thing simply because they choose to inside of themselves choice is all up to the individual and what they wish to accomplish or get out of a situation or become in themselves it is solely connected to your will power in yourself and your will power is that part of you that chooses to do right or wrong in yourself in otherwords if you want what is best and good for you you will do what you have to do to achieve that for yourself if you do not care then you won't do anything to improve yourself whether or not it is or isn't hard to do also depends on how you look at the situation and make your own mind up about it you can choose to struggle with the situation or you can accept it and make the most of it it's all up to your inner person and how you want to become a success or remain a failure in whatever task or situation you are going through do you want to control it or do you want it to control you if you control the situation then you mature and become a success if you let the situation control you then you fail and stay where you are at it's all in the way you look at your situation will you make it a win or a lose situaion your choice good luck  Theory of conduct Ethics Goodness and value theory Abortion debate Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nicomachean Ethics Extreme Programming Procrastination Ontological argument Diabetes mellitus Password Alcoholics Anonymous The nature of God in Western theology Economics Social rule Philosophical skepticism Meaning of life Monty Hall problem Simone Weil Pitaten Lie Karen Horney Justification (theology) Redundant array of independent disks Original sin Health insurance Value system Poker jargon Hypoglycemia Singlish Free will Predestination Utilitarianism Coming of Age (TNG episode) Property (ownership right) Social psychology Aikido Stomach cancer Alignment (role-playing games) Morality Polyamory Epistemology Contract Microeconomics Fecal incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Expert system Causality Fast bowling Philosophy of language 2000 Australian Grand Prix Scientific method Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Joker's Wild The Price Is Right Prisoner's dilemma Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Atkins Nutritional Approach Decision making Infantilism Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sant Thakar Singh Determinism Public policy Anorexia nervosa Alexander Technique Presidential system Magical thinking Chess strategy and tactics Press Your Luck Canadian House of Commons Vacuous truth Religious pluralism IP (complexity) Soul Floppy disk S__ren Kierkegaard Moral objectivism MAME Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Samuel Goldwyn Leadership Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Debugging Dog training Friends Insulin Altruism Summa Theologiae Finesse Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Intelligent design Dyslexia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Culture of Lithuania Falsifiability

what was outlawed in prohibition during the prohibition in the 's was it only hard liquer that was outlawed or did they ban stuff like wine and champagne too actually it turns out the specifics of the th amendment were only the sale production and transportation of all types of alcohol there was an accompanying law that prohibited the consumption but it came later that same year it was enacted in as religious minded citizens blamed the consumption of alcohol on many different woes specifically there was a great fear of the american public when it came to the irish who were still trampled under foot to a large extent in there was also a great deal of concern regarding crime there were all sorts of groups which prohibited alcohol consumption kansas enacted it into their state constitution in there's more in the wiki reference in my link set but one of my favorite thoughts is that of a river if the water wants to go this way eventually it will find a way if you think of the ills of society markets for gambling sex drugs and alcohol these are all things people like to do no amount of law will stop them from doing what they need to do to be happy someone will be there to provide for this need whether it is a prostitute a casio boss a drug dealer or an al capone and the mafia who were bootleggers bringing what the country wanted to the masses and making a ton of dough on it it only took years for the us to realize this with regards to alcohol and now its just heavily regulated sadly the other sins have not found their way into the ok by the law but heavily regulated state yet and in the meantime we spend millions of dollars trying to stop the dam of need and support with some masking tape its far better to teach people why these things are good and bad for them and then let them manage on their own while those millions of dollars are spent doing things to take care of the people and the planet  Prohibition Illegal drug trade Arguments for and against drug prohibition Prohibition (drugs) Alcoholic beverage Economy of the United States Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Smoking ban Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Food and Drug Administration Black market Prostitution Absinthe Child pornography Microeconomics Cuba Video game controversy Harm reduction Al Capone History of the United States (1918-1945) Gay rights Gun politics in the United States Controlled Substances Act Sin City United States Constitution Victimless crime Tax History of the United States FairTax Elections in the United States The Untouchables Freedom of speech Legal issues of cannabis Cocaine Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland Rum-running First Amendment to the United States Constitution Law French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Federal Marriage Amendment Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Drug abuse Gun politics Roaring Twenties Kansas Involuntary commitment Knots Landing Intellectual property Recreational drug use Convention on Psychotropic Substances Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Female genital cutting Motion picture rating system Human sexual behavior Civil rights Prohibition Party Church of Christ, Scientist Politics of the United States Capital punishment Tennessee State Constitution New Deal Laws of Singapore Cannabis (drug) Pornography U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Public policy Article One of the United States Constitution Culture of France Sodomy law Economy of Russia Religion and sexuality Libertarianism United States Bill of Rights Landmark decision Polygamy Alcoholism Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Mothers Against Drunk Driving Constitution Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Las Vegas, Nevada First Monday Human rights in the United States Teach the Controversy Hate speech Age of consent International Criminal Court

whats happening in your body when a body part starts to twitch i always get these random twitches everywhere mostly in my eye but also my arms and legs i was just wondering whats happening in your body to make you twitch twitches occur in your muscles when the neurons over fire each nerve in our bodies is made up of bundles of neurons that all combine together to make the nerve fiber each neuron has a different firing time in other words the neuron cannot fire again until the chemicals have returned to their normal balance when these neurons become over stimulated or over fire it is often caused by stress which causes the neurons to over produce the neuro transmitters dopamine acytecholine which causes a specific muscle to continue firing so you feel a twitch it's harmless but can be annoying  Muscle Action potential Brain Post Polio syndrome Multiple sclerosis Motor neurone disease Eye Proprioception Cerebellum Muscle contraction Neurotransmitter Cardiac pacemaker Nerve agent Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Clinical depression Electromyography Puberty Pain Parkinson's disease Synapse Dualism (philosophy of mind) Neuron Cancer Drug addiction Acetylcholine Diabetic neuropathy Motoneuron Reticular formation Myasthenia gravis Corticospinal tract Poliomyelitis Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Cephalic disorder Benign fasciculation syndrome Stem cell Weight training Peripheral nervous system Retina Cocaine Epilepsy Local anesthesia Urination Urinary incontinence Axon Cognitive science Sleep Tetany Caffeine Primary motor cortex Duchenne muscular dystrophy Fecal incontinence Methamphetamine John Carew Eccles 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Human brain Histamine Cerebral cortex Cell growth Rat Park Neuro-linguistic programming Human adaptation to space Facial nerve Signal transduction Autism Mikhail Lebedev Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Reflexology Long-term potentiation Raphe nuclei Enzyme Neuro cybernetics Dopamine Arm Insulin Electroconvulsive therapy History of brain imaging Magnetic resonance imaging Schizophrenia Massage Dyspraxia Chemotherapy Acupuncture Trigeminal nerve Adrenal gland Spinal cord Hypoglycemia Membrane potential Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Narcolepsy Heart Balance disorder Humerus Cardiac cycle Chemosensor

i dont know the differences between circumcised uncircumcised penis please explain in details ok visual difference they both look the same hard while soft a circumcised guy's knob shows on the end the part that looks like a helmet an uncircumcised guy will look like an elephant trunk tapering at the end hiding the knob inside because the knob is always hidden under a layer of skin it stays moist literally mucous and has a shiny appearance circumcised guys don't have their knob covered in skin all the time so it's dry just like any other skin on the body the anatomical difference the skin on the penis is loose and slides back and forth on the penis it is attached fixed at two places at the base where it attaches to the abdomen skin and at the place just behind the knob on uncircumcised guys the skin is actually longer than the penis itself so it hangs down and folds back on itself drooping down over the knob and covering it on circumcised guys the skin is shortened so that it's the same length as the penis because it's shorter it doesn't fold back on itself or cover the knob well there you have it  Penis Glans penis Circumcision Foreskin Foreskin restoration Strap-on dildo Vulva Ridged band History of male circumcision Knife Phimosis Medical analysis of circumcision Clitoris Pubic hair Masturbation Plastic surgery Smegma Anatomy Pachypodium brevicaule Puberty Gliding action Syphilis Autonomic nervous system Chancroid Fecal incontinence Undergarment History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Skin Body modification Orgasm Hair Prostate cancer Climbing equipment Kyle Broflovski Human penis size Abdomen Katana Penile cancer Windows XP Stage lighting Dispensationalism Oral sex Lung Sex organ Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ulna History of Christianity Coconut crab Pachypodium baronii Cellular network Sexual fetishism Penis removal Decompression sickness Erection Goatse.cx Mummy Casting Balanitis Aquatic ape hypothesis Hypospadias Sexual differentiation Professional wrestling holds Extreme Programming Drill bit Dinosaur Trombone Aerial (dance move) Glossary of climbing terms Tarantula Frenulum Testicle Evidence of evolution Head Seismic retrofit Pachypodium bicolor Leaf Gay slang Herpes simplex virus Jewish Christians Condom Electrophysiology Circumcision advocacy Human anatomy How to prepare an onion cell slide Epithelium Humerus Doom enemies Anatomical terms of location Maize Mattress Intersexuality Comanche Nile crocodile Chair Violin Brassiere

what did the emancipaton proclamaton actually do i'll give the best answer to the first person to give me the whole answer and i really do know it so don't try to fool me be shure to include the actual effects i e emotional and political the emancipation proclamation was passed by president lincoln president fo the united states during the civil war it stated that all slaves in states that were in rebellion were freed ie slaves in the conferate states because the confederate states were in rebellion the southern states they didn't listen to president lincoln this would be the the same as president bush telling europe to pay him taxes it wouldn't do anything in middle school children are taught that the emancipation proclamation freed the slaves when in fact it didn't free any slaves it did however have some concequences and it wasn't a pointless piece of paper lincoln knew what he was doing it changed the purpose of the war before the emancipation proclamation was passed the war was about getting the southern states to rejoin the union after the emancipation proclamation was passed the war became focused arounds the issue of slavery it allowed president lincoln to allow run away slaves to join the military and fight against the south before the emancipation proclamation was passed there were many run away slaves in the north lincoln couldn't send them back to the south because he knew they would be beaten and or killed he also couldn't keep them in the north because they were not legally free many african americans tried to enter the military to fight against the south during the civil war but lincoln could not allow them to fight because there was no law saying they were free after the emancipation proclamation was passed all african americans in the north were free and therefore lincoln could allow them to fight in the war  Emancipation Proclamation American Civil War History of slavery in the United States United States Abraham Lincoln History of Maryland African American Underground Railroad History of the Southern United States Border states (Civil War) African American history Southern United States Delaware Lincoln Memorial Dred Scott v.

where did the phrase skinny dipping come from i just don't get it here is one explanation the term skinny dipping originated in the s when soda jerks the guys who scooped the ice cream at the soda fountains skimped on the size of the scoops of ice cream by cleverly creating a hollow air hole inside of the ball of frozen confection thus creating the illusion of massive scoops of ice cream while actually conserving product thereby raising profits when the customers discovered that their large scoops of ice cream were filled with air and not the ice cream that they had paid for they gathered an angry mob and waited for the soda jerk to get off of work grabbed him stripped him buck naked and threw him in the town fountain or lake or river as available and here is another originally this term did not refer to young people swimming au naturel in the local creek if you were a british sailor on a man 'o war you would refer to shallow water as skinny water and you must remember that the british don't swim they go for a dip there were no bathing suits in the 's and on remote tropical islands there was no need for them and so the sailors traditionally went swimming in shallow water in the buff and so today the only thing that is generally remembered about it is that the sailors were swimming naked nowadays we use the term to indicate nede swimming but originally the term skinny dipping refered to the depth of the water not the lack of clothing personally i am not sure that either explanation is correct but  Ice cream Sento Soft drink Swimming pool Nudity Drowning Swimming Skinny dipping Fishing Bathing Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 5) Diving Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon Nudism Sundae Tea Water polo Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Scuba set Death Valley National Park Sherbet The Apprentice 2 Skinny Dip Humphrey Bogart Hazing Confectionery Joke Bob and George Customs and etiquette of Japan Carbon dioxide Spidey Super Stories Dairy Buckingham Palace Robot Master Tag Root beer float Milkshake Futurama (TV series - season 4) Japanese cuisine Fountain pen Fountain Little Britain Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Lake Burley Griffin Rebreather Baptism Japanese toilet Shaggy dog story Seabird Bulk vending Solar power Niagara Falls Sauna 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Cloud Casting Ice cream van Ice hockey Pie Glacier Antarctic krill Air Florida Flight 90 Kirby's Adventure Francisco Hern__ndez de C__rdoba (discoverer of Yucat__n) Smelt Cuisine of Denmark Equine conformation Ice Rum Items in the Metroid series Sodium carbonate Spanking Breakfast Desert Coffee Oreo Geology of the Grand Canyon area Ice core Autonomous building Bad Wolf Cuisine of the Philippines Daria Severe weather terminology (United States) Cream (food) Vending machine Magic (illusion) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Geography of Ireland Tokusatsu Ice age Mineral County, West Virginia Body piercing Toa

what does 'calivo' mean in spanish there's a place named as such i'm thinking possible meanings where it was named after from the clavo tree cloves or since its the spanish equivalent for nail then it might mean the act of thrusting or driving away or out there's also this idiom clavarsela in central america which roughly means to get drunk and the phrase clavar un clavo con la cabeza figuratively means 'to be very stubborn' in the local area though there is a plant known as clavo it is rather what we'd call the oregano or the pot marjoram any idea anyone it is spelled as so it probably is an archaic term already that's what im trying to find out where the town of kalibo is named after according to wikipedia kalibo is the capital of the province of aklan in the northwest of panay island philippines kalibo is best known as the venue of the ati atihan festival normally held during the rd sunday of january the term kalibo comes from the aklanon word sangka libo one thousand the number of native ati aka aeta people who attended the first catholic mass there after this very first mass a celebration was held that was continued annually as the ati atihan festival from the time of the spanish colonial administration until the institution of pilipino as the national language in kalibo was spelled as calivo  Aklan Nabas, Aklan Antique province Panay Iloilo City Philippines Iloilo Capiz Languages of the Philippines Cebu Literature of the Philippines Filipino people Demographics of the Philippines Oregano Filipino language Mexico Spanish language Philippine peso Mestizo Chinese language American and British English differences Tagalog language Philippine Airlines Vietnamese language Hispanic culture in the Philippines Family name Bosniaks Americas Black (people) Translation Cavite City Boracay Spanish colonization of the Americas English language Mass (liturgy) German language Idiom Sabbath Kapampangan language Hanja Spanish in the Philippines Chili con carne Creole Nagercoil Javanese language Religion in Japan Capitalization Visayan languages Names given to the Spanish language Mount Pinatubo Negrito Vermont Australian English Batangas Midwestern United States Sicilian language Camiguin British Isles Imperialism in Asia Languages of Hong Kong Pequeninos Catalan language Canadian Confederation Portuguese language Chinese Filipino Louisiana Non-native pronunciations of English Rosario Ho Chi Minh City County Republic of China Middle Ages Woman New Zealand English Sri Lanka Macau Inuit language San Fernando City, Pampanga New Guinea Taiwan NATO phonetic alphabet Swedish language Sinulog festival Black Legend English plural Speaker for the Dead Tennessee Spanish Creole Spain Hiberno-English Languages in the United States Christopher Columbus Aramaic of Jesus Plantations of Ireland Latin alphabet Benguet Wolof language

whats the difference between the states and the union territories they have seperated the states as and the union territories as in what way how canada has a constitution the constitution act of the constitution talks about all sorts of things like what our official languages are and what our individual rights are the constitution works together with our system of laws to make up the rules of the country the constitution also indicates what provinces are a part of canada and what the powers of those provinces are for example provinces have jurisdiction over education and the environment territories on the other hand are created by federal law that means the territories have a bit less power than the provinces they still have representation in the federal government but don't have provincial governments the biggest difference is that the provinces get to vote on changes to the constitution but the territories do not are you sure that's right up until canada didn't have a constitution instead we had something called the british north america act this act functioned the same way as the constitution does but reflected our continuing close ties to great britain up until most changes to the british north america act had to be passed by the parliament of great britain in under prime minister pierre trudeau the constitution act was passed this act did two main things it added a charter of rights and freedoms and it made the process of changing the constitution something that canadians could do on their own canada's constitutional documents including the british north america act this is a bit detailed younger students will likely find it goes a bit over their head i've tried to simplify things as much as possible note up until everything was known as the british north america act the constitution retroactively changed the names of everything constitution act formerly known as the british north america act after the war with the colonists in the united states queen victoria decided it would be in the best interests of everyone involved to consent to the formation of a parliament within canada this parliament made decisions and laws for canada like great britain it had a house of commons and a senate however the crown's the queen's representative called the governor general had the 'power of disallowance' this allowed him to revoke any federal law within two years after it was enacted he could also withhold assent from a bill for a period of two years ultimately preventing it from becoming a law the provinces of united upper canada ontario lower canada quebec nova scotia and new brunswick were recognized as forming the dominion of canada the crown's representatives for these provinces were called the lieutenant governor one per province they could also withhold assent from bills and revoke laws but had a one year time limit rupert's land act the queen to accepted all lands belonging to the hudson's bay company they 'owned' most of what we now call canada temporary government of rupert's land act created a temporary government for 'rupert's land' see the previous act manitoba act created the province of manitoba rupert's land and north western territory order relieved hudson's bay company of any unsettled indian claims effectively making it the responsibility of the canadian government british columbia terms of union created the province of british columbia constitution act formerly british north america act gave parliament the power to create new provinces out of the northwest territories prince edward island terms of union created the province of prince edward island parliament of canada act gave parliament the power to regulate its members adjacent territories order admitted all remaining territories of british north america surrounding canada except newfoundland into canada although they were now part of canada they didn't automatically become provinces at this point constitution act formerly british north america act allowed parliamentary representation for citizens residing in the territories canada ontario boundary act extended the boundaries of the province of ontario statute law revision act repealed certain obsolete laws canadian speaker appointment of deputy act session repealed by the constitution act confirmed the rules around the deputy speaker of the senate yukon territory act separated the yukon territory from the northwest territory alberta act formerly the alberta act created the province of alberta saskatchewan act formerly the saskatchewan act created the province of saskatchewan constitution act formerly british north america act changed the way money was transferred between the federal and provincial governments constitution act formerly british north america act changed the number of seats in the senate from to british north america act repealed by statute law revision act extended the term of parliament during world war i statute law revision act repealed the previous act since the war had ended constitution act transferred all rights and interests of certain natural resources of the provinces of british columbia alberta saskatchewan and manitoba statute of westminster removed legislative authority of parliament in great britain over its dominions canada australia new zealand south africa and newfoundland yes at the time newfoundland was a separate dominion from canada at this point constitution act formerly british north america act gave the federal government the power to legislate laws repealing unemployment insurance british north america act repealed by the constitution act delayed the re adjustment of the seats in the house of commons until world war ii was over british north america act repealed by the constitution act increased the number of members in the house of commons to letters patent constituting the office of governor general of canada clarified the role of the governor general the crown's representative in canada newfoundland act formerly british north america act created the province of newfoundland british north america no act repealed by the constitution act gave the parliament of canada limited powers to amend the constitution of canada statute law revision act repealed some out of date laws british north america act partially repealed by the constitution act repealed by the constitution act gave the federal government the power to enact laws regarding old age pensions british north america act repealed by the constitution act increased the number of members in the house of commons to constitution act formerly british north america act changed the length of term of office for superior court judges to years of age instead of for life constitution act formerly british north america act gave parliament the power to legislate laws regarding old age pensions constitution act formerly british north america act changed the length of term of office for senators to years of age instead of for life constitution act formerly british north america act changed the rules for calculating the number of mps to sit in the next parliament constitution act no formerly british north america act no gave the yukon and northwest territories representation in the house of commons constitution act no formerly british north america act no changed the number of senators from to gave the yukon and northwest territories each one seat on the senate miscellaneous statue law revision act a law which made some technical corrections and name changes to previous acts canada act last act requiring the sign off of the parliament of great britain from that time on the british parliament relinquished the power to affect any canadian laws including the constitution constitution act part of the canada act includes the charter of rights and freedoms includes the notwithstanding clause this allows the governments to suspend parts of the charter of rights for a period of years at which time it must review the suspension in december quebec invoked the notwithstanding clause related to bill its language law bill required signage outside stores to be french only even thought that violated canada's charter of rights you could not have an english sign in quebec in a report that bill violated the international covenant on civil and political rights was released by a united nations human rights committee since then quebec has allowed french english signs as long as the french is predominant the act was signed by of the provinces the quebec government has never signed it despite this the act is legally binding in canada why didn't quebec sign there is a strong 'separatist' movement in quebec including a strong provincial party that usually makes up the majority of the government members at the time this party was in power and did not wish to sign the constitution of canada because they don't want to be part of canada why do they want to separate this movement wishes to be their own country apart from canada the main issue is language and culture they are concerned their french speaking culture is being overshadowed by the majority english speaking culture of canada in there was even a 'referendum' vote of all the people in quebec about whether the people wished to separate the vote to stay part of canada won by a very small majority no one knows what would have happened if the majority had wanted to separate the vote simply reflected the wishes of the people and was not legally binding however in a democratic country like canada the wishes of the people have great influence proclamation bringing into force the constitution act can the document that the queen signed at parliament hill making the constitution act law constitution amendment proclamation recognition of rights obtained under aboriginal land claims agreements committed all governments to invite aboriginal and territorial government representatives to conferences on issues related to them constitution act representation changed the formula for figuring out the house of commons seats constitution amendment newfoundland

can levy tolls for the use of a fixed crossing joining the island to the mainland specifically the confederation bridge constitution amendment proclamation newfoundland act allows the government of newfoundland to take control of establishing and continuing denominational and nondenominational schools constitution amendment quebec gave quebec the sole power to determine the system of education used there this allowed them to reorganize the school boards for separate french and english schools constitution act newfoundland act there is no mention of denominational schools so a single school system can be established courses in religion are guaranteed including religious observances at the request of parents constitution act nunavut allow nunavut to be represented by one senator and one

why do stamps have ridges on the sides just wondering if they serve any sort of purpose why not just make stamps square so the sheets of stamps wouldn't curl the rotary press printing method provided many advantages in the manufacture of u s postage stamps primarily in the speed of production allowing the printing of stamps on rolls of paper rather than on the single sheet at a time of the flat plate method it also allowed the gumming of stamps as a roll rather than by the individual sheet again a big time saver however when the rotary press rolls were cut down to sheets to be delivered to post offices the sheets tended to curl back into their rolled form this was not a problem with rotary coils which were sold in rolls but it was a problem for postal clerks who needed the sheets of stamps to lie flat in their drawers more pressing was the fact that it was exceptionally difficult to add pre cancels to the curled sheets without tearing the sheets apart at the perforations a problem that was alleviated somewhat as the bureau took over the pre canceling chore since un gummed sheets from the rotary rolls did not curl it was noted that the gum must be the cause of the curling by simply adding breaks in the gum the curling was reduced considerably  Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Postage stamp Stamp collecting Postage stamp separation Envelope Drill bit Mail Postage stamp gum United States Postal Service Philately Welding Bookbinding View camera Gramophone record Penny Black Toilet paper Paper size Philatelic literature Transformer Screw Loudspeaker Table tennis Penny Red Printing press Topps Wire Inverted Jenny Cookware and bakeware Paper Mattress M60 machine gun Combine harvester Post office Autograph Seismic retrofit Equine conformation Glass Duplicating machines Brewery Printmaking Bacon Microeconomics Textile manufacturing terminology Genericized trademark Dice Private Express Statutes ZIP Code Mail art Sheet metal Solar cell RISC Oscilloscope Die (manufacturing) Offset printing Dither Terminal ballistics Cascading Style Sheets Stereoscopy Musical notation One-time pad Cancellation Craps Tax Textile manufacturing Carburetor Regular polytope Arado Ar 80 Hyperinflation Bulk vending Violin Knife Wankel engine Rotary engine Map projection Mach kernel Artistamp Solar power Microphone Direct marketing Flat tax Dairy Fender Telecaster Postmark Trombone Floppy disk Bullet Two-stroke cycle Rules of the road Pottery Printed circuit board
