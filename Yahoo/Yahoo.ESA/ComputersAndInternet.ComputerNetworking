qiuck question about wimax d hi wimax d is known as a fixed version of wimax does fixed mean users have to absolutely stay put to use it or they can use it while moving within the base station coverage thnx fixed wimax is similar to wifi where you connect to a base station but rather than the limited distance of just a few meters you can use it for up to km mobile wimax allows you to roam from one station to the next without losing service but just like mobile phones your network provider has to have many stations to support long distances companies such as sprint are looking to spend billions of dollars on this technology to supplant their existing mobile phone networks with an ability to provide both phone and internet over the same infrastructure at speeds in excess of mbps up to mbps  WiMAX Wi-Fi Voice over IP Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Global System for Mobile Communications Telephone IP Multimedia Subsystem Mobile phone Sprint Nextel Corporation Broadband Internet access Cellular network EGovernment BlackBerry Digital divide GSM services General Packet Radio Service Internet Telephone numbering plan IEEE 802.11 Network Switching Subsystem Virgin Mobile Inmarsat Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing AT&T Verizon Wireless Global Positioning System T-Mobile Telephone tapping Q-Telecom Wireless LAN Communications satellite MSN Messenger Enterprise content management National Weather Service Wireless Application Protocol North American Numbering Plan MTR Mobility management Nordic Mobile Telephone IiNet Skype Turkcell GPRS Core Network Push to talk Citizens' band radio CDMA2000 Public transport BBC 9-1-1 Windows XP Modem Wireless Mobile phone radiation and health High-speed rail Wireless mesh network Session Initiation Protocol Short message service Opera (web browser) X.25 Emergency telephone number Power line communication Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Ethernet NorthwesTel Telecom New Zealand Linux Digital Subscriber Line Octopus card Vodafone BT Group plc Telecommunications in the United Kingdom Microsoft Pocket PC Amateur radio Secure Shell Meteor Mobile Communications Code division multiple access IPv6 Data retention Television Phreaking InterCity Express High-Speed Downlink Packet Access Microeconomics Austar UK telephone numbering plan Cable television Radio Eircom Instant messaging Infrared Data Association Private branch exchange NTT DoCoMo MCI Internet service provider W-CDMA

need help with a wireless network question i hope there is a simple answer to my question i have a wireless router set up in my house connected to my main pc the wireless is used for my wife's work laptop which has a wireless card that is enabled i have a work laptop where the internal wireless card is disabled for security reasons in order to connect to my network at work i connect an ethernet cable to the back of the wireless router and directly to my work laptop this means i always have to be in my home office when using my work laptop is there a way for me to use my work laptop somewhere else in my house without being directly connected to the main wireless router is there a hub of some sort that will accept the wireless signal and allow me to connect my ethernet cable to the hub any help with this is greatly appreciated btw enabling the wireless card is not an option thanks you have a few options though some may not be recommended or may be locked down by your employer what you've described a wired device that picks up your wireless router's signal and allows you to connect to it using your ethernet connection is called a wireless ethernet bridge unfortunately most of them are just as expensive as a router but they will accomplish exactly what you want without requiring you to change anything on your laptop you will need to set the bridge up to work with your router though you can then bring the bridge around with you and plug it in wherever you want to work i got one from newegg for a voip phone i wanted to use in a room without an ethernet jack it gets the job done a more affordable option for you might be to buy an additional wireless adapter either usb or a pcmcia card for your laptop unfortunately you may need local administrative rights on your laptop in order to install the new hardware if you're not a local admin your best option is the wireless bridge it's also the least likely to be against company policy keep in mind it may be against your work's policy to ever allow your laptop on wireless networks secure or insecure please check the company rule books and always make sure you use wireless encryption especially when transferring confidential information cheers gl  Universal Serial Bus Wireless LAN Windows XP Computer bus Cisco Systems Secure Digital card GSM services WiMAX Password MAC address Wireless access point USB flash drive PlayStation 3 PCI Express Cable television Laptop AirPort IBook IEEE 802.11 Xbox Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Xbox 360 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Router Verizon Wireless IPod PowerPC Nintendo Revolution FireWire HomePNA IMac Telephone Television Surveillance PlayStation 2 TIA-568A/B Embedded system Internet Apple Macintosh Skype NSA encryption systems 9-1-1 Local area network Nintendo DS Telegraphy Closed-circuit television Internet fraud IP Multimedia Subsystem Global System for Mobile Communications Federal Standard 1037C Mouse (computing) Transmission Control Protocol Desktop computer Mobile phone Internet Group Management Protocol PlayStation Portable Telephone tapping Copy protection Wardriving Wireless Computer networking device Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus IEEE 802.11i BlackBerry Enhanced 911 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Session Initiation Protocol OSI model SCSI CompactFlash Amateur radio Wireless mesh network Telephone exchange Asynchronous Transfer Mode One-time pad Virtual private network Category 5 cable Wi-Fi Protected Access Private branch exchange Power line communication ALOHAnet Computer network Wireless Application Protocol Computer surveillance Peripheral Component Interconnect

i can ping to any pc in my companies network but no one can ping to my ip what can be the reason of that hi i think the reason behind that is that you are using a software firewall or windows built in firewall which blocks the ping replies by default so you have to enable the icmp port used to reply the ping requests go to my network places right click properties select the connection that you want and right click properties advances firewall settings advanced on the icmp tab click settings and tick the option allow incoming echo requests regards  Netfilter/iptables Ping Internet Control Message Protocol HTTP cookie Denial-of-service attack Firewall (networking) Windows XP MTU (networking) Spyware Mouse (computing) Skype Gnutella Ethernet Stateful firewall Internet Relay Chat Internet Group Management Protocol Network address translation Quake Web service Kazaa Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol EMule Multiplayer Microsoft Windows Mac OS X E-mail spam Voice over IP Friend-to-friend Novell NetWare Windows Server 2003 Knoppix Uniform Resource Locator Opera (web browser) Common Unix Printing System Internet censorship in mainland China Redundant array of independent disks Screenshot IPod Windows Vista Personal firewall FreeBSD Peer-to-peer Xbox 360 PNG Hello world program Internet protocol suite Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Nintendo DS Wget Bluetooth Transmission Control Protocol Stopping e-mail abuse Proxy server Macromedia Flash Mozilla Firefox MDAC Nintendo GameCube Object Desktop Comparison of web browsers Computer security Modem Network Time Protocol Load balancer PHP Virtual Network Computing Domain Name System Wireless LAN Whois OpenBSD Linspire Linux GSM services DragonFly BSD Control Panel (Windows) Pretty Good Privacy Cisco PIX Go (board game) Java programming language Streaming media Computer insecurity Btrieve Unicode Google Talk Wang Mang Counter-Strike Mandriva Linux LiveJournal Messaging spam Tor (anonymity network) History of the graphical user interface Gmail Tung Chung Intranet MySQL E-mail Emacs

wifimax wireless connecting my laptop to the web security issue i'm using wifimax to connect my laptop to the internet wirelessly it works great but here's the problem my setup is like this my desktop pc is connected to a wired not wireless modem and router wifimax dongle thingie is plugged into this pc this sends a signal to my laptop and now the problem the connection doesn't work if the network is secure if i put in a password or use encryption it simply sends no signal at all so to make it work i'm basically running an unsecured unprotected network authentication is open system and wep is disabled how unsafe is it to keep the network unsecured no one can see my files i've checked but i assume someone could steal my internet by connecting to my network how big of a problem is this going to be assuming i only use my laptop for a few hours a day and unplug the dongle thingie shutting down the network when i'm not using it here's a picture of my settings which might help http i tinypic com osi og jpg is it wifi or wimax i was one of the authors of the wifi security specification and i was the primary author of the wimax security specification so i know the security protocols in great detail from the rest of your message i'm assuming that it is wifi not wimax there's no such thing as wifimax dual protocol interfaces will come out in the future but they aren't out yet you have the desktop pc trying to act as a bridge or router since it has to bridge or route your laptop's traffic onto the wired internet connection you have if you're running linux that bit is easy configure it as a router or bridge bridge is easier if you're running windows you have some digging to do to find the configuration however in wifi in infrastructure mode the normal mode one end needs to be an access point and the other needs to be a sta mobile station so either the laptop needs to be configured to be an ap or the desktop pc's wifi connection needs to be configured as an ap see your manufacturer's manual for the details of how to do that there's no standard way it may well not be possible on either end an alternative is to configure both ends to be ad hoc mode rather than infrastructure mode with routing on the desktop this should work assuming something downstream like your router is handling dhcp with bridging on the desktop it should also work but do force address packet headers in so bridging can work the reason why is black magic that i can explain by email if you care it is basically unsafe to have your wireless unsecured so if you care about people using your network and having direct access to your pc past the firewall don't do it securing it with i also known as wpav should not be a problem is you use psk mode pre shared key but i can quite believe some vendors don't support security in ad hoc mode for a simpler solution get a wireless ap that plugs into the ethernet and bypasses the desktop pc  X Window System Network address translation Wi-Fi Protected Access Internet protocol suite MDAC Windows Server 2003 Skype Pretty Good Privacy Password Windows Vista Digital Subscriber Line IEEE 802.11i AirPort Embedded system IBM PC compatible IPv6 E-mail ITU-T Extensible Authentication Protocol Novell NetWare OpenBSD Public-key cryptography PowerPC Laptop Wardriving Denial-of-service attack GPRS Core Network Wireless access point Integrated Services Digital Network Wireless Application Protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode Secure Digital card Musical Instrument Digital Interface MAC address PlayStation 3 IPsec History of Microsoft Windows Internet Group Management Protocol Communications protocol Internet Relay Chat HyperText Transfer Protocol Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Universal Plug and Play HTTP cookie Stopping e-mail abuse Surveillance Session Initiation Protocol Microsoft Windows Proxy server Opera (web browser) AmigaOS Computer security Routing Telegraphy General Packet Radio Service OSI model Domain Name System Spyware File Transfer Protocol Web service ZigBee ALOHAnet Computer virus Xbox Digital rights management Microsoft .NET Netfilter/iptables E-mail spam Computer forensics Global System for Mobile Communications BitTorrent

internet and bandwidth when the internet applications etc leave's my companies building does it actually travel through cable to the isp or through t lines how fast are the packers moving dont they crash through cable dont cables have like cables inside for internet for video and for etc i hope i make sense thanks regarding the first question this will all depend on how much bandwidth the company has agreed to pay and what type of isp infrastructure is available in the area such as microwave wireless satellite atm or t t yes if the bandwidth required exceeds that of a t mb s multiple t s can be bundled to equal a fractional t a t has the capacity mb s and regardless of the prefix both ride on the same dedicated physical cable t s are commonly subdivided and leased as fractional t s or as multple t s it is the equipment provided by the isp that throttles the available bandwidth to thier clients another example would be cable internet which a group of houses may share the same physical link for catv telphone and internet access the speed between some links can handle an aggregate load exceeding gb s and they are currently experimenting with gb s when data is sent packets do crash here and there but there are rules in place to reduce this the two most common practices are collision avoidance and collision detection collision avoidance systems either require the sender to have a special ticket to send or before sending ask for clearance to send it will then wait until it receives the special ticket or receives a clear to send response collision detection systems first check the line for activity before sending they do not wait for a clearance response but listen for the line to clear some times it isn't clear when they send and this causes a collision when this happens both ends will back off for a random amount of time before resending lastly it is physically possible to have one cable dedicated for each type of traffic but not always practical there are many cases where all three ride on the same cable common examples used are cable and dsl both generally ride on the same wire that supplies a telephone or catv service you can also bundle audio video and data on the same t all three examples do this by either different encoding or broadcast frequencies that do not interfere this is called multiplexing and that is how a cable or dsl modem work they isolate the data signals from the rest  ALOHAnet Radio IEEE 802.11 Internet service provider Voice over IP Bluetooth Integrated Services Digital Network Telegraphy Transmission Control Protocol Telephone Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Frame relay Cable modem Universal Serial Bus Air traffic control Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Antenna (radio) GSM services ITU-T CPU cache Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting WiMAX Internet protocol suite Denial-of-service attack Satellite internet Digital television Web hosting Broadband Optical fiber Power line communication Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Code division multiple access IP Multimedia Subsystem Oscilloscope RS-232 Cellular network Internet Amateur radio Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wi-Fi Web crawler High-definition television Password Broadband Networks Radar Transformer Telephone exchange Communications protocol DOCSIS Stopping e-mail abuse Universal Mobile Telecommunications System IS-95 Differentiated services Public transport Computer bus Time-division multiplexing Digital audio broadcasting TGV AppleTalk Speed of light Road-rule enforcement camera Compact disc Router Quality of service Elevator Phase-locked loop Airport Broadcasting Error correction and detection Spam (electronic) Data retention Electric power transmission Netfilter/iptables Floppy disk Alternating current Nintendo GameCube Loudspeaker Morse Code BitTorrent PlayStation Portable Analog-to-digital converter Freeview History of radio

using my blackberry as a modem u torrent problems hey am using my blackberry as a modem to access the internet on my laptop but am having a problem with u torrent its say that my port is not forward this it what it say error port does not appear to be open so does anybody knows how to forward a port on using a blackberry as a modem be careful here if you do get an answer that works there is p p sharing and then there is outright abuse of bandwidth my advice would be to leave the p p sharing to the landlines dsl broadband and leave the wireless spectrum out of this picture you also need to know that even though you may have an unlimited plan the telcos often run reports i heard they have rd party companies analyze that data and cut off abusers of unlimited plans also i'm sure running torrents over their network is a violation of an agreement they you two have with each other  Broadband Internet access Modem Voice over IP Digital Subscriber Line Cable television Cable modem Internet service provider BlackBerry Ethernet Broadband Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Internet Telephone Telstra BitTorrent WiMAX StarHub Integrated Services Digital Network Wireless LAN Router Telewest Broadband Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DOCSIS Skype Bluetooth Video on demand General Packet Radio Service Frame relay Power line communication Warez Federal Standard 1037C Softmodem IP Multimedia Subsystem Alcatel Wireless network BT Group plc ITU-T IEEE 802.11 Password Satellite internet Laptop Wi-Fi Sprint Nextel Corporation Desktop computer Prodigy (ISP) Wireless community network Telegraphy Spyware HomePNA Amateur radio Differentiated services PlayStation 2 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Network address translation Wireless Application Protocol Eircom Quality of service 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Vertical service code Apple Computer Verizon Wireless Virgin Mobile Point-to-Point Protocol Computer bus VDSL Bulletin board system Acorn Computers Windows XP Dial-up access IBook Internet protocol suite AirPort Wireless Commodore 64 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines USB flash drive ALOHAnet Transmission Control Protocol Cisco Systems Pacific Century Cyberworks Nintendo GameCube Wireless mesh network Secure Shell ZX Spectrum Research In Motion Federal Communications Commission AT&T Cingular Wireless PlayStation 3 X.25 Floppy disk Computer surveillance Bandwidth Surveillance

why cant i get on an unencripted unprotected wireless network i live outside of the city and dsl is unavalabe but one of my neighbors has satalite internet and is broadcasting the internet through a linksys wireless router im not shure what kind exactly and the signal is not secured in any way that my imac can tell but even when signal strength is good i cant get internet i was able to get a usable signal a few months ago but that stoped when i hooked my imac up to my friend's high speed internet it just didnt work when i came back i can still connect with airport but no data is being transfered and cant get internet acsess on any of my apps the best i can assume is mac filtering every nic network interface card in the world has a unique mac address mac filtering means that the router has a list of these macs and that only an nic with a mac address in the list will be able to associate i e get internet the problem for me is that you have a mac haha mac filtering and i am not familiar with the hardware where my assumption could be wrong is in the fact that you were able to connect at one time he may have had a router problem then and you just got luck i don't know can you tell if you have a ip or have been assigned a dns server again i can't tell you how to look as i don't know macs i may not return to this question so please feel free to send me an email with answers to my questions good luck all nics are created with a unique mac this however can be changed via software the mac will always reset back to the original mac as it is hard wired into the nic  Router MAC address Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Wi-Fi IMac Ethernet Apple Macintosh Apple Computer Floppy disk Digital Subscriber Line Modem E-mail IEEE 802.11 Internet Email authentication Bluetooth Internet Group Management Protocol Federal Standard 1037C AppleTalk Internet protocol suite Windows XP Mac OS X Universal Serial Bus Denial-of-service attack IPv6 Wireless LAN IP Multimedia Subsystem Linux Web crawler Voice over IP AirPort Computer Wireless access point Transmission Control Protocol IPod Broadband Internet access Gmail Peer-to-peer X Window System Simple Mail Transfer Protocol IBook File Transfer Protocol IP address Telegraphy PlayStation 3 FireWire Network address translation Anonymous remailer OSI model Pretty Good Privacy ITunes Internet service provider Timeline of computing Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Windows Netfilter/iptables Xbox Commodore 64 Internet Relay Chat Network switch Mac OS X v10.4 PCI Express Satellite internet Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Proxy server Power line communication Session Initiation Protocol Communications protocol Nintendo GameCube Global System for Mobile Communications Mac OS history Nintendo DS Common Unix Printing System Novell NetWare Usenet Database ISCSI Mac OS Routing Copy protection ZX Spectrum CPU cache Linux kernel Cable television PowerPC WiMAX Verizon Wireless Morse Code System 7 (Macintosh) Telephone Embedded system

linking a wireless enabled computer to another with ethernet to share a connection is it possible to do so can i run the cable to a hub to use more links yes this is possible and yes you can connect it to a hub to share more connections that said let me tell you the down side to this configuration the main computer will need to stay on at all times you will also need to enable ics internet connection sharing on it you will manually need to setup all the ip addresses and subnets for each computer you want to connect to the hub your shared internet connection will be slower because the internet is fed through the wireless adapter and ics for multiple computers at the same time it would be alot better and less of a headache to you if you just went and bought a few cheap wireless adapters on ebay and installed them on the other computers  Ethernet Wi-Fi Digital Subscriber Line Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive Computer bus Wireless LAN Telegraphy AirPort Bluetooth ALOHAnet Windows XP Internet Broadband Internet access Modem Floppy disk WiMAX Xbox Local area network Network address translation Cray-1 Hard disk IEEE 802.11 PlayStation Portable Transmission Control Protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode Computer network Internet protocol suite Bus network FireWire IP address AppleTalk MAC address Secure Digital card Game Boy Advance TIA-568A/B IMac GSM services Wireless access point Central processing unit Computer and video games Server Message Block Apple Macintosh Serial communications PlayStation 2 Telephone Xbox 360 Nintendo Revolution Internet service provider Proxy server Computer Mozilla Firefox Wireless community network AT&T Cisco Systems Router Internet Group Management Protocol Wireless ITunes Private branch exchange Windows 2000 System/36 Cray-2 Btrieve Digital Equipment Corporation Personal computer PowerPC Category 5 cable FidoNet CDC 6600 IPod Windows Server 2003 Mouse (computing) Information Age Distributed computing PlayStation 3 Internet Explorer Federal Standard 1037C MDAC Computer surveillance Coaxial cable LAN party Network switch Wireless mesh network Laptop Copy protection Super Nintendo Entertainment System ARCNET Gmail Universal Plug and Play RS-232 OSI model LocalTalk Apple Newton SCSI Loudspeaker Skype Apollo Guidance Computer

how would i be able to have routers one wireless the other wired set up to be on one dsl line is it possible please i have my wireless router downstairs and its connected to the computer with out a wireless card and my other computers are upstairs and they both have wireless cards but the wireless signal wont go that far and i cant move the wireless router so i need to add another router upstairs is there a way to connect the two routers thanks in advance sysgoddess could you email me with the steps im kind of a begginner at this kind of stuf so i would appreciate it if you could email me thanks the best setup would be to move the wireless router upstairs as it would increase the wireless coverage and might provide enough for all of your computers since the signal has an umbrella effect and should be located at the highest point possible yes the routers can be connected assuming they both have an unpopulated port and or an uplink port to connect via a long cable or you have a computer to act as a server with a wireless and a wired nic to act as a bridge between the two  Router Wi-Fi Modem Wireless LAN Telegraphy IEEE 802.11 Cisco Systems Wireless access point Xbox Universal Serial Bus Denial-of-service attack Bluetooth Voice over IP Loudspeaker Telephone AppleTalk PlayStation 3 Network address translation MAC address Quality of service Internet service provider Password Internet Local area network RS-232 Telephone exchange Cable television Nintendo DS E-mail Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 3Com Corporation Federal Standard 1037C Internet protocol suite Email authentication Integrated Services Digital Network Differentiated services AirPort Nintendo Revolution Transmission Control Protocol HomePNA Satellite internet Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line IMac WiMAX Computer bus Mobile ad-hoc network HyperTransport Wireless Embedded system Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing USB flash drive Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Power line communication GSM services LAN party Routing Personal area network Windows Server 2003 Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Game Boy Advance Wi-Fi Protected Access Computer network Television Central processing unit Cellular network Enhanced 911 Coaxial cable Telephone booth Computer Multiplayer Mouse (computing) Contract bridge Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Amateur radio Drill bit IP Multimedia Subsystem Communications protocol Electric power transmission Data center EGovernment Hotspot (wifi) GPRS Core Network Onion Routing Direct marketing Damn Small Linux Distributed computing Tor (anonymity network) Hewlett-Packard MIPS architecture Computer networking device Global Positioning System Tesla coil ALOHAnet Wardriving Musical Instrument Digital Interface Acorn Computers

is a network key the same as a password i was told that my wireless network would be safe from people trying to use my connection as long as i had a password for it i thought i had one as if i connect manually i have to type something in however i checked what it was and it says its a network key and not a password is this the same thing not the same thing although the network key is sometimes called a password the password you're talking about is a login password the same as for logging in here on yahoo the network key is password like but it's used by the router and the computers on your network to encrypt transmissions between them this is the one that prevents outsiders from hopping on board and hides what gets sent by the way by connect manually i take it to mean you log into the router via your browser to run the admin pages for security you should confine this ability to wired links only and prohibit it from wireless links you can do this from the admin pages themselves this won't affect your usage but will keep a neighbor from hijacking the router from you  Password Wi-Fi Password cracking Malware Windows XP Router Federal Standard 1037C 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Wireless LAN Novell NetWare Secure Shell Internet USB flash drive Onion Routing Wireless access point Two-factor authentication Surveillance Skype Computer security Bluetooth Spyware RuneScape cheats Windows 2000 Freenet MDAC Passphrase Cryptography IEEE 802.11i Kerberos (protocol) Telegraphy Streaming media Wireless mesh network Rootkit Denial-of-service attack Transmission Control Protocol Internet fraud GameFAQs NSA encryption systems Ethernet Wardriving Virtual Network Computing Internet protocol suite Enterprise content management Internet security Rlogin Buffer overflow Dictionary attack Pretty Good Privacy Global Positioning System HTTP cookie One-time pad File Transfer Protocol Friend-to-friend Voice over IP Computer virus Intrusion-detection system User (computing) AirPort Uniform Resource Locator Enigma machine Control-Alt-Delete Computer forensics Cryptographic hash function Stopping e-mail abuse Embedded system MAC address Neopets Digital Subscriber Line System/36 Email authentication Telephone tapping Computer surveillance Proxy server Internet Relay Chat Cisco Systems Database management system IEEE 802.11 Extensible Authentication Protocol Universal Serial Bus Computer insecurity Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Telephone Google Talk PunkBuster Routing Wired Equivalent Privacy Computer network General Packet Radio Service Btrieve Internet Message Access Protocol Key derivation function Apple Open Collaboration Environment

making a wireless connection sorry to ask so many questions but you have all helped me get this far now so now i am online using the router just it still has the entranet cable connected as there is no wireless connection available it worked perfectly with my old laptop just cant remember how i done it it is kind of hard to diagnose your problem is your wireless router connected to your modem via ethernet cable your cable coming from the modem needs to plug into the console port of the wireless router which is obvious there should be open ports next to each other and then open one by itself the console port then you need an ethernet going from your router to your pc if you have a desktop that is you need to maybe go through the setup on the cd that came with the router to set it up again another note your laptop may need to have zero wireless configuration services disabled because it may cause conflicts with intel's built in wireless  Wi-Fi Universal Serial Bus Xbox Ethernet Wireless LAN Bluetooth Nintendo Revolution Modem Embedded system Laptop PlayStation 3 Desktop computer Router PlayStation 2 PowerPC IBook Xbox 360 Digital Subscriber Line Wireless access point IEEE 802.11 Personal computer IMac Windows XP Computer bus Cisco Systems AirPort RS-232 MAC address Local area network Network address translation Password Denial-of-service attack WiMAX GSM services Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Border Gateway Protocol ThinkPad Commodore 64 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family Nintendo GameCube Differentiated services Game Boy Advance Dongle Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mouse (computing) IPod Windows Server 2003 Atari ST Linux HyperTransport Hewlett-Packard Sega Dreamcast Hotspot (wifi) Internet service provider PowerBook Quality of service Power Macintosh G3 Windows 2000 USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Internet protocol suite HomePNA Nintendo Entertainment System DOCSIS FireWire Power line communication Secure Digital card Mobile ad-hoc network MIPS architecture Internet IBM PC compatible Cable television Microprocessor Multiplayer Distributed computing Telegraphy Broadcom Netfilter/iptables Cisco PIX Wireless mesh network ALOHAnet Hard disk Windows Vista Integrated Services Digital Network Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection PCI Express Novell NetWare Television Floppy disk Computer network 3Com Corporation Internet Group Management Protocol Bus network TIA-568A/B ATI Technologies

fastest way to transfer files between two computers that are next to each other okay we have a small home office where we do wedding videos we edit and prepare the dvd files on one computer but burn the discs using another computer the computers are networked with a hard wired connection but we transfer gb of info at a time and it takes a while i'm wondering if there's a way to connect the computers using usb in addition to the regular network connection theoretically usb is capable of m bps but that's considered a burst speed firewire can do a faster sustained transfer there's overhead involved in either one your m bps ethernet also has some overhead depending on how you're using it if you're sharing directories and using the file manager to drag and drop to copy files there's a lot of overhead both in the device drivers managing the shared disks but also in the transfer protocol itself you could try a protocol like ftp check out filezilla in the link below filezilla has a nice interface and both client and server are available it will cut down on some of the overhead associated with other protocols a gb file can transfer over a m bps connection in about seconds not counting the packet overhead i'd bet that some of the delay you're sensing is from your hard drive the sender has to be able to read the data off the drive at m bps and the receiver has to be able to write it at m bps to get the theoretical maximum speed over the ethernet connection if one of the hard drives is older and slower your biggest speed increase may be achieved by replacing it with a fast drive and ensuring that your bus ide eide ata pata sata and computer can support the speeds you'd like to achieve certainly there are devices available that will do what you want see last link below i've got one that i've used but my feeling was that it wasn't any faster than ethernet i used it just as a convenience when a cross over cable hub or even ethernet port wasn't available  Windows XP USB flash drive PlayStation 3 Bluetooth IPod Floppy disk Asynchronous Transfer Mode Transmission Control Protocol PCI Express Digital photography Cache Storage area network File Transfer Protocol DVD BitTorrent Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation 2 Linux Commodore 64 Secure Digital card Xbox IMac File Allocation Table Voice over IP PlayStation Portable Internet protocol suite Apple Macintosh File system Xbox 360 Serial communications AppleTalk Token ring Internet Computer hardware Sound recording Atari 8-bit family Computer network Power Macintosh G3 IEEE 802.11 X Window System Ripping HyperText Transfer Protocol USB mass storage device class Digital audio player ALOHAnet Streaming media Wi-Fi Xserve Mach kernel Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Modchip RS-232 Password Cheating in Counter-Strike Federal Standard 1037C Fibre Channel File sharing Architecture of Windows 2000 Secure Shell Apple II family General Packet Radio Service MicroATX Network address translation IBook TiVo Internet Group Management Protocol Peer-to-peer Serial port Quality of service CD-ROM Computer virus Desktop computer Internet Relay Chat Warez MDAC CD recorder Mac OS X Nintendo GameCube AmigaOS

router connection problems heres the problem i connected everything in the right spot but when i try to use the internet it wont work it doesnt say a connection is unplugged or there is no internet connection there are no warning signs or pop ups saying that i have no internet connection and all the lights in my modem and router says good but when i try to use the internet it wont work but every time i use the modem and put the router out of the way traditional modem to pc connection it does work can anyone help me on this people tell me to change my ip address and what not but i dont know how to do that sometimes the router works randomly but then it disconnects me and when i try to connect it again it wont work anymore hi there i would first try and log into your router's settings to do this you're going to have to put the router's ip address in the address bar of your favorite browser once you have done that make sure you have the correct settings set for dsl a pppoe connection dhcp etc i don't think it has anything to do with changing your ip address most likely it is a setting on your router that needs to be changed  Router Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Digital Subscriber Line Denial-of-service attack Modem Password Domain Name System MAC address Communications protocol Voice over IP Differentiated services Point-to-Point Protocol Wi-Fi Broadband Internet access IPv4 Routing Border Gateway Protocol America Online IP address Netfilter/iptables Email authentication Internet fraud Lag Cisco Systems Novell NetWare Atomic Kitten Internet protocol suite IPv6 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Internet security Uniform Resource Locator Hayes command set Wireless LAN History of the Internet Dialer Cable modem Ethernet Streaming media X.25 Open Shortest Path First Federal Standard 1037C Integrated Services Digital Network Internet service provider Spyware Open mail relay Windows XP Apple Open Collaboration Environment HomePNA ITU-T MDAC HyperTransport Satellite internet AppleTalk Telegraphy Local area network Atari 8-bit family IEEE 802.11 Opera (web browser) Slashdot subculture Tor (anonymity network) Universal Plug and Play Serial communications Commodore 64 Web crawler Prodigy (ISP) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act IP Multimedia Subsystem Mozilla Firefox RS-232 Zeroconf Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Internet protocol spoofing Frame relay PowerPC Super Nintendo Entertainment System QuakeWorld Roxette CompuServe Windows Server 2003 Internet Protocol Softmodem Multiplayer MIPS architecture E-mail Dial-up access Xerox Network Services Control Panel (Windows) Power line communication OSI model Bulletin board system Damn Small Linux Asynchronous Transfer Mode Computer bus Blue screen of death IPv4 address exhaustion Alcatel Subnetwork

ics internet connection sharing host looses connectivity after using ics for a while the host computer looses connectivity the only solution to this so far is to disable and then enable the internet while keep the network between two computers alive any ideas i initially used ics then i realized it wasn't a good idea for several reasons my machine had to be up for my wife's machine to work i couldn't let it go into standby mode if my machine died i couldn't use hers to get help off the web like from yahoo answers the transfer rate to her machine was slo o o ow i eventually bit the bullet and bought a router for about the same as the second wireless adapter cost on my machine it's more headaches security wise but it's worth it so my answer to your question is to ditch ics and install a router wireless probably but not necessarily at least the second computer won't be at the mercy of the first's health and who knows it might fix the problem too  Windows XP Wireless LAN USB flash drive Ethernet Serial communications PowerPC Voice over IP Universal Serial Bus Windows Server 2003 Router Internet protocol suite Internet Modem AppleTalk Transmission Control Protocol Telegraphy Bluetooth Atari 8-bit family Password E-mail WiMAX Apollo Guidance Computer Web crawler Broadband Internet access PlayStation Portable Floppy disk Digital Subscriber Line PlayStation 3 Central processing unit Computer virus Cisco Systems Asynchronous Transfer Mode Linux Secure Digital card MDAC Outsourcing Streaming media History of the Internet Wireless Application Protocol Mach kernel Incident Command System ARPANET Routing Domain Name System IEEE 802.11 Pretty Good Privacy Fax Embedded system File Transfer Protocol CPU design Windows 2000 Internet Group Management Protocol General Packet Radio Service Copy protection Novell NetWare Wireless access point Super Nintendo Entertainment System Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Xbox Spyware Java programming language Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol FireWire PHP Atari ST Seymour Cray Wardenclyffe Tower Internet Relay Chat Peer-to-peer ITU-T Distributed computing Internet Explorer AirPort Microeconomics Local area network $ale of the Century Border Gateway Protocol Algorithm Microsoft Windows PLATO MP3 Natural Selection (computer game) Acorn Computers Nintendo Laptop Mobile ad-hoc network Telephone Space Shuttle program Communications protocol

problem with dial up interference we recenctly hooked up a xp home edition desktop upstairs with a wireless linksys adapter i for one like to play games on the computer but i have connection problems due to the fact that even though we are on dsl now it still believes we use dial up and asks to hook it up to the internet causing the wireless to have limited or no connectivity this is very annoying because i lose connection with my games does anyone have any advice on how to make it so it will work right p s the wireless is through the xp configuration in case that does anything if you go into control panel networks you can run the new connection wizard and set it up for a wireless network with direct access to the internet it is best to do a manual install and don't bother with a disk creation as the last step one other thing is change your router channel to to cut down on interference be sure to set up some type of security and change the default password  Wi-Fi Windows XP Digital Subscriber Line Wireless LAN Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus Modem IEEE 802.11 Cisco Systems Router Windows Server 2003 Internet Telephone Federal Standard 1037C Linux Telephone exchange Computer surveillance Malware Telegraphy Ethernet Hard disk USB flash drive Broadband Internet access Windows 2000 Control Panel (Windows) Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Wireless access point Computer virus Mouse (computing) Integrated Services Digital Network MDAC Computer security Virtual Network Computing PlayStation Portable Pretty Good Privacy Multiplayer IBM PC compatible GSM services Visual Basic Floppy disk FreeBSD Denial-of-service attack Nintendo Entertainment System Dialer Television Object Desktop Apple Computer Redundant array of independent disks Xbox 360 Internet Relay Chat Vertical service code Computer hardware Wireless Application Protocol Novell NetWare PlayStation 2 AirPort MAC address Laptop Telephone numbering plan Mandriva Linux AmigaOS WiMAX Blue screen of death Knoppix Prodigy (ISP) Opera (web browser) Apple Open Collaboration Environment Windows Vista Netfilter/iptables Rootkit HomePNA Private branch exchange Wireless mesh network Nintendo DS Voice over IP Files-11 Secure Shell File system General Packet Radio Service System/36 File Transfer Protocol Burglar alarm Internet protocol suite System/34 Differentiated services Skype Power line communication Java programming language

how many people can access my computer at one time though cable internet i'm thing a bough starting a internet business and i would like to find out how many people can access my computer at one time through cable internet that would help me determine how many computers i will need i'm guessing what you want to do is use your cable internet to provide internet access for other people you will need to be a registered business and you will need to use a special business account with your isp using a consumer account this is illegal i'm also pretty certain you have no idea how to implement this judging by the question you're asking anyway you can have as many people as you want theoretically realistically each one will only get a fraction of the bandwidth so it will depend on what kind of speeds you're selling to your users also your pc will only be able to handle a certain number of connections before it gets overloaded and crashes this will depend on the power of your servers and involves a lot of guessing and stress testing  Internet service provider Broadband Internet access Password Ethernet Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cable television CPU cache Domain Name System Modem Web traffic Steam (content delivery) Voice over IP Microsoft E-mail spam Computer insecurity Computer E-mail Digital Subscriber Line CPU design America Online Database management system Network address translation Web hosting IP Multimedia Subsystem Dial-up access History of the Internet PlayStation Portable The Internet Movie Database RISC Etisalat Bluetooth GSM services Telegraphy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Internet protocol suite Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Trademark Extreme Programming Gmail File system Copyleft Computer security Mach kernel Stopping e-mail abuse Internet privacy Cable modem PlayStation 3 Skype Floppy disk IEEE 802.11 Internet Relay Chat Windows XP MP3 Universal Serial Bus CompuServe Copy protection Password cracking Expert system Satellite internet MAME Windows 2000 Pretty Good Privacy Spam (electronic) Streaming media Datatype Mainframe computer AppleTalk Prodigy (ISP) Usenet Server Message Block C plus plus Polymorphism (computer science) Game programming Supercomputer Turing machine Redundant array of independent disks AT&T MMORPG Public-key cryptography Internet IBM PC compatible Enterprise content management Transmission Control Protocol Common Unix Printing System SETI@home Embedded system DVD Public domain Microsoft Windows RuneScape cheats Server

belkin wireless g plus mimo router i just got one and set it up pretty easily but it suppose to work ft and i can barly take the laptop out of my house i dont know what to do about this never had one before is this normal or what im not sure what to do id appricate any suggestions thanks guys well there is some information that the mfgs of routers don't make very clear you can indeed get around ft if your router is located outside and the ft distance is in a perfectly flat plane with no obstructions between the receiver and the router all ranges are done in the best of conditions just like the car manufacturers come up with mileage statements if your router is located near or in a window and you are outside you will get much further as long as that window is on the same side of the house etc things like walls floors brick all reduce signal and thus the range of your router metal or thick concrete walls will kill the signal very rapidly you can add higher gain antennas to the router to improve the coverage you can position the router for the best coverage within the house these will help extend useful range what your neighbors are running will also have an effect if there are a lot of wireless routers in the area your range will be reduced by the interference from them as well the other things that can bother distance includes wireless phones and other devices operating on gig wireless speakers for tv wireless intercoms wireless cameras etc all are in competition for the range of your router for the best range put your router in a location that gives a clear path to its signal sounds easy but its not in most homes a lot of experimentation is needed  Wi-Fi Bluetooth Wireless LAN Router Global Positioning System Loudspeaker Modem Drill bit Radar Cellular network Telephone Radio Universal Serial Bus Wireless access point Federal Standard 1037C IBM PC compatible Antenna (radio) Television Linux PlayStation 3 Cordless telephone History of radar Broadband Internet access WiMAX Oscilloscope GSM services Mobile phone radiation and health Mobile phone Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing X10 (industry standard) Amateur radio Microeconomics Equine conformation Sonar RISC Universal Mobile Telecommunications System ZigBee IPod Gramophone record Speed of light Stereoscopy VHF omnidirectional range Nintendo DS Mouse (computing) Speech recognition Cisco Systems Windows XP Air traffic control Bass guitar Glossary of American football MIPS architecture Microphone Transformer Color Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory E85 Solar power Apple Macintosh Volleyball Floppy disk Polarization Gas metal arc welding Microwave oven Operational amplifier Surveillance Hearing impairment Spark plug Cable television Morse Code Telegraphy Nintendo Revolution USB flash drive Routing Wireless Application Protocol Atari ST Internet Group Management Protocol Enhanced 911 Straw-bale construction Casting Plane (tool) Vacuum Tire Solar cell NTSC Wind power Windows Server 2003 Code division multiple access Gliding Communications satellite View camera Rachel Corrie Open Shortest Path First Wireless mesh network

how do i find my port number i trying to download a torrent but i want it fast so i need to find my port number on my computer that connects to my router i have a belkin soo any ideas you're very confused i will try to explain every computer that is connected to a network has thousands of ports when a program communicates over the network it uses a port every packet of data sent over a network contains a port number aswell as the address of the computer the purpose of a port number is simply so your computer knows which program the piece of data belongs to now it's important to understand that it is your router that is connected to the big internet network you computer is connected to the router through a smaller network and only to the internet through the router well making outgoing connections onto the internet like requesting a website over http is no problem the router just sends the request on out the internet incoming connections situations where your computer is the host or torrent seed however can be a problem because the router needs to know which local computer the connection is going to what i mean is computers out on the internet only see your router connected to the internet and are trying to request data directly from it the router needs to know where to send the request through to ok you need to set your router so that the used port number s redirect to your computer's address it's local ip the easiest way is to set your computer to the dmz demilitarized zone on the router which defaults every port through to your computer remember to unset the dmz after you're done though you don't want to be there all the time  Network address translation Internet Group Management Protocol Netfilter/iptables Internet protocol suite Denial-of-service attack AppleTalk Transmission Control Protocol Firewall (networking) BitTorrent Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IPv4 Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System Wi-Fi Computer Routing Peer-to-peer Uniform Resource Locator Voice over IP Telnet HyperText Transfer Protocol Ethernet Web crawler Universal Serial Bus Internet Control Message Protocol Novell NetWare Communications protocol MDAC HTTP cookie Differentiated services Streaming media Proxy server Modem Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Email authentication History of the Internet Computer virus Freenet IPv6 X Window System Skype E-mail Whois Bluetooth IP address Tor (anonymity network) Internet Spyware Windows XP Pretty Good Privacy Telegraphy E-mail spam Stateful firewall Internet privacy Open Shortest Path First HyperTransport OSI model File Transfer Protocol Port (computing) FidoNet Network switch Transport layer Embedded system Content-addressable memory Gnutella I2P Request for Comments General Packet Radio Service Internet Protocol Password Packet switching Perl Computer network Ping Cross site scripting World Wide Web GPRS Core Network Network congestion avoidance Border Gateway Protocol CPU design Demilitarized zone Kernel (computer science) PlayStation 3 Quality of service Lag Onion Routing Berkeley sockets Redundant array of independent disks National Weather Service Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Integrated services

is it possible for a linksys router that isnt online to send out a signal perhaps send out a signal with shared files i'm hoping to find a way to send files from my pc to my psp without having to save them on the memory stick or have it be directly connected to the pc my computer is part of a home network internet it certainly is possible depends on a few things if you're using xp win k or whatever on your pc you have to have file sharing turned on make sure you have a username and password set for the sharing and only share the things you intend to just in case someone else is listening next it's down to the connection method a if it's a usb connected modem router the psp can only use an over the air wifi connection e g a bg you can also do this with an ethernet connected router that has wifi make sure you turn on encryption for your safety and that your sharing psp has the same wifi passphrase or key for access b if it's a modem that has ethernet connection they usually have a mini hub with two or local lan connections in which case you can also use psp ethernet docking for sharing files if you have the ethernet dock expansion for your psp of course this can be faster and is a lot more secure but does need that extra bit of hardware finally make sure that both pcs or whatever have tcp ip addresses in the same basic range like typically y z where y and z are generally numbers in the ranges if you use dhcp addressing the default on linksys routers with ethernet or wifi this will be sorted out for you good luck  Router Password Wireless LAN PlayStation Portable Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Bluetooth PlayStation 3 AppleTalk Modem Digital Subscriber Line Novell NetWare Local area network Windows XP Voice over IP Transmission Control Protocol Internet Group Management Protocol Federal Standard 1037C Computer bus PlayStation 2 PowerPC Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cisco Systems MAC address Apple Macintosh Network address translation Streaming media Internet protocol suite Broadband Internet access AirPort Computer Denial-of-service attack IEEE 802.11 Commodore 64 Password cracking ALOHAnet Atari 8-bit family Communications protocol Wireless access point Musical Instrument Digital Interface Nintendo Revolution Token ring Apple Open Collaboration Environment Windows 2000 Copy protection Network switch IPod Uniform Resource Locator History of Microsoft Windows OSI model Storage area network IP Multimedia Subsystem E-mail IP address Computer network Passphrase IMac File Transfer Protocol CPU cache Domain Name System Linux kernel Computer security Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection FireWire General Packet Radio Service Netfilter/iptables NSA encryption systems 3Com Corporation Telnet Microsoft Windows PaX Desktop computer Floppy disk Dongle MP3 Telegraphy Internet Computer hardware Virtual Network Computing Cryptography Laptop HomePNA DECnet Computer networking device IBM PC compatible Internet Relay Chat OpenVPN Hotspot (wifi) OpenVMS

what happened to my wireless internet connection and computer something weird happened to my computer and i'd like to know what it was i'm using a wireless router and adapter and was online earlier i know for a fact i didn t press anything but my computer just restarted itself by itself i know i didn t do anything so why did it do that i looked over at the router and the internet light had gone off that when my computer had restarted itself the little green wireless icon on the taskbar had disappeared and when i looked at the adapter it said i had no adapters i was confused because my adapter was still plugged in and nothing had been moved so what happened there i couldn t get online as it was saying i had no wireless adapter and no connection so i shut down my computer and switched off the router left it for a few minutes switched everything back on and it was working again since then i've had the signal strength going up and down all the time from low to excellent whereas before today all it was ever at was excellent and the speed which is normally mbps has gone up and down from as low as mbps i'm worried as to whether anyone has access to my pc or don t know if i am just over reacting could the weather be interfering with it in anyway or is it something more serious any ideas i am worried my internet access is no longer safe and cant understand why my computer restarted itself thanks jn i do have a password for it if i try and connect manually instead of letting the pc connect automatically then it asks me for the password so is this safe enough i really dont want neighbours stealing my internet also its a wpa setting so that is the safer option isnt it rather than wep i'm not good with computers i dont think the pc needs to be restored though because the actual router itself is connecting faster than it did before just couldnt understand why the signal was going so crazy archmagus micael now you mention it it could have been a power cut because the router must have switched off too when i turned around it was searching for the internet light again and it only does that when it's first switched on so i guess it would do that after a power cut too hmm wireless adaptors have a tendency to do funny things at times but not normally unless you frequently experience problems you mentioned the weather really nasty weather like fog in the house lol can affect it as can local electrical discharges etc lightning ofcourse that's a bit doubtful that it happened if you've been having bad weather what might have happened is that you had a split second power cut at your house which explains the restart of the computer and also depending on your wireless router the possible resetting of the router if you yourself are having troubles connecting to your system then it's highly unlikely that anyone else is hacking into your system most routers use passwords anyway and if you have one set up you'll be in no trouble sorry to be so vague with the answers but wireless problems exist in literally hundreds of different forms so it's really very hard to fix without specifics try to connect yourself to the router by ethernet cable some routers have to have a tickbox set not default to be able to be accessed wirelessly if still no luck just try resetting everything to do with the wireless connection on both the router and your system and start again  Ethernet Modem Password Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Embedded system Mouse (computing) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bluetooth Wireless access point IEEE 802.11 PlayStation Portable Wireless LAN Nintendo Revolution Broadband Internet access Telegraphy System/36 Floppy disk Xbox Internet Group Management Protocol MAC address HyperTransport Cheating in Counter-Strike Nintendo DS AirPort PlayStation 2 Cisco Systems Digital Subscriber Line Router Password cracking Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Atari 8-bit family PowerPC Voice over IP Telephone exchange AppleTalk CPU cache Drill bit Diablo II Federal Standard 1037C Computer Piccolo Junior Saga PlayStation 3 Speed of light Wi-Fi Protected Access Phreaking Asynchronous Transfer Mode Copy protection Local area network Ecco the Dolphin Heinkel He 100 USB flash drive IPod Opera (web browser) Central processing unit RuneScape cheats Internet Laptop Electrophysiology Global Positioning System Theory of conduct History of the Internet Loudspeaker B-47 Stratojet Commodore 64 Mach kernel Nintendo GameCube Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Cable television Radar Web crawler Power line communication Social rule Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer security MP3 The Star Wars Holiday Special Xbox 360 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Danger Hiptop IEEE 802.11i GameFAQs Anchor Wardenclyffe Tower Communications satellite Musical Instrument Digital Interface Year 2000 problem Television Control-Alt-Delete ITU-T

what is telnet what the hell is telnet and how do i use it telnet teletype network is a way to open a serial text session over a network connection if your using tcp ip how do you use it well you will need a server or embedded device that supports a telnet session like maybe your router some network printers or perhaps a unix server then go into a command window or prompt start run cmd type telnet and the host address that you want to connect to either the host name or the ip address you will start a session with that host over telnet each telnet session is different depending on the host your connecting to each host will probably have it's own commands user names passwords and configurations telnet is only a tool to connect you to another tool over a network  Telnet Secure Shell Common Unix Printing System Simple Mail Transfer Protocol X Window System Transmission Control Protocol Internet Relay Chat Windows XP Novell NetWare Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server Unix Virtual Network Computing Teleprinter Uniform Resource Locator File Transfer Protocol Firewall (networking) Domain Name System Network address translation Windows Server 2003 Server Message Block Linux OSI model Mac OS X Session Initiation Protocol Internet protocol suite Proxy server Password IP address Bluetooth Windows 2000 Forth programming language Plan 9 (operating system) Denial-of-service attack MDAC Embedded system Whois HyperText Transfer Protocol Universal Plug and Play PowerPC DECnet HTTP cookie Remote Desktop Protocol PuTTY Computer IPv6 Stopping e-mail abuse Cmd.exe Digital Equipment Corporation I2P Mach kernel Universal Serial Bus Bulletin board system Commodore 64 MIPS architecture PARC Universal Packet Rlogin History of Microsoft Windows Active Directory Wi-Fi Terminal emulator PHP Web browser E-mail spam Port numbers BitTorrent Federal Standard 1037C File system E-mail Voice over IP Peer-to-peer Berkeley Software Distribution Operating system Windows 3.x Microsoft USB flash drive Microsoft Windows SCSI AmigaOS Booting Perl Direct Client-to-Client Ethernet Tor (anonymity network) OpenBSD Streaming media Kernel (computer science) Local area network Web hosting Blue screen of death

having trouble connecting to xbox live using my comcasat modem i know that it's because comcast doesn't support sharing networks but is there any way i can get my modem to work with other computers or xbox well form my past experiences with the xbox i found many problems with it for your specific problem assuming your refaring to accessing xbox live your modem does not support networking therefor you are unable to to attatch your xbox to your network however if your modem can be connected to a router of some sort this may resolve the problem because you can connect your xbox to the router and connect your modem to the same router although routers are fairly expensive however they are amazingly useful having able to connect devices in and they are commonly wireless compatible i personally suggest you go to a computer hardware store or some sort suggest pc world and you find a nice cheap router additionally i strongly urge you to ask information on the subject from the staff in pc world they have a facility in msot stores called techguys these will be able to provide you with the msot benificial information on the subject overall my suggestion is you purchase a router connect it up to your modem via an ethernet cable you may or may not want to purchase one connect the xbox via an ethernet and attempt to access xbox live i suggest you unplug your modem and xbox before attempting it and then givging it minutes to finalize a connection then attempt it if however you want to connect it to your computer solely so you can for example whach movies in wmv format or listen to your music via the computer or media center simply connect an ethernet form a port on your computer to your xbox and let ti connect very simple any further questions do not hesitate to contact me or add to your question  PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 Xbox 360 Xbox AppleTalk Modem Router Universal Serial Bus Wi-Fi Voice over IP PowerPC Bluetooth Broadband Internet access Password IMac MAC address Cisco Systems Denial-of-service attack Musical Instrument Digital Interface Local area network Computer Wireless LAN Internet protocol suite Commodore 64 Network address translation Nintendo GameCube Digital Subscriber Line MIPS architecture Desktop computer Floppy disk Game programmer Secure Digital card Computer and video games TiVo ITunes ALOHAnet Microsoft Asynchronous Transfer Mode Nintendo Entertainment System Cable television Nintendo DS Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Computer hardware Computer bus PlayStation Portable Computer network HomePNA Personal computer IPod Internet Group Management Protocol RS-232 IEEE 802.11 GSM services Windows XP Atari ST Wireless access point Computer networking device Storage area network X Window System IBook ZigBee Telegraphy Mach kernel Vorbis USB flash drive Private branch exchange Linux Digital video recorder Internet service provider Routing Skype DOCSIS Computer surveillance Embedded system Xbox Live MDAC OSI model Fiber distributed data interface Game controller Sega Dreamcast Redundant array of independent disks Virtual memory Console wars Apple IIGS Serial port CompuServe Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis X86 Federal Standard 1037C PCI Express Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

trouble connecting wire dsl modem online all lights are solid green i just bought a wire hg wifi wireless modem router at t dsl after some configuration on the setup page i managed to get all the lights on the modem solid green i am also able to connect my playstation online through the modem but when i try to connect online with my computer it gives me a connecting through wan miniport ppoe message then just stalls i was trying to connect through the same connection i had made from my sbc speedstream modem im wondering if i need to delete that and configure a new network connection and how i would go about doing that help i ran the wire set up wizard and at the end it tells me that the dsl signal ppp login internet address and isp link are all good it gives me a red dot and error on configuaration server link unable to contact the configuaration help it sounds like you were on the right track at the beginning you got the wire modem router set up with your username and password the configuration was correct and the connection was made you were also right about needing to delete the old speedstream connection details or at least don't click them to connect if you're connected to the new wire modem through ethernet you're already all set the changes in the internet explorer version web browser would be as follows tools internet options connections if you see always dial selected that's what's going wrong i've attached a screenshot and outlined the change in red in the past it had to make that sbc connection before the browser would work now the connection will be live all the time through the wire so you won't need to launch that anymore if you pick never dial and close then open the browser again it ought to 'just work' if you're launching the old sbc connection by hand don't do that opening the browser directly should network through the wire modem and go on out to the internet without any other configuration if you're connected to the wire modem using usb instead of ethernet you need to connect the ethernet cable that used to go to the speedstream modem into your new wire modem instead and reboot the pc i suspect however that you've already done that if so you're very close to complete the only network connection needed for the wire is the local area connection which is probably already working if you're still stuck after this write me  Modem Wi-Fi Password Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Xbox PlayStation 2 Internet fraud Router Universal Serial Bus Internet service provider Telegraphy Windows XP HTTP cookie Spyware Bluetooth Prodigy (ISP) Common Unix Printing System Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol PlayStation Portable Domain Name System Internet Group Management Protocol Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Computer bus MAC address Denial-of-service attack Windows Server 2003 RS-232 PlayStation 3 Federal Standard 1037C IMac Mouse (computing) America Online Point-to-Point Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Xbox 360 Computer network Asynchronous Transfer Mode GSM services Phishing Stopping e-mail abuse Opera (web browser) Internet protocol suite Sega Dreamcast Novell NetWare E-mail spam HomePNA Cisco Systems ITU-T Internet Wireless LAN Cable television Linux Telephone exchange Mozilla Firefox Netfilter/iptables Bulletin board system USB flash drive Communications protocol AppleTalk Nintendo Revolution Netscape Communications Corporation Network address translation Dialer IP Multimedia Subsystem E-mail Transmission Control Protocol AirPort Telephone Neopets 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines IEEE 802.11 Integrated Services Digital Network Commodore 64 X Window System Null modem GameFAQs Power line communication Musical Instrument Digital Interface MDAC Control Panel (Windows) Morse Code Computer Streaming media Atari 8-bit family Internet privacy WiMAX Knoppix Nintendo GameCube IP address Windows 2000 Serial port Microsoft

wireless router how do i secure my router i have two laptops that log on to my unsecure network use either wep or wpa encryption you should be able to set this up using the manual if you do not have the manual just go to the manufactures website and download it wpa is more secure than wep i recommend also turning on mac address filtering and allow only the mac addresses listed to access the router to see what your mac address is on your wifi card click start then run they type cmd once there type ipconfig all the mac address is the physical address which looks somthing like this ab b enter that into the routers authorized mac address list this will give you much more security and make it pretty much impossible to get in  Wi-Fi Wardriving IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN Wired Equivalent Privacy IEEE 802.11i Wi-Fi Protected Access Wireless access point Windows XP Related-key attack Router AirPort Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mac OS X Bluetooth Internet Group Management Protocol RC4 Ethernet MAC address Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Password Apple Macintosh PowerPC Hard disk Gmail Hotspot (wifi) Apple Open Collaboration Environment Extensible Authentication Protocol Cisco Systems Denial-of-service attack Copy protection Windows 2000 FreeBSD Linux Data retention Skype Common Unix Printing System Internet Internet Relay Chat Computer virus Commodore 64 Netfilter/iptables PlayStation Portable Mozilla Firefox Wget OSI model Mac OS 9 Federal Standard 1037C USB flash drive Local area network Mac OS X v10.4 AppleTalk Network address translation Pretty Good Privacy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines System 7 (Macintosh) E-mail Embedded system Apple Computer Microprocessor Laptop Cryptography Public-key cryptography PHP Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Cryptographic hash function Java programming language Peer-to-peer Malware PlayStation 3 Mouse (computing) E-mail spam Telegraphy ZigBee Differentiated services Secure Digital card Knoppix Onion Routing Mach kernel MDAC NSA encryption systems Perl History of Microsoft Windows Stopping e-mail abuse Proxy server Screenshot File system IPod Windows Vista Surveillance Network switch X Window System ITunes Cisco IOS Comparison of web browsers Xbox IPv4

full home ethernet networking my house has built in ethernet wiring with jacks in every room each of these long wires end up connected to a dual speed stackable hub in my basement currently i have dsl and i have a router connected to my dsl modem in a bedroom i use one of the four out jacks on my router to plug into the room jack downstairs the hub recognizes this wire as the link and now i can pull a wired internet connection in any room so questions if i were to pull an internet connection in rooms simultaneously will this slow down the internet if i were to move the modem router to the basement and insert an ethernet cable into one of the out s on the router and the other end into the hub will this work again will speed be compromised thanks for the input guys i'll let this forum on for a few more hours at least to let more responses in the main point was this i need wired connections for some equipment i run and i can't connect wireless to it additionally do you all think i can buy a switch and seamlessly replace the hub with it i am also going to get verizon fios and they provide a gateway so gone is the issue of having a dsl line in the basement there are a couple of issues here a bandwidth you get a certain amount of bandwidth from your dsl provider if all of the active connections take up more than the available bandwidth you will notice slowdowns b hub or switch there is a difference between using a hub and using a switch a mb hub with connections will split the mb into a mb switch with connections will try to provide mb for each port if you are using a true hub then you may notice slow downs however the sneaky marketing people have been selling switches labeled as hubs there are a few responses that talk about wireless ethernet it is an option but make sure you understand the security implications before jumping on the wireless bandwagon also there is a difference between mbps ethernet connections and mbps wireless g again it depends on your situation to answer your question probably not as along as the total bandwidth is below what the dsl company gives you yes if you move the dsl connection to basement  Modem Broadband Internet access Router Cisco Systems Universal Serial Bus Cable television WiMAX Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Power line communication Internet service provider Xbox Voice over IP Wi-Fi Wireless access point Telegraphy Bluetooth Integrated Services Digital Network Xbox 360 IP Multimedia Subsystem Internet protocol suite Musical Instrument Digital Interface TIA-568A/B HomePNA PlayStation 2 Federal Standard 1037C Broadband Laptop DOCSIS Cable modem Quality of service IMac AirPort Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Differentiated services Denial-of-service attack Super Nintendo Entertainment System Local area network USB flash drive Floppy disk Nintendo DS Telephone Computer bus Oscilloscope General Packet Radio Service Embedded system Loudspeaker Acorn Computers Serial communications Nintendo Revolution Computer networking device Internet Group Management Protocol Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Television Transmission Control Protocol Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Routing Alcatel Token ring Network switch Commodore 64 Network address translation Computer network 3Com Corporation Electrical wiring Multiprotocol Label Switching DVD ALOHAnet Jack plug Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Antenna (radio) IPv6 Lag HyperTransport Verizon Wireless Windows XP Satellite internet IBook ITU-T Category 5 cable IPod Softswitch U.S. Robotics Netfilter/iptables Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Congestion control

do i lose bandwidth because my internet connection is spread throughout the house using a wlan router even when using only one computer is is just as fast id i don't run it through the wlan router the good news is that most wireless routers support faster speeds and more bandwidth than your internet service provider can actually give you and a computer will only use as much of the bandwidth as it needs the bad news is that it is possible for a single computer on a wireless network to completely hog all the bandwidth from your internet service provider but it takes work as long as everybody sharing the wireless connection is only using the internet for one or two standard tasks you shouldn't notice any major slowdowns however if everybody is trying to access the internet with high bandwidth tasks like streaming video or downloading large files then you can use your available bandwidth up pretty quickly let's use an example to understand how the internet and the home networks interact if you have an g router then your wireless router can transmit at up to mb every second in comparison most broadband providers only offer download speeds of between mb per second and mb per second what this means is that if one computer is streaming a kbps internet radio channel and downloading a movie at mbps and chatting it up on skype there isn't going to be much outside bandwidth left for any other computers trying to reach the outside world over the internet within the home wireless network however only mbps of the available mbps are being consumed therefore a second laptop on the network may only be able to download a song at kbps from the internet but they'll be able to stream video from their local media center pc at mbps and it'll still flow smoothly i hope that helps clarify things for you gl  Wireless LAN Broadband Internet access Wi-Fi Voice over IP Streaming media Skype Bluetooth Modem PlayStation 3 IEEE 802.11 General Packet Radio Service Internet service provider Internet Universal Serial Bus Asynchronous Transfer Mode Digital Subscriber Line Windows XP Network address translation Universal Mobile Telecommunications System BitTorrent Router IP Multimedia Subsystem ITunes Telegraphy WiMAX Ethernet Power line communication Differentiated services Video on demand Transmission Control Protocol Nintendo Revolution Peer-to-peer Verizon Wireless Internet protocol suite Wireless Warez PlayStation Portable Wireless access point Xbox Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Digital television Wireless mesh network Satellite internet Session Initiation Protocol MP3 High-definition television Broadband Networks Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting GSM services Federal Standard 1037C Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mobile phone File sharing Broadband Web crawler Mapua Institute of Technology Telephone Television Computer and video games Radio Podcasting Instant messaging Telkom PCI Express Internet Group Management Protocol Morse Code HIPERLAN Lag Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Internet pornography Mac OS X Now Broadband TV Vorbis IBM PC compatible Broadcasting Floppy disk DOCSIS Mobile ad-hoc network Apple Computer Prodigy (ISP) AT&T Nintendo DS MSN Messenger MDAC Nintendo GameCube Newsgroup Windows Vista Digital audio broadcasting Frame relay Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks

what's the best internet security software hardware for a lan what's the very best internet security software hardware out there i don't care if it runs on windows linux unix freebsd mac etc i'm just looking for the best security for a lan with computers sharing internet and files on it i hear good things in using freebsd or linux on a barebone machine with a way lan device to further protect an incoming line what are your experiences with these are they really better than sticking to router firewalls what about antivirus and firewall software for lans i have yet to find a peice of antivirus software that can scan every computer on the lan at once is that possible that'd be great because automatic scanning always interupts one of our users and hogs of the cpu power which is normal but frustrating for a someone rending footage or animation and they have to start all over because of skipped frames caused by a lack of cpu at a moment try pfsense or m n wall firewalls they run on a standalone box and act as a firewall router on the pcs any antivirus software should allow you to schedule when scans take place set the scan to happen at am or corrdinate a time with the users so they know it's going to happen something free like avg would work for that you could spend the big bucks and go with symantec's corprate solutions but you'd have to setup a dedicated server to manage the clients  Linux Microsoft Windows Anti-virus software Windows XP Wi-Fi Skype Computer virus Wireless LAN Operating system Router Computer security X Window System Server OpenBSD FreeBSD Spyware Internet security IBM PC compatible Rootkit Windows Vista Voice over IP Mac OS X Embedded system Novell NetWare Mandriva Linux Cisco Systems Mach kernel Xbox History of Microsoft Windows Common Unix Printing System Linux kernel Buffer overflow Berkeley Software Distribution Windows Server 2003 DragonFly BSD Apple Macintosh Unix Linux distribution Proxy server Streaming media AppleTalk Virtual Network Computing Macromedia Flash File Transfer Protocol Peer-to-peer Amiga OS/2 NX bit MAC address Thread (computer science) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Microsoft Quake Network address translation Kernel (computer science) Java programming language IPod MIPS architecture Mozilla Firefox Bluetooth Perl USB flash drive NeXT Microprocessor Denial-of-service attack PowerPC Internet Relay Chat Thin client AmigaOS Opera (web browser) MAME Redundant array of independent disks Session Initiation Protocol ITunes Secure Shell Computer forensics Common criticisms of Microsoft Booting Sun Microsystems Digital rights management PlayStation 3 History of the graphical user interface Microsoft Office Commodore 64 Internet Explorer Apple IIGS Virtual memory 64-bit SETI@home Floppy disk Appliance

are wireless networks now as good as wired i'm moving office we only have pc's on the current wired network but i'm thinking i have the opportunity to go wireless in the new office although i gather wires are already there are there any advantages these days in staying wired wired networks have three main advantages over wireless networks speed cost and reliability wireless networks offer two main advantages over wired networks flexibility and lack of cables wired networks are relatively simple to configure you add a network card to each computer attach a cable to the network card and the switch or hub and you re in business another point on which wired networks often score over wireless networks is security because the range of a wireless access device often extends beyond the physical boundaries of the location it s covering someone can tap into the network from outside the location check this link http www netgear co uk home newnetwork wiredwireless php  Ethernet Wi-Fi Wireless access point Universal Serial Bus Internet IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth Modem AirPort Computer bus Loudspeaker Electrical wiring Computer Cable television PlayStation Portable High-voltage direct current Federal Standard 1037C WiMAX Voice over IP Surveillance USB flash drive Telephone tapping Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Verizon Wireless Local area network Secure Digital card Wi-Fi Protected Access Windows 2000 Xbox 360 Computer network Embedded system Coaxial cable Redundant array of independent disks Telephone Token ring Central processing unit Apple Macintosh Transmission Control Protocol Windows XP Broadband Internet access Wireless mesh network Wireless Application Protocol TIA-568A/B Xbox Wireless community network RS-232 PHP Amstrad CPC Personal area network Mach kernel Field-programmable gate array Advanced Technology Attachment Transformer Octopus card Burglar alarm Covert listening device IP Multimedia Subsystem Password Global Positioning System Digital Subscriber Line Computer surveillance Integrated Services Digital Network Mobile phone T-Mobile Amateur radio Cisco Systems Wireless X10 (industry standard) Rogers Communications Web crawler Nortel Networks PlayStation 3 Routing Transistor Hall effect Magnetic core memory Electric motor Nintendo DS Wind turbine Wardriving Telephone exchange Logic gate Apple Computer FireWire United Parcel Service CPU design INSTEON Storage area network System/36 Commodore 64

what is the difference between dhcp and dhcp relay agent a dhcp relay agent is a router or computer that is configured to listen for dhcp or bootp broadcast from dhcp clients and then relay those messages to dhcp servers on different subnets dhcp clients use broadcasts from a dhcp server to secure a lease network routers do not pass broadcasts unless they are specifically configured to do so his means that a dhcp server can normally provide ip addresses to clients which are located on the same subnet many organizations want to centralize their dhcp servers as they find it easier to manage these organizations must configure their network so that dhcp broadcasts will be passed from the client to the dhcp server this can be done in any of the two ways by configuring the routers which connect the subnets to forward dhcp broadcasts or by configuring dhcp relay agents the routing and remote access service under microsoft windows is able to function as a dhcp relay agent dhcp relay agent vs dual dhcp servers to provide fault tolerance you should have at least two responders to dhcp client requests on every subnet if you have two or more subnets you can use dhcp relay agents to provide fault tolerance and to keep management overhead at a minimum for this you should assign a dhcp server to each subnet and then create non overlapping scopes for both subnets on both servers then you should deploy a dhcp relay agent on each subnet that is configured to forward packets with a slight delay to the dhcp sever in another subnet this configuration will allow you to designate one dhcp server as the primary responder to dhcp requests and to provide a backup route to another server if needed how a dhcp relay agent works the following steps describe how a dhcp relay agent works the dhcp client broadcasts a dhcpdiscover packet the dhcp relay agent on the client's subnet forwards the dhcpdiscover message to the dhcp server by using unicast the dhcp server uses unicast to send a dhcpoffer message to the dhcp relay agent the dhcp relay agent broadcasts the dhcpoffer packet to the dhcp client's subnet the dhcp client broadcasts a dhcprequest packet the dhcp relay agent on the client's subnet forwards the dhcprequest message to the dhcp server by using unicast the dhcp server uses unicast to send a dhcpack message to the dhcp relay agent the dhcp relay agent broadcasts the dhcpack to the dhcp client's subnet using the microsoft dhcp server as a dhcp relay agent configuring a dhcp relay agent open routing and remote access console right click the server and then click configure and enable routing and remote access on the welcome page to routing and remote access setup wizard page click next on the configuration page select custom configuration and then click next on the custom configuration page select lan routing and then click next on the completing routing and remote access setup wizard page click finish in routing and remote access warning dialog box click yes to start the service on the remote access vpn server page click finish in the options of console tree expand the server expand ip routing and then select general right click general tab and click the new routing protocol in the new routing protocol page click the dhcp relay agent and click ok configuring a dhcp relay agent with the ip address of the dhcp server open routing and remote access console in the options of console tree select dhcp relay agent right click the dhcp relay agent click properties on general tab server address field type ip address of the dhcp server that you wish to forward dhcp request to click add then click ok enabling the dhcp relay agent on a interface of router open routing and remote access console in the options of console tree select dhcp relay agent right click the dhcp relay agent click new interface select the interface on which you want to enable the dhcp relay agent and then click ok in the properties dialog box of dhcp relay agent general tab make sure that relay dhcp packet is selected configure the boot threshold seconds and hop count threshold if needed and then click ok the dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp is a set of rules used by communications devices such as a computer router or network adapter to allow the device to request and obtain an ip address from a server which has a list of addresses available for assignment dhcp is a protocol used by networked computers clients to obtain ip addresses and other parameters such as the default gateway subnet mask and ip addresses of dns servers from a dhcp server the dhcp server ensures that all ip addresses are unique e g no ip address is assigned to a second client while the first client's assignment is valid its lease has not expired thus ip address pool management is done by the server and not by a human network administrator dhcp emerged as a standard protocol in october dhcp is a successor to the older bootp protocol whose leases were given for infinite time and did not support options due to the backward compatibility of dhcp very few networks continue to use pure bootp as of rfc dated march provides the latest dhcp definition as of the latest non standard of the protocol is rfc dated july which describes dhcpv dhcp in an ipv environment  Visual Basic Microsoft News server Freenet Pretty Good Privacy Spring

is there a maximum optimum length for an ethernet cable can an ethernet cable be any length or will it effect performance interference and speed if the cable is too long what is the maximum legnth of ethernet cable that can be used without compromising data transfer can anyone recommend reference sites for setting up a non wireless computer terminal at a considerable distance from the dsl modem ethernet under the standards is not supposed to go over meters of cable length or else the throughput actual speeds fades if you have a crappy router or switch that can also minimize the throughput if you're making your own cables that will decrease it some more in the end i think the maximum speed can only be achieved with meters or less some people say going over meters may slow it down everyone's experience will be difference but in the end you may notice the difference  Digital Subscriber Line Federal Standard 1037C Asynchronous Transfer Mode Universal Serial Bus SCSI Modem Bluetooth ARCNET Router Password Wi-Fi Local area network WiMAX Cable television ALOHAnet Serial ATA Cisco Systems Transmission Control Protocol HomePNA OSI model Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Action potential Token ring Optical fiber Computer bus Advanced Technology Attachment Nintendo Revolution FireWire 10-gigabit Ethernet ITU-T General Packet Radio Service Cable modem Digital photography AppleTalk TIA-568A/B Physical layer Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Cray-1 Telegraphy GSM services Redundant array of independent disks Category 5 cable PlayStation 3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Power over Ethernet 3Com Corporation Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 100BASE-TX SCADA Myrinet Broadband Fuel injection Embedded system Internet service provider Transformer Airbus A380 Power line communication Loudspeaker MIPS architecture PowerPC AirPort Computer Speed of light Throughput Floppy disk Oscilloscope IP Multimedia Subsystem Sega Dreamcast High-voltage direct current Integrated Services Digital Network 10BASE-T Magnetic tape Interstate Highway X.25 Secure Digital card Radio TGV MAC address Antenna (radio) Telephone Central processing unit Personal rapid transit Xbox Hash table Spacecraft propulsion Explosive material DMX (lighting) Radar Nintendo GameCube Propeller Jet engine

is there any way to make your home network act as a proxy server i have a netgear wgr v wireless router and i was wondering if it would be possible to connect to it from another computer to use my internet connection basically make my home network a proxy i would rather not have to connect to my computer to do it i have already used remote desktop connection to basically do this but that was rediculously slow and a serious security risk so is it possible and how might i do it i just have to ask anthony how could it possibly be illegal to use your home network as a proxy it might be against some rules at school but illegal i only want to do this because my school just made it against the rules to access your email no matter what you use it for if i wanted to hide something why in the world would i want to use my home network which would be easily traceable to me you can't turn it into a proxy that would require broadband connections each with fixed ip addresses the cost is prohibitive  Proxy server Network address translation E-mail spam Router Windows XP Stopping e-mail abuse Internet Wi-Fi Password Windows Server 2003 Transmission Control Protocol Wireless LAN Tor (anonymity network) Virtual private network Internet privacy IP Multimedia Subsystem Firewall (networking) Data retention Secure Shell Denial-of-service attack Internet Relay Chat Broadband Internet access Modem Satellite internet E-mail Gmail Bluetooth X Window System Skype Cisco Systems Surveillance Computer Local area network Internet security Internet censorship in mainland China Open mail relay America Online Danger Hiptop Streaming media Virtual Network Computing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Microsoft Telegraphy MDAC BlackBerry Web crawler Computer security Grid computing Xbox Distributed computing WiMAX Pseudonymity Digital Subscriber Line Windows 2000 Ajax (programming) History of Microsoft Windows Whois Computer virus IP address Internet service provider Anonymity Anonymous remailer Spam (electronic) MSN Messenger Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Novell NetWare Wget File Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista Wireless access point Apple Open Collaboration Environment Lag Computer insecurity Onion Routing Server PowerPC Squid cache Pretty Good Privacy Quality of service I2P Data center IMac Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Telnet Spyware AppleTalk Multiplayer Apple Macintosh Communications protocol Dial-up access Personal computer Universal Serial Bus Internet Message Access Protocol HyperText Transfer Protocol Telephone

will a router with a higher mbps cabability make my internet faster your adapter has to be able to connect at that speed as well otherwise it will connect at a compatable speed then of course depending on signal strength will go down from there also its probably not the pc to router connection but the dsl or cable connection you want to increase the router is probably at least megs most likely about but your backbone is probably megs you need to call the isp to upgrade that if possible and that'll cost you more  Broadband Internet access Digital Subscriber Line Internet service provider Asynchronous Transfer Mode IEEE 802.11 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Cable television Telegraphy Differentiated services Border Gateway Protocol Voice over IP Modem Power line communication Serial communications Xbox Broadband IiNet Ethernet Nintendo Revolution Cisco Systems SCSI PlayStation 3 Wireless LAN Wi-Fi HomePNA Dial-up access PowerPC Routing Denial-of-service attack HyperTransport High-speed rail Network address translation Integrated Services Digital Network MIPS architecture Bluetooth Floppy disk Etisalat Optical fiber Welding NSA encryption systems TGV Universal Serial Bus Cable modem USB flash drive Open Shortest Path First Tier 1 carrier General Packet Radio Service Autonomous system (Internet) Windows Server 2003 Quality of service Softmodem Eircom Wind turbine Light rail ITU-T Drill bit Email authentication PlayStation 2 Digital circuit Central processing unit WiMAX History of the Internet RS-232 Netfilter/iptables Wood router Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telephone exchange Oscilloscope Frame relay Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Coaxial cable Mac OS X Password Telephone DVD Distributed computing Wireless access point Skype NTL Communications protocol IBM PC compatible DOCSIS 10-gigabit Ethernet FireWire Transistor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Peering JANET Satellite internet Prodigy (ISP) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MAC address Web crawler Multiprotocol Label Switching AppleTalk EarthLink Open mail relay Redundant array of independent disks

wireless router how do i determine what type of wireless router i need for my apartment i need it to work from one room to another and i what do i need to get for my computer to make it work i'm sure most anything you get would cover your apartment assuming its an average sq ft or so you can get a linksys from walmart for bucks or so the computer closest to the dsl phone jack will probably use ethernet and most pcs have an ethernet card but double check the other pc will need a wireless adapter you can get a usb wireless adapter for about bucks at walmart  Cisco Systems Router Wi-Fi Wireless LAN Universal Serial Bus IEEE 802.11 HomePNA Ethernet Xbox 3Com Corporation MAC address Digital Subscriber Line Nintendo Revolution Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Secure Digital card IBook IMac AirPort Computer network Wireless access point PlayStation 3 Local area network Personal computer Asynchronous Transfer Mode USB flash drive Floppy disk Softmodem Musical Instrument Digital Interface PowerPC Hotspot (wifi) Dongle Modem GSM services Wireless network Laptop Federal Standard 1037C PCI Express SCSI Linux Closed-circuit television PlayStation Portable CompactFlash Radio Computer bus Power line communication Broadcom ALOHAnet Desktop computer Mac mini AppleTalk Power Macintosh G3 Internet Embedded system WRT54G Password Internet protocol suite PC motherboard Protocol stack Telephone Internet Group Management Protocol Verizon Wireless Digital audio player Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Windows XP IPod Xbox 360 Computer hardware Wi-Fi Protected Access Nintendo DS PlayStation 2 Internet service provider Symbol Technologies Tablet PC Poker jargon Hard disk Mobile ad-hoc network D-subminiature Danger Hiptop Computer networking device Broadband Internet access 10-gigabit Ethernet IBM PC Telegraphy DECnet Memory card Cingular Wireless Security token Host adapter Speech recognition Apple Macintosh Sprint Nextel Corporation Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing WiMAX Surveillance Tungsten Handheld Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mobile phone Terry Pratchett

networking between two buildings my business has acquired another building and naturally we need to incorporate the new building into our existing network the buildings are located down the street from one another and there are houses and trees inbetween we currently have a wireless antenna set up on each building but we have experienced limited connectivity during stormy weather there are trees that block the line of sight in the spring when the leaves come it there are a total of about seven houses in between our two buildings we are basically looking for a reliable alternative to the faulty wireless solution that we have in place now any suggestions now obviously you are looking for the cheapest solution being a business and must conform to all appropriate regulations you say you have a wireless antenna and have not specified what bandwidth this can carry i'll assume therefore you only require a standard speed link the fastest and most reliable method is obviosly using standard ethernet cables from router to router giving you a megbyte per second link between buildings easily enough for the e mails between workers the downside of this solution is that seven houses in between woulod mean a cable above or below the ground between buildings if permission wasn't required for this it would easily be the cheapest solution but any one of the seven householders could say no or the council which they will so virtual private networking if both offices have connections to the internet then you can host a link via your internet connections but i would assume as you are small businesses that your link would be slow and therefore this would not be suitable two servers at each end can be set up to route external traffic other the internet between each other this can also be encrypted and secured another method is requesting bt to establish you a conneciton however this method is likely to be expensive which as i mentioned earlier is probably out of your budget hope this helps  Wi-Fi Ethernet Wireless LAN Transmission Control Protocol Telegraphy IEEE 802.11 Broadband Internet access Cable television Universal Serial Bus AppleTalk Asynchronous Transfer Mode Voice over IP Wireless access point Digital Subscriber Line Federal Standard 1037C Router USB flash drive WiMAX Network address translation Internet Denial-of-service attack Global Positioning System Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Password Quality of service Internet protocol suite Television TGV Amateur radio MAC address Cisco Systems Electric power transmission Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus IP Multimedia Subsystem Digital television Antenna (radio) Private branch exchange Routing Storage area network Skype Windows 2000 Internet Relay Chat AirPort Xbox IPv6 Personal rapid transit Wireless mesh network Proxy server PlayStation 3 Internet service provider Redundant array of independent disks Domain Name System Computer BitTorrent Local area network E-mail Peer-to-peer Frame relay NSA encryption systems Differentiated services Communications satellite Novell NetWare Nintendo Revolution Hard disk PlayStation 2 Lag Radio Electrical wiring Pretty Good Privacy Satellite internet Streaming media Wardriving IPv4 PowerPC Enterprise content management Oscilloscope GSM services Server Message Block Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Serial communications Surveillance LAN party Computer virus Wind turbine Teletext Xbox 360 Digital circuit Communications protocol Stopping e-mail abuse X Window System PHP CPU cache HTTP cookie PlayStation Portable

are there any wireless internet service providers in mn all you need for wireless internet from your existing provider is a router that includes a wireless access point most internet providers will charge you as much as the cost of a router each month to provide you with wireless internet when all you need to do is get a wireless access point router and a wireless network interface card or other adapter like a usb type for your computer it's very simple to do the router directions usually walk you through it and it's a lot cheaper than getting it through your internet provider you can do it yourself and probably get out for under i set my own up and had no experience actually doing it although i understood the theory behind it it took me all of abour minutes  Wi-Fi Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth Router MAC address Telegraphy Cisco Systems PlayStation 3 Internet Group Management Protocol Wireless Application Protocol Nintendo Revolution Routing PlayStation Portable Computer Network address translation Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Local area network Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Differentiated services ZigBee Modem IEEE 802.11 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IMac AirPort USB flash drive Verizon Wireless Wireless access point Internet Mobile ad-hoc network Internet protocol suite Linux Hotspot (wifi) Asynchronous Transfer Mode Wireless network Virgin Mobile Nintendo DS Mouse (computing) Federal Standard 1037C IPod AppleTalk GSM services 3Com Corporation Embedded system Broadband Internet access Wi-Fi Protected Access Windows XP Telephone Digital Subscriber Line Amateur radio Wireless community network Wireless mesh network WiMAX Windows Server 2003 IBook Wireless IP address Radio EGovernment Apple Macintosh Streaming media Quality of service Satellite internet Internet service provider Windows 2000 Xbox Request for Comments Computer network Wardriving Common Unix Printing System IEEE 802.11i Personal computer History of the Internet HomePNA MDAC Cisco IOS Domain Name System America Online GPRS Core Network T-Mobile Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Multiprotocol Label Switching Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Skype Rogers Communications Novell NetWare PlayStation 2 Secure Digital card MSN TV CompuServe Communications protocol Mac mini General Packet Radio Service History of Microsoft Windows Internet cafe PCI Express BlackBerry

i just made a shared folder on my wireless ntwork but i cant see it on my old win se computer i see it on all my xp machines but not the please help thanks file and printer sharing on windows xp and windows systems can be a little difficult you should first insure that you are on the same network on all the computers you can do this by pressing the windows key and the pause break button on your keyboard this will pull up your system properties window you should then go to your computer name tab check the workgroup name on all the computers ideally you would want to keep these the same to reduce network problems next you will want to go to your control panel then to network connections right click on your local area connection or wireless connection depending on the system and then click on properties check to make sure you have the file and printer sharing for microsoft networks installed and checked if not then go to install and double click service and then find this service once you've verified that you have file sharing enabled and the computers are on the same network it is time to check the settings of your firewalls the windows firewall can be restored to default settings through the control panel if you restore to default settings i'd make sure you set an exception for file sharing under the exceptions tab all other firewalls should have documentation that walks you through enabling file sharing you may need to visit the website of your firewall provider if you ever have problems with file and print sharing you should always look for the following on the same network service installed and enabled firewall not blocking the service good luck  Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 Control Panel (Windows) Windows Server 2003 Bluetooth Mac OS X System 7 (Macintosh) Firewall (networking) Opera (web browser) Common Unix Printing System Spyware Windows Vista MDAC Universal Serial Bus Embedded system Windows registry Xerox Star Novell NetWare Screenshot Mozilla Firefox PHP Skype Apple Macintosh Virtual memory Unicode Password Object Desktop Buffer overflow Proxy server Network address translation File Transfer Protocol E-mail Pretty Good Privacy Blue screen of death Computer security Computer insecurity Ethernet EMule USB flash drive NTFS Netfilter/iptables AmigaOS PlayStation Portable Apple typography Domain Name System Computer virus Computer Wi-Fi Windows Installer System/36 Hello world program Mandriva Linux Local area network Freenet Cascading Style Sheets Gmail Windows API Double-click (computing) Active Directory Mach kernel NX bit Peer-to-peer X Window System Internet Explorer Kazaa MSN Messenger Voice over IP Mozilla Application Suite IPod 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Python programming language Server Message Block Malware Windows Explorer Spring operating system Common criticisms of Microsoft Mac OS history Mac OS X v10.4 Device driver Stardock DragonFly BSD

when i use batch to move files from a linux computer to an win one why is there an hr difference my co worker and i transfer three files from our linux computer to our windows sp computer about once an hour one file we pull over to the computer using a program we then run a batch file that renames that file by looking for pdf there's only one pdf in the folder so this works well then this first batch file calls a second batch file the second batch file copies the remaining two files from the linux computer to the windows computer then it renames both of these files the first file pulled over with software has the correct date problem the two files pulled via batch and renamed show a modified date in the folder that is hours behind the actual time it is always hours difference we create the original files on the linux computer just before transfer any ideas what might be causing this first thing to check is the locale settings for windows and linux if there is a time or zone difference then there is very possibility for the issue to occur in this scenario the file downloaded by some software does not create any problem as the software just pulls over the file with the file attributes from the source software does not allow file to directly interact with system however with batch file it directly interacts with system and takes the destination system locale  Computer virus Microsoft Windows Thread (computer science) Linux Virtual memory Windows 2000 Linux distribution Debugging NTFS Windows XP IBM PC compatible Mac OS X Btrieve MS-DOS Software bug Operating system MDAC File Allocation Table Concurrent Versions System Emacs Mach kernel DOS Rootkit ITunes Windows registry Java programming language GNU General Public License Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista Redundant array of independent disks COMMAND.COM Portable Document Format Gmail Patch (computing) Spyware GNOME File format Macromedia Flash SCO-Linux controversies Domain Name System Peer-to-peer Open-source software CPU cache X Window System BitTorrent Pretty Good Privacy Wine (software) Perl Unicode SCO v.

upgrade wireless network with router and or network card i set up my home wireless network about a month ago but the signal strength is always very low file transfer is very slow transferring large files is important to me and streaming media files are often interrupted i have at t dsl and my wire modem is also my wireless router my laptop is equipped w the factory g wireless card i want to upgrade my hardware to improve the signal and capabilities so i'm thinking of getting g mimo or n hardware i want the least expensive but effective solution will upgrading the router but not network card but keeping the same router make any significant difference in performance how about just upgrading the router or both what is the approximate performance improvement of each of these options are there potential problems w hooking up a separate router to a modem router combo even w disabling wireless on the wire i'm learning as i go with networking not as savvy as i'd like to be so i appreciate the help thanks for the help so far yes i am certain i'm connecting to my own network i didn't laugh though i know those things are easy to do i just looked at the configuration settings and its set to the default which is b g but the max connection rate is mbps so i assume that tells me g right the problem is not that i can't connect i definitely connect and i have my laptop hooked up to my tv and sound system so i can listen to my itunes files shared across the network so the connection does work its just a sub par connection if i stream video files they keep stopping to reconnect etc and large files take forever to transfer the strength is always very low on rare occasions just low late at night wireless on these modems is always poor replace it with a combined router modem anything will give better wireless performance just make sure you mount the router as high as possible and clear of obstructions since the inbuilt card is limited to g do not go mad on getting a very expensive router it will have no advantage  Modem Universal Serial Bus Wi-Fi Bluetooth Broadband Internet access Atari 8-bit family Windows XP Asynchronous Transfer Mode Digital Subscriber Line Cable television RS-232 IBM PC compatible Verizon Wireless Computer bus Xbox Voice over IP Commodore 64 Apple Computer Softmodem Embedded system Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Redundant array of independent disks Laptop IBook IMac ITU-T GSM services Windows Vista Telegraphy Floppy disk Streaming media ITunes Internet Radeon IPod TGV Netfilter/iptables Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer Apple Macintosh Television AirPort Windows 2000 Phreaking Universal Mobile Telecommunications System PCI Express History of Microsoft Windows Power line communication Internet protocol suite AppleTalk Novell NetWare PlayStation Portable Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MIPS architecture Personal computer Linux Musical Instrument Digital Interface PC Engine ALOHAnet Windows Server 2003 Wireless access point Xbox 360 Sound recording Telephone WiMAX Password Spyware Atari ST Mouse (computing) Nintendo GameCube High-definition television Cisco Systems Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol FireWire TRS-80 TiVo Nintendo DS Differentiated services Laserdisc Wireless mesh network MP3 MIM-23 Hawk USB flash drive Cheating in Counter-Strike Microsoft Windows General Packet Radio Service CPU cache
