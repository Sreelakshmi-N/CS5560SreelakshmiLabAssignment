what would a change from sunday to monday do to the indy i think it would be nothing but a positive other than tuesday being the day to make up for a rain delay i think it would be a good move you would get the nascar doubles like tony stewert and robby gordon back and who knows maybe even drivers like jeff gordon and ryan newman all indiana natives what do you think let nascar move back to saturday night then they do that whole thing at charlotte wrong anyway the all star race should be about wednesday night rather than the weekend before then run on into the other racing the best part of that weekend other than the is watching the outlaws on the dirt track leave me monday for getting home from either one i've been to each indy used to draw whatever day of the week it was held  Indianapolis 500 Tony Stewart May 2005 in sports Hendrick Motorsports Bristol Motor Speedway Lowe's Motor Speedway Monday Night Football September 2005 in sports NEXTEL Cup NASCAR Rookie of the Year Monday NASCAR Realignment The Double Penske Racing Jeff Gordon NASCAR Watkins Glen International Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Chip Ganassi Racing Indianapolis Motor Speedway October 2005 in sports NASCAR Thunder 2004 June 2004 in sports Robby Gordon Ernie Irvan 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Roush Racing Carnival Dale Earnhardt Auto racing Jimmie Johnson Operation Market Garden Saturday Craftsman Truck Series Saturday Night Live Dale Earnhardt, Inc.

who do you think will end up winning the points championship tk dario dixon wheldon hornish i'm going to have to lean toward dario on this one despite the fact that i'd rather see dixon win it dixon's come on very strong lately and i think he's in the position to pull it off but dario's been so consistent this season that it's his championship to lose of course after the mis incident we'll have to see if dario's lost any of his edge hornish is too far out and he's been mid pack most of the year so he's not a factor tk is simply not consistent enough to close such a large gap in a short amount of time all in all dario's shown he deserves to be where he's at especially the way he went from back of the pack to the front this last week at mis  Indy Racing League Scott Dixon American Championship Car Racing 2002 Tour de France Lee Dixon Bowl Championship Series New York Giants Indianapolis 500 Cleveland Browns 2005 English cricket season Fernando Alonso Newcastle United F.C.
