how can i study good for exams i am in high school now study in chunks minute time periods followed by a brief break minutes is the most effective way to study use daylight hours an hour of studying during the day is worth two at night do the work that requires the most concentration typically reading earliest in the day rank your three classes and be sure to spend time on your most challenging class everyday and early in the day study actively ask yourself questions review your notes regularly discuss key concepts with freinds and teacher flashcards make a timetable for exam days by marking the dates on a calendar so you can be prepared by the time the test comes around have your freinds go over your house and styudy with u or they can test you don't panic on test day the night before the exam and the morning of the exam read through your notes a few times then put them away exams are simply a quick and lazy way to assess people don't panic just study remember to get good sleep hope this helps  SAT Test (student assessment) Daylight saving time Education in Romania GED Education in Germany Graduate school Grade (education) Harrow School College admissions Advanced Placement Program Time Victorian Certificate of Education Hogwarts Education in Hong Kong Prostate cancer Law School Admissions Test Education in the United States A-level Second language acquisition Standardized testing Junior Certificate Higher School Certificate International Mathematical Olympiad Lynbrook High School Secondary education in France Education in France Franklin W.

yo i wanna behave this year in skool how do u think thatta happen i get the feeling that you normally have not behaved in school the way your parents or teachers wanted you to your goal is admirable these are some hints you are breaking a bad habit which means you might have days that you fail a bit and go back to your old behaviors if that happens start again one failure one day to meet your goal is not constant failure its only one day take it one day at a time do not look at is as all year first day of school you tell yourself i am going to behave today get through one day then another etc keep a log so you can tell what days were good and what days you messed up you will find you were good more often than you thought if you do mess up write down what caused it this is the tough one if your friends are the cause of you misbehaving stay away from them in school but hang with them after school if a best friend is causing the problem go to your guidance counselor and ask to be put in a different class until you clean up your act if its possible they will do that because they dont want you to misbehave you never have to tell your friend you asked to be moved reward yourself for reaching small goals too often we wait until we are done that is too long tell yourself at the end of each day you have behaved you will do a little something for yourself that you like at the end of each five days you behave make the treat a bit bigger and at the end of a month make it even better your parents might actually help you with this good luck  Social rule Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pitaten The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Nicomachean Ethics Debugging The Ashlee Simpson Show The Adventures of Pete & Pete Dog training Friends The Catcher in the Rye Shaggy dog story Springfield Elementary School Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Piccolo Junior Saga Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) W.I.T.C.H.

how to study and get a good result there are rmany different ways of studying you can choose the usual method of rote learning memorizing your facts and figures or you can learn from working through topical questions and from there find out what are the answers but these two methods will not help you in questions that require application i e questions that require you to use the skills you were taught and apply to another context how do you handle application questions then one way is to be familiar with the skills and concepts taught before trying out some application questions to gain familiarity with the concept skills when it comes to essays thesis writing you will need to polish up on your argument skills as well as demonstrating your clarity in thinking and writing  Graduate school Master's degree College admissions Higher education Student loan Academic degree Education in Hong Kong Technical analysis College and university rankings Ragnarok Online NHH Education in Australia Chinese University of Hong Kong Juris Doctor College Kingston University William Herschel Telescope Education in the United States Lawyer Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Albania Tianjin University High school Nanjing University Far Eastern University Torah study University of Cape Town University of Santo Tomas Law school Education in Portugal Seneca College Saint Joseph's University Columbia University Education in Sweden Higher Education Bill Education Education in Belgium Education in Taiwan ITESM Brown University Academia University of Connecticut Seton Hall University Education in Austria Education in Japan Divorce Macquarie University Business Kyoto University Grandes __coles Pennsylvania State University Master of Laws Education in the Republic of Ireland Israeli Arab Students' union Degrees of Oxford University Doctorate Gymnasium (Denmark) University of Virginia Corporate governance The College of New Jersey Ryerson University Saeima Grade (education) Homeschooling Top-up fees Secondary education in Japan University of Szeged UCAS Productive and unproductive labour Harvard Division of Continuing Education Bond Liberal arts Bumiputra Distance education York University Affirmative action Ben Cardin American University Education in Germany University of Coimbra Korea University WUVP-TV Associate's degree University of Maryland Baltimore County Sarbanes-Oxley Act University at Albany Institutional fund management Efficient market hypothesis University of Indonesia Universiti Putra Malaysia Doctor of Philosophy Seoul National University Computer science Florida State University Stevens Institute of Technology Marist College Johns Hopkins University University of San Diego Economy of Finland

what exactly are the benefits to studying abroad i am a high school student i have traveled studied abroad to china in the summer before it was great truly i learned a lot about the language about the culture and a lot of life lessons that can't be taught in school but academically speaking what are the benefits to studying abroad for an actual semester does it only help people who want to become more familiar with a specific language and gpa will credits carry over please and thanks in advance the benefits are immense but subtle you may not even be aware of how you've changed until years later in high school i traveled to germany for weeks and in college i studied abroad in japan for a year even going abroad for a few weeks really has a lot of benefits as you've seen experiencing the language culture and people first hand are the big ones however you were still mostly a tourist you would be going home in just a matter of weeks i wasn't in germany long enough to really get culture shock by being abroad for a longer period of time you'll get a much deeper understanding of the language and the culture the longer you're abroad and fully immersed in the culture and language you'll learn a lot more one semester abroad will teach you than what you'd cover in a classroom in or maybe semesters the benefits are much greater than just learning the language however since my time in japan i feel i've better able to communicate with people from all different backgrounds simply because i've had that experience of being the foreigner and struggling to learn the language at many of the companies i've worked at i've been able to use my japanese skills as part of my job or even to greet vips from japan i'm by no means fluent but just being able to properly greet someone in their native language goes a long ways towards making a positive impression it also helps convince the visitors that the company is serious about doing business as for gpa and credits that will depend on the particular program you will study through the japanese program i attended was actually run as an extension of my university so i got full grades and credits for the classes i attended some of my classmates were from different universities and had to use their local policies about transferring credits check with your school to see what programs they offer or what their policies on study abroad programs are even if you don't get credit i would strongly encourage you to go abroad for a semester i cannot tell you how much it has changed my life or how many opportunities it opened down the road it was well worth the effort and money  GED Logic Mathematics Classical education Economics Franz Boas Philosophy of science Scientific method Test (student assessment) Psychology Critical thinking Object-oriented programming Scientology beliefs and practices Education Philosophy Alexander Technique Western philosophy Martial art Second language acquisition Parapsychology Ontological argument Jacques Derrida Art Law school Socratic method Physics Software testing Neuro-linguistic programming Developmental psychology Graduate school Aikido George Lakoff Software engineering Catechism John Wycliffe Socrates Deconstruction Epistemology Philosophy of mathematics Research Asperger syndrome Richard Feynman Leo Strauss Martin Heidegger Guide for the Perplexed A New Kind of Science Arabic alphabet Consensus decision-making Ludwig Wittgenstein Montessori method Jacob Neusner Ethics Lisp programming language Presuppositional apologetics Category theory G__del's incompleteness theorem Willard Van Orman Quine Science Education in the United States Cryptanalysis Tai Chi Chuan Bayesian inference Culture A Course In Miracles Expert system Strategic management Religion Philosophy of history Education reform Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China History of science Probability Qualitative psychological research Philosophy of language Sexual orientation Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Juris Doctor Japanese tea ceremony Extreme Programming Speed reading Geometry Biblical inerrancy Philosophy of education Database Donald Davidson (philosopher) Cultural relativism Plato Max Weber Existentialism Victor Cousin Meaning of life Originalism Patent Turing machine Autism Literacy Labor theory of value Photography

what's your advice to a us student studying abroad in ireland i will be studying at the university of limmerick this coming spring i was wondering what type of advice anyone had about study abroad or ireland in general good advice would be apreciated good for you for studying abroad it's been ten years now since i spent my junior year in england and it's still among the most amazing experiences of my life some things i wish i'd known before i went find out as much as you can about the u of limerick before you go the english uni system is quite different from american colleges don't know if irish unis are comparable my entire grade for the year was based on one final exam all papers homework etc was entirely optional lots of rote learning and memorization as opposed to my home school's emphasis on deep thinking and creativity took a lot of self discipline and if you happen to be someone who stinks at tests well tough noogies to you just a totally different idea over there of what learning and teaching are all about i'm not saying these things will be true at limerick but i think i had no idea that a learning institution could be so fundamentally different make travel and learning new things your top priorities while there i'm all for studying hard but you can also do that here at home study abroad is a once in a lifetime chance be willing to forgo some of the school stuff for opportunities to grow culturally before i left someone gave me this great advice try not to let money stop you from doing things while over there do however let it stop you from buying things while there navigating limited funds while overseas can be tricky but this advice really helped me keep my priorities straight did i really want to spend my cash on eating out or did i want to save it for some opportunity that i would never have at home and when the occasional chance to splurge came along say those front row seats to the royal shakespeare theatre i gave myself rare permission to use my credit card knowing i would rather work a bit harder later to pay it off than to have missed out on something that special live like a native as much as possible some study abroad programs allow you to cushion yourself in pretty amazing ways from the culture you're actually there to experience special american classes host families guided tours these can keep you away from the very things to came to see hang out with irish people as much as you can refuse to eat at mcdonald's and pizza hut strike out on your own for travel and be willing to get lost a little embrace the chance to be as irish as you can for a short time invest in a quality guidebook or two for every country you plan to visit i am a huge fan of rick steves who teaches smart travel skills as opposed to simply telling you which sites to visit his website www ricksteves com is a wealth of useful information he also teaches you how to be a smart open minded traveller as opposed to an ugly american tourist check him out lonely planet is good too know that culture shock is normal expect that it will happen do some web searches for culture shock symptoms and be prepared for it to manifest itself in ways you may not anticipate it gets easier come back to the u s as a wiser person i think that one of the neatest parts of studying abroad is returning home america will seem both very familiar and totally strange after you've been away relish the chance to re examine that which you've always considered the norm your own personal status quo have a great time bon voyage  GED Literature Graduate school Education in Romania Japanese literature C.

can anyone tell me about the best engineering colleges around the globe with affordable fee structure you probably know this but where you study will limit you to where you work maybe the principles or measurements or something are different enough to make engineering not so global i do know that ireland uk and the usa do not allow qualifications from the other countries a good friend with engineering degrees in ireland and uk and years experience was not allowed to work as an engineer in the usa my brother in law has completed some program in saudi arabia in conjunction with his irish electrical engineering and can work in many countries seems a bit complicated good luck  Credit card Identity theft Slot machine Zambia Bank Grade (education) Yu-Gi-Oh!

i really want to study abroad whereas some cities correlate with certain careers ie chicago graphic design l a film and digital media are there any cities overseas that are worth traveling to for a student interested in journalism my school send pre med students to maastrict and english majors to europe what about us journalists is there anywhere for us to study the thing about journalism is that you need to know a little about a lot of subjects the actual craft of writing news reporting isn't that tough as long as you have a broad view of the world i'd suggest studying in a city you've always wanted to go to with a culture that interests you if you want to travel and you should as a journalist go to europe and buy a train pass and explore as much of the eu as you can or go somewhere completely unfamiliar like china what you do while living there is more important than the classes you take when you're doing study abroad the most important thing is to take in the culture and talk to as many people who live there as you can don't spend all your time hanging out with the other us students and don't go to london that place is a hole  Graduate school Biodiversity Antarctic Treaty System Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape Professor Ragnarok Online Education in Australia Doctor of Philosophy Antiviral drug Australian National University Futures Studies Johns Hopkins University Terran (StarCraft) Electrical engineering Alabama (band) National Science Foundation Jane Goodall The Isley Brothers Genetically modified food University of California, Santa Barbara Aquaculture Middle East Technical University Seattle Mariners Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research University of Cape Town Tina Turner Juris Doctor Asia University of Maryland Baltimore County Master's degree Species Genetic engineering Nurse National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Peer review HIV UIUC College of Engineering Singles Collection: The London Years United States Merchant Marine Academy University of Connecticut Linus Pauling Animal testing Z__oty Open access Cornell University AIDS in Africa Athabasca University Organ transplant Mars Domestication of the horse The Citadel (Military College) Doctorate Education in Germany University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Biology Chimpanzee Johns Hopkins Hospital Schutzhund Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Rice AIDS reappraisal Doom (film) University of Ottawa Fermi paradox The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Charles Fort Malaria Stanford University Political science Korea University Duke University Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong The Wild Wild West Mae Jemison Cetacean intelligence Amateur radio Statistical survey Who Shot Mr. Burns?

to indians transition to college abroad how to prepare i'm going to australia for my bachelors the education system in india is very very different i have no idea how to take good notes no idea how to research for papers let alone write them tell me how do u prepare for this and how hard is it to get used to this new system of learning g'day nikki i used to be an international student in australia from south east asia studied for bachelor course as well b'cos my country's high school qualification is not deemed equivalent to austrlaian's high school i had to do a foundation studies year sort of a 'pre uni' course to prepare you to study in uni level however even after done a year foundation studies in australia which is like australian high school system all of us me and my fellow foundation studies graduates still got the shock when we get to our first week of the first year at uni before uni start the international students will need to attend an orientation and enrolment week this event is specially designed for newly arrived international students to make them feel welcome the students is then enrolled to the classes of their course then assisted to make the timetable once that done students will then be taken for campus tours to give them info abt how to access services and assistance available to international students this will include the tour to the library where the librarian will inform you how to research information from books or online database info also there are some helps either in library or some other student services section to help for writing papers assignments in some unis these activities are conducted by the senior international students so all the information are relevant to the newbies as well since they also experienced the same thing when they came to the uni for the first time therefore it is very crucial to come for the orientation week in most cases university staffs informed me that international students who miss the orientation enrolment week usually struggle to cope the first week of study usually called an orientation week there are no formal teaching just lecturers and tutors introduce themselves and giving out handouts with lecture topics to cover every week what homework to do before the tutorial and what book to read and to buy this is when some int students struggle like me english wasn't even a nd language in my home country so to hear the lecturers lecturing on and we have to simultaneously hear him read what he wrote and write down is extremely challenging i'm sure you will have very little problem with this if you do think that you will have problem with this then i suggest you to buy a voice recorder of some sort it used to be a walkman in my days to record the lecture and re hear them again later to add things to your initial note the lecturers will never mind that you are recording them the system also encourage you to study find out and try things yourself if after doing things yourself you stuck then you can come to the tutors and lecturers and ask them directly in most cases they will put a note on when to come to see them for a consultation at no extra charge lol yes there will be some time needed for adjustment and there's no way you can prepare until you come for the first week in uni in my first month in uni i used to complained that i need hrs a day not however after awhile you will adjust to the new system with your fellow first year students including the aussies my advise are these please come early if possible nothing worse than starting the classes in uni and you are still struggling finding accommodations learning where to shop for your daily groceries buying furnitures etc when you had a bad late start it usually carried on seek advise further help from the teaching staff asap if you think that you are struggling with a topic or will be late to submit an assignment quite alot of students leave it until it was too late you'll get no sympathy from the lecturers if your reason is because i don't know the topic very well hope this helps i know i'm not indian but hope i can share my experience to you e mail me at mikegun at studentfirst com au if you have more questions abt study in australia good luck and welcome to australia  Education in the United States Doctorate Medical school Medicine Juris Doctor Master's degree

what about the students who leave there family and go abroad to study homesick and new language you dont know it we have had of those lol and it happened to me to when i joined the military and served in germany at least the homesick part to a point the best advice on the language is to use it stay away from english as much as possible which means staying away from the computer esp chatting and skype and staying off the phone besides you'll make more friends out doing things than back in your room on the computer which brings me to the homesickness thing you will get homesick no way around it but the key is to tell someone you're homesick just don't suffer in silence then get out and get busy go to a new museum go walk around a new part of town go to a different restaurant take a train ride but busy is the only cure do not succumb to the temptation to call home because you're homesick that will make things worse  Square Enix Enix Nintendo Fan translation Tokyo Computer role-playing game Square Co., Ltd.

how do you study i really want to study but im never able to study because of of my lazyness i need help majorly lol i want to go to uni no the reason is not just because your lazy there is a reason behind it and i had this challenge to in the past what changed for me to read many books and even write my own and have my own businesses can i be honest with you mate you see we all do things or don't do things because of a reason many don't understand the first which i will come upto is when i was having a challenge i began to sit down and think and realised i didn't know my real reason why i didn't know what i wanted out of life and couldn't see the future really of what i wanted imagine mate if you don't have a target then you might as well keep firing to find you've hit everything else but not what you wanted or nothing at all so the first thing i did is i took a step back and not to criticise myself but to reflect and write down exactly why i am studying where do i want to be in a couple of years and broke these down to how i am going to do it now i just didn't do that straight away i wanted too but something was holding me back and everytime i didn't do what i should be doing i kept getting into a mess work piles up and i am panicking and i knew deep inside the result would be crap so i wanted to find out why am i like this until you know about you how you tick you won't move on so i did just that and man i found out why i didn't do what i did and why everyone else was doing the same you see when you and i do something or not then this becomes a habit everytime you don't do what you do it becomes a stronger habit until it becomes part of you when that happens you are in trouble if that habit doesn't do anything positive imagine a glass of milk now imagine each time you don't study that habit is a like a drop of blue ink dropped into the milk each time you don't study another drop of blue ink hits that milk until so many actions make that glass of milk go dark blue now you got a major problem and if it isn't sorted out this habit of not studying not reading or not doing the other things too that will help you in life will because part of you the only way is to dilute it so imagine you start sitting down and before tomorrow comes you get a piece of paper and write down what you need to do for example maths assignment four pages to do english essay pages science pages and so forth and at the end of each task you put a box now you know what to do tomorrow you have to make a decision that no tv no music no mates nothing should get in the away you don't move also from task two if task one is not done your task one must be the most important if there are three most important task then break them down to a a etc look i have learnt the hard way and i know now why people mess up because i have been there and i meet so many people who mess their life up or they are so busy but i find they have not achieved jack nothing just looked very busy when you do what you need to do and plan a day or even like me a week ahead then you're going to be ahead of everyone of the population don't plan they don't also dilute all that black ink the negative habits by positive thoughts and saying to themselves i am in control i am not anything else and nor my whims i can do this you know when i planned my business turnover trippled in four months and its growing even more and faster all because i am doing what others don't do you can do it mate i know it be a little struggle because you will need to pushing against habits you have had for sometime and also your thoughts but your future is important your success may inspire someone your finances will help your family or neighbourhood oneday you can go on holiday and see the world oneday you can make a difference to your life and others too but most of all you do it for you so ask yourself what am i doing it for whenever you do anything ask yourself will this get me to where i really want to go and make me what i want to be always ask this question and deep inside you will know the answer the thing is i haven't really shared anything that you don't know you know all i have said and know it well there is a saying you cannot teach a person something he does not already know you can only bring what he does know to his awareness the best book for you and if you read this and apply then you won't have any problems or challenges you have now is a book by brain tracy called eat the frog i'll leave you a link read more books to develop yourself and leadership it will make you stand out of the crowd study and also maybe you can help others too who having same challenges but what you are facing has a name it is called procrastination good luck apply what i mentioned and see what happens and read that book you'd be amazed what happens next you can do it  Georgetown University Johns Hopkins University Tuition Washington, D.C.

would you plz tell me what kind of difficulties a student inevitably faces living n studying in a different culture loneliness is a big factor especially if there's no one around who speaks your language or knows your country stomach problems sometimes since the food will be new and you won't have much money other than that it really depends on where you're from how well you know the language and what you are studying i would suggest that you try to study in a specific place that interests you try to experience the culture but also be sure to be in an environment you'll enjoy think about climate city versus countryside hobbies such as outdoor adventure or night life language etc that should help you choose both a country and a specific place in that country also remember to study somewhere that has educational programs that will help you in the future basically it depends there is no inevitable difficulty apart from the usual hassles of travel pack light do your research and be open to the experience most people are very welcoming to foreigners have a great time  Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 W.

college question help okay well i am thinking about college i am not going this year but soon i really like notre dame and i know tha t it is a good university yet i have to think about going to franciscan university of steubenville my dad works there so i would get free tuition and alll of my older brothers and sisters ahve gone there i know that notre dame will be expensive but i think that i will be able to get a scholarship i am think of going into pre law please tell me which school is better i like notre dame much better than franscican i have lived near francoscan for all my life and sick of it does anyone know the college that i am talking about i really want to know the education basis of this and not the money i know it will cost more money but i thik that notre dame is better than fransican university of stuebenville franciscan is a good school to be sure and the quality of education is very comparable but let's talk post grad and name recognition how many people outside of ohio outside of the midwest have heard of steubenville how many of them would be more likely to hire a fus grad over an nd grad with the same qualifications the free tuition is certainly very tempting but as impractical as it sounds money should not be a consideration for college yes i said it and i'm certainly not rich if you can't afford it you'll get financial aid and even if you're like me and have to take out some student loans it's the most important investment you can make all in all i say forget the money part examine both schools for what they are the pros and cons of both and follow your heart apply to both and see what happens from there  Sri Lanka Football World Cup 2006 (qualification AFC) HyperText Transfer Protocol 1999 Cricket World Cup One-day International Music of Sri Lanka Education in Germany Indian Oil Cup 2005 Social work City and Guilds of London Institute International cricket in 2005 Education in Portugal Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka 1996 Cricket World Cup Asian Cup 2007 International cricket in 2005-06 2003 Cricket World Cup Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Maldives Doctorate Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Supreme court Asia Cup British degree abbreviations Chinese University of Hong Kong Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Paralegal Partition of India Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Medical school Common Unix Printing System Lawyer Australian cricket team Roy Dias Rama's Bridge Governor Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Sri Lanka Economy of Sri Lanka Duleep Mendis Kandy Military history of India Sinhala History of Sri Lanka Master's degree New Zealand cricket team Nurse Uttarapatha Cholas Ravana Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project Indian Peace Keeping Force Australian Qualifications Framework P__li Teacher 1979 ICC Trophy Tamil people Lakshman Kadirgamar Arjuna Ranatunga Master of Business Administration Academia South-East Asian Theatre of World War II Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Blogger Elephant Pandyan kingdom Lanka Sama Samaja Party Academic degree 2007 Cricket World Cup Outsourcing Caste Librarian Bologna process Tamil language Education in Australia Asian Highway Network Timeline of Buddhism Degrees of Oxford University Cricket World Cup Singapore International Film Festival Physician Types of bowlers in cricket South Asia West Indian cricket team Elaeocarpus The Times Group Church of South India Graduate school USS America (CV-66) Web service Rajiv Gandhi Rahul Dravid Hinayana Colombo Indian Ocean West Indies A cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005 Athabasca University Education in the Republic of Ireland 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake

i want to go abroad for higher education how to apply to any foreign university hello friends i want to go abroad for higher education i want to get admission to a university of any english speaking country such as canada australia uk and us i want to pursue master degree from any recognized university what are the exams i have to face to get an admission to university and what are the procedure to apply to any foreign university when to apply to those universities i don't know much about these things so tell me clearly so that i can understand i have another question my stream is electronics i am a graduate student can i study any other subjects in master degree g'day from the countries you mentioned australia is most likely have the lowest cost of living and probably the lowest tuition fee as well due to currency exchange for australia on top of tuition fees you will need to pay for campus fee vary from each uni and overseas student health cover abt aud yr and text books abt aud these are the rough estimate of the fees for your study before coming to australia you will need to pay the fee for student visa processing and health check up depending on your country of origin you may also be required to take an ielts test for proof of your english proficiency for application to uni and for visa www ielts org you can apply for different masters course so it doesn't have to follow your previous bachelor degree course to be eligible for a masters course in australia you will need to have the degree that deemed as equivalent to australian bachelor degree you will need to fill in the application form and send them together with the certified copy of all of your academic transcripts if they cannot accept you for the masters course they may offer you a place in their bachelor degree course with credit transfer so you do not have to study from year again there are only soon to be universities in australia all of them are fully accredited and they are tightly controlled therefore the quality and recognition of their graduates are equal from wherever university you are studying from the most important thing is you have to read the course information carefully since some courses may have the same name but different content to find out the latest info abt course that you are interested in taking and where it is offered i suggest you to go to the dept of education science and training website http cricos dest gov au or idp education australia www idp edu au it will give the list of institutions that are able to offer courses to international students who wants to continue their study in australia the info abt fees and requirements are available from the universities' websites please make sure that the information you are accessing are the one for international students it will also tell you when can you start your course feb or july intakes you can apply as early as you can since the admissions process can take abt weeks depending on the day of the year hope this helps good luck for your study  Master's degree Physician Graduate school Doctor of Philosophy Education in the United States University of Notre Dame Education in

study abroad for free i heard about a program in italy that if you or your parents or grandparents are italian you can go study for the summer in italy in abruzzo for free all you would have to pay for is the ticket to go to italy and the rest is paid for you has anyone heard of it if you did could give me more information please thanks i very much doubt that it is free or everybody who as italian parents grandparents would be doing it rather than paying to study in their own country most likely will be a scam if anything but eh the worst that could happen is you get to spend two weeks in italy  Plame affair Sabbath E-mail John F.
