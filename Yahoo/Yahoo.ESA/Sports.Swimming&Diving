will wearing ankle wrist weights help me become a faster swimmer i am years old and want to become a faster and stronger swimmer will using them be harmful to my body what size weights should i use tomas it's great to hear from a young swimmer who wants to improve his times make sure when you receive advice on this forum that you get some assurances from the people who advise you that they know what they are talking about i am not a swim coach or trainer but i have been a competitive amateur athlete since boyhood and i still am i have done lots of research into training techniques for my sports running skiing and tennis i have also helped my son with his sport which happens to be swimming he is now a college swimmer in a championship program i asked him your question too we both agreed that ankle and wrist weights are probably not appropriate training techniques for swimmers many basketball players like them but the strain on your joints elbows and knees offset the benefits of the increased resistance from the weights swimmers who want to train with increased resistance usually use hand paddles for their hands and swim fins for their feet the paddles and fins increase the surface area of your hands and feet and so doing allow you to move more water with each stroke or kick moving more water requires more effort and basically increases the resistance it s very important to concentrate on your form and technique when doing this type of training in the water if you let your form break down you will negate the benefit from the extra workload and just teach your body bad swimming habit if you concentrate on proper form in a relaxed but efficient stroke you will go a long way towards making yourself better at your sport many great swimmers train exclusively in the pool logging over a hundred hours in the pool a month others like my son like to break up the swim training with other forms of exercise so that their bodies and minds stay fresh running and weight training in the off season with just one or two light workouts in the pool can keep you interested and break up the tedium of the swim athletes training regimen if you would like to experiment with resistance training my son recommends using the weight training program described by olympic swimmer jason lezak here http www bodybuilding com fun jasonlezak htm my son was very pleased with the results he got using weight training and good technique it might work for you too whatever you do decide on make sure you talk to someone who can help you do things the right way good luck mike  Breaststroke Diving Butterfly stroke Swimming pool Triathlon History of swimming Tai Chi Chuan Basketball Medley swimming Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Table tennis Volleyball Sport Marathon (sport) Muay Thai Canoe Professional wrestling holds Cross-country skiing Badminton Judo Running Fencing Boxing Exercise Breastfeeding Martial art Kayak Frogman Alexander Technique Georgia Institute of Technology Fanny Blankers-Koen Water polo Michael Phelps Tennis Urinary incontinence Taekwondo Punt (boat) Lifeguard Swimsuit Sumo Archery 1896 Summer Olympics Sport rowing Dog agility Olympic Games Spanking Sailing Andre Agassi Social rule Osteoarthritis Welding Baseball Scientology beliefs and practices Golf Milton H.

high school swim team question i swim in the summer and i really want to make the swim team this year at my high school i can swim about a free without stopping and i am pretty good with the others as well my best stroke is breast i am working out now and i really hope that its paying off any advice about what a high school practice consists of how long meets are etc ok so the odds are that unless your school has a really tough team to get on you will be able to be on the team and they will put you with the beginners for now swimming is a cool sport because usually in the first year people improve a ton so if you keep with it and swim every weekday for like hours this is how long my practices were you should be way past the beginner level by the time next year's season starts here is the way my practices went there were easy practices and there were hard practices when you don't have any meets coming up you do hard practices that go something like this nice long warm up speed training do s and exert yourself more each time repeat or times as desired arms and legs training use paddles on your hands and don't kick to strengthen your arms use a kickboard to strengthen your legs special work on your strokes of course the actual practice can and does vary so you don't get too bored don't be scared off by the idea of a hard practice they start to get easier after a week or two easy practices have similar things in them but they don't encourage you to work quite as hard or swim quite as far a lot of times you will do these before meets so you save up your strength for competition sometimes you get to play fun games in them like sharks minnows also depending on your team you may do some exercises like lunges and sit ups weight training and running before your swims in my experience these things help you build strength that you can then translate in the pool to domination also meets vary but most high school meets are just against one team and they take hours most people only swim or events in them they usually have a limit to how many you can swim teams go to big meets sometimes on the weekends which are against tons of schools like regional state meets and can last anywhere from days again most people won't swim more than events so when not swimming you end up hanging out with the team playing cards going out to eat and fun stuff like that i encourage you to definitely go check out practice and enjoy swimming is a wonderful sport and it's great for making friends i swam for all years of high school starting as a beginner and finishing as a starter  Breaststroke Butterfly stroke Tag Diving Triathlon Norway national football team Medley swimming Backstroke Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Swimming pool Weight training Volleyball Star Trek Customizable Card Game History of swimming Poker jargon Tennis Professional wrestling slang Badminton Paragliding Extreme Programming National Football League Front crawl Cross-country skiing Golf Sauna Craps The Amazing Race New York Giants Football (soccer) Sport rowing Table tennis Education in the United States Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Diving suit Ultimate (sport) Parachuting Mixed martial arts 2000 Australian Grand Prix Water polo Beatmania IIDX Little Britain Social rule Stuttering Dragon boat RuneScape Fanny Blankers-Koen Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 1896 Summer Olympics Chinese martial arts Scientology beliefs and practices Unreal Super Mario 64 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ocean's Twelve Fencing Team Fortress Classic Drowning Lance Armstrong Time Out of Mind Martial art Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Pittsburgh Steelers Cleveland Browns Georgia Institute of Technology American football Playoff Aikido Skateboarding trick Major League Baseball television contracts Dog Kitesurfing Singlish New York Jets Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Glossary of climbing terms Horizontal bar Indianapolis 500 Ceroc Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Batting (cricket) Marching band Piccolo Junior Saga Ice hockey Kodocha The Contender (television series) Theory of conduct Paintball Drifting (motorsport) Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Satchel Paige Frogman

does anyone know which swimming pool pump has the best value for the money for both pool and spa i had a pool built just years ago my spa is not generating any bubbles or jets as it was the first year it has a hayward pump to filter both pool and spa this was highly recommended by the builder but now my pool cleaner guy cleans the filter every week so the spa can get some pressure he says that he wouldn't have bought a hayward pump also said he would have another pump for the spa i don't know anything about pools and want to learn so i don't have to second guess everyone in the pool business i don't have money to burn like some friends of mine that just keeps paying a pool guy to fix everything for them i would like to do it myself and save my money any comments or suggestions are welcomed thank you in advance it sounds like your pool guy might be a dealer for sta rite and not hayward haywards are an ok make and i'm actually quite fond of them particularly the super pump series with the squarish wet end if you had no issues the first year the pump won't be at fault unless the impeller is bunged up with debris which can happen i'd be looking at a few other things first as the culprit it sounds as though your system is made up of two valves that you turn over to spa when you're planning on using it and you have just the one pump this isn't uncommon for a smaller pool spa combination that over flows into the pool it's a cheaper alternative than having a separate spa booster which can add over bucks to the price of a new pool spa usually this sort of set up is quite adequate for a smaller spa with or less jets if you're using a hp or hp motor which in all likelyhood you are has your filter pressure changed since the first year has it gone up more when in spa mode it may indicate a blockage in one or more of the spa jets or a dirty filter you mention that everything works just fine after a filter cleaning so your filter is getting debris in it that's going to have an impact on the strength of the water from the jets and the amount of bubbles you see for the bubbles to show up you need water rushing through the jet's venturi at a good rate to draw air into the mix from the air line if it's not going fast enough it won't draw that air in well or even at all for that matter the master air line valve may be shut check it it's located on the top of your spa usually round in shape it needs to be open for air to get in if the jets are as strong as they were initially and you're just looking at one or more of them not producing the same bubbles i'd be checking the air line that feeds them they can get blocked up rather easily also some types of jet actually have an adjustment on their face that allows more or less air to come out the jet your's may be turned down or off not to mention the air venturi in them might be blocked not uncommon at all if you winterize your pool as these are removed when winterizing and need adjustment when you re install them as the re installation process for some types of jet actually uses the air control on the jet itself as the thing you turn to thread them into the spa wall essentially shutting the air off as you tighten it in your pool guy's idea of installing another pump booster pump in the spa lines can be done how difficult it'll be will depend on how smart the original contractor was in plumbing everything up in the first place if he left a lot of room for the pump and it's associated plumbing then not a big issue installation wise as long as everything is in inch and not pipe it will cost you a chunk of change for the pump they're not cheap and if you have only jets a booster pump may actually be to much oomph for your spa you may not be able to sit down and stay put

attention swimmers how do you do this when you swimmers are swimming laps and you get to one end how do you manage to do that tumble thing and start swimming the other direction whats it called and how is it done i tried tumbling but i end up sideways facing the side pool walls hi it is called flipturn sommersault tumbleturn depends on which country i would break down this flip exercise into parts if you want to learn this complex flip you need to break it down to simpler parts and practise and once you familiar with all steps you can try the flip the approach to the wall i am a right hander so my last pull is my right arm once you make a full pull head bow down and ready for the turn after my full pull i would be around half a meter from the wall this stage just practise geting familiar with the distance from the wall the flip this is the most crucial if you are not familiar start practising a tumble turn sommersault stationary in the middle of the pool or something just look at one point reference could be a lane number roll yourself into a ball use your arms to flap forward and remember to breath out from your nose otherwise u will be f ed hopefully after a the turn you end up looking at the same reference point it is good if someone can assist you with the sommersault once you familiar with this stationary flip you can practise near the wall combining step and step remember do not puss off first just make sure your feet land on the wall and stop the pushing off once you get so familiar with step and step until you dont even need to think to flip try step the pushing off i push off sideways belly button face the side and while gliding then only i get back to the original position belly button face the pool bed this save times on your flipping step if you are in a competition try swimming harder nearing the wall to get a full momentum and transfer tbe momentum while doing the turn so that u can have a fast turn and a fast push off cheers  Breaststroke Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Front crawl Swimming Professional wrestling holds Swingout Suplex Professional wrestling throws History of swimming Medley swimming Drowning Glossary of partner dance terms Marching band Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Volleyball Fast bowling Glossary of American football Bubble Bobble Ko shogi Professional wrestling attacks Piledriver (professional wrestling) Circle (dance move) Rugby union positions Glossary of ballet terms Figure skating Equine conformation Water polo Side pass (dance move) Cheerleading Internal ballistics Powerbomb Rugby union Lindy Basic Drill bit Floppy disk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Swimming pool Mouse (computing) Dai dai shogi Drag racing Boxing Poker jargon Charleston (dance move) GunZ The Duel Coin flipping Table tennis Sailing Archery Tenjiku shogi Tai shogi Sport rowing Dai shogi Textile manufacturing Helicopter Frogman Wallpaper group M16 (rifle) Canoe Contredanse Softball DDT (professional wrestling) Indianapolis 500 Tag Taikyoku shogi Backgammon Shen Gong Wu Flip jump Kitesurfing Wa shogi Cross-country skiing DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Lifeguard Stairway Ecco the Dolphin Snooker Chu shogi Entropy Revolver Flight controls Baseball Sugar push Triathlon Skateboarding 2000 Australian Grand Prix Terminal ballistics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Spatial disorientation

i'm going on a swim team for my first year of high school i was wondering if any of you are have done that in the u s and i was wondering if everyone makes it also how is it hard or easy do they train you to swim better i've never been on a team before of any sort so i have no idea how this works haha i'm a fairly good swimmer but i still need some practice thanks all for the answers i was also wondering what exercises do they make you do like stretches etc because it says that we'll be doing exercises in and out of the pool i'm just really nervous that i won't ever get picked to swim at any of the meets thanks for the asnwers well my highschool just opened last year so no we've never gone state and we only practice from pm to and it doesn't say how many days or when we have to share a school with another high school that's been around much longer thank you again and thanks for the luck but everyone makes the team at my school thankfully i was just wondering if someone was so bad that they'd cut them is that done thanks so much in some cases it'll be a take all situation where everyone gets to be involved while in some other cases there will be tryouts for the team for the most part as far as i've seen personally it's a lot of take all reject none kind of thing honestly i can't even name a single school in our whole area league that has tryouts for their swim teams when you first get in the water you'll think to yourself wow this is so hard how can i ever swim like the guys in the faster lanes but once you get over the normal mental blocks and get a hang of how you swim you'll be in great shape from there and this is also what happened to me so when you look back at your freshman and sophomore years as a senior you'll think that they were actually easy but they absolutely train you to be a better swimmer that's the whole point of the team as for exercises that you'll do you'll always have a swimming workout to do these workouts include the distance you swim how many of them you're supposed to do and how much time you have until you're supposed to swim the next thing i typically get about rests of about minutes each you can get a drink or go to the bathroom during this time but we're in the pool about of the time but as for dryland that you do different teams have their different policies on this you might go running for a mile or or you might just to dockside exercises like push ups and sit ups jump rope some walking jogging exercises there's actually a lot you can do with these of course almost every team stretches before practices but as for meets it's a more relaxed policy with stretching all i can really say about the exercises you never know how hard or easy it'll be until you try it  Backstroke Social rule Swimming Swimming pool Triathlon Theory of conduct Breaststroke Diving Weight training Medley swimming Drowning History of swimming Water polo The Ashlee Simpson Show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Diving suit Butterfly stroke Quizbowl Pittsburgh Steelers Front crawl Equine conformation Lynbrook High School Education in the United States Volleyball Epistemology The nature of God in Western theology Extreme Programming Cranford, New Jersey Time Out of Mind Milton H.

how do people drowned in the ocean i have always swam in fresh water never salt but i when i went to hawii i went snorkling off a boat we were given oval floaties to hang onto in the water to float on when i finally got the courage to let go and try to swim i couldn't i couldnt go under the water i tried driving under but the water kept me afloat as if i had a life jacket on or something then i tried will all my strength to go as far under the water as i could but my ears hurt then the second i stopped tring to go under i floated back up with out doing anything i tried over over to swim down as far as i could but the same problem so how do people actually drowned in the ocean were you wearing anything that would keep you afloat people will usually drown if they've been drinking and decide to swim in the ocean or if they're in the ocean sober and there's a rough current causing the water to be very edgy and full of mini waves and when they get caught in the current and tired of keeping themself afloat their body's just get exhausted and sometimes all of your muscles can just lock up and you go under and once you're under most people tend to panic and they start losing control and start swallowing water and breathign in the water filling their lungs and so they drown usually it's when people panic and don't know what to do when they're pulled under the water because once you panic and start moving around in the water your intake of oxygen in your lungs releases a lot faster than if you were to calmly swim up and relax once your oxygen is running out you have less oxygen and time to actually get to the surface when you've been sinking that's why it's best to not panic and try to stay in contol to maintain those last bits of oxygen left in your lungs i'm not too sure why you couldn't swim under the water it's very easy to do and get pulled under the water unless you were holding onto something someone was holding onto you or you were wearing some sort of contraption that helps keep you afloat also if you had lots of air in your lungs that also helps you keep afloat divers usually intake breaths very deep before they dive and once they dive they slowly let it out so they can sink to the bottom even if you let all of your air out you'll still have air left in your lungs but you won't be able to be as afloat as when you had all of their air filling your lungs take care xx  Swimming Diving Scuba set Lung Snorkel Diver rescue Breathing gas Waterworld Carburetor Swimming pool Suicide methods Shaggy dog story Diving suit Backstroke Breaststroke Water (molecule) Submarine Bong Equine conformation Sailing Sea-Monkey Personal flotation device Seine (fishing) Underwater First Battle of the Atlantic Cetacea Hiccup Diving cylinder RMS Titanic Buoyancy compensator Fishing Water Scuba diving Front crawl Butterfly stroke Motorcycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carbon dioxide Diving regulator Siphon Cave diving Pneumonia Naval mine First aid Blood (computer game) Fire fighting Thermohaline circulation Asthma Sea ice Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) USS Thresher (SS-200) Lifeguard Tide Free-diving Coconut crab Sperm Whale Circulatory system Ocean thermal energy conversion Gas bladder Albatross Shock Sport rowing Jet engine Aerial (dance move) Barotrauma Tetrapod Moon USS Tunny (SS-282) Diver training Out-of-body experience Traumatic brain injury Canal lock USS Yorktown (CV-5) Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma USS Tang (SS-306) Water polo Apnea Breastfeeding Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Cruising (maritime) Aircraft carrier Energy development

how to swim i never got around to it oh and will your head easily float above the water then how do you start moving oh and after i learn do you think it would be embarrasing to have a floatie like the circle just so you can lie down when you're at the beach thx your chest is what keeps you afloat in the water because your lungs are filled with air you still have to keep at least a little lateral motion going when you're floating on your back or your legs will hang down and you do have to use a little neck muscle to keep your face above the water while floating on your back if you float on your stomach you have to use your neck muscles to lift your face out of the water every seconds to take a breath of air remember panic is what kills people when they drown if you body was thrown in the water while you're alive it will bob to the surface almost immediately the more salt in the water the better the bouyancy you just keep slowly using your closed finger hands rotating like a windmill to keep you aloft enough to keep your face above the surface and you can open your eyes safely under water fresh water is better for that though because salt water makes your eyes sting a little when you do it in the ocean i've been a strong swimmer my whole life and i highly recommend you learn not just for the life saving skill that enables but for the sheer fun of it swimming is fun as hell don't miss out on one of life's greatest pleasures  Drowning Diving Swimming Breaststroke Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Butterfly stroke Backstroke Front crawl Equine conformation Anatomical terms of location Suplex Professional wrestling attacks Lung First aid Sin City Swimming pool Ecco the Dolphin Personal flotation device Bong Tetrapod Naruto jutsu Blood (computer game) Swingout Diving suit Happy Tree Friends Shark Frogman Suicide methods History of swimming Kitesurfing Sailing Unreal Autopsy Aikido Doom enemies Mercury 4 Medley swimming Boxing Crocodilia Cat Diver rescue Eye Professional wrestling aerial techniques Fishing Volleyball Rebreather Conker's Bad Fur Day Lifeguard Scuba set Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Fugu Weight training Skateboarding trick 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Waterworld Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Piece minor characters Water Buoyancy compensator Snorkel Muscle The Legend of Zelda series enemies Humerus Paragliding Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Shaggy dog story Tenshinhan Triathlon Naval mine The Amber Spyglass Mattress Swimsuit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma GunZ The Duel Eye movements Table tennis Fast bowling Professional wrestling match types Eryops Orca Tag Lemmings 2: The Tribes Horse Sport rowing RMS Titanic Glossary of climbing terms Neckbreaker Panama Canal Uncanny Valley Wave power Combine (Half-Life 2) Water (molecule) Human anatomy

can you use bleach in a ' by pool instead of chlorine to kill algae hi kim not only can you use bleach but it's a great way to fight algae in your pool typically it's cheaper too first off bleach is chlorine there is no way around it the laundry bleach that you buy at the drug store is a concentration of sodium hypochlorite chlorine if you buy pool chlorine it is normally supplied in a concentration of either or solution of sodium hypochlorite chlorine yep bleach is the same exact thing as pool chlorine except bleach is quite a bit lower in concentration figuring out how much bleach or pool chlorine can be easy once you know the concentration look on the bottle for the there are a couple of pool chemical calculators out there that help you calculate how much of any chlorine solution is needed for your gallon pool but one thing you will want to do with any pool that uses chlorine is be sure that you have some stabilizer in the pool the cya stabilizer protects the chlorine from getting eatin' up by the sun's rays without it your chlorine would go to zero very quickly on a sunny day among the stabilizer cya level you can also benefit from having your water tested for all the usual chemicals as well fc tc ph ta cya etc after you get your water tested you can post the results at a forum like troublefreepools and post the results the members will be happy to help you do you have any type of water test kit to test for ph and chlorine if not go out and get yourself a test kit i am figuring your pool volume near gallons since it's not filled to the brim if you start with a chlorine level of zero then you would add enough chlorine to bring your chlorine up to shock levels get the cya reading and you'll better determine the exact level with a gallon pool cup of laundry bleach will bring your chlorine level up ppm if your chlorine level is at ppm and you want to bring it up to ppm just add cups of laundry bleach to bring it up ppm if you use a pool chlorine solution you will need to add barely over cup of pool chlorine to get each ppm increase in your chlorine level however if your fighting an algae bloom you should bring your chlorine levels up to shock levels elevated chlorine levels until the algae clears and the chlorine levels return to normal you should wait to swim in the pool no matter what type of chlorine you use dan  Chlorine Hydrochloric acid Ammonia Hydrogen peroxide Concentration Swimming pool Solar power Parts per notation Hard water Biodiesel Cyanide Menstrual cycle Sewage treatment Ozone Haloalkane Coral reef Neutrino Microeconomics Marine aquarium Hydrogen Ozone depletion Sodium percarbonate Sea-Monkey Sodium chloride Bromine Polychlorinated biphenyl Use of poison gas in World War I Lake Fire fighting Explosive material Chloroform Ozone hole Brewery Asthma Lac operon Gold Chlorite Diving Dioxin Hydrogen chloride Ethidium bromide Redundant array of independent disks Wood pulp Inflation Tetrachloroethylene E85 Sodium perborate Supply and demand Solar cell Alkane Jet engine Algae Soil pH Hydrogen economy Fluoride therapy Sterilization (microbiology) Poison Trisodium phosphate Algal bloom Acetic acid Fluoride Titanium Illegal drug trade Ozone layer Solvent Halogen Water (molecule) Siphon Dialysis Allergy Biological warfare Autonomous building Sodium hydroxide CPU cache Tide Water supply Snowball Earth Textile manufacturing Carbon tetrachloride Dishwashing RISC Sauna E number Drowning Swimming Chlorination Laundry detergent Sun

how do i get rid of them k i have a pool with these gross bugs in it called back swimmers i was wondering how do i kill them ive tried to take them out an stomp on them but there is way too many an some fly back in help me please im so grossed out by these bugs and i want my pool back by the way i have a pond and i live like on farm land fields ive heard this kinda stuff attracts them is this true first off keep your pool as clean as you can chlorinate as much as needed on a regular basis this will not get rid of them but it will dissuade them from sticking around too long they come to the pool because after a short while the chlorine that is generally in swimming pools starts to clear up and makes the water smell like a fresh spring which attracts the whirligig beetle their main purpose is to eat algae and other slower water insects that are smaller or in a sense dumber than they are the thrive on the temperature of the water too if you could either cool your pool down or heat it up enough it would get rid of these beetles but there is no true way to get rid of them with chemicals  Swimming pool Swimming Beetle Sewage treatment Water purification Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sea ice Butterfly stroke Lake Insect Disinfection Breaststroke Backstroke Water Mosquito Jet engine Diseases of the honeybee Diving Sodium hypochlorite Pikmin Water resources Medley swimming Biological pest control Ozone Spacecraft propulsion Fish farming Renewable energy Sento Haloalkane Dry cleaning Bong Hydrochloric acid Biodiesel Fire fighting Brewery Diving suit Environmental concerns with electricity generation Water (molecule) Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Power station Ammonia Drowning Textile manufacturing Otitis externa Alkane Mach kernel Platypus Biogeochemical cycle Coffee Water polo Nile crocodile Billiards Sense Ozone depletion Energy development Internal ballistics Frogman Codename: Kids Next Door Wood pulp World War Three (Doctor Who) Ecology Polychlorinated biphenyl Sea-Monkey Xenomorph Gas metal arc welding Tag Sterilization (microbiology) Insecticide Alternative biochemistry Hemiptera Smelt Ocean thermal energy conversion Linked list Triathlon Titanium Speedo (suit style) Kerikeri Warm-blooded Ozone hole Corrosion Carbon dioxide Frog Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Halogen Plastic Front crawl Neoptera Temperature Ladybird Welding Cat Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Wood Venus Flytrap Body piercing Marine aquarium

forced to swim hours a day is that reasonable i'm on a high school swim team so of course it's going to be intense seeing as i'm on varsity but really isn't it a bit ridiculous that we have to swim not just sitting around or running either like swimming very fast yards at a time for four hours in the morning and two plus one hour of dryland in the afternoon maybe it's just because i'm a bit out of shape and we're nearing the end of the first week but what do you think any swimmers' opinions or anyone else really is fine well im a competitive swimmer for a club team and of course its going to be intense yeah and i know what you mean about yards fast at a time it does get really hard at points but it will ease up my guess is that its the start of the season and your coach wants to get you in shape and ready for some big meets i dont think its too bad hours i mean it might be overwhelming at first but youll get used to it for my club team we had alot of big meets coming up and hard summer training so we practiced normall days a week but we practiced hours in the morning then in the afternoon including about an hour and half of dry lands mostly running and hard core stuff after a few weeks and some meets come closer than your coach will ease up a bit and then about weeks before a big meet he will probably taper you so dont stress out now i know what your going through and some practices will get to an extant of non stop pain where you just want to faint and i know how that feels when we did one of the hardest sets we have ever done and it was x s on on on and i broke down in the middle of the set i kept going but i was crying because the pain was at an extant to where i didnt think i could go any further but you just have to remember one thing during those hard practices dont ever give up and you will accomplish so much and achieve the best hope this helps good luck  Swimming Diving New York Giants Texas Longhorn Athletics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers Fanny Blankers-Koen Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Tai Chi Chuan Operation Market Garden Bryan Robson Babe Ruth Backstroke Volleyball Super Bowl XXV Social rule USS Alden (DD-211) Butterfly stroke Fast bowling Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City Chiefs Extreme Programming Dog agility Jon Secada Frogman Sydney Riot of 1879 FC Rostov USS Yorktown (CV-10) Cleveland Browns USS Waters (DD-115) The Ashlee Simpson Show Norway national football team Medley swimming History of swimming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American football San Francisco 49ers USS Tunny (SS-282) New England Patriots The Contender (television series) Super Bowl XXVII She Loves You St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXI Equine conformation Scientology beliefs and practices The Chemical Brothers Sport USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Breaststroke Good Morning, Vietnam Super Bowl XXVI Shaggy dog story Battle of Tarawa National Football League Sandy Koufax Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina USS Wasp (CV-18) West Bromwich Albion F.C.

ymca lifeguard heres the deal i turn in feb so i will not be elligable to take the lifeguard class until the summer after next because of where my bday falls i am going to email the instructor and see if he would let me take the class and hold my card till i turn in feb my question is if any of you are lifeguards at a ymca are you full time or do they only staff lifeguards in the summer for the outdoor pools the reason is because if they are full time then if i got the cert next summer then i could apply in feb as soon as i turn as opposed to waiting till the following summer and useing some of the time i could be working takeing the class thanks my suggestion would be to call your local ymca for example the y near my house has an indoor pool so lifeguards are hired all year round plus when i took the cert class they only let you enroll in it when you are you can always check with the swim guy at your local y  Swimming pool YMCA Boy Scouts of America Lifeguard Community emergency response team Volleyball Swimming Poker jargon Walt Disney World College Program Glens Falls, New York Franklin and Marshall College Cranford, New Jersey Draw poker Dartmouth College Betting (poker) Tag Junior Certificate Adult Swim E-mail Drowning Ben Johnson (athlete) Caulfield Grammar School Melbourne High School Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

should i stay on my college swim team next year i'm debating whether or not to swim on my college swim team again next year i swim for a small liberal arts women's college in california we're d i've swam the past years and loved it the first year but last year major drama went down and the only two friends i had on the team are gone leaving me with a bunch of frienemies new radicals song and two enemies i'm starting my junior year the year that matters a ton for law school so i really should focus on school but i love competing and i love the traveling trips i swim fly and there is just something about getting out there and pounding on that water that i love and i know that without the team i won't do that nearly so much hopefully you swimmers understand this anyways your advice all my friends who see the pain i endure are telling me to quit the team focus on school but i feel like my family etc want me to stay plus i never did sports in high school so this is my chance your opinion thanks as a former college swimmer who swam four years my thought is you would regret the time you missed when you are out of college and no longer in shape you will miss the shape you were in when you could swim hours a day work keeps you from ever reaching that level again even if you do masters you cannot get that time back and the opportunity will never present itself in the same form again from a team dynamic standpoint i would suspect that with a new year new people and your old friends being gone team dynamics will change and people who were your enemies may be friends and others might not bottom line you could always quit if it becomes unbearable and it is much more difficult to come back after deciding to quit from a fitness standpoint not to mention as a graduated law student the skills in balancing school and swimming will be critical in law school and life beyond when you will probably need to balance much more responsibilities and your remainder of your post collegiate life  Fanny Blankers-Koen Triathlon Swimming Quizbowl Diving American football Georgetown University Education in Japan The Amazing Race Medley swimming Blonde on Blonde The Catholic University of America One Tree Hill (TV series) Swimming pool Breaststroke University of California, San Diego University of San Diego Education in the United States University of Denver Saved by the Bell University of Houston College basketball Tai Chi Chuan Williams College Boston University Graduate school University of Michigan Caulfield Grammar School University of Alabama The Book of Five Rings University of California, Los Angeles Volleyball Debate Adventure racing Backstroke Cliff Richard 1896 Summer Olympics Marching band Butterfly stroke Surrender of Japan Sydney Riot of 1879 Juris Doctor Tufts University Ecco the Dolphin Scientology beliefs and practices The Four Tops High school Cranford, New Jersey National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) Education in the People's Republic of China College Grammatical aspect EastEnders University of Central Florida Avenue Q Drowning University of Washington Dartmouth College Sport rowing History of swimming Drew University Boston College Affirmative action W.I.T.C.H.
