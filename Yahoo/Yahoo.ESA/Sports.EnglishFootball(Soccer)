should leeds united be docked their points for league this season as a port vale fan i am glad to see a fellow team start with such a huge dis advantage however when we went into administration in we were docked no points because this rule did not exist i feel having such a rule in place damages the competitive nature of football and a salary cap or transfer embargo would be fair as they would have to prove that they can manage their finances with the squad they have if leeds have a team capable of going up after all the worries off the pitch then fair enough why should they suffer further it's a stupid rule which is just more likely to make clubs in trouble go to the wall altogether someone needs to sort it out it seems to be based on ideas of market forces rather than any aim to protect the interests of the game starting a side points down unless under really serious circumstances is just stupid going into administration is not cheating at the game is it if there's any club that should be docked points at the moment it is west ham because they actually did cheat last season  West Ham United F.C.

why do footballers moan about being tired when i play sat and sun work all week doing hour shifts and train twice for just k a year not a week i am a glasgow boy living in brazil said to be the land of football well did you see the reports that the ex number one ronaldo was weighing kilos and not as declared also that several st team players arrived back at the hotel at a m drunk anyway this was a declaration made by mr ricardo teixeira last week and he is the president of brazil s football association this may answer your question at least for many players they are not rich until they are discovered into fame and fortune then they need to be disciplined into this elite many are and some only seem to run after models and overeat and drink at this stage these guys are overtaken by their new found glory and this becomes a priority well it only takes one to ruin a team since the others must cover up for a guy who is never on the spot team events means that all must carry the burden it is simply a lack of discipline  American football Football (soccer) Ronaldo National Football League Football (soccer) positions Portugal national football team Baseball Rugby football Wheel of Fortune Norway national football team Bobby Charlton Steve McManaman International League Brazil national football team Football World Cup FIFA World Player of the Year Avenue Q STS-59 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Volleyball Newcastle United F.C.

do we expect too much from our football team are they really that good or is having all the foreign players in the premiership having an impact on how the england football team perform i think our press and media hype our players and national team up too much we've got a very good squad but we have yet to have a manager to have the guts to develop them into the team any numbnut could pick top players in england but that doesnt mean you can get them to play together with a great team spirit its like our central defence sol and rio had a great partnership but that had to stop because terry became top dog and was put straight into first team but he makes a lot of mistakes for england believe me i like terry he puts his heart and soul into the game but how many times when we have a last minute corner does he jump all over the oppositions defence and ends up giving away a free kick he gets away with it in the prem but at international level the refs dont give a stuff who terry or anyone else of these overhyped players are it's like gerrard and lampard we cannot afford to have two attacking midfielders we need one to be free to attack and the other to cover him and be a playmaker in my opinion the best attacking midfielder is gerrard so either lampard stays back more or he makes way for a scholes hargreaves carrick for the sake of the team i really hope mcclaren persuades scholes to play in next years euros cause i really think he could make a difference i do think we expect a lot from the team but thats what happens when they allow themselves to be so overhyped i bet half of our great first team players wouldn't cope in another league as real great players can the only member of our squad that doesnt play in england is beckham so our players are in this little media bubble constantly saying how great they are and sadly believe it  England national football team Frank Lampard David Beckham Norway national football team Alex Ferguson Football (soccer) positions Bryan Robson Steve McManaman Rugby union Alan Shearer American football Sol Campbell West Ham United F.C.

what do you think of sunderland's chances this season i think they'll escape relegation this season they have got a good manager good and supportive chairman and have made a top signing by getting a top quality keeper like gordon which i think will be more important to them than buying any striker as they'll need to avoid letting goals in by the looks of it their game today with spurs will end in a draw with sunderland looking most likely to score which is a great result for them ive got my fingers crossed for them  West Bromwich Albion F.C.

do you think indain football players play just for a job the football condition in india is pretty pathetic the thing is that no one pays enough attention to football in india everyone is after cricket football craze is there but all of us just appreciate and watch european football not bothering about indian or asian football the thing is football isn't as commercialized in india as it is in europe we don't have big businessmen owning our clubs people will notice and participate in indian football only if there are enough facilities which we sadly lack we do have some promising african players but on the whole indian soccer badly needs a miracle for the sport to be truly promoted fifa is doing its best only if india proves herself in the international stage will people want to play league soccer in india also indian footballers must prove themselves in the international stage in order to be noticed by the big european clubs it is about time football conditions improved here in india  Football (soccer) FIFA Major League Soccer Sport in Ireland Norway national football team Indian sport Newcastle United F.C.

football has there ever been a team thats had a downfall as bad as leeds utd seems incredible that less than years ago they were reaching the latter stages of the champions league and now they find themselves with a point start to their rd division campaign in short has a team ever before had this much of a downfall the only one i could think of is wimbledon and or swindon jason a surely the question here should have been 'has there ever been a club as hated as leeds utd ' what a stupid answer to a decent question as a leeds fan i am upset by what has happened as are many other leeds fans in the world over the past months we have had a lot to deal with relegation was a massive blow but then to have lots of rumours and idiots in between then we are faced with a point deduction i do believe we can survive and i don't think there has ever been a team that has been as hard hit as leeds have i empathise with all my fellow leeds fans and i think this season we should concentrate on survival with the points and then next season concentrate on promotion  Leeds United F.C.

who's the number on the england football team like who's the guy with the number on the back of his shirt barring injuries wayne rooney is the first choice for the number jersey in the england squad at the moment however i personally feel he should swap his number with michael owen number that's because usually in a team the team's most lethal striker wears the number while the team's most creative player wears the number we know owen is england's most natural striker with his deadly poacher instinct and finishing and we also know rooney is england's brightest star and the player to inspire his team with his creative play and fancy dribbling so it's just strange to see rooney and owen wearing each other's number perhaps it's meant to confuse the opponents as well hmmm  Michael Owen Wayne Rooney Striker England national football team Newcastle United F.C.

fifa vice president jack warner said he will battle to stop england hosting the world cup and i quote from todays news on the bbc nobody in europe likes england england invented the sport but has never made any impact on world football i know what i think of him and it can only be described using language for after the watershed what does everyone else think of that to me that is a very destructive comment to both england and football it also boarders on being a racist comment which flies in the face of fifa's slogan shame someone with his position has the ignorance and opportunity to voice a comment such as that you have referred to england have produced some of the finest players to play the game along with other nations and its english clubs that bought footballs popularity to many nations around the world where is there no contribution clearly he has already shown a bias towards selection and as such has no place being on a committee that requires common sense and objective attitudes  Football (soccer) FIFA Football World Cup England national football team Norway national football team American football Football in the United Kingdom Rugby union Women's football (soccer) Football World Cup 1986 Football Football in England National Football League FIFA Series Playoff format Football World Cup 1990 Diego Maradona Pel__ Football at the Summer Olympics FIFA Club World Championship Football World Cup 1950 UEFA Australian rules football Mexico national football team Germany national football team England national rugby union team France women's national football team The Football League Rugby league Chelsea F.C.

what is it about alex ferguson i don t know how he expects any player to show loyalty to man utd after the way he treats players as soon as they disagree with him if i was in the utd team i would be scared to open my mouth incase i was sold do you not think he has a cheek expecting players not to leave the club so you honestly think he treated van nistelroy well and beckham i know you must be a united fan but guess what you don t have to be a donut about it i ask this as i was recently having a convo about this with a mate who supports united i am not saying he is not succesful i don t know where you read that he also buggered roy keane off as soon as he oppened his mouth and spoke the truth about a few united players anyway if you care to read the question it was about him getting funny when a player wants to go not his success as a manager which no one can argue with sorry if i offended any united fans i just wondered why he is so bothered about a squad player heinze leaving but is happy to let first teamers leave you don't get it it's not about alex disliking people who disagree with him it's that no one is bigger then the club the players that got the boot believed they were and no one player makes the club unfortunately beckham ruud are two prime examples of players who thought they were bigger then the club and good riddance manchester united is not a team like real madrid we don't grab a bunch of big names and allow them to run their mouths off there's a reason sir alex is the manager it's his job i respect the way he runs his team i don't like the way big big big clubs are run sir alex has respect from his players they trust in him and that's the way it should be manchester united is like liverpool we are where we are because of the way we play and the way our team runs not because we were pumped with cash that's the only reason why i respect liverpool because i know that they worked for where they got just like us it was unfortunate about keane though he was probably one of my favourites back then  Alex Ferguson David Beckham Manchester United 1999-present Roy Keane Leeds United F.C.
