why is it that different races are built differently take black and middle eastern indian women they usually are very shapely and even the skinny ones have a big butt i'm not trying to offend anyone but asian girls are usually very tiny and they kind of remind me of children not that there is anything wrong with that different people white girls are usually shaped weird i do not count latinos as a race since well latino isn't a race it's an ethnicity and anyone can be hispanic i've also noticed the same for men asian men are small white and african american men are usually tall actually i think that white middle eastern indian black men are built the same well i have noticed something about races some would consider my answer racist but really it's just an observation the darker skin races tend to have more physical advantages than the lighter skin races but the lighter skined races tend to have more mental advantages for example most pro sports players tend to be of darker skin yet they make up far less of the population look at the lighter skined people they tend to always hold higher offices and tend to hold more manijorial positions of course there are exceptions to every rule and this by no means that white people and asians can't be sports players or construction laborers darker skinned people just seem to have an advantage also the same goes for darker skinned people such as blacks and mexicans they can hold high offices and be intelligent yet they tend to have less qualities on average again this is not racist just observation i am just curious if others have noticed this  Race (U.S. Census) Black (people) Race Race and intelligence African American Affirmative action Racism Colonial mentality Dragon Booster Human skin color Asian American Interracial couple Race of Jesus Strap-on dildo Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Physical attractiveness Miscegenation Volleyball White nationalism Wood Lamanite Blacks and Mormonism White supremacy Double bass Baseball American football Joke Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Mestizo Afrocentrism National Football League Skinhead Basketball Kender Caucasian race Aryan race Media and ethnicity Ultimate (sport) Validity of human races Violin Asian fetish New York-New Jersey English Mahjong Human Batting average White flight Species Indian English Equine conformation African American contemporary issues Intelligence quotient Ethnic stereotypes in pornography Water polo Ethnic issues in Japan Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Betting (poker) Non-native pronunciations of English Multiracial Rolling-element bearing Left-handed Political correctness Model minority Boxing South Africa Nation of Islam Billiards Dravidian people Race in biomedicine Mario Kart 64 Southern United States Black supremacy Race X Oz (TV series) Sento Passing Social rule Education in the United States The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Rules of Go Coloured Racism in the United States Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chess terminology Salary cap Sport rowing Clarinet Nadir of American race relations Lacrosse Welding Punt (boat) Chess opening Economic inequality Vernon Schillinger Hair color Zambo

why do the majority of black folks insist on being called african americans when we all know darn good and well aint a fraction of them ever even been to africa we never hear of a white person getting offended for being called white white people do not expect to be called german ireland americans or french canadian americans we know we are white and have no problem being called so i am no more prejudice or bigoted then i am a man fyi i am female and i too overlabel myself i refer to myself as german native american indian american in sarcasm of course because we as a politically anal people do overlabel my wife makes handmade cloth dolls faces are painted and each doll's hair is handmade and outfits are custom made she belongs to several on line doll making groups meaning no one knows where the other group members live race religion etc a few years ago a very skilled lady posted pictures of her newest doll which she called my beautiful black child lots of folks started flaming her calling her racist said they were insulted that she would so rude and crude to call the doll black instead african american they also flamed her for making the doll too stereotypical complaining the doll's broad nose fat lips the dark skin is too dark etc saying she was just mean since she making fun of african americans some even accused her of wanting to enslave all african americans because she named the doll my beautiful black doll this woman didn't respond to anything for a few days to let the furor die down then she responded i am black in my lifetime i have gone from being called a negro or the n word to being called colored to being called black which is still how i think of myself to being called african american she then added why didn't i or any of my friends or family get a choice on the african american name everyone i know thinks of themselves as black and i hate being called an african american i was born and raised in ohio calling me an ohio american would make a lot more sense and being accused of being racist the reason why that doll looks like a real black child with real dark skin fat lips broad nose is because i used my precious grandchild as my inspiration in creating this doll i think my granddaughter is the most beautiful black child i have seen so i made a doll to preserve how delightful she is at her young age then she ended her posting with this matter is closed i hope some of you have learned something by all of your nasty comments this is my insight i am not saying all african americans want to be called black in my job i work with people of all races and during the intake interview the government requires us to ask people which race or ethnic background the clients they belong to if we don't ask and document their responses the government will cut our funds this gives every client to tell me how they view themselves i don't ask them african american or black but just tell me how they refer to themselves in many groups there is a wide variety of how they liked to be referred to some examples african american or black mexican american or hispanic or latino or mexican native american or indian or their individual tribe a lot my clients tell me they prefer to be called an american i ask each individual so that i don't unintentionally offend them and this leads to a better working relationship with my clients  Black

does being african american mean that one has to act black it seems that many people of all races act as though blacks who act less stereotypically black are also less black and even claim that those people are less aware and appreciative of their heritage why should your ancestry race or nationality dictate your speech style and mannerisms i grew up in a mostly white neighborhood and have been described by some as an oreo the kind of person i am is in large a factor of where i grew up me acting stereotypically black would be me acting fake to ms parker to act stereotypically black typically means to be loud use bad grammar have a certain i guess cadence to your voice that sounds a bit like from the inner city mixed with southern by the way all i'm not referring to black as in color but more as in race if you don't know african americans are often referred to as blacks by the way all i'm not referring to black as in color but more as in race if you don't know african americans are often referred to as blacks keep in mind i did grow up in a mostly white neighborhood i've gotten the same thing from both whites and blacks because i don't act or speak in the way i described i don't believe there is such a thing as acting a race your race does not determine how you act your environment does people who say otherwise are ignorant regardless of their race more specifically towards your question i deal with the same thing the sad thing is that no matter how educated some blacks become they still feel the need to belittle themselves to fit in i say that's bull be you  Black (people) African American White (people) New York-New Jersey English Meaning English grammar Autism Theory of conduct Hispanic Stuttering Asperger syndrome Creole Race (U.S. Census) Coloured Redneck Southern American English Non-native pronunciations of English Black African American Vernacular English Negro Whose Line Is It Anyway?

why is the white house white instead of black is for some racist reason let me start by giving you a warning this is a very complicated and delicate matter as it concerns the white house the very building which rules america the west i would not think of criticising the white house for a second if not for reading what you lot alledge it is of being racist this is all rubbish firstly back in the th th century the building had already started to get dirty and the colour changed to a greyish texture which was miserable in tone they then decided to make it more appealing for various reasons like national interests and the media which came much afterwards that the colour chosen was white to make it look not only attractive but also stand out from other buildings and the surrounding environment thus getting its name as the white house never mind black not even blue beige or yellow paint will ever be painted on this sacred building because of the name and the white colour which has become part of its tradition now by the way i don t know whether it should have been black or not but it has nothing to do with people s colour white people as you say it are not white in colour they do have some pigementation to remain healthy people vitamin d in this case is important i am shocked that you blame white people for having painted it white who s being racist now this is all wrong i think you should consider your country s sacred building once more and respect it for all it has done for you instead of criticising it and defaming it on yahoo answers it is quite sad actually i hope people will understand one day that without politics we ll never be able to stand tall it s just a shame get your facts right or do not talk about politics  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Black (people) Plame affair Anti-Defamation League Color Flag of South Africa Slander and libel The Adventures of Tintin Pauline Hanson Palace of Westminster Snooker Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nation of Islam Canadian House of Commons Hair color Taxicab Political colour Skinhead EastEnders Falsifiability O.

you know how there is a united negro college what if what if the white people were to build a college just for whites would there be outrage from the black community calling us racist what would happen here i get what you are asking it's kind of weird that if you are proud to be black you are celebrating your heritage but if you are proud to be white you are a racist the race thing is just all messed up and it's tied into economic and social issues as well example black kids who do well on the national merit exam get access to a scholarship pool just for them which of these kids do well the rich suburban african american kids who went to good high schools not so much the poor ones who never had much of anything and could use a boost race issues are hopelessly complex i figure that the historically black colleges are there as an attempt to balance things out i have no idea whether it is working with regard to colleges i attended a college that was all white except for a handful of black kids who were all there on scholarship heck anyone who was in any way different from the crowd was there on scholarship i am a white girl who likes to paint and that was different enough to get me a scholarship the place was that whitebread so i'm thinking there are plenty of all white colleges out there they just don't advertise it as a feature  Affirmative action Racism Black nationalism American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) African American Black (people) Scholarship Martin Luther King, Jr. Education in the United States Minstrel show Garth Brooks Race of Jesus Nation of Islam Humphrey Bogart Interracial couple Ohio Wesleyan University Negro White supremacy Aesthetic Realism Anti-intellectualism Paul Robeson Commonwealth of Nations Beavis and Butt-head Nelson Mandela Hank Aaron Boston Public Blacks and Mormonism Education in the People's Republic of China White nationalism National Merit Scholarship Racialism White flight Gross domestic product Ku Klux Klan Race and intelligence Harlem Renaissance African American history Racial segregation Class in the contemporary United States History of South Africa in the apartheid era White (people) EastEnders Race (U.S. Census) SAT Rhodes Scholarship Nigger Westminster School Fiddler on the Roof Southern United States African American contemporary issues Education in Romania Predestination Calvin and Hobbes New Trier High School Jorge Luis Borges Power Rangers The Simpsons School choice Community college Al Sharpton Moral Politics College admissions Nadir of American race relations Goodness and value theory African Blood Brotherhood Rich Mullins Vernon Schillinger The Human Stain American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954) Miscegenation Ted Radcliffe Stuyvesant High School 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paul Newman Little Britain Black Panther Party Marcus Garvey Black Power Conservatism David Hume Robert Byrd Education in Germany Copyleft Richard Allen (reverend) Left-wing politics National Certificate of Educational Achievement Franklin D.

are all thugs in gangs its funny how when you say the word thug people assume its a negative thing associated with gangs violence and ignorance but some people dotn even know half of what its really like being with a thug or knowing a thug they just assume what do you think imo not all thugs are gangsters and not all gangsters are thugs i have only known one gangster in my life and he was no thug again imo a thug and a gangster are similiar but not the same i know quite a few thugs but there are different levels of thugs just like there are of gangsters a bonafide gangster tends to be more discreet as does a true thug laying low some people who associate with them outside of their environment may not be aware that they are to some extent thay are the same they just operate on different levels a thug is you front line soldier while your gangster tends to be higher up the food chain i also think people confuse gangsters and gang bangers which are not the same those are just my thoughts  Gangsta rap Gangster Gang Infantilism All Eyez on Me Thuggee Grand Theft Auto III Mafia Hip hop collaborations Gangster No. 1 Power (sociology) The Untouchables Cultural Revolution Max Payne EastEnders Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Aquemini A Piece of the Action Al Capone Beavis and Butt-head True Crime: Streets of LA Intelligence quotient The Usual Suspects Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Full Metal Panic?

why are women becoming so blatantly hypocrites i just watched a movie called phat girls comedian monique and what i noticed is that the main point of the movie was to say that women that are overweight still have sex appeal value but what i found to be so hypocritical was that there weren't any overweight men displayed in the film as sexy or having any value before the immaturity starts no i'm not overweight but it got me to thinking that women have been in the past few years trying to get men to appreciate overweight women but yet most women don't have the same appreciation for overweight men why blue i'm sorry but i think you're mistaken if you think that men don't worry about their appearance and my opinion wasn't just based on the movie the movie just got me started thinking judy i never said anything wrong about big women i'm just talking about how women treat men dam good question i have never noticed that but you are completely right  Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Peter Griffin Sexual attraction The Smoking Room Cary Grant Friends Pornographic movie The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Social rule Kodocha Gay slang Tony Hancock Sin City Spidey Super Stories Wedding Crashers Judy Garland Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series Physical attractiveness Sinfest Good Morning, Vietnam The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Joke Yoko Ono Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American Psycho Infidels Binge eating disorder Sex symbol Madonna (entertainer) About a Boy Chinglish Mae West Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Nine to Five Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In True Grit Reservoir Dogs Feminism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures A Series of Unfortunate Events The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Canon (fiction) Anime Miss Saigon Lauren Bacall Stewie Griffin Comedy film One Tree Hill (TV series) Married... with Children Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Theodicy Sexual orientation Extras (sitcom) Doug Big five personality traits U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Same-sex marriage in the United States Springfield Elementary School Human penis size The Pilgrim's Progress Piccolo Junior Saga Laura Schlessinger Sex and the City Epistemology Catwoman Peter Sellers The Country Wife Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Paradox Mississippi John Hurt South Park Paramount Pictures EastEnders Stuart Smalley Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roger Ebert's most hated films Mystique (comics) Futurama (TV series - season 3) Super Size Me Mulholland Drive (film) Milton H.

the real american black experience as a black american which singers would you want to be looked at as representing the true heart of the black american experience and aspirations leadbelly jellyroll morton billy holliday b b king temptations aretha franklin platters supremes snoop dogg li'l missy beyonce tupac b i g and why did you make that choice o k let me explain where i'm going here and what i'm trying to understand first with leadbelly jellyroll morton billy holliday b b king they all lived just a couple of generations removed from slavery they lived through the darkest era of segregation but still kept their dignity and sense of humor their lives were pure hell but they persevered and overcame all the obstacles in their paths to become icons of american music and among many others of their era left an indelible influence on american music they were personalities that young blacks could look up to because they symbolized strength and triumph in the face of evil second the temptations aretha franklin platters supremes all covered the turbulent era of the civil rights movement and all of them even the early platters used their songs to address the serious problems of the black community papa was a rolling stone love child r e s p e c t etc they made good livings but they returned a hell of a lot more to the community than they received financially they tried to make a positive change in a community that was being torn apart during the ' s and ' s when the civil rights movement left a lot of blacks wondering who to follow m l k malcolm x the black panthers etc these groups were talking straight and hard to the kids then and trying to guide them or at least get them to ask the right questions for their futures now we've got snoop dogg the late tupac the late b i g li'l missy and beyonce all covered in bling and using derogatory terms for black women and girls that would have had their grandmothers' slippers off and smacking their butts before they knew what happened black women who fought for the past hundred and fifty years to be free and proud are now being degraded by not just the black male rappers but the females as well it's like the farther ahead the black entertainment community gets financially the farther back they're falling in self respect and dignity i mean i can't see aretha taking the sh t from any of the gangsta rappers that young black girls are soaking up just to be fly today can anybody explain this it's like in the depths of the era of slavery and segregation the black community turned out w e b dubois booker t washington fredrick douglass harriet tubman and on and on and on the civil rights era gave the world m l k malcolm x muhammad ali jackie robinson ralph bunche sports heros without steroids proud dignified and dedicated leaders whether or not you agreed with their particular direction but now who the hell do the black youth have as role models eddie murphy can yell out let the nigger talk in the nutty professor the n word's used more now by blacks than by crackers in the ' s that's why i asked about the music difficult to answer each person you have named has contributed their talent in different 'era's' i sincerely feel where you are coming from agree with you it seems that some african americans have found a 'niche' to which they are singing rapping about 'what is' in so far as their this present time not having the experiences had by those in less humane times i dare say that those that stood against oppression did not come that far to hear a brother call someones daughter ho a sign of self oppression the blame i feel cannot fall on politics race or disrimination as single entities but as a joint effort even then it is for each individual to take responsibility for their actions blame no one i personally refuse to call anyone 'n' or 'ho' hold dearly my culture so much so that it is on my face peace love respect to you  African American American Civil Rights

where do these mexican women on here get off putting down the whites if it wasn' t for us you wouldn't be in our country why don't you at least act like you appreciate us letting you come here when most americans would rather send you back and i am speaking to christien and spicy latina who can't wait to answer a question putting down white people defend everyone else why are you living in our country then go back to where you came from or is it to messed up over there to live as well as you do here well i figured i'd get more negative than positive but like the one person said i pay taxes speak english and don't disrespect anyone til they do me and these women have been disrespectin white people on here since they joined do your homework people that's why our country is as f'd up as it is peoples ignorance if you can't conform get out we've helped enough of these people who laugh in our faces wake up people or continue living in your rose colored glasses world i was referring to these two individuals if you read more into it that's your choice it reads pretty simple and easy hi beachy it's pathetic that anyone has to place racist remarks against any individual in the first place i don't care if a person is bi racial african american native american caucasian or mexican we are all god's children no matter what nationality we are when an individual has degrated another person's heritage or ethnic background it's usually for a reason it may not be a good reason in the eye's of the other but there is a reason for everything that is said or for a behavior or action now i'm not condoning what these two individuals have said because i haven't been familiar with the questions they have answered but don't lower yourself to their level by doing the same exact thing that they have done believe it or not they have the same freedom of speech as you do and they have the right to voice their own opinion whether we like their opinion or not now let me add that they may be acting very immature and not acting their age when voicing their own opinion but that's where we are 'smarter' than they are or at least more mature than they seem to be in our actions and reactions our country was suppose to be 'the land of the free' to everyone who wanted to make this country their home this country was for all nationalities not just for a selected few the europeans came to this continent to find a better place to live and to get rid of the rules of a monarchy ruled country if one wants to get technical about this issue it was the europeans that took this land away from the native american indians they were the first settlers here so with this is mind and to be realsitic about things and history only the native american indians have the right so do speak to tell anyone to get out of the us but the government is to 'thank' for that realization but that's a different topic all together so what i'm trying to say is that these two individuals must have a reason for their racist remarks maybe they have been exploited with their nationality or someone has hurt them by making snide remarks one must consider the 'source' when one makes a statement such as what you were referring to in their answers it's a shame that some individuals have to 'hurt' people due to their heritage but unfortunately society in a lot of cases have caused such turmoil racism has been around for decades and will remain for years to come it's a shame that 'we' can't all live together in peace without all this racism underneath god's umbrella but don't place yourself on their level of ignorance have a blessed day  Black (people) Plame affair African American Democracy Social rule Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Nigger Patriotism

why do people keep saying that their race is smarter than another race fine then bl dsuckr give me a violation for just asking a freakin question because they doesn't realise that every human being on this planet is related to every other human being on the planet they also don't account for god and the intelligence that is distributed to each person regardless of genetics and how our soul and intelligence is a blessing from a god who is for every person racists don't allow for the fact that we're all genetically and spiritually linked basically i tend to think that evolution opens the doors for racists due to the fact that a racist individual could assert that their race was evolved from insert species here and that another race evolved from insert species here and then make arguments such as the one you've described it's all utter nonsense ignore it and be content knowing that you're more intelligent when bickering with a foolish man it only serves to make us both look foolish he for his argument and ourselves for attempting to make a fool understand a concept above his comprehension pepper  Intelligent design God Creationism Meaning of life Soul Evolutionary creationism Creation-evolution controversy Free will Bah__'__ Faith and Science Atheism History of creationism Validity of human races Species The nature of God in Western theology Race and intelligence Race Urantia Supernatural Eugenics Animism Religion Psychology of religion Guns, Germs, and Steel Philosophy of mathematics Summa Theologiae Eastern Orthodox Church Sola fide Reincarnation Teleological argument Agnosticism Human nature Intelligent design movement Sociocultural evolution Meme Person Immortality David Hume Jews as a chosen people Racism Biodiversity Spiritual evolution Goodness and value theory Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ontological argument Presuppositional apologetics Existence Wealth Theory of conduct The Origin of Species Predestination Scopes Trial Postmodernism Sexual orientation Extraterrestrial life Existence of God Economics John Howard Yoder Infant baptism Trinity Origin belief Creation biology Aristotle Cosmological argument Teach the Controversy Abortion debate Evolution Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Same-sex marriage The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Black (people) Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Joke Fundamentalism Transhumanism Theodicy Flood geology Sociobiology Brahman Original sin Specified complexity Intelligence (trait) Psychology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Age of Enlightenment Culture Internet troll Karl Popper Religion and sexual orientation Deconstruction Horus Neuro-linguistic programming Extinction

what would a racist do if he she died and god looked just like someone they hated tom t i understand what you're saying clearly and i agree yet as a christian i would find it hard to face the lord knowing that i didn't speak out against racism if you know god then you know that he knows your heart no matter what someone does on this earth there is going to be a point when they have to face god to be judged and they are going to have to face all the things they did on earth good and bad want to know what i think people who are racist are going to have a real wake up call what are they going to do when their soul moves on from their body and race will no longer matter anymore what kind of excuse will they have to justify their actions i believe that when that time comes from that point forward they will only care about what god thinks about them and that is all they will have to face what they have done when god asks them why they have not loved others who are all of the same blood for once in their existence they will finally be able to reflect on what they did in this world they will have to look at what they did and will finally feel humiliation for making the hateful decisions they have made in life here just like anyone else i think racism makes god sad because he loves all of us and wants us to love each other just like he love us he loves all of us the same no matter what we look like in the end no matter what others have done or how they live we all make our own choices and we will all reap what we sow not for what others did but for what we do that's one of the reasons why people say it doesn't matter how you died but how you lived  Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Pitaten Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Merit God Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rich Mullins Duties of the Heart The nature of God in Western theology Incarnations of Immortality Philipp Melanchthon Theodicy Meaning of life Socrates Original sin Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Summa Theologiae John Howard Yoder Ten Commandments Racism Qiyamah The Subtle Knife Karma in Hinduism Soul Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Rei Ayanami Moral objectivism Infant baptism Jews as a chosen people Dead Like Me Yusuf al-Qaradawi Philosophical skepticism Reincarnation Hades Alan Campbell (pastor) Shaggy dog story Anti-Defamation League Sola fide Friedrich Schleiermacher Bible and reincarnation Salvation Phaedo Origin belief Book of Isaiah Sant Thakar Singh Resurrection of Jesus Kodocha Christian eschatology Atomism Free will Piccolo Junior Saga Edgar Cayce Blacks and Mormonism Abortion debate Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Biblical inerrancy Human Church of Christ, Scientist Simone Weil Eastern Orthodox Church Determinism Scenes from a Memory Jewish principles of faith Urantia The Death Gate Cycle Religion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eucharist EastEnders Evolutionary creationism Patriotism Too Short a Season (TNG episode) David Hume Amidah Bertrand Russell Immortality Perseverance of the saints Current teachings of Prem Rawat One Tree Hill (TV series) Taxi Driver Death (personification)

can a psychopath claim to be able to love when she he lacks feelings like empathy i mean it's another thing to decide that you are going to put on an act and cry when you win money cry at your wedding cry if somebody proposes to you but feeling these feelings genuinely is another thing can a psychopath feel emotions of love and the like when they can't feel for exampe empathy super psych the dependence you are talking about is a key word we know in which ways we are all dependent on each other in the world though we may not admit it readily in some cases but to depend on some one and then hate them doesn't make sense every body is dependent on some one in some way whetehr we would like to admit it or not these things are all amazing and as maya angelou put it it's time we are living in a time for the thinkers to think dink you say psychopaths are most likely the ones filling up prisons for crimes commited against individuals or society but do you and i agree that even those who put them there do not fare well in this analysis because hte prisoners are all individuals each has a different story to tell that has probably put them in that situation what do you call the lack of understanding for that fact if we had empathy and tried to understand what has brought a human being to commitnig hideous crimes crime is not to be justified at all but if we had empathy far lesser people would be in prisons at least not for longer periods of time abateddust i love the earnesty of your answer really people like a 'psycopaths' tend to have either a severe chemical imbalance in their brain or have cut off ties to reality due to specific usually extreme experiences they are usualy able to feel regular emotions but due to their instability and whatever may have caused it these emotions may not register be ignored due to much more powerful influences other emotions thoughts or the emotion may even be a reminder of somthing that caused the instability and in that case will usually be avoided at all costs  Empathy Evil Antisocial personality disorder Autism Social psychology Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Religion Goodness and value theory Human The nature of God in Western theology Soul Epistemology Narcissism Consciousness Capital punishment Addiction Serial killer Theodicy Philosophy of language Novel Post-traumatic stress disorder Altruism Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Gestalt therapy The Amber Spyglass Torture Alignment (role-playing games) Numerology Mojave people Borderline personality disorder Psychology Patriotism Emotional intelligence Out-of-body experience Social rule Mental illness Human sexual behavior Law of value Ethics Asperger syndrome Scientific method Capitalism Mental Health Act 1983 Sexual orientation Objectivist philosophy Traumatic brain injury Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Rape Determinism Neuro-linguistic programming Enneagram Homophobia Atheism John Howard Yoder Universal pragmatics Marshall McLuhan Franz Boas Stuttering Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charles Manson Daredevil God Phoebe Halliwell Zoophilia Karla Homolka Motivation Obsessive-compulsive disorder W.

why do small people get offended by the word midget i'm not a small person and the phrase small people makes me want to laugh and seems to be more offensive than midget this is a real question because i really don't get it and i don't like using the phrase small people maybe its just because i don't like politically correct phrases in general for instance i'm black and i don't really like the term african american or colored people i did noticed the first sentence isn't in correct english probably because many people use the word in an offensive way like when someone sees a person who is short for their age and they call them a midget and start making fun of them  Political correctness Joke Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i have heard this comment a lot the true americans are the native americans not the europeans that came later could this statement be considered accurate for those who may find the question confusing it s not a semantic question it s not about who was here first or what native means as a personal comment it s not a statement out of fashion if you have had the chance to know innmigrant communities living in america who do not understand for example why everyone that is not white is labeled as xxxx american including natives who were irrefutably the first to inhabit this land giving the impression that these groups are an annex of the real american society hi yes that is very true the native american indians were the first people that lived here in the united states of course it wasn't known as the united states then but you know my meaning they were the first settlers to make our country their home or i should say 'their country' since they were here first and the europeans took it away from them realistically speaking of course go to your local library or the internet and look up the history of the native american indians quite interesting they were very proud people have a great day  White (people) Indigenous peoples of the Americas South America Black (people) Hispanic Telephone numbering plan Slander and libel Languages in the United States Past teachings of Prem Rawat Social psychology Philosophy of science Philosophy of language Cherokee Colony Manifest Destiny Indian Wars Indigenous peoples Hearsay Reality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus North American Numbering Plan Native Americans in the United States Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) History of Ohio Race (U.S. Census) Plame affair Cultural relativism American Revolution Social rule French colonial empires Africa Logic Asian Latin America Bosniaks Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Falsifiability Lie Ownership Indian reservation Americas History of Texas Ontology (computer science) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 History of the United States Multilingual State Existence Portuguese Creole Hindu Transcontinental nation New Caledonia English grammar New France British Isles Irish Rebellion of 1641 Quantification Reparations for slavery Donald Davidson (philosopher) Roswell UFO incident Multiracial Lenape England Seminole (tribe) Pensacola, Florida Atheism Indigenous Australians Ward Churchill History of Florida Ubykh language History of the United States (1789-1849) Fashion Ohio Country Population history of American indigenous peoples Inuit Republic of Texas Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Contract Modal logic Colonial America Pontiac's Rebellion Asian American History of the Americas Northwest Indian War German language Southeast Asia Demographics of Brazil Cree Fort Ashby, West Virginia John Titor Goodness and value theory War of 1812 Philosophy African American Western United States Native American name controversy American exceptionalism Indigenous peoples in Brazil Frontier

why do white people invade people's land why do europeans move out of europe and to someone else's nation and then subjugate and torment the native people and cause their starvation and misery europeans went to australia the phillipines almost every country in africa south america north america india and alot of places in between they even did it to themselves roman empire but white folks seem to hate being around other ethnic groups unless the group decides to join them and their society then they can tolerate them a bit what is so wrong with europe is it really that bad it looks fine to me except not as many natural resources yes people from other countries move to other countries i know all about immigration but the difference is that they leave countries with few opportunities and they don't try to completely destroy native people's homes and usually the countries were colonized or invaded beforehand by europeans what is deal just trade if u need resources why is it ok to steal bohmoron i hear alot of this theory that africans sold other africans but i don't think this was always the case because certain tribes would put hugeplates in the lips of their women so that they would look scary grotesque and would not be nabbed by portueguese invaders also some theories suggest that african kings thought they were sending people to be educated in europe and that they were tricked robert k africans did develop ships they sailed to the americas and traded with the natives of central and south america i read this in a book called they came before coloumbus by cheik anta diop also remember that the natives of polynesia macronesia and micronesia appear to be of african descent so that means thay they probably sailed there from africa there are also theories that african's often sailed to china and traded with the people there at least years ago mike is calling me stupid but has not backed up his claims at all i read and i analyze which i am quite sure mike does not just becasue you don't like what i have to say does not make me stupid oh and brillilant vocabulary mike idiot and stupid are such clever insults psf europeans have dominated of late but at one times africans were dominant one perosn here pointed out that the north african moors invaded iberia and ruled for years i believe that spain wa the one country that did not go into the dark ages because these africans brought education and universities and fresh ideas which means that yes this kind of invasion can be a good thig as well however what should a people do with that domination should they kill and destroy other culutres and people should they bomb other nations hiroshima nagasaki should they exploit people and take their natural resources and let the native people starve even with all this technology and advancement there appears to be a price the internet has been shown to be a danger to children factories cars trucks and airplanes pour out harmful chemicals into the environment convenience foods have led to obesity and heart disease entire animal populations are extinct ok i'm off topic now definatelymaybe yeah i know its in the past no you dont have to invade anyone but some of the governments will do it for you and you will reap the benefits see its not about you the indivdual you simply get to reap the benefits while others suffer you dont have to lift a finger and maybe i am reaping the benefits as well which i dont think is ok since i'm black and you know i should care about other black people in peril al r i dont believe that stuff about africans selling other africans because it too perfectly lets american off the hook for slavery and since publishers celverly omit certain things from school books concerning slvery such as the rape torture bdsm you know that bondage sex stuf sodomy pedophilia raping of lil boys the hanging of pregnant women the whipping of pregnant moms until their unborn babies fell out this was done for sport the fact they forbid slaves to read and write the fact that after church white folks would go watch people being lynched the fact that black people rebelled often and killed whites often the hatian revolution where african slaves rose up and defeated their masters and took over haiti led by denmark vesey and i could go on but for this reason i am skeptical about what i read in history books and on the history channel because so much stuff is left out and they act like slavery was fun and games i believe this has perplexed so many people you find yourself thinking until you can think no more that's all i have to say as we speak we are all trying to be assimilated into a method of self destruction and a sterile hostile planet that can no longer hold human life and still not much is being said mimi below me that was quite a selfish answer and i hope you know it  Black (people) Slavery Atlantic slave trade Economy of Africa Guns, Germs, and Steel Reparations for slavery South Africa

um i don't get it why are some of you being overly sensitive okay i get that some of you are angry because of all the racist so you make jokes or talk about things that have absolutely nothing with the subject to deviate from the racist question but you are still doing it with questions that are actually valid i mean this is a section about culture so there will be some valid questions about race and nationality wouldn't it make more sense to answer real questions with real answers instead of putting crazy answers in every post a few of you have actually proved my point i honestly don't think you read before you post see this why i say overly sensitive if you look at some of the people's history who post legitimate questions you will see that they are not racist some people just really want to know things everything mentioned about race isn't racist and it's better to ask then assume i think some of you need to learn reading comprehension or even just learn to read because going into a valid post and typing up nonsense only gives racist an opportunity to say i told you so by the way i'm years old and i think i know when people are being sarcastic or sincere but its because i take the time to read and not assume assumption is what makes people start idiot stereotypes in the first place they're immature plain and simple honey  Internet troll The nature of God in Western theology Joke Theory of conduct Slashdot subculture Theodicy African American Vernacular English Ontological argument Avenue Q Philosophical skepticism Validity of human races Plame affair Asperger syndrome Deconstruction Racism The Catcher in the Rye Philosophy of language Who is a Jew?

why do biracial children with ethnic mothers look less ethnic than biracial children with white mothers i have noticed that when i see a white woman with biracial children the children have more ethnic features and color but when i see an ethnic woman black hispanic asian with biracial children white father more often the children look less ethnic i know hispanic women with white children and the children look white but when i see white women with hispanic children the children look hispanic i also have two black girlfriends with white husbands and the children could pass if they wanted to if anything they look italian or greek do children tend to take on the genes of the father more often this must be a matter of perception the biracial children of a mixed white ethnic couple are usually going to be darker than the white parent and lighter than the ethnic parent but since you're more likely to see kids out with just their mother instead of their father you're probably just noticing how biracial kids look different from their mothers if you often saw them with just their fathers instead you'd be wondering why the kids don't look more like their dads children do not and cannot take on the genes of their father more than their mother a man's genes are not stronger or more dominant than a woman's the only way a man's genes are different from a woman's is on the y chromosome which actually contains fewer genes than the x chromosome when it comes to appearance a child is equally likely to take after its mother or its father  Multiracial Black (people) African American White (people) X chromosome Dominance relationship Human Eye color Incest Mendelian inheritance Father Haemophilia Liger Androgen insensitivity syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Affirmative action Blood type Fathers' rights Daredevil Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Intelligence quotient Melanin Colonial mentality Cat coat genetics Color Family name Physical attractiveness Mestizo Color blindness Mitosis Vivid Entertainment Woman Recessive gene Race Left-handed Miscegenation Divorce Cell growth Chromosome Child custody Human skin color Mulatto Thalassemia Horse Domestic violence The Jeffersons (South Park) Color theory Species Huntington's disease Biology and sexual orientation Gene Race (U.S. Census) Interracial couple Blood purity (Harry Potter) White flight Hair color Joke Gender role The Human Stain Feminism Abortion debate Family Santa Claus Hispanic Iberian naming customs Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Roan (color) Beauty contest Japanese American Gray (horse) Spy Kids Ethnic stereotypes in pornography Genetic disorder Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Married... with Children Baldness About a Boy Asian fetish Will & Grace Fathers' rights movement in the UK Boston Public Maiden name Bill Cosby Racial segregation Genealogical DNA test Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Passing DNA Laura Schlessinger Urinary incontinence Demographics of Brazil Down syndrome Reggie Jackson Barbara McClintock Tibetan people Tortoiseshell cat Kyle Broflovski Gene Simmons Reproduction Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)

nudist ladies what do think when you see guys in a state of excitement pervert or human behaviour my opinion it depends on the type of person age and situations but this problem happens very often maybe of experienced nudist are able to hide it but being a so human and unavoidable effect it has not to be considered pervert behaviour in general young guys or boys have more difficulties to avoid that because the self control needs more effort respect to adult control all reactions when meeting or looking to gorgeous girls or ladies can be very challenging for a young guy one personal and funny example my son we are a nudist family now is already a very skilled nudist but last year had a very hard day when on a very solitary nudist place we met his maths supply teacher a real voluptuous girls dream of his entire class apart the first embarrassing moment for my son instead she acted very naturally we spent all day chatting with her and her hubby but it was a real difficult day for my boy without considering the day after at school human nature it happens all the time it can even happen to men not just teenagers once i made the mistake of watching my wife undress and a nude beach fortunately it was early and no one was near enough to see that i was enjoying the view as it were we feel undressing is more erotic that plain nudity don't get me wrong my wife was not stripping just getting undress i simply looked away my wife started making some conversion about whatever and the problem went away as quickly as it happen we then spent a nice relaxing day at the beach  Nudism Nudity Social aspects of clothing Social rule Child sexual abuse Pornography in Japan Human sexual behavior Transactional analysis Megan Griffin Child sexuality Shaggy dog story Pedophilia Nude beach Theory of conduct Motion picture rating system Ranma __ characters Spanking Striptease Stuttering El Goonish Shive Anime Sauna Hentai Cliff Richard About a Boy The New School at West Heath Infantilism Lewis Carroll Sento Avenue Q Hikikomori Friends W.I.T.C.H.

why is hispanic a race in america and why do people refer to themselves as irish etc not just white ok well i live in the uk and i don't want to sound ignorant but we just have white not generally hispanic latino etc i have friends who are originally spanish but view themselves as white why is it diffret on the other side of the pond and on yahoo answers when people mighjt be asking what colours suit to them they will refer to themselves as irish not just white it's very confusing and i don't understand why in america more emphasis is put on race etc especially in films etc i am doing american history this year and was wondering is it because of immigration etc i don't want to offend anyoen i'm just curious lol i posted a badly worded question i don't mean that we don't have discrimination we certainly do but it seems like it is more diverse over there and in popular culture race is referered to more lol pasty white people i'm a pasty white person especially as we are only just starting to get some sunshine over here i can see that some people have read into your question and found it to be offensive i don't see it that way i believe you are inquiring about differences that we seem to have in the way we view certain cultural issues you could be right we are of many places and to some degree it gives us a comfort level to be able to define our roots it may be exactly as you describe it may be an attitude that is present because we are all from somewhere else and not have the ancient ties to the soil that one might find in britain judging by the mix that i have seen there in recent trips you too may find yourself asking the same questions in the near future there is pride involved in it but there is also a defining of our heritage and perhaps a short hand for our beliefs and attitudes ie irish would likely be raised catholic with all typical stereotypes we understand and german is bound to be entirely different possibly in appearance not necessarily but in cultural bias good luck with your course when you get to the part about the revolutionary war you might also understand that those that chose to leave or were driven out to a great extent defined who we became in canada history lives with us and defines who we become btw if someone asks me i say i am canadian fifth generation as canadian as anyone gets but to tell you that would not tell you much about my appearance but if i said i have english irish scottish roots you might be able to see me better  Black (people) Hispanic White (people) Nationalism Sexual orientation Philosophy Racism Same-sex marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Political correctness Socrates Asperger syndrome Goodness and value theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Hiberno-English Patriotism Irish language Theory of conduct Homophobia Liberalism Funeral Evangelicalism Psychology African American England Roman Catholic Church English language Multilingual Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Christianity Intelligent design Franz Boas Infant baptism New York-New Jersey English Trinity Multiculturalism Supernatural Predestination College Race (U.S. Census) Coercion Plame affair Canadian literature Atheism Ireland Court system of Canada Polyamory Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses English grammar Bosniaks Race of Jesus Infantilism Feminism Fundamentalism Skinhead Southern United States Parliament of the United Kingdom Postmodernism Modern Celts Species Monarchy in Canada Celt Esperanto as an international language Nicomachean Ethics Jacob Neusner Democracy Witchcraft Who is a Jew?

i was accused of being racist and it hurt a lot i work in a hotel and we were full tonight an older black couple came in at am and asked if we had any rooms we didn't and i knew that without having to look it up on the computer because i do all of the paperwork for the hotel anyways i apologized and explained that we are the only hotel this far west in omaha and without missing a beat they said they were going to call a lawyer and he would be calling us in the morning because we discriminate and then they walked out i for one enjoy making money so i wouldn't turn away any paying customer unless it looked like they were wasted and they were going to trash the place so why would they just jump to the conclusion that i was discriminating is there a mentality that midwest men are racist or something our part of town is not predominately white in fact there are blacks and latinos that work here at the hotel too and i have never come experienced this kind of situation before what do you think they only assumed that because you didn't bother to check to see if there were any rooms available they didn't know you already knew that there weren't any rooms left simple misunderstanding edit by reading some of these comments it's clear how most of you people are racist every black person doesn't scream racism whenever something doesn't go right  Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Racism The Shining (film) Ann Coulter American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Have I Got News For You Shaggy dog story Little Britain Escape from New York Ethnic issues in Japan Vernon Schillinger Ocean's Twelve Satchel Paige Anti-Defamation League Make money fast Avenue Q Eddie Guerrero The Catcher in the Rye The Star Wars Holiday Special Late Night with Conan O'Brien Karl Rove Hal Trosky Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Black (people) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Futurama (TV series - season 5) EastEnders Boston Public Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Plame affair Domestic violence Beetle in an Anthill Fancy Crane Martin Luther King, Jr. The Inside Humphrey Bogart Kasparov versus The World On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Alan Keyes Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Ron Weasley Pitaten Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Sin City Taxi Driver Leo Frank Reparations for slavery African American James Hanratty Rosa Parks Schapelle Corby Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Garfield Superman III The Emancipation of Mimi Daredevil Major League Baseball television contracts Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Howard Stern Montreal Screwjob Angel One (TNG episode) Blonde on Blonde Blacks and Mormonism Jean Charles de Menezes The Human Stain Equal Protection Clause Rent (musical) God Emperor of Dune Marilyn Monroe Russian joke Miss Saigon Eugenics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nation of Islam Nadir of American race relations Jackass: The Movie Nigger Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Full Metal Panic?

is this creepy i made a collage of a picture of a guy i like that i met at camp comparing him to a celebrity i also did the same for myself do you think this is creepy why or why not not at all it is your own particular creativity at portraiture and self portrait you happened to put together to make a statement about both of you when i worked as a teacher i'd ask that the children would allow me to perceive them through a first project which as a self portrait would become their own declared signature for the time they felt it applied to them the option was they could change this self symbolism at any time they felt sufficient of a change in themselves to promote another interpretation the children would particularly enjoy and like this project because it made them aware of looking inward and vigilant as to what changes occurred in them constant self awareness kept them in touch with themselves  Portrait Autism rights movement Art Time travel Copyleft Richard Avedon Collage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.

why the whining about asians not dating other races i am tired of seeing questions like why are whites dating mostly asians now or why asians refuse dating other races what do you expect when they are most likely to meet each other during college years or at professional jobs the monority with the biggest representation in top prestigious colleges and professional jobs are asians leading to frequet contact with the white population last month my cousin got married to a black guy she meet while working at microsoft this shows that if other monorities were more represented in schools and professional jobs the marriage or dating disparity wont be so obvious i think its cool i really like couples of different races it to me shows the world changing in a good way  Interracial couple Affirmative action NWo Race (U.S. Census) Friends Jennifer Lopez 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carl Barks John Forsythe Snooker Race and intelligence Jumping the shark University of Houston Humphrey Bogart White (people) Multiracial Baseball Tiger Woods ABBA Equal Protection Clause White flight Economic inequality National Football League Makati City 2005 United States Grand Prix The Dukes of Hazzard George W.

this is a question for wiccans or pagans please i am so very intrested in your belifs i have always felt a lack of a better work witch at heart i have experienced a power of some sort i would like a guiding hand where should i start i would like to do this the right way i don't know much but can you tell me a little about your path and how you got where you are today thank you so very much witchcraft is a belief system based on the practice of magic and it is also a spiritual enlightenment some practice only one most do both you can also be born a witch usually with psychic powers or witchcraft family traditions but those are rarer witchcraft the craft is designed to work with the universe to achieve goals like healing or punishment or love witchcraft the old religion is to achieve personal enlightenment i have always worked for both ppl who are witches usually have some contact with the other worlds since they are children like seeing ghosts or pre cog or other psychic abilities however witchcraft is a skill like praying or gardening it is not associated with any religion per se you can get burnt as a witch regardless of your faith i know some jewitches some islamic witches and esp xian witches that said witches are usually perveyors of the old religion that is the folk traditions of native ppls of the area in question like native celtic or norse nowadays they are often called 'pagan' or earth based religions reclaimists and many neo pagans actively work to recover the lost knowledge and practices of their elders and therefore do a great deal of research on folklore although most of it was lost with the often forceable conversion to xianity and islam much of the folk traditions we see today all over the world are handed down from ancient times http paganwiccan about com od wiccaandpaganismbasics a wwpdiffs htm witch the practice of witchcraft is not associated with any religion therefore you can be a witch and yet also be a member of any number of religions or none using the natural energies within yourself along with the energies of herbs stones or other elements to make changes around you is considered witchcraft though the skills and gifts that are part of witchcraft can be inherited from parents or grandparents you aren't automatically a witch just because your grandmother may have been one the use of magick takes practice experience and learning on a side note a male witch is called a witch not a warlock wiccans are usually witches but witches do not have to be wiccan thank goodness one of the biggest sore points among wiccans is the improper usage of the terms wiccan and witch too many people use the terms interchangably presuming that they both mean the same thing they do not wiccan wicca is a religion and someone who follows that religion is called a wiccan sometimes it can be difficult to accurately define wicca and not all wiccans will define themselves the same way observing the wiccan sabbats honoring the gods and or goddesses creating sacred space for rituals to name a few typical wiccans also practice magick and therefore are also witches witches are low magic practioners usually specializing in herbal and natural healing both physical and mental solving family and tribal issues like finding lost articles weather prediction and the like they are usually women and also known as priestesses of the old religion which they often were wizards are high magic magicians they specialize in ceremonial magic such as the kabbalah or key of solomon they are the cape hat wand sword and dagger crowd they are usually male most witches don't need to start practicing witchcraft they always have done so however like any skill we learn by doing experiementation speaking to others and reading there are many ways to increase efficacy of spellcraft including focus research mediation symbolism of both words and tools i am a witch from a witch family who lost the belief system and ritual structure if they ever had it and have certain abilities like prophetic dreaming which is passed on in a legacy format when someone dies i have been a practicing witch all my life and was dedicated when i was years old i have chaired a seance with correct answers coming forth unbidden i have felt presences and asked them to remove themselves when i became frightened including my own grandfather stupid that i have led guided meditations since i was a child had a few veriable pre cog incidences practiced divination and had weather affinity and magic before training i have heard the distinct thoughts of others on many occations including those far away but those are rarer there are many websites to help you increase your skills and aid in your spirituality http www witchvox com http www witchway net

popular question racists touchy about colour surprisingly ok with stupidity i mean really years of civilization most of which not founded or worked upon by whites and this is what we have to show for it we can't cure modern ailments or address things like homelessness abuse or poverty in the richest nations but we can be just as pointlessly racist as a middle ages dirt farmer yay us i'm so proud p s unless you can produce a flawlessly accurate pedigree stating names dates and locations what the fuck makes you think you're pure anything guffaw most of you racist motherfuckers probably can't trace your muddy lineage back more than a pathetic century or two it's bad enough you talk out yer ass but doing so without any concrete proof except the immediate present day skin colour is laughable seriously don't you have more important things to do edit yes but i only feel vaguely better yes most of the useful leaps in civilization were not made by whites sure because ignoring racists instead of addressing the problem makes everything go away yes sick to death of reading racist posts most of which are from white males so they have a right to post hate but i don't have a right to get angry about it nice edit wow a scolding i'm so reticient do you do the same to the morons who post questions that are so racist they're inhumane p s i'm kind of puzzled with what sexism has to do with my question like listen to a raiveran rabbit i am being quite serious racists are always going to be around regardless of actual race or ethnic background whites will hate blacks blacks will hate whites israelis will hate palestinians palestinians will hate jews and the list goes on it doesn't matter whether more important things need to be done because the hate is so engrained into the moral fiber of their being the best thing to do is educate the youth at risk so they grow and learn that racist stereotypes aren't o k just as whites aren't supposed to drop the n word blacks should not do it either the only thing you can do or any sane person for that matter is do you personal best to make this world a better place and let the brain of every racist rot away  Racism Nigger Black (people) Theory of conduct British National Party The Marshall Mathers LP Shit Avenue Q Arab-Israeli conflict Zionism and racism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Media and ethnicity Noam Chomsky The nature of God in Western theology Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Joke Race and intelligence Rocko's Modern Life Philosophical Investigations Howard Stern New anti-Semitism Palestinian Skinhead Talmud Dualism (philosophy of mind) Singlish Vernon Schillinger Anti-Semitism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Taxi Driver Anne Rice Ron and Fez Kyle Broflovski Little Britain Invader Zim Profanity Sant Thakar Singh White (people) Yusuf al-Qaradawi Anti-Zionism Minstrel show Hiberno-English Israeli Arab Objectivist philosophy Lie Yasser Arafat Benny Morris EastEnders Russian joke British Mandate of Palestine Nation of Islam Past teachings of Prem Rawat Race of Jesus Karl Rove Homosexuality Plame affair Internet troll African American Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Philosophy of language Margaret Sanger B3ta Anti-Defamation League Jewish state White supremacy American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Historical Jesus Philosophical skepticism Homophobia Self-hatred Bill Maher David Horowitz Opie and Anthony Soul Proposals for a Palestinian state Alan Keyes Social rule Asperger syndrome Angels in America H.P.

why are african americans allowed to enjoy privileges whites cannot ethnic groups such as african americans and hispanics are publicly allowed to have parades and organizations specifically according to their race imagine a white entertainment channel or someone using the catch phrase the whiter the polar bear the sweeter the juice there would be outrage it just seems a little unfair that white people have to be shy about being proud of their ancestry because they might be called a biggot imagine a white scholarship just think of a parade exclusively for white ancestry every activist group in america would be protesting and it would turn into a riot image tuning into the white starz channel also why are black comedians allowed to poke fun at whites on their stand up acts without suffering any flak from either race yet whites are not allowed to do such things without suffering the consequences of people called racist your thoughts black people are sensitive when a white guy says something specifically about their race they go around and say that that white guy was a racist when a black guy goes around saying things about white guys the white guy can't do anything about it because he in turn would be called a racist my opinion blacks are treating white people unfairly  Racism White (people) Black (people) Hispanic Nigger American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) African American Blackface Minstrel show Multiracial Blacks and Mormonism Black nationalism Colonial mentality History of South Africa in the apartheid era Negro Japanese American internment Anti-Defamation League Reparations for slavery White nationalism Race of Jesus British National Party Validity of human races Passing Creole Cultural Revolution Racism in the United States Black Panther Party Affirmative action O.

are white women threatened by women of other races i'm white but i'm often mistaken for hispanic or told that i look like i'm mixed with another race i have dark brown hair and dark features i take it as a compliment because i think women of other races are usually more attractive than white women i've had people basically tell me that i'm too pretty to be just white it's true that most of the attractive celebs i know of are either non white or look like they're non white i often wonder if the average white woman feels threatened by non white women white men are starting to date asian women more and commonly favor their thinner smaller body types i've heard that in heavily populated asian areas there is a lot of resentment toward asian women by white women latina women are stereotyped as hot and sensual historically when black men dated interracially they dated white women but that's changing i'm not bugged because i don't feel i look like a typical white woman i almost feel like i'm another race how about you p s this is an observation i personally am not threatened by non white women it just seems that some white women are as i have heard them make negative comments about asian women for example people can be and threatened by a race of people for various reasons and it's true that many white men are attracted to asian women because of certain characteristics it's not just shallow men either there are differences among the races and it's not racist to acknowledge that and have preferences i like black men because they tend to be more open and straightforward and i'm just attracted to them doesn't mean i don't like white men or could never be interested in a white man but a lot of white men are threatened by my liking black men i can't even say i find a black man attractive in the presence of a white man don't act like it's not common for people to be threatened by people of another race just look at how many white people are bothered by the growing of latinos welll im not white im white and black and i would nevert want to be just white or be just black cuz i like the way i am no but i hate to say it what u say is kinda true white women are nt seen as exotic in this country theres lots of white people here so no one sees them as special and i just thought about it most of the celebrities that i see as pretty are either mixed with white or non white at all im not being racist just telling the truth as for white women being jealous or feeling threatened uhm i dont know about that  Black (people) Interracial couple Asian fetish Social rule Physical attractiveness Racism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an African American EastEnders Hispanic Avenue Q Joke Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Affirmative action Sexual orientation Sento Race (U.S. Census) Race and intelligence Ranma __ characters Race of Jesus Maison Ikkoku Multiracial Tenchi Muyo!

why do taller people get treated with more respect taller people intimidate the shorter ones i am pretty tall myself but when i am talking to someone taller than me although i don' t want to there is subconscious awareness of their height and presence in an intimidating sort of way i had several difficult bosses over the past years and whenever they would come with idiotic requests i would get up from my chair knowing that i was taller and they would immediately change their attitude it's unfair but it works and if it works for a tall female imagine how much better it works for a tall male  Heightism Milton H.

whats your opinion of iraq and have you been there i always read all this stuff about outside people giving strong opinions and they have never been there to really experience what they are talking about st of all i have been to iraq i spent months their earlier this year i was with a reserve unit in northern iraq which is considered kurdish territory the american people are not getting the true feedback about what is happening over there we have made a lot of progress and pulling our forces out of there would be a complete disaster every day i read the news i hear how many soldiers died they keep track of the number since the start of the war we have more people killed in holiday traffic accidents for the magnitude of the war we have had the least amount of troops killed than in any other was in history the people in iraq are poor and only have about a percent litercy rate this is the result of the type of dictatorship they were under for so many years i had a chance to visit a lot of the villages the people are poor very few material items most houses don't have running water open sewer pits are common about every block electricity is a luxery and those that may have it only have it a couple of hours a day children play in the street and around dangerous areas most roads are not paved sheep herding is common when you travel around its like visiting back in biblical times hygene is almost non existant compared to western standards if we pulled our efforts out in six months it would take billions and billions of dollars and ten to years just to fix the social and economic problems that exist i seen some politicians that visited while i was there these bastards cause more hate inconvenience and uprest than you can imagine they show up unexpected causing soldiers that need the flight to go home or get medical help to delay the army has to pull their troops back and form special protected convoys with all the best armored equipment just to protect these politicians and it causes overall discontent and lowers morale among the troops dod has to bring these politicians over just to try and convince them that what we are doing is critically needed the entire thing is a joke and causing the american taxpayers millions to add insult to injury these politicians bring their own group with them including their spouses at times so they can go on a shopping spur on the way there and back its very sickening and field commanders have to really bite their tongues and put up with it while there folks are there visiting they don't go where the action is and don't visit the children and villages they stay behind the wire inside compounds and take up everyones time and resources catering to their rediculous needs if you want the real scoop on what is happening and what needs done ask the field commanders and troops the spell check on yahoo takes to long so i'm sending as is take care savvy  Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New

of australian teenage girls would have plastic surgery it makes me wonder what we are doing so wrong that our kids think that they need surgery to be beautiful what are your thoughts on kids wanting plastic surgery and how can we solve this obvious problem http www news com au story html jamu ocd maybe lol perhaps great minds think alike we need to seriously address this issue and look at how the media and fitness industry promote this nonsense about ideal body shape more emphasis needs to be on general and natural health and wellbeing and also on personal development so that young people are allowed to build healthy self images that are not simply based on their body image there is more to being beautiful than looking perfect and i think this latest obsession of the media with people like paris hilton and her type has actually been detrimental to the promotion of healthy minds as well as healthy bodies in the young plastic surgery eating disorders and taking drugs like steroids and hormones to control body shape are all part of the social obsession with looks and perfection it might help if these young people were to know more about the problems people have when plastic surgery goes wrong and perhaps they need more advice on the risks and the long term effects of these invasive procedures perhaps a campaign like the anti smoking one might be something to look at it is just so sad  Obesity Cancer Obsessive-compulsive disorder Prostate cancer Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder World Wide Web Drug abuse Puberty Human height Breast implant Breastfeeding Psychotherapy Stomach cancer Psychosurgery Medicine Anorexia nervosa Androgen insensitivity syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Insulin Growth hormone treatment Clinical depression Urinary incontinence Anabolic steroid Baldness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Word of Wisdom Pneumonia Organic farming Eating disorder Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Sigmund Freud Scar Teenage pregnancy Phimosis Nutrition Physical attractiveness Chronic fatigue syndrome Surgery Adolescence Health insurance Legal aspects of transsexualism Psychosis Welding Philosophy of language Anger management Infantilism Transgender Controversies in autism Adjustable gastric band Anxiety Cardiovascular disease Abortion debate Tank Psychology Stroke Bipolar disorder Multiple sclerosis Healthy eating Dissociative identity disorder Sex reassignment surgery Intersex surgery Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Diabetes mellitus Osteoporosis Gender identity disorder Hypnosis Yoko Ono Plastic surgery Dwarfism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sexual attraction Kylie Minogue Organ transplant Blog HTML element Chemotherapy Simone Weil Body image Lung cancer Epilepsy Theory of conduct In vitro fertilisation Oral sex Serial killer Borderline personality disorder Teenage suicide Rave party Gestalt therapy Neurofeedback

why the british people are so uncivilized they are very rude and pretentious always acting to be polite all the times but actually are quite brash intrinsically they make trouble during the football games without considering others they leave the toilet bowl dirty smelly and filthy what happened to the so called civilized society is it because of lack of education well the majority of graduate students at oxford or cambridge are foreigners and the trends will be the same for undergraduates as well and the television is full of crap british shows and their music is just shitty that they have to imports loads of american shows and performers to their concerts and events from many of the replies here they do make a point affirming the statements most british people are great they're just like everyone else though they have lots of idiots to go along with the nice ones the idiots are the ones that tend to get out there into the world holidays in spain and poland football matches in europe and make fools of themselves lots of them for example are taking advantage of very cheap flights to poland in order to get completely drunk on good cheap beer and these people come here and make a very bad impression on the poles because they are loud and stupid but many poles do not take into consideration all the invisible english here that don't bother anybody the english also have this tendency to lose their inhibitions when they are abroad but believe me most of the english and i correct myself to say english because i don't really think you would include the scottish for example in this group would you are very nice and quite embarassed when their fellow countrymen act up and about british music dude i'm american and i have to honestly say that they've always had one up on us in the music department  Shit Theory of conduct Lawyer Russian joke Graduate school Norway national football team Craps Hiberno-English English language College Anti-intellectualism The Jim Rome Show England national football team Affirmative action Jackass: The Movie Newcastle United F.C.

are either gender being conditioned to be the way they are i've noticed that every study about men or women have said things like men are conditioned to do this women are conditioned to do that is that true an if so how can get unconditioned if parents teaches a boy that the man of the house is the ruling body he'll expect it to be that way when he marries guess what he'll be sure in for a shocker when his wife tells him to get off his butt and clean the house the same is true if a woman is taught to be subserviant to a man she will find it hard to think for herself experience and education is the best way to uncondition someone  Masculism Bisexuality Economic inequality Androgen insensitivity syndrome A Course In Miracles Infantilism Transsexuality Sexual orientation Domestic violence Women in Islam Little Britain 3rd Rock from the Sun Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet God and gender History of sex Opus Dei The Inside Christian views of women Marriage Venom (comics) Woman Gender role Episodes of Lost (Season 1) John Money Mixed martial arts One Power Patriarchy Man Bah__'__ Faith and gender equality Volleyball Anorexia nervosa Reinhold Niebuhr Book of Mormon Sento Human Catechism Social rule Unconditional Love Crazy Horse Clergy Women in the Victorian era EastEnders Sexual abstinence Christian view of marriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an UCAS Clerical celibacy Wichita State University Strap-on dildo Hip hop collaborations Twin French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Jane Eyre Gender identity One Tree Hill (TV series) Phoebe Buffay's songs Calvinism Divorce Eric Cartman Sex assignment Unconditional election Magic (Discworld) Victor Cousin God Emperor of Dune Toilet Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith The Fourth Way Homosexuality and Christianity Biology and sexual orientation Discordianism Miss Saigon Macbeth Adam and Eve Gender of rearing Predestination Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Patsy Mink Theory of conduct Bill Cosby Anal masturbation Soul Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Changeroom Eastern Orthodox Church Jennifer Lopez Ex-gay Bulgarian language Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Incarnations of Immortality George Costanza Simone Weil Scouting William M.

will there ever be a time when we can walk down our streets and feel secure hahaha no i am not a ghetto child lol i live in a good area but i don't feel comfortable even walking down my own street there was a time and it wasn't long ago that few in the us felt the need to lock their doors and kids were able to run all over without fear of somebody snatching them what changed is too much law and the loss of some key elements of core us society the war on drugs was a war against the us people and it turned cops into the bad guys not that they really needed much help in that area since the late s law enforcement in the us had become increasingly brutal and repressive against the poor until the s it was also often repressive against various ethnic religious and other societal groups today they just pick on the poor this produces a backlash that is exibited in many ways class tension increased violence and crime and most of all a loss of respect for the law the mph speed limit completely elimanated any respect the us public had for the law corruption from top to bottom has been the norm in us politics and it's become more and more open clinton literally sold us technology to china in what amounted too an open bribe bush's crowd is getting quite rich off the war in iraq nothing to do with oil the gov contracts and the way they are parceled has been a bonanza for bush's cronies gore got caught red handed taking bribes from the chinese and scooter libby should have been tried for influence buying not lieing under oath nixon reagon carter all cabinets full of corruption scandal nixon was unseated by the watergate scandal reagon and bush sr nearly undone by contra gate and a few other scandals hilary got busted with fbi files on personal enemies of the clintons what bigger abuse of power could there be nobody has faith in our institutions any more and for good reason the cops are frequently busted in theft rings or worse the politicians are openly corrupt and might as well paint a dollar sign on their face the courts could care less about guilt and innocence and dispense gross injustice more often than they get the right guy people go to prison for life for having bags of pot but a guy molests children and gets probation with a system like that how can you respect it once there's no respect then why abide by the laws if your going to get blamed for something or another why not at least do some crime somebody once said the only true law is one that leads to freedom and they were absolutely correct there are too many laws too many cops too many crimes and too much gov in everybodies biz when left alone most people are decent folk given a chance to make something of thier lives and a good environment they will ethnic centric ghettos breed crime and distrust of other ethnic groups many groups in the us have come to reject the american values that is they do not subscribe to the strong work ethic and value of education that is core to the american values they don't subscribe to the traditional american live and let live system they want to ban everything force people to live like they live there is little tolerance today if you are different at all you are attacked for those differences that's not the american way the melting pot has been our ideal sure america's never been perfect about it and has it's shameful periods when one group or another was mistreated overall though america has led the world in tolerance and spread it across the globe to all who'd listen another huge problem is we look at each other and we don't see americans we see skin color religion political party affiliation and a host of other dividing factors we are smokers or non smokers we drink or don't drink even the type of music we listen too can create divides when those happen we don't look out for our fellow american because they are not one of us any more they are x group outsiders if they are not one of ours then we don't feel responisble so people don't help when something bad happens they drive on by they close the curtains and look the other way sometimes they might even join in the riots in watts were a great example not only was anybody not black targeted despite people from all ethnic and social groups down at the police station protesting each of the affected groups rarely tried to help each other hispanics looked after fellow hispanics asians looked after asians by doing so it left these groups divided and outnumbered in the area of the riots few blacks came forward to help people of other ethnic groups somehow we ceased being americans and have splintered into a thousand different groups another factor is the huge number of ex cons produced by the war on america the us has imprisoned people like no other nation in history and the prison culture has invaded the mainstream you hear it in rapp lyrics country songs even in other music genres people live out in the world like they were still in prison there the rules are very different and much more violent the lack of rehabilitation and the large concentration of ex cons in poverty stricken areas just assures an endless cycle the last factor is so few people are armed and or willing to use force today recently two unarmed criminals forced their way into a doctor's home think about that a moment they were so assured that the victims would be unarmed that they brazenly entered these people's homes without a weapon themselves all it'd taken was a single gun crossbow or other ranged lethal weapon on the vt campus and the first time the shooter reloaded he'd never lived to kill more students this dependancy upon others to protect us puts us at risk and invites the predatory elements in our society it's like leaving your keys in your car people walk by and are tempted by the vulnerability people that wouldn't normally think about stealing a car the lack of self sufficiency in america has invited violence upon ourselves there is no fear those who wish to do evil fear only the inefficient cops who might or might not catch up to them look at how many unsolved crimes there are every year and look at how many people have been freed of wrongful convictions by dna evidence i'd say at least a fifth of those in prison are doing time for a crime they didn't commit that means for every one who's innocent in there there is somebody who got away with that crime and probably out doing another one there's no fear career criminals have a career because they can get away with crime times out of there couldn't be many career criminals if they got caught with any frequency so people who do not watch out for each other people who are incapable or unwilling to put themselves in danger to help a stranger and the mess our legal system has become combined with socio economic and cultural struggles has created a society on the brink there won't be any safe neighborhoods soon even in the best neighborhoods people are afraid to let their children run around any more there is no safe place and we may start to resemble latin america where the wealthy live in fortresses and the rest live in crime and poverty to change it we need imediate reform at the top toss both corrupt lieing parties out the door reforms in law enforcement and justice are desperately needed we need to see each other as americans first and forget the other things the sub cultures need to adopt american core values that is value on education pride in being american being american first then whatever else as a very distant second respect for the law at least once the laws are respectable again a strong work ethic anti corruption a common language and other things that tie us together that bridge what religion we might practice race how much money we have or any of the other things that divide us now i'm not holding my breath the worse the economy is the worse crime gets and the economy is on the brink of collapse i see the divides deepening i see few people who are not something american any more many who drop the american completely and think of themselves only as something else we have enough enemies outside our borders yet we are our own worst

does anyone know about the armenian forehead coins does anyone know the story history behind the armenian girls' costume headpiece coins across the forehead i've heard that it had something to do with the family's wealth but then again it could just be for decoration basically does anyone know why the armenian costume for girls sometimes has a bunch of coins going across the forehead thanks there is a rich tradition related to how our ancestors dressed the armenian clothes costumes and styles have been complimented by a rich cultural tradition forehead has a very important meaning in armenian culture language and life i am going to give you few examples we armenians have the word which says written on forehead for destiny when couples are getting married they join they foreheads in the church while the priest does the ceremony very lovely act which means they are joining each others souls and thoughts and they have to share whatever they have in their mind before anything else when someone is acting very bad and not proper there is this saying which means that person s forehead is torn and has no shame ok with that i explained the importance of the meaning of the forehead in armenians life of course there are more stories said about it but i will answer your q now in most armenian regions old and new also armenians in iran this was a very important first to show how wealthy that woman is meaning if the coins were gold they were from richer family silver from less rich family and so forth the quantity too it was also ornaments to make them beautiful like we use jewelry these days and they would display it on their forehead because it was the representative of their second heart soul and the most visible place on body  Clothing Armenians Armenia Jewellery Money Funeral Roman Catholic Church Ayyavazhi mythology Filigree Pysanka Marriage Han Chinese clothing Culture of Africa Totem pole Armenian language Nagorno-Karabakh Kemal Atat__rk Fiddler on the Roof Kimono Jennifer Lopez Miss Saigon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Art in Ancient Greece Papal Tiara Summa Theologiae Physical attractiveness Eastern Orthodox Church Wealth Actor Soul Family name Culture of Korea Japanese tea ceremony Scythia Eid ul-Fitr Aztec Caucasian Albania History of Armenia Silver Shinto Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Past teachings of Prem Rawat Socrates Mass (liturgy) Greco-Buddhist art Jon Secada Hinduism Religious Society of Friends Achaemenid dynasty Belly dance Meaning of life Kilt Iyer Hijab Confucius Chinese in Singapore Medieval literature Haven (TNG episode) Bar-Hebraeus Anthony the Great Polygamy Book of Isaiah Assyrian people Halloween Diwali Repentance Human Animism Christian liturgy Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Headgear Aka (tribe) Southeast Asia Indo-European languages Silk Road Tea Pedophilia Comanche Sari Day of the Dead Cross-dressing Confucianism Economic inequality William Saroyan A Course In Miracles Carnival Gesture Maneki Neko Funeral of Pope John Paul II Muslim ibn Aqeel Mojave people Mor lam Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Catechism Drag (clothing) Abgarus of Edessa Modernism Superhero Pontius Pilate

if you are asian did you find your parents to be stricter and harsher than other parents or do you know any asian kids whose parents were total dictators i was reading a message board devoted to disgruntled asian children whose parents were totally abusive and apparently it's common just wondering your thoughts excuse me timatcrosby but just who the hell are you asking you a smutty question i can only assume you came across a question you didn't agree with as nobody specifically asked you a smutty question if you don't like all the material presented to you then i suggest you move on i'm not about to be lectured or censored or made self conscious by some faceless person named timcrosby basically what this means is you are are delusional and you need to stop following me some parents are abusive but its not always because of grades it could be something like not listening to what they tell you to study or something worse and they still wanna beat you up this is mostly from asian fathers though some asian people i now say their fathers are very abusive  Sant Thakar Singh Infantilism Milton H.

this is a little controversial but i'm going to ask anyway racisim do people find that in the media if a white person says something racist they are repremanded and shuned which is rightly so i'm completly against any form of discrimanation but if a non white person of any other race say's somthing racist against a white person they are no repremanded to the same extent i would love to hear opinions from everyone thanks i agree people are warped now into being hyper sensitive about a whtie person's racial outlook but they turn their heads when it comes to a minority's racial outlook not fair not right and something should be done about it and it should be televised on a reputable show like minutes oprah etc as for comics since dave chappelle and carlos mencia are equal opportunity offenders and it's soooo funny then the green light should be given to all comics to make fun of different groups of people regardless of the comic's own race however there is a condition both carlos mencia and dave chappelle make fun of everyone but it's well understood that they themselves are not being racist they are pretty much making fun of racism and stereotypes altogether any comic who wants to do that should be clear that they're not being personal when it comes to racial humor but that it's to make fun of racism and stereotypes altogether i personally don't believe for one moment that mencia or chappelle are racists because they married outside of their race and have children with their wives mencia's wife is caucasian chappelle's wife is asian they even say that all this racism is ridiculous hell they even make fun of their own race and it's hilarious bottom line i agree with what you're saying  Chappelle's Show Racism White trash Nigger Dave Chappelle Minstrel show Our Gang Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn Asian fetish White (people) Joke Married... with Children Black (people) Race Media and ethnicity Scientific racism Blackface Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Racial segregation Ethnic issues in Japan Validity of human races Skinhead Race and intelligence Arab-Israeli conflict Sarah Silverman British National Party The Fairly OddParents Humour White supremacy Indian American Anti-racism Comedy Central Bertrand Russell I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Deadpan Racialism Nadir of American race relations White Australia policy Multiracial Sketch comedy Caucasian race Peter Pan Little Britain Affirmative action Late Night with Conan O'Brien Fictional character Porgy and Bess The Simpsons SpongeBob SquarePants New anti-Semitism Model minority Eddie Murphy Anti-Defamation League Blacks and Mormonism Bob and George Mem__n Pingu__n Racism in the United States Whose Line Is It Anyway?

going greek i have read a lot of different takes on the greek system in colleges some for and some against do you as a person think that 'going greek' in college makes a difference in a person do you think that they are for the good or for the bad of the campus and community do you think that the type of organization you pledge matters cultural or social of course the organization of your pledge matters also you have to decide whether you are going to go greek with a chartered chapter some get kicked out of campus but remain a house by name only also remember that when you go greek you will be told who you can and cannot affiliate with outside of your house usually you are without doubt not allowed to go to other parties unless they are of the opposite sex house parties meaning you cannot go to other frat parties if you're a guy but can go to any sorority house and vice versa and the big thing is whether or not you want to risk all those years with people you end up not actually liking if you go greek too soon you will be pigeonholed with you can can and cannot befriend and if it doesn't work out that's it your social life is down the tubes you can become friends with a greek house and live under all the perks of the parties and private events without actually pledging my friends called me the sweetheart meaning i didn't date any of the boys but they were all my friends and protectors but they weren't really a big frat on campus more like a social club i went to all the formals and date parties and private house parties i had friends in sororities but they needed people like me to help them meet guys in frats the frats don't really care about sororities and the sorority girls don't really care about each other by the end of years you'll notice that many sorority girls spend little to no time with each other or their house cultural or social greek does not matter still the same feel unless you join something like phi delta phi the co ed law frat they don't do hazing or anything like that just hang and pay dues frats and sororities frats esp have bad reps amongst communities sometimes with good reason  University of Alabama Hazing Alpha Phi Night of the Creeps Carnegie Mellon University Alpha Phi Omega Trinity College (Connecticut) St. Elmo's Fire (film) Case Western Reserve University Franklin and Marshall College Paddle (spanking) Social rule Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Towson University Theory of conduct National Lampoon's Animal House Hamilton College Brown University Rice University Pan Sophic Pitaten Marriage Phi Delta Theta Swarthmore College Southwestern University Avenue Q Freed-Hardeman University Kettering University The George Washington University Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc.

so we're not allowed to embrace our culture now why do most people try to push americanism on people don't get me wrong i support this country and agree with most of the laws and some choices we make but it seems like everywhere i turn we are trying to make people conform to one culture i don't agree with this i don't mind separate cultures i love my hbcus historically black colleges and universities i love my divine nine historically black sororities and frats i love kwanzaa i love juneteenth i agree that no race is better than another but why do races have to give up our culture to be labeled non racist why do i have to give up the legacy made for me to be considered non racist why can't we have unity without conformity janelle b but you bothered to answer always right wow you're an idiot robert shelton so honored you came to troll my board i must be really striking a nerve with the kkk to render your presence gives self a pat on the back delta apparently people do because if you haven't noticed there are tons of posts about hbcus and bet and the naacp and other things bashing them so you do care more than you know iamtheparty once again ignorance there are no blacks only schools every hbcu lets in all races the college fund is privately owned and therefore can do whatever it wants ever heard of catholic college funds and schools and kwanzaa and juneteenth can be celebrated by all races my aunt who is white celebrates both you really need to read once and a while diddy is a perfect example why do i have to go to africa to embrace my culture this is america i have freedom of speech so sucks to be you doesn't it that's a good question i believe that white people and black people alike are asking the same questions you're lucky that you are allowed to embrace more of your culture if a white person were to embrace the fact that they are caucasian they are considered racist it's hard to find someone who will say white pride you know i believe that the only way to rectify this is for people to recognize that there are very different cultures within the us and none are superior even by majority we should embrace our differences and learn from each other but instead we bicker and b tch the us is the melting pot what do you expect but some people are intolerant of this and seem to think that one race needs to conform to another in order for total acceptance  Black (people) White (people) African American Nation of Islam Racism Poker jargon Avenue Q African American culture Liberalism Democracy Fraternities and sororities Arab-Israeli conflict A Course In Miracles Free will Original sin White supremacy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Afrocentrism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nadir of American race relations The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Separation of church and state Kwanzaa Rastafari movement Historically Black colleges and universities Plame affair White nationalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sexual orientation Racial segregation Evil Fundamentalism Rosa Parks Melting pot Kasparov versus The World Theodicy Social rule Charles Grandison Finney Royal Assent Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Biblical inerrancy Eastern Orthodox Church Brown v.

is bdsm a valid form of sexuality i've done my research clear back to victorian scientists and i still can't decide if it's a sexuality like homo or heretrosexuality or if it's just kink or if it is an iteration of the natural order of things ie dominant male and submissive female as it is in the majority of bdsm relationships or if it is just a way for chauvenists to get their jollies in a mariginally accepted way what do you think and no jack ss answers please giggles thanks for all the answers everyone i'm no closer to deciding what bdsm actually is in terms of catagorization but you've given me food for thought in my experience in the bdsm world i have found that men are more often dominant in the pro bdsm world however there is a vast majority of women who are dominant and yes these are the professionals of whom someone spoke thanks again everyone i believe that it is just as valid a choice for me my slavery was a calling as any other sexuality or lifestyle i define myself as a slave and i live as one inside or outside of the bedroom whether i have a partner or not to me it is not a kink or even a choice i just am this does not mean that i am unable to make my own decisions i am highly independent broadly educated and very intelligent nor that i am unable to stand up for myself i am the strongest person i know i am also very able and willing to say no or pick faults in a situation slaving if i submit to a partner is undertaken with my full consent and full understanding in broader society i expect to be treated with the same courtesy and respect as any other person who lives according to their different truth homosexuality for example and do not fail to command it i also do not slant others for their beliefs if something that i personally disagree with makes someone happy as long as they don't try to push their ideas onto me then so be it each to their own cheers  Domination & submission (BDSM) BDSM Polyamory Sexual orientation Infantilism Bondage (BDSM) Human sexual behavior Human Homophobia Zoophilia Sadism and masochism Theory of conduct Bisexuality Goodness and value theory Human sexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage Age of consent Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Simone Weil Homosexuality Objectivist philosophy Female dominance Contract Religious Society of Friends Divorce Homosexuality and transgender Kink Child sexual abuse Scientific method Asperger syndrome Deconstruction Sexual abstinence Sexual intercourse Lawrence v.

do filipinos have a national identity while looking through the chapters of my history i see no trace of culture thats distinctly filipino do we filipinos have an identity that could identify us a race well there's the indigenous culture and the colonial culture they're all mixed up they say the true filipino is based on the indigenous heritage there are at least a hundred indigenous tribes in the philippines maranao maguindanao igorot tagalog visayan etc some say the true filipino race is malay but the first filipinos aborigines were aetas pygmies however when the spanish and americans colonized the philippines they changed the cultural and political institutions so that they introduced the american public school system and spanish catholicism many filipinos have an identity crisis in that they cannot appreciate their indigenous heritage because the colonists spain and america taught them that their original culture was inferior to western culture but if you examine original filipino culture and tradition their art and music and food and religion and values of respect for nature and god and people and objects and overall what they value as good and moral you find that their filipino culture is very rich and beautiful  Philippines Demographics of the Philippines Ethnic groups of the Philippines Filipino people Black (people) Filipino American Mestizo Chinese Filipino Languages of the Philippines Music of the Philippines Hinduism in the Philippines Filipino language Colonial mentality Indigenous peoples Southeast Asia Philippine-American War Spanish in the Philippines Religion in the Philippines Hispanic Culture of the Philippines Creole Bukidnon History of the Philippines Manila Tagalog language Indigenous peoples of the Americas Hispanic culture in the Philippines Spain Bisaya Eskrima Filipino Muslim Culture Latin America Literature of the Philippines South America Ateneo de Manila University Philippine peso Benguet Pinoy rock European colonization of the Americas Military history of the Philippines Mexico Portuguese Creole Spanish colonization of the Americas Family name Spanish Creole Nationalism Cebu Philippine Revolution Agusan del Sur Iglesia ni Cristo Hindu Hawaii Colony Malaysia Multiracial Black Legend Latin American music Sociocultural evolution Conservatism Native Americans in the United States Philippine mythology Mindanao Ilokano language Africa Negrito History of Mexico Languages of Hong Kong Genocides in history Canadian nationalism Visayan languages Population history of American indigenous peoples History of the Spanish language White (people) Cuisine of the Philippines Multilingual Colonisation Taiwanese aborigines Mission (Christian) Indigenous peoples in Brazil Culture of the United States Native American name controversy Laguna province M__ori Bosniaks Philippine Independent Church Christianity in Korea Anthropology History of the United States (1865-1918) Coloured Mount Pinatubo Colonial America Patriotism North Africa Slavic peoples

asian women only please i quote the discussion with regard to the reason why asian women prefer dating white men some dude on y answer said the reason why asian women date white men is because of their low self esteem by dating white men which whom they consider superior they feel that they have accomplished something big in life and it makes them feel better about themselves i guest it's their ideal of thriving their are people with that mentality in every race but asian women seem to have a the highest percentage in my opinion people who love themselves and are proud of their heritage don't need white men to make them feel that they are really worth something also this mentality is common during the first few years in anyone who immigrates to the united states but again it appears that asian women never get over such mentality so asian women what is your take on this well said good point i agreed with this guy  White (people) Sexual orientation Interracial couple Humphrey Bogart Self-esteem Objectivist philosophy Theory of conduct Affirmative action The Apprentice 2 Friends Abortion debate Colonial mentality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Racism Social rule Socrates Patriotism Transgender Friedrich Schleiermacher Intelligence quotient Demographics of the United States Asian fetish Physical attractiveness Mojave people Democracy Generation X Transcontinental nation Pedophilia Asian American Love Turing test The Fountainhead Transsexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Kyle Broflovski Scientology beliefs and practices Jon Secada U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle African American Equal Protection Clause Aesthetic Realism 2005 United States Grand Prix Courtship Human sexual behavior Microeconomics Simone Weil Evil Homophobia Arthur Schopenhauer White supremacy Self-harm Transactional analysis Infantilism Mick Foley Utilitarianism Bosniaks Moral Politics Abortion Derek Parfit Peru Polyamory Love-shyness Baldness Church of Christ Rain Man Bertrand Russell Hispanic The nature of God in Western theology Internet fraud Iago Bish__jo game Philipp Melanchthon Goodness and value theory Race (U.S. Census) Extras (sitcom) Ruth Bader Ginsburg Economic inequality Prostate cancer Double standard Asian financial crisis Mental retardation Philosophy of language Duties of the Heart The Merchant of Venice Gospel of Thomas A Course In Miracles Strap-on dildo History of British nationality law Opus Dei Same-sex marriage in Canada Ethnic issues in Japan Laura Schlessinger Puerto Rican The Big Lebowski Jennifer Lopez Nation of Islam Little Britain

what do german people think of the jewish community today this is my perspective as a jew with german friends and business associates it depends on the age of the germans despite intensive education efforts by the german government young people years generally do not seem to understand the significance of the holocaust it seems that for these germans who have jewish acquaintances they do not understand why the holocaust came about in the first place for germans in their s the issue is quite different when i travelled through germany right after sep older germans who recognized my name as jewish seemed to be suffering a pain from an unanswered question namely what were my parents doing during the third reich there is no question in my mind that the lessons learned at great cost during and after the holocaust were soon forgotten for example the german nation stayed largely silent on iraq and what saddam hussein a hitler admirer did until it became fashionable in germany to criticize pres bush and the united states for coming to the aid of the iraqi people unfortunately germany chose to be awol when its participation really would have mattered from time to time i am asked by germans for my opinion on what caused the holocaust and how i view german jewish relations my own view is that many people made many mistakes and that if we all had it to do over again then the holocaust would not reoccur on a personal scale germans have been very cordial to me my view is that all of us need to move on and to remain respectful of all victims of that horrible period for these reasons i recommend for your reading richard w sonnenfeldt witness to nurenberg c also available in german as mehr als ein leben c  The Holocaust Adolf Eichmann Plame affair Holocaust denial Nazism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Andreas Hillgruber Appeasement Propaganda Martin Heidegger Paul von Hindenburg Voter turnout Mein Kampf Jew History of the Jews in the United States Anschluss Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust Iraq disarmament crisis Iraq War Max Planck Kristallnacht Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq David Irving Adolf Hitler Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Who is a Jew?

should i be discouraged or offended my ancestry is mixed african american and native american the term griffe describes a person with mixed negro and indian ancestry if someone calls me that should i be offended also i consider myself a black indian because of my dual ancestry and i acknowledge both parts should i be discouraged by african americans who think that i should just focus on black heritage alone and think it traitorous to focus on another should i be offended by the opinions of american indians who are narrow minded and think that there is no such thing as black indians and think that i am a wannabe please no silly or disrespecful answers i'm in the middle of a culture shock if you study much history you find that many times when a group of people become a minority that many people in the majority dislike or view as lesser that members of that minority are very strict in their estimation of who deserves to belong to that group for example i know some gay and lesbian folks who deride and call bi sexual folks bad names because they don't like it when someone can keep keep a foot in either camp so to speak and there are indians who are the same way somehow i'm mixed blood too it's apparently our fault for being born and not wanting to scorn half our heritage for the other half or for being happy that we are who we are not one thing or another just the descendants of people who weren't willing to let race change their decisions on who to love or have sex with you know it's said in some tribes that have a large number of folks with a percentage of non indian blood but the tribe still has a strong identity that when the first mixed race babies were born many in the tribe were for killing the infants of course it never happened because no one wanted to do the deed and those infants became treasured members of the tribe celebrate who you are and be grateful for all those ancestors who were smart enough to look past race when they looked at their beloveds and remember that most people don't think you're a traitor for being respectful to everyone who made you what you are just a vocal self righteous minority because mixed blood folks of every racial description really are the future  Black (people) African American Sexual orientation White (people) Hispanic Multiracial Palestinian Afro-Latin American Creole Mestizo Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Race and intelligence Chinese Filipino Africa Abortion debate Voodoo One-drop theory Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Blood purity (Harry Potter) Zambo Gay Ethnic groups of the Philippines Music genre Marriage Indigenous peoples of the Americas Demographics of the Philippines Cherokee Pashtun Genealogical DNA test Affirmative action Indigenous peoples Native Americans in the United States African American literature Franz Boas Bisexuality Human sexual behavior Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Southern United States Caucasian race Demographics of Brazil Gay slang Arab Afro-Mexican Blacks and Mormonism Coloured Music history of the United States Gender role Shaggy dog story Child sexual abuse Race Ethnic group Theory of conduct Little Britain Western United States Equal Protection Clause Circumcision Louisiana Past teachings of Prem Rawat Curse and mark of Cain Anglican views of homosexuality Homophobia Massachusetts Afrikaner Tamriel Ex-gay Autism rights movement South America Ward Churchill Alan Campbell (pastor) Indian Wars Magyars Religion and sexual orientation Lamanite Wang Mang Gay rights Race (U.S. Census) Portuguese Creole Mu'allaqat Hip hop music Black nationalism Reparative therapy Bosniaks Homosexuality Creationism Internet troll Transgender A Course In Miracles Multiculturalism Asian American Childlove movement Delaware Infantilism Greeks Friends White nationalism Pedophilia

albino's the ancestor of white people maybe read first from the national organization for albinism and hypopigmentation the word albinism refers to a group of inherited conditions people with albinism have little or no pigment in their eyes skin or hair they have inherited genes that do not make the usual amounts of a pigment called melanin a common myth is that by definition people with albinism have red eyes in fact there are different types of albinism and the amount of pigment in the eyes varies although some individuals with albinism have reddish or violet eyes most have blue eyes some have hazel or brown eyes while most people with albinism have very light skin and hair not all do oculocutaneous pronounced ock you low kew tain ee us albinism involves the eyes hair and skin ocular albinism involves primarily the eyes while skin and hair may appear similar or slightly lighter than that of other family members continued from the noah website over the years researchers have used various systems for classifying oculocutaneous albinism in general these systems contrasted types of albinism having almost no pigmentation with types having slight pigmentation in less pigmented types of albinism hair and skin are cream colored and vision is often in the range of in types with slight pigmentation hair appears more yellow or red tinged and vision often corrects to early descriptions of albinism called these main categories of albinism complete and incomplete albinism in the united states people with albinism live normal life spans and have the same types of general medical problems as the rest of the population the lives of people with hernansky pudlak syndrome can be shortened by lung disease or other problems in tropical countries those who do not use skin protection may develop life threatening skin cancers that is true that all races can be albino including white people the website says there are various degrees of albinism from no melanin production to some melanin production its recessive but so is white skin if a white person marries a black person the skin is usally dark unless the black person has white ancestry where else could white skin have originated isn't the answer right here in front of us asians can be albino as well they have the capacity to develop white skin as do africans i dont know it just seems interesting where else did blonde hair and blue eyes come from i'm just analyzing i did say maybe it seems like it could be true though and that the darker skinned whites of the mediterranean and iberian peninsula have black ancestry after all the north african moors did invade in ad and stayed for several hundred years just thinking about the possiblity robert shelton probably works at yahoo spookyjimjams did you read my post first and have you read on the subject of albinism this is on the noah website i am just using context clues here me myself i when you do your own research then maybe you can call me stupid but how do you explain white skin and blonde hair black people can be born with white skin blonde hair and blue eyes its called albinism just because you are content with your public school education does not mean that there is more to the story of humanity than was placed in your government backed history book i don't even know why you are calling me racist did i even say anything that was racist does me asking questions make me a racist if you don't like my question then keep it moving i'm not the only person who thinks this alot of people support this theory you are such a dumb sellout you are acting like a guard dog for your master blindly loving your master even so you can eat his table scraps still on the plantation i see so i guess the national website for albinism is not enough how much research do i have to come with its yahoo answers not the nobel prize full of people's dumb questions how many people quote sources for their claims about black people leon what is up with your

why do people get mad when people from other countries speak their language to each other i have known people to get mad because they feel uncomfortable with the situation and excluded i have experienced a number of incidents where people did not know i had comprehension of their language i e korean german spanish my family is multi ethnic and they engaged in rather rude comments about me or others present i generally respond with a pleasant greeting in their tongue or a word to the wise that i understood their conversation and if others are present i will even go so far as to translate only if it does not offend my overall intention is just to let the speakers know that their language may also be appreciated by others even if we are not of the same race or culture it can be especially uncomfortable if you are aware that the people speaking another language also speak your language english i'll assume i think being bi lingual or multi lingual is a gift but there are also courtesies that should be observed for the considerations of others  Chinese language German language Dialect Urdu French people Occitan language Standard Cantonese Cultural relativism Russian language Esperanto as an international language English language Glossolalia Taiwanese (linguistics) Chinese spoken language Multilingual Social rule T-V distinction Languages in the United States Gender-neutral language Hindi Arab Basque language Germans Finnish language Internet troll Korean language Etiquette Second language acquisition England Ethnic issues in Japan Nationalism Autism Non-native pronunciations of English Standard Mandarin Jew Vietnamese language Koan Autism rights movement Indonesian language French language Semitic Swedish language Deaf culture Moldovan language Spanish in the Philippines Dutch language Slovak language Socrates Catalonia Languages of Hong Kong Stuttering Phoneme Malay people Greek language Arabic language Profanity Mutually intelligible languages Neuro-linguistic programming International English Novel Polish language Asperger syndrome Hungarian language Languages of the Philippines Scientology beliefs and practices Quechua language Creole Latin Vowel White (people) Esperanto Ethnic groups of the Philippines Cornish people Wolof language Australian English Portuguese language Infantilism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Japanese language Spanish Creole Black (people) Portuguese Creole Ido People's Republic of China Translation Morse Code Singlish Ethnic group History of the English Bible Irony J__rriais Pashtun Swedish people Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Theodor Adorno Indian English Hangul Basque people

to all vietnamese do you find it offending that parts of the u s hang the communist flag of vietnam well my junior high had a variety of flags hanging from the ceiling in the cafeteria and they had hung the vietnamese communist flag a few other vietnamese students and i complained to the principal and they just completely took it down and replaced it with another flag of another country we tried discussing it with the school staff but they would refuse to listen and change the subject is it just a few of us or do most of the vietnamese vietnamese americans get bothered by the communist flag because i sure do oh and scroll down to the bottom of this page guess what the vietnam yahoo page uses an icon of none other than the communist flag well there are only two flags of vietnam the communist the one with the red field and yellow star in the middle the original the one with the yellow field and three red horizontal stripes in the middle eh i was born in america so i don't really know that much i just find it offending that they still use it you can tell your vietnamese classmates that they re misinformed and ignorant of their own culture from what you ve described the flag that was hanging from the ceiling of your cafeteria is the vietnam country flag and not the communist flag the communist flag has a yellow hammer sickle moon of yellow stars at the top corner closest to the flagpole on a red background the vietnam country flag has a yellow star on a red background the vietnam country flag originates from the north vietnam flag during the separation of north and south vietnam between and the north vietnam flag was a red top half blue bottom half with a yellow star in the middle when vietnam was reunited the blue bottom half was replaced with a complete red background with a yellow star in the middle many have a misconception of relating the red and yellow colors of the vietnam flag to communism most non asians don t realize that red and yellow are positive colors of strength luck or good fortune in asian cultures this is why the flags of both china and vietnam have red backgrounds and yellow foregrounds such colors also represent communism but for slightly different reasons a communist flag is represented in vietnam by flying at the same height side by side with the vietnam country flag which represents communism as being just as important as country this was widely seen in north vietnam until last year but rarely seen in south vietnam except on government buildings now you will be hard pressed to find a communist flag flying anywhere in vietnam except on government buildings what does that tell you something you can tell your vietnamese classmates is their parent s grudge against the vietnamese government or communism in vietnam is not your classmate s grudge your vietnamese classmates don t realize that they are in a position to build a bridge of friendship between two former enemies for them to continue their ignorance would be foolish your classmates are fortunate to live in a country that allows them free access to information allowing them to discover the truth about modern vietnam themselves instead of the decades old information that their parents are telling them  Colours, standards and guidons Flag Flag of India Flag of the Republic of China Flag of the United States Flag of South Africa Flag of Hong Kong Flag of the People's Republic of China Flag of Belarus Flag of the Republic of Vietnam Royal Standard Southeast Asia Vietnam EIA-708 South Vietnam Lynbrook High School Flag of Denmark Maritime flags Color Bubble Bobble Pikmin Hangul Asian American The Amazing Race Rainbow flag Houston Astros Chinese character Democracy Heraldry Flag of Iraq Formula One regulations Sento Racing flags Logo Volleyball Flags of the Confederate States of America Yellow Poker jargon Flag terminology Beatmania IIDX National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam Wrigley Field PNG Union Jack Buckingham Palace Xiangqi Bosniaks Flag of the Netherlands Columbine High School massacre Yu-Gi-Oh!

why do so many people make excuses for all of the problems that the black community has as frederick douglass said in what i ask for the negro is not benevolence not pity not sympathy but simply justice the american people have always been anxious to know what they shall do with us i have had but one answer from the beginning do nothing with us your doing with us has already played the mischief with us do nothing with us if the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength if they are worm eaten at the core if they are early ripe and disposed to fall let them fall and if the negro cannot stand on his own legs let him fall also all i ask is give him a chance to stand on his own legs let him alone y our interference is doing him positive injury http www allheadlinenews com articles making excuses for problems doesn't make the problems go a way because they are so dependent on people to always help them and the people that dont help them they blame those people for not helping example welfare the government helps them because they're poor and supposedly can't work or find work a lot of blacks dont want to help themselves they always feel like they are owed something by everybody i saw a question on here the other day that had the answer that black people do not have education because of the white people but it's like how long ago did the whites tell blacks that no you can't go to school also a lot of whites dont want to deny blacks help because the first second they say no we're not helping you they cry you're racist like a big baby why do so many people make excuses because the blacks will always make you seem like the bad person for not helping them when they wont even help themselves  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Negro Booker T.

equal but different is segregation morally wrong if under the law all races are equal do people also not have the right to segregate their child's education based on race we already do this for people with money or different religions why would it be morally wrong to segregate based on race if it protects our children from gang violence you make a good point that we already segregate education based on other attributes such as religion it seem hypocritical that voluntary racial segregate institutions are not permitted to exist for white people i think the problem lies beyond the strictly concrete and towards to the abstract the many shades of grey that exist within our society are what protect us from falling prey to to something worse that is why an all white school which would not allow other races would indeed be racist while an all jewish school would not be racist one has to look upon the history of the situation  Racial segregation American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Israeli Arab Equal Protection Clause Affirmative action Brown v.

why are chinese people better than everyone else at math there is a recent study by milner which examined this question children whose first language is chinese have an advantage in math because of the way their numerical language is structured example the number eleven english speaking childing would have to learn a new number coinciding with a whole new term in essence a whole new language the same goes for twelve and thirteen and so on but in chinese their language term for the number would be translated into english as ten plus one so chinese people do not have to learn a whole new term such as eleven instead they can operationalize upon old terms they have already learned one added advantage is that they also learn to add earlier as well this advantage carries on through the years the empirical evidence and conclusion the children of both races had the same acquisition rate for the numbers but after that the chinese children had the profound advantage  Numerology Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Language acquisition Japanese language Esperanto as an international language Mathematics Multilingual Simplified Chinese character Chinese language Chinese spoken language Bible Dyslexia Pinyin Korean language Mandarin (linguistics) Left-handed Kanji Languages of Hong Kong Central processing unit Behaviorism SAT Linguistics History of the English Bible French language History of China Speech synthesis Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner Biology and sexual orientation Phoneme Education in Hong Kong Hangul Autism Duodecimal Education in the People's Republic of China Chinese numerals Economic inequality Celt Chinese calendar African American Vernacular English Greek language Demographics of the Philippines Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Maurice Merleau-Ponty Encyclopedia China Wolof language Education in Romania BASIC programming language M__ra-Pirah__ language College Auslan Computer numbering formats Psychology German language Gender-neutral language Tocharians Literacy Dictionary Foreign language Writing system Philosophy of language Macau Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Novus Ordo Missae Homeschooling Vietnamese language Anthropology Developmental psychology Vladimir Nabokov American Sign Language Hearing impairment Manglish Singlish Standard Mandarin Cantonese (linguistics) Advanced Placement Program Strategic management Central Asia Cognitive science Tone (linguistics) East Asian language Education in the United States Sesotho language Aristotle Education Child prodigy Neolithic Europe Education in Singapore Hispanic Origin of language Names of large numbers Translation Nafaanra language Standard Cantonese Mainlander Han Chinese Tao Te Ching Common Era Logic

what can you tell me about the inuits today i realised today that i know nothing about the inuits how much of their inuit traditions do they follow to this day do some of them still live their traditional lifestyle i mean what's their culture now do any of them marry outside of their inuit heritage i know that sounds odd but i have never met anyone who's just like a half inuit on the other hand i've never met an inuit what are their modern lifestyles like i'm sorry if any of this question came accross as racist it wasn't meant to it's just extremely difficult to ask about something like this when you're as ignorant as i am thank you very much yv and my thoughts btw i had a look at wp but they weren't very clear they maintain some traditions but for the most part they have modern lifestyles like everyone else the reason why you don't see a lot of inuit or half inuit people is because there aren't many inuit people in the world i think their worldwide population in alaska canada greenland russia etc is only about if that and they all mostly live in the same place so unless you live there you won't meet many inuit people  Inuit language Inuit Inuktitut Eskimo Inuit music Native American music Inuit mythology Greenland History of Greenland Marriage Dorset culture Indigenous peoples of the Americas Thule people Kayak Transcontinental nation Native American name controversy Iditarod Native Americans in the United States 1925 serum run to Nome Mongoloid Reindeer Canadian nationalism Nunavut Hans Island Totem pole Who is a Jew?

why do many people claim others to be of certain races according to the convenience of their discussion i'll give a couple of examples to illustrate these are from my experience while discussing the enslavement of africans many blacks refer to the arab slave traders as white or white arabs on the other hand some of these same people claim that arabs and other middle easterners are actually black or ''closer to black than white'' while discussing criminal activities many whites claim that certain criminals are black regardless of their physical features such as how lightly complected they are on the other hand while discussing accomplished folks people are suddenly referred to as white light skinned or just part black or a little black why do people do this deeds don't change a person's lineage i know that some of you may think i've answered my own question that people do this for their own convenience to reflect positively or negatively upon people according to the impression that they want to give but what i really want to know is what i really want to know is what's the point like i said lineage can't be changed i just don't get it no i'm not saying that some people think only certain races can be responsible for certain things although there are people who do feel that way i'm talking about people who refer to folks as particular races according to what they're talking about use me as an example let's say that while people refer to me as white i would suddenly be called black if i robbed a bank understand what i'm saying why do people do this what's the point someone's blood isn't going to change just because people want it to martha plimpton ummm no what does my appearance have to do with anything yes you are right humans are feeble minded and your question is great i guess people need to justify their position continuously and changing facts is one easy way to do it truth is probably very subjective which explains why there is so much misunderstanding  Theory of conduct Black (people) White (people) African American Vernacular English The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Nation of Islam Blacks and Mormonism Have I Got News For You Abortion debate Epistemology Agnosticism Determinism Reparations for slavery Free will Religion Human Science Supernatural English grammar African American Arab Slander and libel Philosophy of language Sant Thakar Singh Bayesian inference Computer numbering formats Curse and mark of Cain Milton H.
