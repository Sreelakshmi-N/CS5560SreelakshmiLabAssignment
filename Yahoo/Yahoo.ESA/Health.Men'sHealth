i really want to get circumcised but don't know how it will affect me in the long run one thing i've noticed in my experience talking with people is that it affects everybody differently there are some people who were circumcised as adults and very happy others more that i know of who were circumcised and lost sensitivity and feeling after all they do remove nerve endings in a sensitive part there's no way to tell which will apply to you but in general i would say not to do it unless something is wrong with your penis how it is already and really wrong and you think it can be fixed by circumcision after all it's non reversible it's a big thing and most circumcised people never experienced the other side of the coin so they don't know what it's like you could have terrible long term affects like a drying up of the glans and less feeling and worse sex but some people have reported that it gets better however these are the things that should not impact your decision cleanliness if you can wash under your foreskin every day then it's fine what people say girls like most of the girls in the world are having sex with uncircumcised men as of men are uncut so really they shouldn't complain personally as a female i prefer uncircumcised and that's how almost every young man is where i live things like infections google it there is no conclusive evidence that it helps with infections and you should practice safe sex anyway  Circumcision Foreskin Medical analysis of circumcision Foreskin restoration Penis Glans penis History of male circumcision Phimosis Masturbation Brit milah Female genital cutting Ridged band AIDS Human sexual behavior Oral sex Balanitis Penile cancer Sex organ Condom Transsexuality Smegma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gay slang Prostate cancer Man Circumcision advocacy Gliding action Clitoris Intersex surgery Pedophilia John Money Balanitis xerotica obliterans Circumcision in the Bible Penis removal Puberty Sexual orientation Infant baptism Child sexuality AIDS in Africa Chronic fatigue syndrome Genital integrity Child sexual abuse Hypospadias Prince Albert piercing Jewish Christians AIDS pandemic Genital modification and mutilation Chancroid Utilitarianism Breastfeeding Infantilism Vulva Body modification Gender role Gay Theodicy Abortion debate Human sexuality Age of consent Hearing impairment Human penis size Sex toy Urinary incontinence Sexual fetishism Gender identity Cervical cancer Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Subud Ex-gay David Reimer Pubic hair American Psycho Sex assignment Fecal incontinence Economic inequality History of intersex surgery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kyle Broflovski Sento Domestic violence The nature of God in Western theology 613 mitzvot Jam (TV series) Autism Infibulation Hepatitis C Motion picture rating system Multiple sclerosis Sharia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Appeal Polyamory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Transactional analysis

physical checkups ok im afraid when i go to the doctor for my physical that i get a b ner when she checks my penis how can i prevent a b ner during my physical p s im only i forgot to mention she's hot and has huge boobs x x you could try to go to a male doctor if a female one makes you too nervous you could drink plenty of cold water an hour before you have to be examined this would cause you to urinate just before being examined the kidney's need to evacuate urine will cause the penis to remain flacid non erect try a test run at this to see what is your reaction to drinking a lot of water and how long it takes before you need to urinate use this as your guide for your exam you could visualize that she is really a wrinkly old man a transvestite is the ugliest woman you ever saw or has some gnarly disease that you wouldn't want to have sex with her under any circumstances but mosty get a grip on your imagination and emotions take control and realize that this is just a medical exam not a sexual opportunity believe me by this time in her career she has probably seen her fair share of penis' erect or otherwise and one looks pretty much like any other and has told her fair share of males to turn their head and cough don't think about it and don't worry about it and you'll be okay  Prostate cancer Penis Condom Medicine Medical analysis of circumcision Herpes simplex virus Premature ejaculation Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Orgasm Sexual intercourse Physical examination Hypoglycemia Dead Like Me Combat stress reaction Human penis size Penis envy Castration Gonorrhoea Masturbation Transgender Birth control Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Erectile dysfunction Intersex surgery Oral sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jam (TV series) First aid Domestic violence History of male circumcision Urine Social rule Pneumonia Sin City Friends Sex assignment Abortion debate Safe sex Urinary system Recurring South Park characters Kidney Human sexual behavior Puberty Hyperthermia Erection Female genital cutting Sigmund Freud Jon Secada Dehydration Ben Johnson (athlete) Strap-on dildo Milton H.

your opinions please in public and crowded places sometimes you may bump into people and your hands may touch other peoples body parts i e privates or if you're in a queue you might be really close to the bum of the person in front of you or somebody might be right against your bum in such situations how might someone prevent an erection from coming on do u reckon the other person can feel your erection has anybody been in a similar situation before tell me about your experiences please thanks by the way im not a pervert and i dont behave in such a manner in public but often im in enclosed places like a packed train or a lift if you have a sling bag or something you can place or position it on your crotch area wear briefs so the erection wont be that obvious and let your penis point downwards when it erects it will not bulge that much compared to a penis positioned upward if you are in a lift or train you can face the wall instead or against a railing  Condom Strap-on dildo Penis Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Dog Professional wrestling throws Narrator Oral sex Goatse.cx Drowning Glossary of climbing terms The Contender (television series) Boxer shorts Glossary of nautical terms Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Anatomical position Equine conformation Tide Human sexual behavior Gender role Skiing Nudity Helicopter Physical intimacy Climbing equipment Undergarment Backstroke Powerbomb Gun safety Sex toy P-61 Black Widow Poker jargon Dog training Breaststroke Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Badminton Domestic violence Customs and etiquette of Japan Nudism Trench warfare Professional wrestling match types Euphemism Orgasm Jackass: The Movie Gay slang 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Baseball Diver rescue Aerial (dance move) Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Blood (computer game) Pubic hair Social aspects of clothing Parachuting Overhead lines Androgen insensitivity syndrome Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Butterfly stroke John Holmes (actor) Leaf Heinkel He 112 Sling (weapon) Rail transport in Great Britain Elevator Suplex The nature of God in Western theology Swimming pool Rigging Salute Japanese toilet Israeli West Bank barrier Horse Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Electroshock gun Montgomery Burns Human penis size Aikido Human sexual response cycle Penis removal Spanking Frogman Clitoris Mercury Atlas 6 Stairway Boxing View camera Kung Fu Hustle Bowing (social) Rugby union Personal rapid transit Puberty Airbag Buckingham Palace Marching band Rathfarnham Rail terminology Plastic surgery Bulgarian language

masturbation i mean years old and i nowadays i masturbate a lot probably once in days and it makes me feel really good but nowadays i have been thinking that i am masturbating a lot soi was thinking that will be there any problem if i continue doing this should i stop doing this first realize that your genitals are among your body's most sensitive parts their skin is the thinnest of any the younger you are the more sensitive it seems to be but it's easy for anyone to irritate or damage that skin there are types of injury that you risk temperature burns chemical burns abrasion scuffing or chafing the skin and for males damaging the circulation system in your genitals if you heat anything in a microwave oven or on a stove intending to put your penis into it or put it into your vagina test it first on your cheek or the inside of your wrist realize that anything such as vapo rub or alcohol that mildly stimulates the thicker skin on your hands arms or legs especially if it contains alcohol or menthol is likely to burn your genitals a surface that may feel smooth to the touch of a finger still could be rough enough to scrape the skin of an erect penis or the membranes that line a vagina tying a string or putting a rubber band around the base of your penis or scrotum if drawn tightly can easily damage the blood vessels inside you need those blood vessels to get and keep an erection although rare it's possible to twist a testicle around inside your scrotum so the testicle's blood supply is cut off the only fix is to go immediately to the emergency room where the scrotum is cut open and the testicle physically untwisted so as to restore blood flow there are normally no bacteria in urine semen or pre cum but your anus abounds in bacteria take great care to keep anything you use for anal stimulation away from other body parts particularly your or a friend's vagina until you can clean it absolutely do not trade anal toys with anyone furthermore understand that although not everyone enjoys anal stimulation people who do can be heterosexual homosexual or bisexual liking anal stimulation is not an indicator of sexual orientation safe lubricants commonly available at home include baby oil kitchen cooking oil vaseline and k y jelly often better when supplemented with water enjoy your body's responses to sexual stimulation but do so responsibly and with respect so you can continue to enjoy that response throughout your life  Prostate cancer Personal lubricant Gay slang Intersex surgery Safe sex Puberty Orgasm Anal masturbation Methamphetamine Human sexual response cycle Erectile dysfunction Fecal incontinence Sexual intercourse Fisting Child sexuality Female genital cutting Violin Erogenous zone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sex organ Human sexuality Traumatic brain injury Penis enlargement Bondage (BDSM) Intravenous therapy Domestic violence Drill bit Medical analysis of circumcision Transmission (medicine) Cryptorchidism Diving suit Menstrual cup Sexual differentiation Testicle Pneumonia Vagina Acne Herpes simplex virus Dildo Stroke Urinary incontinence Human anatomy Male reproductive system (human) Cancer Psoriasis Body piercing Scrotum Vulva Salad Fingers Skin Cat Genital wart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Physical intimacy Massage Foreskin restoration Erection History of intersex surgery Butt plug Gonorrhoea Bleeding Cookware and bakeware Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pain Knife Castration Brewery Plastic Equine conformation Penis removal First aid Pubic hair Breastfeeding Hazing Eczema Intersexuality Unsafe sexual practices Foreskin Circumcision AIDS Carbon dioxide Sexual orientation Smegma Portable stove

is it true that all erect penisses are the same size or is this a myth designed to make men feel better i wasen't even aware of that myth and no that is totally false what you probably heard is that the size range between erect penises tends to be less than the range between flaccid penises and that is true most guys penises are between and inches when erect a small percentage of guys have or inches and a small percentage of guys have or less but for like it's between and which really isn't that much of a range so on one hand most of them are pretty much the same size when erect give or take an inch or so but you also have to take into accout that inches on a guy who is ' lbs looks a lot bigger than inches on a guy who is ' lbs but flaccid size varies much more because some guys are grow ers and other guys are show ers flaccid penises range from inches in length to inches in legth and there is no rhyme or reason behind it guys who have smaller penises when flaccid tend to grow or times in legth when they have an erection and guys that have longer penises when flaccid tend not to grow very much at all so in the end they all pretty much even out but they are not all the same size when erect just closer to the same size than they are when flaccid  Human penis size Penis Penis enlargement Condom Strap-on dildo Puberty John Holmes (actor) Oral sex Foreskin restoration Penis removal Erectile dysfunction Ejaculation Floppy disk Knife Stage lighting Shoe size Gender role Micropenis Erection Phimosis Shotgun Nine Inch Nails Androgen insensitivity syndrome Wood Audio tape length and thickness View camera Laptop Violin Dog agility Premature ejaculation Sexual intercourse Domestic violence Joke Terminal ballistics Kyle Broflovski Masturbation M16 (rifle) Mercury Cougar Human sexual behavior Drill bit Intersex surgery Carbine Eyepiece Depth of field Boxer shorts Time Out of Mind Urethra Old wives' tale O scale Human sexual response cycle Grigori Rasputin Social rule Ammunition Menstrual cup Small penis humiliation The finger Internal ballistics Orgasm Goatse.cx Andrew Dice Clay Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Textile manufacturing Paper size Tiger Sex and the City Priapism Mach kernel Circumcision Ship model Male reproductive system (human) Hash table Eunuch Hat HMS Dreadnought (1906) Photographic lens Bed (furniture) Non-native pronunciations of English Anal sex Goldfish Carding Phalloplasty 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Adolescence Pedophilia Pachypodium key to species The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie British 2 inch mortar Sex toy Buddy Guy Dildo Man Sex assignment Pope Korea Jindo Dog Rigid designator Timpani American lobster Adoption

gaining weight a big mystery for me hi all my height is ' and weighs kg age i m very skinny i eat well but i can't gain weight and most of the time feel embaresment when some one says you r very thin and skinny wht shud i do so tht i gain weight at least kg more regards i had this problem until i was a year older than you are now for the life of me i just couldn't gain weight i finally managed to do so when i was my best answer eat well lots of carbs and work out eating well if you want a bigger fire you put more material in to burn if you want a bigger body you need to put plenty of food in it so it can build carbs are used by the body as long term energy meaning they will be stored longer and keep your weight up working out means both aerobically and anaerobically aerobic so the carbs you're adding don't turn to fat trust me you're better off being skinny than being fat anaerobic because lifting weights will build your muscles muscles have a pretty high density which will bulk you up and help you gain weight there are some products on the market that are considered weight gainers if you hit up a local health shop they should be able to recommend something but if you're not eating right first then it's not going to help  Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Low-carbohydrate diet Swimming Exercise Obesity Dieting Muscle Anorexia nervosa Milk Bodybuilding Aerobic exercise Food Piccolo Junior Saga South Beach diet Sewage treatment Binge eating disorder Waste management Cellular respiration Human height Ramen Glycolysis Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hydrogen economy Diabetes mellitus Bong Body mass index Diving Marathon (sport) Uranium Magnesium Dodge Charger Aspartame Brown Bear Fecal incontinence Ketosis Growth hormone treatment Chocolate Dairy Cheese Super Size Me Soil life Internal ballistics Tocopherol Nutrition Body type (exercise) Hamster DDT Adjustable gastric band Flatulence Urinary incontinence Nuclear weapon design Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cannabis (drug) Creatine Norway national football team Toyota Corolla Wall Street Explosive material Mattress Depleted uranium Veganism Vermicompost Terminal ballistics Weight Puberty Raw food diet Nuclear fusion Fat Hamburger Mass Pork M60 machine gun Guinea pig Renewable energy Garfield M16 (rifle) Biochemistry Wood Professional wrestling throws Insulin Skin Feeder (fetish) Birth weight InuYasha (character) Sauerkraut Domestic rabbit Potassium Space elevator Mercury Cougar Dualism (philosophy of mind) Babe Ruth Ford Thunderbird Growth hormone deficiency Fancy rat

why do i jack off masturbate i am a year old boy my question is why do i masturbate you see when i jack off i'm not thinking of girls nor guys i'm jacking off to jack off is it just a habit or something is there a way to stop is it normal to get a boner without even thinking about sexual stuff i'd appreciate your help the future mrs s is right it has a good deal to do with your hormones you are of the age when you most likely get aroused very frequently some women refer to guys your age as being walking e r e c t i o n s because it happens so often being young is also part of the reason as you get older this will not happen so frequently if you masturbate enough it will become a habit or an addiction just like anything else you do frequently becomes a habit if you want to stop you have to focus on other things like school sports working a job reading a book studying learning find a non sexual hobby keep yourself busy and distract yourself from your e r e c t i o n when it pops up it is very normal to become aroused without thinking about sexual things especially for a guy your age masturbation can be habit forming if you do it often enough welcome to manhood  Sexual orientation Margaret Sanger Milton H.

is it good or bad to masturbate with no lube if not ok where can i get a lube at store what are they called it isn t necessarily bad tro masturbate with no lube even if you are circumcised but if circumcised it does tend to create a lot fo friction between yoru hand and the glans head which may be uncomfortable as well that much freiction on a regular basis can 'toughen up' the glans and make it less sensitive so if you are circumcised or have foreskin but retract it out of the way for masturbatrion i would suggest applying a nice lubrication to make things glide more easily as for what to use there are many commercial products available for lubrication ky probably being the most widely known but if you aren't quite up to buying one of the store bought lubes check out the kitchen for suitable substitutes personally i think extra virgin olive oil is great but any liquid vegetable oil will do the trick very smoothly some swear by vaseline others by baby oil just don't use soaps or shapmoos since they are actually abrasive and can harm the sensitive head of the penis oh don't use an oil based lube when having sex they will damage the condom  Masturbation Penis Condom Oral sex Foreskin Phimosis Motor oil Medical analysis of circumcision Glans penis Anal sex Strap-on dildo Gliding action Smegma Circumcision Human sexual behavior Human sexuality Sex toy Foreskin restoration Gay slang History of male circumcision Safe sex Prostitution Friction Ridged band Female genital cutting Violin Sexual arousal Menstrual cup Breastfeeding Balanitis Tire Infant baptism Lionel Corporation Social rule Thermal power station Birth control Drill bit Circumcision advocacy Biodiesel Manual transmission Petroleum Child sexuality Prostate cancer Sex organ Olive oil Plastic Intersex surgery Balanitis xerotica obliterans Microeconomics Penis removal Clitoris Soap Gross domestic product Hamster Pornography Frenulum Ceramics Explosive material Mouse (computing) Kyle Broflovski Anal masturbation Theory of conduct Margarine Handloading Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vulva Fisting Kosher foods Sexual abstinence Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Child sexual abuse Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Diesel Kashrut Cervical cancer Capital accumulation Genital integrity Upholstery Glycerin Equine conformation Floppy disk Die (manufacturing) Fire extinguisher Child pornography Knife Erection Essential oil Virgin Grease (lubricant) Motion picture rating system Textile manufacturing Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Eastern Orthodox Church Ice cream Gramophone record Hypospadias

my husband is having a really hard time he has to shave everyday for his job but he is getting really bad bumps that eventually bleed when he has to shave the next day we have tried bikini zone a girls razor etc any suggestions i have very sensitive skin and used to get razor bumps and ingrown hairs from shaving it was embarassing quite frankly i went to a barber shop and had them teach me how to do the perfect shave so here you go first of all you always shave after you shower in the shower you should wash your face thoroughly with an actual face soap such as that made by neutrogena it will soften your beard and won't dry out your skin then follow these steps apply a hot wash cloth to your face and keep it there for at least seconds this opens the pores and softens the beard even further do not dry the face afterward apply a pre shave oil just a few drops will coat the entire beard area apply a thin layer of shave cream preferably a gel meant for sensitive skin using a clean razor with sharp blades shave with the grain for most men this means downward strokes on the cheeks and around the mouth and upward strokes for the throat area rinse the face with very cold water this will remove all remaining oil and shave cream while sealing the pores back up apply a non alcohol based moisturizer alcohol based aftershaves dry out the skin shaving is pretty traumatic for skin so you need moisture at this time so it can heal use moisturizer as needed throughout the day your husband might complain about the act of applying moisturizer but he'll thank you in years when his friends look like old men and he doesn't if this doesn't significantly help your husband's situation you might consider visiting a facial specialist at a spa for more advice but i think you'll notice a difference in just a short while good luck  Razor Sento Beard Pubic hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Barber Psoriasis Depilation Knife Global Gillette Fecal incontinence Skin Soap Eczema Tofu Tattoo Hair Shampoo Hard water Wound Acne Wood Coffee Upholstery Pseudofolliculitis barbae Gay bathhouse Cleanser Leather Glycerin Haircut Baldness Aloe 613 mitzvot Body piercing Violin Moisturizer Leaf Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Volleyball Hyperthermia Leg shaving Drowning Puberty Kurt Angle Social rule Textile manufacturing Physical attractiveness Equine conformation Urticaria Breastfeeding Corrosion Woodworking Massage Menstrual cup Hair conditioner Genericized trademark Fluoride therapy Tanning Car washing techniques Moustache Three Stooges Swimming Dry cleaning Internal ballistics Comanche Table tennis Waxing Mummy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Dishwasher Head shaving Casting Embalming Professional wrestling slang Sauna Kodocha Malignant melanoma Wok Paint Poker jargon Dairy Steam engine Mattress Face Hypothermia Brewery Hangul Scabies Professional wrestling throws Hard disk Wolfrider Water

i am uncircumsized and my foreskin is sow tight that it would not retract can i remove it manually i am yrs old and i am a virgin and i was wondering if theres any way i could retract the foreskin manually or will having sexual relationships help it retract some may say that circumcision will fix it but circumcision's risks include reduction in sensitivity and pleasure and making masturbation more difficult according to studies including a few new ones from a few months ago oddly enough that's how it was promoted in the usa since masturbation was bad haha there's a reason why the usa is the last remaining advanced nation still doing it and even so it's getting a lot less popular it's now as low as in some states save that as a last resort as you're doing that's only one of the few risks there's more listed here in addition to the studies and statistics http forums govteen com showpost php p postcount i was the same when i was younger and now it slides fine with no problems whatsoever just pull back your foreskin when you shower the most you can without forcing it and rub the head that should encourage it to separate from the head this is probably all you have to do since this is common especially with teens you just haven't 'used' it enough as in masturbation and washing it the same goes for sensitivity the more your rub it the less sensitive it'll get start using water when you shower then rub a little more each day and if its rather tight you can get a cream that works in almost of cases it's betamethasone or betamethasone dipropionate and unlike circumcision it is very cheap in the usa painless and you don't risk decreasing sensitivity pleasure and making masturbation more difficult here's the study that you can even print and give to the doctor http www scielo br scielo php pid s script sci arttext tlng en http www drugstore com pharmacy prices drugprice asp ndc trx z try that cream it works doctors often just mention circumcision since its a surgery that brings a lot of money to them especially in the usa if you have questions e mail me from my profile since i've gone through this i'll be happy to answer any questions  Foreskin Medical analysis of circumcision Circumcision PHP Penis Female genital cutting History of male circumcision Breastfeeding Foreskin restoration Circumcision advocacy Human sexual behavior Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Prostate cancer Human sexuality Strap-on dildo Acne Brit milah Plastic surgery Penile cancer Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infant baptism Psoriasis Condom Digital photography Safe sex Colorectal cancer Cross site scripting Ajax (programming) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct Floppy disk Sento Coffee Deflation (economics) Abortion Radiation therapy Orgasm Surveillance Hyperinflation Gmail Sexual arousal Smegma Brewery Monetary policy Apache HTTP Server Domain Name System Mesothelioma Slashdot trolling phenomena Sexual abstinence Cervical cancer Dairy Sex education Web server Social rule Erection Childbirth Charles Darwin's illness Tattoo The Sims 2 Cat Gay slang Anal sex GameFAQs Menstrual cup Domestic violence The Apprentice 2 Babe Ruth World Wide Web Atkins Nutritional Approach Gender identity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glans penis Child sexual abuse Sharia Mutual masturbation Frenulum Plame affair Wget Nocturnal emission Anal masturbation Solar variation HTML Pubic hair AIDS in Africa

help me problem going to camp im gay and i'm going to a army camp for a week its a boys one n there gonna be like boys there im gona be so embarased in showers wen i get a boner wht can i do cus i doubt i can wear swim shorts s will you be embarrassed because the other boys will think you're soft excuse the unintended pun or maybe because you're not as developed as you'd like to be or because they might discover you are gay firstly some boys and even older guys both straight and gay get an erection every time they get in the shower even at home where its private and there's nothing around to excite them sexually the warm water stimulates the blood flow in the arteries of the penis and it brings on a physiological response its not sexual just like riding a horse or taking the bus the vibration just sets them off after a while it goes away and then maybe it comes back but eventually it subsides so there is nothing to be ashamed of but if it is going to freak you out here's a few tips dont look at the other guys if you can help it think of them as stone sculptures or whatever also concentrate on something that will take your mind of it for instance try to remember the birthdates and telephone numbers of all your family breathe really deeply and slowly occasionally turn the temperature of the water down real cold leave washing your privates right to the last giving your dick a quick painful flick will usually head off an erection and bending down to wash your feet will make it less obvious some shy guys masturbate and ejaculate in the toilet cubicle beforehand that gives you around minutes or so before the next erection but its best not to grow up having to do that in the army you're taught to be a leader so why not start out being confident of who you are right from the beginning dont deliberately get a hard on because that's kind of sexual but if you do you can be sure there are at least another boys on camp who are going to struggle with the same issue possibly their whole life my friend in the military says it a pretty common thing in the showers  Penis Masturbation Orgasm Strap-on dildo Oral sex Condom Toilet humour Sex and the City Nudity Sexual intercourse Shaggy dog story Erection Toilet Gay slang Prostate cancer Decompression sickness Japanese toilet Human sexual behavior 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Urinary incontinence Pornography Anal sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sento Blood on the Tracks Diving Androgen insensitivity syndrome Equine conformation Human sexual response cycle Carbon dioxide Gay bathhouse Infantilism Recurring South Park characters Menstrual cup Salad Fingers Massage Gender role Drowning Eric Cartman Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.

what causes an orgasm to happen and why does it feel so good i know what an orgasm feels like to me i dont want to know how it feels i want to know why it feels so good and wat exactly causes it because an orgasm helps the reproduction cycle if it didnt feel good what person would ever want to have sex women would never want sex and guys would have no reason either in the reproductive area you have tons of nerve endings which means that it is super sensitive and when you rub them etc your nerves send signals to the brain saying that this feels good so your brain says oh yea and releases a whole lot of endorphins that courses threw and it doesnt last very long because its just one big burst of energy i e a bottle rocket for men the rocket shoots up and then in one instance boom and its done women can have multiple orgasms same thing only imagin the th of july hope that helps  Orgasm Oral sex Sex toy Human sexual behavior Atomic Kitten Sexual intercourse Puberty Strap-on dildo Masters and Johnson Anal sex Patrick Star Vibrator Birth control Penis Sexual abstinence Rape Sexual orientation Prostate cancer Sadism and masochism Human sexual response cycle Bondage (BDSM) Menstrual cycle Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Action potential Static Shock Clitoris Erogenous zone Functional magnetic resonance imaging Anorgasmia Multiple sclerosis Self-harm Sex organ Urinary incontinence Menstrual cup Transsexuality Futurama (TV series - season 3) Wilhelm Reich Color Joke Social rule Zoophilia Clinical depression Tribadism Erotic sexual denial Gender role Man Religion and sexuality Sexual fetishism Transgender Anal masturbation Gr__fenberg spot John Money Fertility awareness Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 About a Boy Dualism (philosophy of mind) History of intersex surgery Gender-neutral language Superman Eye Sexual addiction Neurotransmitter 3rd Rock from the Sun Chronic fatigue syndrome Child sexuality Spacecraft propulsion Power Rangers: SPD Traumatic brain injury Magnetic resonance imaging Shaggy dog story Bernard Williams Gender Xiaolin Showdown Breastfeeding Fasting Demographics of sexual orientation History of sex Addiction Pain Nocturnal emission W.

i know that this is an awkward question but why do guys only care about the length of their penis why not the width no perverts just guys girls who know why i know that length is important because it makes it look bigger but i want to know why guys also don't consider width when they compare themselves i think boys care about both actually you will see on this forum that more often both a length and width is given with the question is that normal that question is significant to the asker when boys go through puberty and a lot of things change one of them penis size and shape a man's height his voice pubic hair chest hair these things are very important changes for boys because it is a sign to them that they are now men it is important to them and therefore it is worthy conversation and an important area of concern for them it is not the same for adult men who have grown acustomed to their adult body unless of course they feel inadequate some men feel inadequate because of hteir height and others might have this feeling by reason that they believe their penis isn't an average size but teenage boys just want re assurance that they are normal  Human penis size Pubic hair Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pedophilia Testosterone Strap-on dildo Transsexuality Penis Gender role Intersex surgery Delayed puberty Human height Hair Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Anorexia nervosa Sexual differentiation Kyle Broflovski Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Child sexuality Micropenis Social rule Castration Secondary sex characteristic Ranma __ characters Penis removal Kender Testicle Condom FLCL Penis enlargement Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma History of intersex surgery Normal distribution Hypertrichosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anime Equine conformation Phoebe Buffay's songs Infantilism Pornographic movie Goatse.cx Sex assignment Child Stairway Turner syndrome Anabolic steroid Second language acquisition Man Human Growth hormone treatment Humphrey Bogart Adrenarche Baldness Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Sealab 2021 Milton H.

why do women always think that they have to get off first i personally think as long as my man is happy then i am happy of course it is nice to orgasm too not that i don't care about a woman's pleasure but you are the perfect woman will in that aspect anyway i find women can be rather selfish when it comes to sex some of them fake orgasms which is dishonest i think most men would rather be ineffective than deceived we can't get better if we think we're gods in bed they let us do all the hard work and complain if they didn't get off i'd like to see you get on top do all the thrusting and focus on getting me off as well as yourself and then there's oral and hand jobs i have yet to meet a woman that enjoys doing that all the girls i've been with act as if it's a chore just because it doesn't give them pleasure  Oral sex Strap-on dildo Anal sex Sexual intercourse Orgasm Child sexuality Masters and Johnson Jam (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Human sexual behavior Serial killer Bondage (BDSM) Mail-order bride Sexual orientation Masturbation History of sex Theory of conduct Social rule Religion and sexuality EastEnders Sex toy Zoophilia Nicomachean Ethics Avenue Q BDSM Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Woman on top sex position Sexual dysfunction American Psycho Gender role Sin City Autograph Meaning of life Birth control The Beatles discography Happiness Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Tom Leykis Anorgasmia When Harry Met Sally...

how can i get motivated to take exercise more i want to start loosing a bit of weight in my opinion i look fat but people always say that im not fat im and years old i do have rather large legs and i just would like to get rid of the fat when i was born i had something called hershbrung disease and they take out the bottom part of my bowell from that day of the operation i have had a scar under my stomach which cases my belly to flop over i know i will never gat a perfect body but at least i will be able to feel more cumfortable so any suggestions staying motivated is definitely one of the hardest parts of getting in shape there are a couple of things i've found that work best one is setting short term goals for instance my latest short term goal was to get my weight from to by birthday which was this last saturday i gave myself a couple of months to reach the goal which was plenty of time and when my birthday came i was lbs now that i have accomplished that goal my new one is to get on a regular weight lifting routine while still doing my cardio for more weight loss so while losing the weight i can also start gaining some muscle i plan to have a good routine going by the end of this month and should be weighing about lbs the whole short term goal thing makes it easier and more fun b c getting in shape can be a very slow process if you just set your goal to eventually be in shape then your probably going to get discouraged along the way when you don't see quick results set these goals so that they will be a challenge but be sure they are within reach that way you get a sense of accomplishment when you work your way to your goal and are motivated to continue to a new one ultimately leading to your long term goal another great way to stay motivated is to find something you enjoy doing that requires you be in shape this can be a lot of things it all really depends on your personal preference if you like baseball then join a team if you like hiking then plan a trip each weekend like i said it could be anything just find something that you will like and that will keep challenging you hope this helps good luck  Weight training Fecal incontinence Muscle Poker jargon 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anorexia nervosa Dieting Bodybuilding Mixed martial arts Obesity Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct Paragliding Weight Aerial (dance move) Social rule Prostate cancer Norway national football team Stomach cancer Adjustable gastric band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Coeliac disease Scientology beliefs and practices Feeder (fetish) Puberty New York Giants Mattress Strap-on dildo Breastfeeding Clinical depression Anchor Hiking Textile manufacturing Terminal ballistics Motivation Weight loss Batting (cricket) Tocopherol Internal ballistics Fast bowling Glossary of American football Airsoft Breaststroke Vegeta Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Sport rowing Ra (board game) New York Jets Osteoarthritis Diving Gliding Tag Birthday Alex Ferguson Swingout Alexander Technique Consensus decision-making Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tai Chi Chuan Goodness and value theory Playoff Characters of Naruto Dance Dance Revolution Lindy Hop Tyrannosaurus rex Piccolo Junior Saga CPU cache Swimming Trapping Sailing File Allocation Table The Amazing Race Parachuting Operation Market Garden Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Happiness Crohn's disease Kodocha Bicycle Colorectal cancer Space Shuttle program Wood Jennifer Lopez Radiation therapy Theodicy Utilitarianism Extreme Programming

muscles how do you work the muscles right under the pectorals the muscles under are called the pectoralis minora my latin is horrendous so the spelling is not likely right and the main muscle is the pectoralis majora the work together so you can't really target one or the other here s what i do and it has been working for me obviously a workout needs to be tailored to the individual but these exercises may help chest dumbbell incline presses pullovers and presses dumbbell bench presses narrow grip bench presses incline dumbbell flyes barbell incline presses push ups between benches cable standing incline flyes cable standing decline flyes i also do crunches per night my idea is to hit a variety of ranges and movements in order to work the muscle to the maximum i tend to use a weight i can do for reps and for reps on the last two movements apart from this i do minutes or cardio every day and stretch before and after the workout as well as frequently during stretching is very important to muscular growth because not only does it help prevent injury and alleviate recovery pain but it also stretches out the fascia tissue that surrounds the muscle and inhibits its growth when you are pumped and you stretch is when you get the best stretch of the fascia lastly rest and nutrition are every bit as important as the workout itself eating enough protein for the muscle to recover and grow as well as enough carbohydrates to replenish diminished glycogen stores in the muscles and liver is vital for repair and being ready for the next time you tax those muscles  Bodybuilding Exercise Equine conformation Insulin Muscle Dieting Bench press Hypoglycemia Dumbbell Massage Glucocorticoid Carpal tunnel syndrome Myocardial infarction Protein-energy malnutrition Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Cancer Puberty Glucose Scapula Traumatic brain injury Wound healing phases Scar Arm Glycogen storage disease type I Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Creatine Growth hormone Atkins Nutritional Approach Nutrition Powerlifting Stuttering Coronary heart disease Abdomen Swimming Action potential Diazepam Glucokinase Liver Cirrhosis Stem cell Fecal incontinence Reptile Human height Cocaine Carbohydrate Humerus Stretching Bicycle Muscular dystrophy Bruise American lobster Osteoporosis Backstroke Radiation therapy Protein Vitamin C Head Running Heart Skeletal muscle Folic acid Enzyme Tightlacing Glossary of climbing terms Duchenne muscular dystrophy Growth hormone treatment Orgasm Sternum Epilepsy Multiple sclerosis Eye Clinical depression Squat (exercise) Hip (anatomy) Osteoarthritis Sleep Stomach cancer Coffee Milton H.

i masterbate but rite before im going to ejaculate i stop i was wondering if the ejaculation goes into my bladder so basicly is it bad to hold in ejaculation the best answer to your question just is in the purpose and utility of the masturbation we all carry out masturbation because have to give vent to our sexual craving satisfying our lust and put down stress masturbation gets its apex and conclusion in the ejaculation corresponding to the orgasm therefore without ejaculation the purpose utility of the masturbation runs out without ejaculation our craving or lust never will be satisfied while masturbation becomes a left undone act yep it's possible that some sperms go in the bladder it s okay to try to defer or prolong the act so that the pleasure will last longer but please don t forget that if ejaculation does not occur there may be a lingering sensation of heaviness aching or discomfort in the testicles due to the continued vasocongestion called the blue balls condition  Orgasm Strap-on dildo Ejaculation Testicle Sexual intercourse Penis Sex toy Prostate cancer Female ejaculation Human sexual response cycle Puberty Birth control Child sexuality Nocturnal emission Male reproductive system (human) Sexual dysfunction History of male circumcision Masters and Johnson Foreskin Pornography Circumcision 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Condom Intersex surgery Female genital cutting Sterilization (surgical procedure) Personal lubricant Pain Medical analysis of circumcision Urinary incontinence Pornographic movie Anorgasmia Darken Rahl Human sexual behavior Sexual arousal Milton H.

how do i cure phimosis without surgery i have heard of stretching i have also heard of using topical steroids with stretching but my urologist won't prescribe me any and insists i get a full circumcision or partial one i have also recently purchased a glansie and was wondering if any men our there have used it with success some may say that circumcision will fix it but circumcision's risks include reduction in sensitivity and pleasure and making masturbation more difficult according to studies including a few new ones from a few months ago oddly enough that's how it was promoted in the usa since masturbation was bad haha there's a reason why the usa is the last remaining advanced nation still doing it and even so it's getting a lot less popular it's now as low as in some states save that as a last resort as you're doing that's only one of the few risks there's more listed here in addition to the studies and statistics http forums govteen com showpost php p postcount i was the same when i was younger and now it slides fine with no problems whatsoever just pull back your foreskin when you shower the most you can without forcing it and rub the head that should encourage it to separate from the head this is probably all you have to do since this is common especially with teens you just haven't 'used' it enough as in masturbation and washing it the same goes for sensitivity the more your rub it the less sensitive it'll get start using water when you shower then rub a little more each day and if its rather tight you can get a cream that works in almost of cases it's betamethasone or betamethasone dipropionate and unlike circumcision it is very cheap in the usa painless and you don't risk decreasing sensitivity pleasure and making masturbation more difficult here's the study that you can even print and give to the doctor http www scielo br scielo php pid s script sci arttext tlng en http www drugstore com pharmacy prices drugprice asp ndc trx z try that cream it works doctors often just mention circumcision since its a surgery that brings a lot of money to them especially in the usa if you have questions e mail me from my profile since i've gone through this i'll be happy to answer any questions  Phimosis Medical analysis of circumcision Circumcision Foreskin Masturbation PHP Female genital cutting Prostate cancer History of male circumcision Circumcision advocacy Penis Breastfeeding Psoriasis Foreskin restoration Acne Fecal incontinence Strap-on dildo Child sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Radiation therapy Balanitis xerotica obliterans Brit milah Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Androgen insensitivity syndrome Deflation (economics) Ajax (programming) Sento Orgasm Colorectal cancer Penile cancer Gender identity Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant baptism Lung cancer Growth hormone treatment Equine conformation Cross site scripting I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue GameFAQs Digital photography Social rule Chronic fatigue syndrome Jam (TV series) Ulcerative colitis Multiple sclerosis Cryptorchidism Gonorrhoea Surveillance Obesity Crohn's disease The Apprentice 2 Charles Darwin's illness History of intersex surgery Monetary policy Dairy Plame affair Tocopherol Babe Ruth Apache HTTP Server Slashdot trolling phenomena Hypospadias Kyle Broflovski Atkins Nutritional Approach Coffee Web server Goodness and value theory Safe sex Homosexuality and Islam Mesothelioma Folic acid The Ashlee Simpson Show Divorce Eczema Abortion Inflation Ozone depletion Chinese University of Hong Kong Sudoku Smegma Arbitrage Economics The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

what kind of doctor handles circumsicions in older males what type of doctors handle circumcisions for older males around also how much should i expect to pay for this procedure i'm aware that prices vary by region but a ballpark estimate would be better than nothing for adults its more than newborns since they put you to sleep i'd say about a grand but it also varies on your insurance and whether it covers it or not or partially unlike newborns you won't scream your guts out discussed later on with links because you can be put to sleep but recovery can be painful for some for especially the first two weeks especially with erections as it disturbs the wound make sure you research it well because once you have it done you can't go back if you don't end up liking it most guys in the world are uncircumcised and in some american states its pretty common since circumcision rates have fallen a lot circumcision is a traditionally jewish and muslim procedure although it was introduced and encouraged to the western developed world as a way to stop masturbation especially with the help of dr kellogg see link however although scientific studies have discovered that circumcision harms masturbation by up to over needless to say it doesn t completely stop masturbation many circumcised guys find it more convenient to use a commercial lubricant as a result since the typically moist foreskin that is like the eyelids is not present to rub the glans with most developed nations quickly rejected circumcision after noticing its ineffectiveness against masturbation and as a result the united states remains the last developed nation doing it to a significant percentage of newborns this was done as a result of the for profit american health care system promoting myths about benefits of circumcision such preventing penile cancer a b preventing hiv c d despite the usa being the developed nation with the highest hiv rates and circumcision rates e and preventing stds d f as a result circumcision is now brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors and the american health system however circumcision has been becoming less popular as years have passed by in the s over of guys were circumcised in the usa now circumcision rates are as low as in some states more and more parents are discovering that circumcision carries more risks than benefits and realize that by leaving their sons uncircumcised they have the choice of choosing what they d like since the surgery is irreversible circumcision risks include the loss of sexual pleasure according to multiple studies those studies take into effect many sensation points including the foreskin and they involve many participants there have been other studies that claim no difference but they don t even take into effect the nerve endings on the foreskin which as seen in one study are some of the most sensitive points on the penis one study even found an increase in erectile dysfunction rates after circumcision a in another study it was found that females ended up reaching orgasm with and preferring uncircumcised males in out of cases b in addition circumcision is extremely painful on newborns and you risk many bad conditions such as a buried penis when too much foreskin is removed and limits the size of the penis or adhesions or skin bridges that develop from the head to the shaft when the skin heals after the surgery meatal stenosis occurs in up to of circumcised males when the opening of the penis becomes irritated from too much exposure and rubbing and begins to close up and meatal ulcers all those risks are of course not including the possibility of having too much skin removed which can cause discomfort during erections due to lack of skin to allow the penis to expand and could consequently cause a hairy penis by pulling pubic hair and skin to the shaft often a circumcision scar develops around the penis after circumcision in addition circumcision has negative effects on breastfeeding to conclude here is a link that describes the anatomy of the foreskin and the development of the foreskin with infants a link especially helpful for parents a ultimately one survey found that although uncircumcised guys are a bit more satisfied percentage wise it s within the margin of error the only difference is that those unsatisfied uncircumcised guys can simply get circumcised and end up satisfied either way in addition in one survey it was found that up to half of circumcised guys expressed concerns on wishing to have had the choice themselves that along with the risks and negative effects that are being seen more with the help of the internet may be what is bringing down circumcision rates  Brit milah Clitoris Hypospadias Erection Ridged band AIDS in

am a male and my age will be on september what diet and exercise is required to grow height am now i don't believe there to be miracle food and exercise program that will guarantee height growth however the healthier you eat the easier it is for your body to absorb what it needs making you healthier and more prone to reaching physical goals a low sugar high fiber protein diet is a good start avoid sweets and greasy type fats and instead focus on getting a pleantiful amount of fruits vegetables meats yogurt brown rice hard boiled eggs nuts seeds avocados and fish will give you powerful doses of omega fatty acids which are good and you should take a multi vitamin in addition to eating meals a day you should attempt to eat a hearty snack in between those meals oh and drink tons of water this oxygenates your cells and helps them out take half your weight and that should be the number of ounces that you drink of water a day so if you're lbs you should drink ounces of water a day or more as far as excersice any activity that elevates your heart rate for a sustained period of at least minutes is good you might try running biking hiking i think any pysical activity is beneficial the number one thing you can to do promote height is to get a lot of sleep it's only when you sleep that your body produces processes growth hormone if you're not sleeping enough it makes it difficult for you body to achieve this also if you're on ritalin or smoke try to cut back or find alternatives because those both can stunt growth i know quite a few people who stay at a certain height until they're and then suddenly grow by leaps and bounds a lot of this is genetic and only a small portion is based on what you do physically or dietary but if you get a lot of sleep eat healthy and exercise moderately you'll be giving your body all the armor you can to aid in the growth process  Omega-3 fatty acid Healthy eating Hypoglycemia Coronary heart disease Food Weight training Insulin Milk Folic acid Atherosclerosis Alcoholic beverage Bodybuilding Prostate cancer Vegetarian nutrition Fecal incontinence Egg (food) Vitamin C Puberty Obesity Tooth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Hamster Breakfast Cancer Anorexia nervosa Food guide pyramid Breastfeeding Vitamin Low-carbohydrate diet Diabetes mellitus Organic food Soybean Peanut Food preservation Sleep Nutrient Fancy rat Cheese South Beach diet Stomach cancer Ramen Vitamin D Glycogen storage disease type I Colorectal cancer Bread Chronic fatigue syndrome Protein Cuisine of Denmark Raw food diet Agriculture Alzheimer's disease Guinea pig Chicken Tofu German cuisine Urinary incontinence Cuisine of the Southern United States Tooth enamel Cuisine of Malaysia Soul food Rice Chocolate Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sugar substitute Hamburger Oily fish Dog Human height Coeliac disease Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Brazil Jewish cuisine Caffeine Cholesterol Genetically modified food Domestic rabbit Growth hormone treatment Fugu Protein-energy malnutrition Chlorophyta Cocaine Watermelon Osteoporosis Antioxidant Anemia Alcohol fuel

does anybody know how to build massive traps besides shoulder shrugs also what foods to eat before bed and post workout i hit traps along with shoulders and do shrugs as well as another exercise that i don't know the name of i am including my whole workout if you are interested as for food i eat a sandwich orange and banana right after the work out and eat my regular dinner about hours after that if you are bulking eat rice and beans potatoes meat and vegetables like chard and broccoli here s what i do and it has been working for me obviously a workout needs to be tailored to the individual but these exercises may help arms lying dumbbell triceps extensions standing barbell curl behind head reverse hammers one arm preacher curl close grip pushdowns incline dumbbell curl parallel bar dips hammer curl single arm reverse grip pushdowns reverse grip ez bar rope push downs super light dumbbell curls chest dumbbell incline presses pullovers and presses dumbbell bench presses narrow grip bench presses incline dumbbell flyes barbell incline presses push ups between benches cable standing incline flyes cable standing decline flyes back barbell row dumbbell row lat pull downs cable row lower back machine forearms lite wide lat pulldowns supermans shoulders lateral raises bent over lateral raises no rest front raises shrugs military presses front raises rotator cuffs superlight lateral raises on incline bench with lbs dumbbells st facing forward bring dumbbells up from sides to parallel to ground palms inward slow repeat for ten reps nd facing bench bring dumbbells up from sides backwards as far as you can palms inward slow repeat for ten reps rd stand up with dumbbells and do lateral raises th back in position raise arms so they are forward palms inward arms bent in a semi bear hug position and parallel to ground bring to sides and back to center for reps i usually do lbs here because this exercise is hard trapps do this set three times with out rest the third set i change to all lb movements all of this is slow pace like second up and one second down legs squats leg extentions leg curls adductors abductors calf lifts glute machine leg lifts i also do crunches per night my idea is to hit a variety of ranges and movements in order to work the muscle to the maximum i tend to use a weight i can do for reps and for reps on the last two movements apart from this i do minutes or cardio every day and stretch before and after the workout as well as frequently during stretching is very important to muscular growth because not only does it help prevent injury and alleviate recovery pain but it also stretches out the fascia tissue that surrounds the muscle and inhibits its growth when you are pumped and you stretch is when you get the best stretch of the fascia lastly rest and nutrition are every bit as important as the workout itself eating enough protein for the muscle to recover and grow as well as enough carbohydrates to replenish diminished glycogen stores in the muscles and liver is vital for repair and being ready for the next time you tax those muscles  Bodybuilding Humerus Breaststroke Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Bench press Professional wrestling aerial techniques Fast bowling Volleyball Boxing Swingout Arm Bicycle Powerbomb Clean and jerk Glossary of climbing terms Squat (exercise) Front crawl Scapula Parade (military) Swimming Exercise DDT (professional wrestling) Anchor Deadlift Internal ballistics Ulna Diving Tetrapod Glossary of ballet terms Horizontal bar Dieting Elbow-joint Insulin Carpal tunnel syndrome Massage M16 (rifle) Salute Muscle Mixed martial arts Pole vault Dairy Figure skating Glossary of American football Lindy Basic Casualty lifting Obedience training Neckbreaker Urinary incontinence Sailing Cat Bruce Lee Weightlifting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Leaf Puberty Horse Terminal ballistics Backbreaker Eye Wing Chun Combine (Half-Life 2) Coffee Aikido Heckler & Koch G3 Marching band Drill bit Piledriver (professional wrestling) Tyrannosaurus rex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Comanche The Time Machine Chair Food Marathon (sport) Abdomen Anatomical position Fancy rat Spanking Breakfast Milton H.

'adult' circumcision i was wondering does this hurt i didn't have my skin cut when i was born for some personal reasons and well i don't really think girls like the skin on it from what i hear and i was wondering if i get it cut how much would it hurt do they put you under anesthesia or whatever for it i'm so i'd probably get a bunch of erections which i thought would make it hurt a lot more i'm also a bit embarrassed to tell anyone i want it cut but i really want it done well unlike newborns you won't scream your guts out discussed later on with links because you can be put to sleep but recovery can be painful for some for especially the first two weeks especially with erections as it disturbs the wound make sure you research it well because once you have it done you can't go back if you don't end up liking it most guys in the world are uncircumcised and in some american states its pretty common since circumcision rates have fallen a lot circumcision is a traditionally jewish and muslim procedure although it was introduced and encouraged to the western developed world as a way to stop masturbation especially with the help of dr kellogg see link however although scientific studies have discovered that circumcision harms masturbation by up to over needless to say it doesn t completely stop masturbation many circumcised guys find it more convenient to use a commercial lubricant as a result since the typically moist foreskin that is like the eyelids is not present to rub the glans with most developed nations quickly rejected circumcision after noticing its ineffectiveness against masturbation and as a result the united states remains the last developed nation doing it to a significant percentage of newborns this was done as a result of the for profit american health care system promoting myths about benefits of circumcision such preventing penile cancer a b preventing hiv c d despite the usa being the developed nation with the highest hiv rates and circumcision rates e and preventing stds d f as a result circumcision is now brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors and the american health system however circumcision has been becoming less popular as years have passed by in the s over of guys were circumcised in the usa now circumcision rates are as low as in some states more and more parents are discovering that circumcision carries more risks than benefits and realize that by leaving their sons uncircumcised they have the choice of choosing what they d like since the surgery is irreversible circumcision risks include the loss of sexual pleasure according to multiple studies those studies take into effect many sensation points including the foreskin and they involve many participants there have been other studies that claim no difference but they don t even take into effect the nerve endings on the foreskin which as seen in one study are some of the most sensitive points on the penis one study even found an increase in erectile dysfunction rates after circumcision a in another study it was found that females ended up reaching orgasm with and preferring uncircumcised males in out of cases b in addition circumcision is extremely painful on newborns and you risk many bad conditions such as a buried penis when too much foreskin is removed and limits the size of the penis or adhesions or skin bridges that develop from the head to the shaft when the skin heals after the surgery meatal stenosis occurs in up to of circumcised males when the opening of the penis becomes irritated from too much exposure and rubbing and begins to close up and meatal ulcers all those risks are of course not including the possibility of having too much skin removed which can cause discomfort during erections due to lack of skin to allow the penis to expand and could consequently cause a hairy penis by pulling pubic hair and skin to the shaft often a circumcision scar develops around the penis after circumcision in addition circumcision has negative effects on breastfeeding to conclude here is a link that describes the anatomy of the foreskin and the development of the foreskin with infants a link especially helpful for parents a ultimately one survey found that although uncircumcised guys are a bit more satisfied percentage wise it s within the margin of error the only difference is that those unsatisfied uncircumcised guys can simply get circumcised and end up satisfied either way in addition in one survey it was found that up to half of circumcised guys expressed concerns on wishing to have had the choice themselves that along with the risks and negative effects that are being seen more with the help of the internet may be what is bringing down circumcision rates

male circumsicion some considerations which one do you prefer any sexual preference could answer c or un c circumcised is there any difference in terms of the smell of both types c and un c and is there any difference in term of sexual pleasure does anybody experienced any infection due to uncircumcised penis thanks in advanced how about the theory that by circumsizing the sensitivity of the male organ is less therefore the enjoyment of female sexuality is increased because the tissues is harder which is the rubbing force is stronger opinion i'm uncircumcised and never had a single infection nor does it smell if you keep it clean takes seconds once a day when you shower otherwise you seem to want a lot of research links so let me help you out circumcision is a traditionally jewish and muslim procedure although it was introduced and encouraged to the western developed world as a way to stop masturbation especially with the help of dr kellogg see link however although scientific studies have discovered that circumcision harms masturbation by up to over needless to say it doesn t completely stop masturbation many circumcised guys find it more convenient to use a commercial lubricant as a result since the typically moist foreskin that is like the eyelids is not present to rub the glans with most developed nations quickly rejected circumcision after noticing its ineffectiveness against masturbation and as a result the united states remains the last developed nation doing it to a significant percentage of newborns this was done as a result of the for profit american health care system promoting myths about benefits of circumcision such preventing penile cancer a b preventing hiv c d despite the usa being the developed nation with the highest hiv rates and circumcision rates e and preventing stds d f as a result circumcision is now brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors and the american health system however circumcision has been becoming less popular as years have passed by in the s over of guys were circumcised in the usa now circumcision rates are as low as in some states more and more parents are discovering that circumcision carries more risks than benefits and realize that by leaving their sons uncircumcised they have the choice of choosing what they d like since the surgery is irreversible circumcision risks include the loss of sexual pleasure according to multiple studies those studies take into effect many sensation points including the foreskin and they involve many participants there have been other studies that claim no difference but they don t even take into effect the nerve endings on the foreskin which as seen in one study are some of the most sensitive points on the penis one study even found an increase in erectile dysfunction rates after circumcision a in another study it was found that females ended up reaching orgasm with and preferring uncircumcised males in out of cases b in addition circumcision is extremely painful on newborns and you risk many bad conditions such as a buried penis when too much foreskin is removed and limits the size of the penis or adhesions or skin bridges that develop from the head to the shaft when the skin heals after the surgery meatal stenosis occurs in up to of circumcised males when the opening of the penis becomes irritated from too much exposure and rubbing and begins to close up and meatal ulcers all those risks are of course not including the possibility of having too much skin removed which can cause discomfort during erections due to lack of skin to allow the penis to expand and could consequently cause a hairy penis by pulling pubic hair and skin to the shaft often a circumcision scar develops around the penis after circumcision in addition circumcision has negative effects on breastfeeding to conclude here is a link that describes the anatomy of the foreskin and the development of the foreskin with infants a link especially helpful for parents a ultimately one survey found that although uncircumcised guys are a bit more satisfied percentage wise it s within the margin of error the only difference is that those unsatisfied uncircumcised guys can simply get circumcised and end up satisfied either way in addition in one survey it was found that up to half of circumcised guys expressed concerns on wishing to have had the choice themselves that along with the risks and negative effects that are being seen more with the help of the internet may be what is bringing down circumcision rates

how to you gain weight at my age i am years old and i weigh lbs and i am ft inches tall i have skinny arms and i'm not very strong however i am constantly active i am a tennis player i occasionally go to the gym maybe once or twice a week i know about weight gain supplements but i am not sure if it is safe to take them at my age i don't want to stunt my growth by weight lifting my doctor told me that i would never gain fat i do not understand i would like some advice on my matter if possible thanx alot you have the same problem i do first thing there's nothing wrong with you you mentioned that you are constantly active what you are doing is you are burning more nutrients than you are putting in your body protein is what you need for the energy and to increase your size you don't need any supplements they only thing i have ever taken was creatine i only took it because i was putting on the pounds to play college football and i have the same problem of not gaining size as you i wouldn't recommend it to you because you don't need it and it won't put on size i was taking it to gain strength also you are only i wouldn't ever take it until you are or older basically all it does is put more creatine in your system so you can push up that last rep that you normally won't your body already has creatine so taking it only puts more in your body to extend the results but don't use it until you are over back to what you need to do number one thing to put on size and gain weight is eat eat lots of protein since you are very active you are burning more protein than you are putting in throughout the day when i put on weight i ate meals a day decent size meals and don't stuff you face this allows you to keep restocking the nutrients in your body that your body keeps trying to burn off while doing everything you do playing tennis and even just walking i ate meals a day and i ate every hours eat before you are starving because when you are straving that is when you have nothing left in your body so your body starts to burn off anything when you go to the gym go days a week or more when you are trying to gain weight one or two days will not do it but don't over work yourself because then you will have a new problem golden rule stay consistant if you eat and workout like this for a week month or months or whatever then stop it will all disappear so stay consistant the daily intake of protein is gram for every pound you weigh you want to gain weight so eat double that you weigh lbs so eat grams of protein a day but remember as you put on weigh that number will increase so pay attention to your weight also make sure you stay active it's always good to good luck  Weight training Dieting Bodybuilding Creatine Anorexia nervosa Milk Tocopherol Guinea pig Super Size Me Obesity Nutrition Protein Coeliac disease Table tennis Garfield Insulin Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Adjustable gastric band Explosive material Muscle Raw food diet Social rule Marathon (sport) Fasting Pound Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain Cheese Omega-3 fatty acid Prostate cancer Paragliding Veganism Stomach cancer Mass Vitamin C Vegetarianism Puberty Humphrey Bogart Hypoglycemia Acorn M16 (rifle) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) American football Protein-energy malnutrition Binge eating disorder Swimming Satchel Paige Calorie restriction Low-carbohydrate diet Swingout Diving Healthy eating Aerial (dance move) Osteoarthritis Theory of conduct National Football League The Contender (television series) Nutrient Professional wrestling throws Functional magnetic resonance imaging Weight Knife The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fancy rat Vegeta Peanut Denis Law Diabetes mellitus Glossary of climbing terms Psoriasis Craps Clinical depression Anchor Ra (board game) Dialysis Exercise Brown Bear Cancer Volleyball Mitsubishi 3000GT Sewage treatment Gold standard Neopets Iron Jackass: The Movie

circumcision is it a bad idea to get circumsized after a certain age im and i've always been a little self concious about it although my wife is totally cool about it she says its fine and it doesn't bother her at all i'd be doing it for me how will it effect our sexual relationship from a sensitivity standpoint can a woman feel the difference will i feel more or less sensation you know with all the don't do it hype that's going on by people who don't know what the difference is i feel compelled to answer this one i've had this done at when i arrived in canada from germany primarily because i had a few long faces made at me by shall we say bed companions so i know perfectly well what it's like with and without which pretty much sets me apart from the majority of those voicing such strong opinions honestly i don't think those people are going to like my opinion the whole sensitivity thing is irrelevant the way the thing works changes and to make a long story short i prefer it by far and i have not had any complaints from females rather the opposite actually one of them was even able to give me a before and after comparison and it came out positive and it somehow does something for your whole well being i feel call me crazy i'm not the type who talks people into stuff but i'd sure do it again for myself  EastEnders Sexual orientation The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Strap-on dildo Human sexual behavior Shaggy dog story Medical analysis of circumcision Milton H.

vasectomy question in april i had a vasectomy physically everything is like it used to be except my right side testicle is still pretty tender i can't run and if i bump it just a little it hurts a very mild crotch hit pain i've called my dr and he says it's normal but most i've talked to have said they healed within a week or two anyone been thru this thanks mine was fully recovered in a week i have heard many men claim that they had some pain months later that usually means they physically exerted themselves maybe lifted something a little too soon after the surgery this is not serious but it is irritating because it takes a while to fully heal  Prostate cancer Sterilization (surgical procedure) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Testicle Babe Ruth Jackass: The Movie Church of Christ, Scientist Stuttering Scoliosis Penis Traumatic brain injury Testicular cancer Bruise Hypnosis Professional wrestling holds Fibromyalgia Acne Traditional Chinese medicine EastEnders Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Castration Strap-on dildo Paget's disease of bone Appendicitis Terran (StarCraft) Professional wrestling throws Kodocha Female genital cutting Pain Iliotibial band syndrome Breastfeeding Milton H.

zit like thing on shaft i just realized a zit like thing on the my penis im not sure what it is but i know i havent been exposed to sex or any std so i really doubt thats what it is anyone got any ideas it's probably just an ingrown hair follicle if it's on the shaft put a warm compress on it or soak in a warm tub to open up the pores and then see if you can pluck it out with tweezers once it gets a white head on it be careful though if you dig around or pick at it you can make it more infected also try washing just that area with salcylic acid facial wash i wouldn't wash the whole penis because it could dry out the skin but it might help the ingrown hair  Acne Textile manufacturing Skin Oral sex Boil Penis Strap-on dildo Puberty Pubic hair Pseudofolliculitis barbae Condom Medical analysis of circumcision Genital wart Body piercing Psoriasis Tattoo Herpes simplex virus Gay slang Safe sex Leather Penis enlargement White phosphorus incendiary Wound Tanning Shaving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anal sex Dandruff Intersex surgery First aid Sexual differentiation Pilonidal cyst Sex toy Transmission (medicine) Manicure The Inside Polar Bear Glans penis Tofu Jock itch Sauna Baldness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Rice Bleeding Dildo Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Conjunctivitis Toilet humour Secondary sex characteristic Wood Collecting fossils Dairy Cleanser Grigori Rasputin Shampoo Escherichia coli O157:H7 Vulva Jute Mange Sexual intercourse Wudu Customs and etiquette of Japan Erogenous zone Aloe Smegma Masturbation Pneumonia Dishwashing Azelaic acid Hypospadias Head Hidradenitis suppurativa 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Jackass: The Movie Crab louse Diving suit Hypertrichosis Hair color Gay bathhouse Pornographic movie Testosterone Razor Marilyn Monroe Penis envy Balanitis Cannabis cultivation Nail disease Laundry Gelatin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Circumcision HIV test Gender role Gliding action Amber The Dalek Invasion of Earth

how to deal with anxiety caused by small penis insecurity is slowly eating me and i feel like this is a curse or some sort this is based from what i found at http www peniswoes com and i'll paste it here the best way to deal with this issue is to try and get over the small size instead of letting this taint all your relationships with other people you should count their blessings and ask themselves if a small penis is really that important in life stop comparing yourself with pornstars and bodybuilders with thighs as big as your torso because such comparisons will do you no good if you were average in physics would you compare yourself with einstein i don t think so the second thing you can do is to look for the more decent girls those who do not move around from one man to another if a girl hasn t had any sex in a while she is sure to be tight enough that your small size won t matter and last but not least learn to trust other people once penis size is out of the way you will understand that friendship and love are beautiful things  Puberty Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Human penis size Penis Human sexual behavior Sex and the City Androgen insensitivity syndrome Friendship Polyamory Karen Horney Meaning of life Boogie Nights The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Mojave people Software engineering Gay slang Sola fide Premature ejaculation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sexual differentiation The nature of God in Western theology Transsexuality Wilhelm Reich Past teachings of Prem Rawat Swingout W.I.T.C.H.

cutting pubes i just cut my pubes was this the right choice and it always itches its getting annoying help wen you shave your lower region it will often cause irritation on the skin causing rashes or sometimes pimples the best way to come about this task is to take a nice hot shower to loosen the roots nd to open the pores then to shave using a five blade razor using shaving cream first time you will most likely cut urself several times but make sure to take small strokes after shaving make sure not to do any activities that will cause sweating for it will cause more pimples if you jst trimmed it nd it itches its because you create 'stubbles' which is short hair that is often sharp nd rough it itches because sometimes these stubbles rub against ur thigh nd makes you uncomfortable  Shaving Pubic hair Razor Beard Pseudofolliculitis barbae Global Gillette Depilation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jock itch Waxing Haircut Head shaving Hair Acne Itch Leg shaving Crab louse Leaf Callus Equine conformation Herpes simplex virus Scabies Strap-on dildo Psoriasis Tarantula Fecal incontinence Woodworking Hyperthermia Dandruff Abdomen Knife Sento Eczema Urticaria Barber Urinary incontinence Violin Urticating hair Mange Tattoo Smallpox Drill bit Payot Skin Rash Hard water Vulva Bulldozer Skinhead Plane (tool) Pediculosis Coffee Prostate cancer Thermoregulation Lawn mower Table tennis 613 mitzvot Candidiasis A Close Shave Stomach cancer Baldness Breastfeeding Cat Manicure Massage Malignant melanoma Tanning Happy Tree Friends Sauna Raney nickel Swimming Anus Katana Terminal ballistics Wood Saw Benzoyl peroxide Pneumonia 2005 Pacific typhoon season Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Old wives' tale Puberty Clothing Barbed wire Internal ballistics Wig (hair) Doxepin Diarrhea Casting Guinea pig History Monks Conjunctivitis Blade Molluscum contagiosum Dermatology Samson Chlorpromazine Textile manufacturing Anarcho-skinheads Table saw

ok im a little curious is a pretty face enough for a man to get a hardon lol thanks hairbob i dont get what u mean im a girl generally no guys are attracted to girls with pretty faces and a pretty face is enough to get them interested enough to go talk to them but we normally don't get all hot and bothered just by looking at someones face however a girl with nice body bare midriff breasts booty legs etc can sometimes lead to an erection because at that point you are undressing them with your eyes im most cases though we normally get erections when there is some sort of physical stimulation dancing making out etc i'm sure the same thing goes for women in that a guy who has a nice looking face isn't usually enough to get them hot and bothered but a muscular guy with his shirt off smooth chest and ripped abs probably is  Aerial (dance move) Toplessness Physical attractiveness Breast Cliff Richard Theory of conduct Brassiere Nudity Milton H.

does circumcision haf any side effects or will it affect my sex life what will happend during circumcision will it be painful during a circumcision you would be given a local anesthetic to numb the area so when they cut off your foreskin it shouldn't hurt it will likely be painful afterwards as you heal but that's what painkillers are for from what i hear erections can pull on the stitches and cause pain and the glans penis head will probably feel oversensitive for about a month as it's constantly exposed which it isn't used to as for side effects or effects on your sex life that's hard to say there are tons of anecdotes of guys who got circumcised and loved it and from guys who got circumcised and felt it was the worst mistake of their lives so it's a toss up in a sense but there are a few studies that might help you make that decision circumcision does remove a lot of the nerve endings found in the foreskin and these nerve endings could otherwise contribute to sexual sensitivity if not removed links also several studies seem to indicate that the foreskin may actually be beneficial to the sexual satisfaction pleasure of not only the man but the woman as well links so it seems like in the majority of guys that get circumcised it tends to have negative effects on their sex life this isn't universally true as there are guys who've have improvements after the procedure they're just in the somewhat minority but those guys probably had physical medical problems with their foreskins to begin with so an improvement makes sense other side effects might be that it's no longer possible to comfortably masturbate without using some kind of external lubrication as there might not be enough skin left to move this is true of a lot of circumcised guys but not all and so things might require a little extra effort and there might be a mess to clean up all in all it's your choice and that's a big deal if you feel that you'll only improve from it go for it if you're unsure or undecided might not be a good idea as your indifference could cause you to regret it if you go through with it see link for a story about a guy who got circumcised and rather regretted it  Medical analysis of circumcision Circumcision Prostate cancer Female genital cutting Masturbation Phimosis Ridged band Human sexuality Orgasm Condom Human sexual behavior Brit milah Gliding action Circumcision advocacy Intersex surgery Sexual intercourse Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Sex organ Smegma Glans penis Sexual arousal Clitoris Strap-on dildo Penis removal Child sexual abuse Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Body modification Prince Albert piercing Penis enlargement Fecal incontinence Balanitis xerotica obliterans Sex toy Gay slang Infantilism Frenulum Anal sex AIDS Vulva Hormone replacement therapy (trans) History of intersex surgery Pain Reflexology Anesthesia Social rule Premature ejaculation Sexual abstinence Penile cancer Herpes simplex virus Bondage (BDSM) Sharia Happiness Psoriasis Erectile dysfunction Sex and the City Erection Acne Breastfeeding Personal lubricant Blood on the Tracks Theory of conduct Transsexuality Man Sexual fetishism Infant baptism Clinical depression Safe sex Multiple sclerosis Massage Cancer Zoophilia Stomach cancer Childbirth David Reimer Balanitis Human sexual response cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Erogenous zone Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fasting Narcissism Epidural Autism Utilitarianism Microeconomics Sigmund Freud

can people tell when you have an erection i know this question sounds a little juvenile but i don't go around looking at other guys crotches so i decided to ask you guys when you or another guy gets an erection does it stick out of your pants or something i've always heard that teenage erections are such a big deal but i've never really had a problem with them i wore breifs before my penis really started to grow so i would always just keep it kind of stuck up against my stomach now i wear boxers and i still don't see how it could just stick straight out i'm not small in the inch range but my jeans won't even stretch enough to let it just stick straight out plus it's terribly uncomfortatble so i usually just keep things constricted under my waist band if i can it's only a problem when i'm wearing slacks or loose pants and i tend to point downward so it looks like i've got a king size sharpie marker in my pocket i swear i'm not being gross i just really have never know this i'm by the way is that a king sized sharpie marker you have in your pocket hahah luke you are still a funny young dude i do what you do tuck it up if it happens and if i am wearing a loose shirt over my pants i can walk around if not i just sit down and try to think of my tax return insert something boring i have used this puberty trick for least years oh except i strategically locate my briefcase when i get a traveller a regular occurance for no known reason when the airplane lands good to see you can take all this growing up in your stride  Aerial (dance move) Jackass: The Movie Equine conformation Human penis size Goatse.cx Strap-on dildo Softball Penis Professional wrestling holds Canadian Armed Forces Recurring South Park characters Kyle Broflovski Puberty Poker jargon Undergarment Trousers Humphrey Bogart Internal ballistics Sharpie (marker) 24 Hours of Le Mans Eric Cartman Fast bowling Skinhead Rave party Double bass Clown Trailer Park Boys Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marching band Goaltender Teen Girl Squad Belt (clothing) Billiards Kimberly-Clark Corporation The Amazing Race Boxing Beavis and Butt-head Garfield Jesuit College Preparatory School Hazing Professional wrestling throws Chess strategy and tactics Russian joke Jeans Condom Volleyball Drill bit Bonus Stage Comanche Kilt Shit Japanese tea ceremony Heracles Social rule Microeconomics Escape from New York SpongeBob SquarePants Shen Gong Wu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Diving Betting (poker) Paul Is Dead Euphemism Recess (TV series) Pantyhose Androgen insensitivity syndrome Supply and demand Gramophone record Intersex surgery I Am Furious Yellow Sydney Riot of 1879 Toilet humour Mojave people New Zealand English Violin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gray Wolf Okashina Okashi The Warriors Motion capture Time Out of Mind Australian words Skateboarding trick Doug Skirt and dress Singlish Suit (clothes) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy New York Giants Shirt Mattress Blonde on Blonde Theory of conduct A Night in Heaven Brassiere Buddy Guy

penis size seems too small i am years old but my penis is only inches long and inch wide is this too small i am scared of what a girl might think becuase i am still a virgin thanks in advance your problem is that you re worrying too much about your size you re basing your whole manhood on how many inches you have instead of what you re worth as a man or what are you going to tell me that all you have to offer a woman is your penis there s nothing else good about you if your penis is all you are worth actually let me correct that all that you think you are worth then you must seek psychological help let s imagine that you have a smaller than average size so what are you going to sit there cry b itch about it feel sorry for yourself or even throw your money away buying pills why not use all that energy and use it in educating yourself on how to really please women i say really because there re a lot of guys out there that think that penis size is everything hell with penis size most men think that their penis regardless of size is all women need in bed do yourself a favor think really hard about what i m about to say you do not need a penis to satisfy women if a penis is so indispensable when it comes to pleasing women how is it that lesbians who don t even have penises can satisfy other women i've talked to a lot of girls who swear that a skilled lesbian can satisfy them in ways that most guys even with big penises can only dream of oh please put aside the misconception that lesbians always use dildos vibrators which is not true at all i know some lesbians bi females that have never owned nor used one that's something that women do in porn movies because those movies are targeting men i m not saying that some don t use them but ask any lesbian that use them and they ll tell you that they can live without them i used to have a penis after a surgery to remove some fibrous tissue that had built due to injury i end up with a penis to put it in perspective business cards are usually long which means that i'm longer than a business card at first i wasn t too happy about like most guy would too but after a few months after my surgery i ve come to realized that it was a blessing in disguise in fact i never really wanted to have the size that i now have but if i was given the choice of going back to my old size i probably would but only as long as i was able to keep the knowledge that i ve gained if i were to lose that knowledge in the process of going back to my original size i wouldn t want to go back no way my new size has made me rethink about the way that i used to try to please women i used to think that i was a great lover now i know that i never was at least not to the extend that i could had been i was pretty selfish like most guys i ve spent a lot of time after my surgery listening to women talk about sex asking them questions about what they really want in bed so on after talking to a lot of them including lesbians bisexuals i live close to west hollywood which in case you don t know it s a gay community i now have a better understanding of what women really want in bed i now compare sex with a nice romantic dinner our penis regardless of size is not the main dish on the table kissing hugging caressing in other words lot s of affection is the appetizer a full body massage with soft kisses all over her body is a great appetizer then comes the main dish which is a combination of masturbation and oral sex on her not you dummy once she s had enough once she s pleased then your penis becomes the dessert and the main dish for us guys then comes the toppings whip cream nuts etc on the desert the toppings are the kisses the holding and caressing that comes after sex while laying in bed together the smaller your penis the more this is true unfortunately most guys specially big guys think that a couple of minutes of kissing masturbation and or may be some oral sex is the appetizer their penis is the main dish the dissert all rapped into one some guys think that the appetizer is the girl going down on them not the other way around in case that what i said above doesn t help you reprogram the way you think i ll leave you with the following interesting fact according to many surveys and studies on penis size the female orgasm very few women ever achieve orgasms from penetration alone and get this regarless of the size of the penis think about it  Human sexual behavior Penis Anal sex Sexual intercourse Child sexuality Orgasm Gay slang Puberty Masturbation Lesbian Sex toy Physical

what helps raise alpha reductase levels i am interested in knowing if there any foods or products that will raise those levels honestly something along the lines of primobolan or dianabol would work best but those are both class banned substances in he u s you might want to try dhea which is about the only legal pre test that is left on the market it is known for giving androgenic effects usually most people are more interested in the anabolic side of their hormone split because it will help you gain the muscle without the hairloss bodyhair acne and voice deepening if you can get a hold of the primobolan it has fewer side effects than dianabol good luck in your search  Anabolic steroid Acne Testosterone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prohormone Methandrostenolone Androgen Puberty Dehydroepiandrosterone Polycystic ovary syndrome Pharmacology Prostate cancer Baldness Hormone Androgen insensitivity syndrome Androstenedione Nandrolone Oxandrolone Doping (sport) Insulin Virilization Adrenarche Bodybuilding Growth hormone treatment Adrenal gland Steroid Intersexuality Weight training Human chorionic gonadotropin Steroid hormone Oxymetholone Baldness treatments Oral contraceptive Growth hormone Antiretroviral drug Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Cholesterol Statin Aspartame Protein Diabetes mellitus Transsexuality Organic food Dihydrotestosterone Urinary incontinence Food and Drug Administration Sexual differentiation Antiandrogen Clinical depression Endocrinology Cancer Cryptorchidism Secondary sex characteristic Progesterone Tax Unemployment Exploitation Nutrition Fatty acid metabolism Scar Folic acid Tocopherol Glucokinase Cocaine Isotretinoin Livestock Glucocorticoid Insulin-like growth factor 1 Chronic fatigue syndrome Anabolism Growth hormone deficiency Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Amineptine Animal testing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Democratic Party (United States) Consensual crime Economy of the People's Republic of China Progressive tax Explosive material Follicle-stimulating hormone Biology and sexual orientation Obesity Breastfeeding Multiple chemical sensitivity Ben Johnson (athlete) Microeconomics Pharmaceutical company Breast cancer Delayed puberty 5-HTP Quicksort RISC Organic farming Dexamethasone Thyroid Chemotherapy Sleep Tariff Free trade

another question for the men mmkay honestly i've never gave a bj i've done everything but and because i haven't done this but everything else i'm really self conscious because of this and tomorrow is my first attempt so of course i'm going to not be good at it so what are some good tips and some advice on not being so self conscious about it i love how you started with mmkay too funny ok when giving a bj try to enjoy the experience even though we know if not your favorite place to be be playful giggle a little its ok to be a tease here its really important that you maintain eye contact as much as possible as the experience for a guy is very intense afterall you want the guy to focus on you and the experience and not on anything else first you could run your hands around the area without actually touching it then try gently blowing some air onto the head of the penis as well as the balls use your lips tongue and teeth as well as your hands all over the glans head the shaft and the balls do alot of kissing nibbling and sucking its ok to pull one ball into your mouth by sucking don't worry about trying to deepthroat the dick that may be fine for porn stars but no normal guy is going to expect you to do it at some point you are going to want to start jerking off the penis with one of your hands just remember that this is most likely going to cause the guy to ejaculate which is the whole point of the exercise anyway before that time you need to decide if you are comfortable swallowing or not since its your first time i would recommend that you don't try it at least not yet many girls have a negative experience the first time swallowing but eventually enjoy it you might want to discuss this prior to the experience guys can be sensitive about the whole swallowing thing we can interpret it as rejection when a girl is not willing to do it if you can't or won't do it yet then at least avoid immediately spitting it out instead you could make a game out of seeing how far you could get him to shoot while you're jerking him off enjoy  Milton H.

is there a way to naturally increase your testerone level i can't get a hold of barry bonds any suggestion since nobody has answered this yet i'll throw in my hat no the only way to increase your testosterone above what your body can make would be through artificial testosterone there are natural ways that you can support the testosterone that's already in your body though you can do heavier workouts and harder exercise to naturally boost your testosterone you can also use a natural supplement as well like dhea tribulus testeris zma yohimbe and longjax also called tongkat ali however most all of those have some sort of warning on them because anytime you may have an increase in testosterone your body may have to get used to it with any testosterone increase the common effects are increased sexual energy aggressiveness not always the good kind facial hair growth in women irritability etc the warning on all of them is to not use if you are under under for women in some cases plus you should ask your doctor if there's a problem like heart trouble all that being said it's best to ask a doctor if it would be safe for you to take do anything to support your testosterone whether that be a workout regiment or supplement just to be on the safe side  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Weight training Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baldness Puberty Puncture Vine Hair Dehydroepiandrosterone Acne Sexual attraction Bodybuilding Prolactinoma Hormone replacement therapy Androgen Anabolic steroid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autism Sexual differentiation Polycystic ovary syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Dihydrotestosterone Osteoporosis Sadism and masochism Breastfeeding Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Erectile dysfunction Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Adrenal gland Anorexia nervosa Tocopherol Creatine Folic acid Growth hormone treatment Estradiol Gigantism Hormone Depilation Exercise Stomach cancer Adrenarche Human nature Psoriasis Delayed puberty Herpes simplex virus Omega-3 fatty acid Physical attractiveness Intersexuality Prohormone Anger Turner syndrome Left-handed Biology and sexual orientation Andropause Atkins Nutritional Approach Homosexuality and transgender Antiretroviral drug Aikido Anemia Mesothelioma Gay slang Cryptorchidism Handedness Protein Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Triathlon Intersex surgery Nuclear weapon design Stroke Castration Digit ratio Tobacco smoking Tour de France Ultimate (sport) Animal communication Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Equine conformation Eczema Dieting Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Human chorionic gonadotropin Sugar substitute Dragon Booster Organic farming The Parting of the Ways DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Hypertrichosis Progesterone Breast Body piercing Obesity Diving Baseball

question about supplements for weight training okay i bought some supplements to help in my weight training and am not sure what they are for or how effective they will be i just kind of bought whatever the sales clerk suggested the supplements are myoplex nutrition shakes hmb l glutamine creatine monohydrate zinc magnesium aspartame amino burst protein bars with some sort of bee stuff in them has anyone used these and can you tell me how effective they are as you have found out there are a plethora of supplements on the market given your list my opinions are myoplex nutrition shakes i myself prefer a isolate whey protein powder there are many brands on the market and as with most supplements 'you get what you pay for' i use pro nos whey isolate complex and i'm satisfied with the results as a side note i wouldn't mix protein powders with water or even fat free milk use milk while i'm on the subject of proteins and milk let me say this do not take soy supplements of any kind whatsoever soy is not a good protein at all avoid intaking it whenever possible hmb it's alright but if you really want to try a supplement that elicits an increase of your own growth hormones testerone primarily then i would recommend vy tech's hd i would recommend that you wait a while before considering such supplements you may find that you do not need them to get the results you're after glutamine now this is an essential supplement to facilitate mass building and you've many options for how you want to take it the powders are good but i feel the capsular products work as well creatine creatine does add some explosive power to your workout but most of the 'mass' you will see water retention you also shouldn't take creatine for more than a couple of months straight as it can be hard on the kidneys honestly i would not recommend creatine for someone who is just starting to hit the gym i would only recommend it for those who have hit a 'wall' in their training regimen zinc magnesium aspartame yawn amino burst someone's been to gnc i get most of my supplements from gnc 'amino burst ' is good but i do not think at this point that you need such a hyper loaded amino acid supplement i myself use gnc's amino acids and it seems to be working fine for me note however that my pronos protein powder is supplemented with amino acids as well protein bars i only eat them when i know i'm not going top be able to meet my protein intake goals for the day i like detour bars they contain mostly whey protein and they come in a regular and a low carb bar they taste 'okay' which is saying a lot for a protein bar most protein bars taste like ss again jack if you have any more questions don't hesitate to e mail them to me and i'll do my best to answer them  Protein Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Nutrition Aspartame Vegetarianism Tofu Soybean Dieting Folic acid Cheese Protein-energy malnutrition Tocopherol Insulin Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Amino acid Magnesium Prostate cancer Dairy Soy milk Zinc Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian nutrition Herpes simplex virus Protein sequencing Iron Infant formula Organic food Chocolate Osteoporosis Nutrient Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Long-term potentiation Anorexia nervosa Antiretroviral drug Food and Drug Administration Cell (biology) Ice cream Illegal drug trade Kidney stone Healthy eating Growth hormone Fire extinguisher Cystic fibrosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Food Guinea pig Monosodium glutamate Vitamin Tryptophan Origin of life Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Explosive material Ramen Kit Kat Vitasoy Vitamin C Brewery Colorectal cancer Flour Signal transduction Carburetor Genetic code Coffee Sugar beet Alzheimer's disease Soft drink Hypomagnesemia Kosher foods Gelatin Obesity Aluminium Clinical depression Bread Osteoarthritis Essential amino acid SoBe Water Chronic fatigue syndrome Glucokinase Dietary fiber Glucocorticoid Cocaine DNA

a good starting weight for dumbbells i'm a year old male up until last year i worked as a nursing assistant for a few years and all the physical labor kept my arms pretty tone now that i've been working a computer job for a year and getting little exercise i can tell quite clearly that my arms don't have the strength they used to been doing tae bo to improve my physical shape in general but it's not doing much for my arms i am interested in dumbbells but don't know what is a good weight to start with is a good weight something you can lift quite easily or something that will tire you out quite fast or something from between lbs seems kind of nice i can feel the weight well but it's not so much that i wouldn't be able to do repeated sets of exercises i am new to all this stuff i suggest you buy the kind of dumbbell that is adjustable and not the kind that has a pre fixed weight in that way if you feel that you are not improving with the current weight that you are using you can purchase weight disks to add to them so you can start with the smaller one if i may add buy two lbs and two lbs disks as starters you can use these dumbbells for biceps triceps deltoids trapezius chest and back with different exercises thus you can prepare yourself with these two different weights you can use the smaller one if you think the bigger ones are more difficult to handle in a specific exercise like the one handed tricep press hey you can even purchase pounders just in case with some of these exercises you can handle heavier weights and with others lighter weights are advisable do not try to push yourself and use heavy weights immediately or you'll risk injury you know that your exercise needs a little push if after three sets of repetitions your arms are still not tired you can purchase a complete set but it will be expensive it is cheaper to canvas those that give cheaper weights for the disks since you will still use the same weight only the price and slightly the quality of the disks differ regarding the exercises you can buy some mens health fitness magazine or just google the exercises too many websites offer suggestions on every body part thus it is not difficult to find one it is advisable to have several exercise on a specific body part your body can easily adjust to the stress that you give to it so be able to change your exercise say after two months of doing such it is better to keep your body guessing so to speak goodluck exercise is always good for the body  Bench press Equine conformation M16 (rifle) Dumbbell Inflation Car handling Scapula Physical attractiveness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress Tai Chi Chuan Elbow-joint Violin Digital photography Microeconomics Internal ballistics Gross domestic product F-16 Fighting Falcon Breastfeeding Alexander Technique Anchor Chair Phonograph Mitsubishi 3000GT Toyota MR2 Atari 8-bit family Helicopter Hard disk Bicycle brake systems Pound Volleyball Childbirth Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Stuttering Repetitive strain injury Sport utility vehicle Aerial (dance move) Floppy disk Bruce Lee Social rule Anorexia nervosa Knife Airsoft Bicycle frame Virtual memory Table saw Handloading MS-06 Zaku II $ale of the Century Amstrad CPC Puberty Heinkel He 112 Supply and demand Back injury CPU cache Swingout Professional wrestling holds View camera Extreme Programming Butterfly stroke CPU design Turbocharger Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Casualty lifting Brassiere Heinkel He 100 M60 machine gun Windows 2000 Computer Urinary incontinence Obesity Deadlift Mouse (computing) Debugging Professional wrestling throws Wing Chun MAME Free trade Drag racing Sport rowing Fast bowling Unemployment Scientology beliefs and practices IPod Gramophone record Tire Theory of conduct Binoculars Ford Thunderbird NeXT

chest work out after protein drink after i work out my chest my chest gets big and i can do the dance with my chest but after i drink my protein drink after a while i can't do it and its not as big as it was should i stop drinking it or what after you work out your chest or any body part at that you get a pump this means your muscle expands gets bigger for a little while it has nothing to do with the protein drink go work out your bicep and they will enlarge pump and then eventually go back to normal this happens because when you work out your muscle breaks down and then rebuilds itself in a way in the process it's trapping water and blood to help with the cooling down as you would say the pump is purely water thats it has nothing to do with the protein eventually when you get more muscle in your chest you will be able to do the dance all you want but in order to do that gain muscle in your chest then protein drink will be your best friend take a protein drink protein carbohydrate even better before you work out maybe minutes and tehn one right afterward and one in the morning when you first wake up when your body needs to be replinished the most protein as you may know is the building block of muscles so when your body breaks down the muscle to build it back up again it needs protein as protein is literally a building block of muscle sole purpose of it is to build muscle with that said you also need good quality food protein drink is a supplement and should only be used as such a supplement nothing beats quality food but protein drinks help bridge the gap stick with tuna eggs and meat among other things good luck and good dancing  Bodybuilding Weight training Veganism Biochemistry Atherosclerosis Milk Myocardial infarction First aid Chicken Brewery Cirrhosis Insulin Coronary heart disease Protein-energy malnutrition Sin City Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Atkins Nutritional Approach Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Glucose Nutrition Vegetarianism Heart Lung Cardiac cycle Honeybee Puberty Piccolo Junior Saga Insect Muscle Gelatin Creatine Conker's Bad Fur Day Multiple sclerosis Blood Professional wrestling holds Marathon (sport) Breastfeeding Water Fasting Obstetrics Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Alzheimer's disease Ice cream Zinc Tooth enamel Urinary incontinence Myasthenia gravis Warm-blooded Cancer Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) House music Hypomagnesemia Thyroid Wound healing phases Jackass: The Movie Respiratory system Wing Chun Healthy eating Ventricular fibrillation Carbon dioxide Vitamin C Nutrient Glucocorticoid Soy protein Anabolic steroid Sarcomere Aztec Autonomous building Signal transduction Reptile In-N-Out Burger Potassium Naruto jutsu Low-carbohydrate diet Glycogen storage disease type I Surimi Spider Growth hormone treatment Equine conformation Eye Morphogenesis Testosterone Hydrochloric acid Fugu Anemia Allergy Inclusion body myositis Diabetes mellitus Caffeine Water purification Food Cocaine Stem cell

i may have a problem with my foreskin when a man with a foreskin is erect is he meant to be able to pull the foreskin all the way back to reveal the whole head of the penis i am only able to pull my foreskin back halfway it simply wont go back any further without hurting because of the bit of skin that connects the foreskin to the head i am not looking for any stupid answers i just want to know if this is normal thanks in advance it sounds like you might have a tight frenulum link the bit of connective tissue that tethers the foreskin to the glans penis head a tight frenulum is often treated in much the same way as phimosis a condition where the foreskin opening is too tight narrow the first thing you should try are stretching exercises link towards the bottom for the frenulum certain prescription creams may work as well link in any case a tight frenulum is a rather minor issue that is usually easily resolved circumcision for such a condition is overkill and you should ignore any comments opinions suggesting that circumcision is the first best option because it might actually be the worst  Penis Foreskin Foreskin restoration Frenulum Circumcision Erection Masturbation Balanitis xerotica obliterans Gliding action Ridged band Intersex surgery Balanitis Body modification Glans penis Smegma Plastic surgery Vulva Penile cancer Female genital cutting Erectile dysfunction Oral sex Human penis size Penis enlargement Prince Albert piercing Circumcision in the Bible Strap-on dildo Sexual fetishism Subincision Androgen insensitivity syndrome Genital modification and mutilation Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus Clitoris Prostate cancer Orgasm Breastfeeding Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Human sexuality Massage Skin Urinary incontinence David Reimer Circumcision advocacy First aid Stomach cancer Sexual arousal Obstetrics Plame affair Modem Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penis removal Horse tack Psoriasis Equine conformation Gay slang Erogenous zone Body piercing AIDS Sexual intercourse Nudity Cryptorchidism Social rule Contract Corpus cavernosum Canon (fiction) Chancroid Radiation therapy Textile manufacturing Man Poker jargon Carpal tunnel syndrome Holy Prepuce Professional wrestling holds Wound Sharia Anchor Acne Sex assignment History of intersex surgery Cascading Style Sheets Premature ejaculation Gospel of Thomas Fecal incontinence Cervical cancer Spina bifida Battle of the Bulge Swingout Pre-ejaculate Stopping power Genital integrity Kyle Broflovski Cephalic disorder Sleep apnea

sexploration tell me anything and or everything about sexploration first realize that your genitals are among your body's most sensitive parts their skin is the thinnest of any the younger you are the more sensitive it seems to be but it's easy for anyone to irritate or damage that skin there are types of injury that you risk temperature burns chemical burns abrasion scuffing or chafing the skin and for males damaging the circulation system in your genitals if you heat anything in a microwave oven or on a stove intending to put your penis into it or put it into your vagina test it first on your cheek or the inside of your wrist realize that anything such as vapo rub or alcohol that mildly stimulates the thicker skin on your hands arms or legs especially if it contains alcohol or menthol is likely to burn your genitals a surface that may feel smooth to the touch of a finger still could be rough enough to scrape the skin of an erect penis or the membranes that line a vagina tying a string or putting a rubber band around the base of your penis or scrotum if drawn tightly can easily damage the blood vessels inside you need those blood vessels to get and keep an erection although rare it's possible to twist a testicle around inside your scrotum so the testicle's blood supply is cut off the only fix is to go immediately to the emergency room where the scrotum is cut open and the testicle physically untwisted so as to restore blood flow there are normally no bacteria in urine semen or pre cum but your anus abounds in bacteria take great care to keep anything you use for anal stimulation away from other body parts particularly your or a friend's vagina until you can clean it absolutely do not trade anal toys with anyone furthermore understand that although not everyone enjoys anal stimulation people who do can be heterosexual homosexual or bisexual liking anal stimulation is not an indicator of sexual orientation safe lubricants commonly available at home include baby oil kitchen cooking oil vaseline and k y jelly often better when supplemented with water enjoy your body's responses to sexual stimulation but do so responsibly and with respect so you can continue to enjoy that response throughout your life  Masturbation Prostate cancer Gay slang Intersex surgery Androgen insensitivity syndrome Orgasm Human sexual response cycle Puberty Erectile dysfunction Methamphetamine Erogenous zone Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fisting Gender role Sex organ Penis enlargement Anal masturbation Violin Transmission (medicine) Birth control Cryptorchidism Sexual differentiation Testicle Intravenous therapy Vagina Medical analysis of circumcision Female genital cutting Human anatomy Male reproductive system (human) Pneumonia Domestic violence Body piercing Scrotum Vulva Anus Bondage (BDSM) Skin Herpes simplex virus Child sexuality Diving suit Menstrual cup Stroke Human sexuality Urinary incontinence Drill bit Genital wart Salad Fingers Acne Cat Psoriasis Massage Cancer Erection Dildo Castration History of intersex surgery Bleeding Pubic hair Solar power Cookware and bakeware Butt plug 2005 trial of Michael Jackson First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma AIDS Gonorrhoea Physical intimacy Knife Pain Hazing Smegma Eczema Portable stove Brewery Breastfeeding Premature ejaculation Penis removal Carbon dioxide Hand grenade Wound Motor oil Intersexuality Testicular torsion

how can you tell if a guy is circumcised obviously without actually seeing his dick well you could put your hand inside his underwear and give him a feel to see if there's foreskin of course that might get you into trouble you could simply ask him though that might cause a lot of mutual embarassment if he's muslim or jewish there's a really high probability he is circumcised if he is american there's a or greater chance you could ask one of the girls he's been intimate with but by far the most fun is to just pants him pull his pants down unexpectedly one day and take a look  Masturbation Foreskin Kyle Broflovski Phimosis Circumcision Brit milah Female genital cutting Buttocks Trousers Medical analysis of circumcision Ripped Pants Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Boxer shorts Foreskin restoration Social rule Sharia Kimberly-Clark Corporation Human sexual behavior Circumcision in the Bible Toilet humour Jewish Christians Butters Stotch Circumcision advocacy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Penis Human sexuality Undergarment History of male circumcision Smegma Poker jargon Gospel of Thomas Aerial (dance move) Jewish principles of faith Swingout Eric Cartman Midori's Days History of Christianity Social aspects of clothing Breastfeeding Cleveland Browns Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Messianic Judaism Holy Prepuce Judaism Genital integrity Beavis and Butt-head Comic Book Guy Abraham Acts of the Apostles Christianity Humphrey Bogart Dispensationalism Judeo-Christian Pink (musician) Man Gay slang Bayesian inference Apostle John the Baptist Full Metal Panic?

after hours of rest from my workout on my arms if they are still sore is it ok to workout or wait for it i mean workout my arms again most of the advice i have seen in other places says you should wait about hours between workouts of the same muscle groups one place even said if you are just starting a workout program wait til the soreness is gone before you work that group again they talk about dms or doms delayed onset muscle soreness thats why typically you get better results by working one group today a different group tommorrow and maybe even a rd group the following day then repeat the earlier comment about not hurting anything just not having as effective a workout was pretty sensible too an important thing to remember is that you do not build muscle during a workout you tear down muscle tissue you actually build up muscle tissue after you workout when the torn down muscles re build another reason many recommend a protein supplement immediately after a workout it helps those muscles to rebuild best advice wait hrs between workouts of the same muscle groups  Weight training Bodybuilding Exercise Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Stretching Multiple sclerosis First aid Myocardial infarction Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Action potential Atherosclerosis Massage Decompression sickness Folic acid Androgen insensitivity syndrome Paget's disease of bone Marathon (sport) Cancer Growth hormone Post Polio syndrome Clinical depression Scar Vitamin C Tocopherol Repetitive strain injury Battle of the Bulge Insulin Carpal tunnel syndrome Muscle Osteoarthritis Radiation therapy Growth hormone deficiency Glucocorticoid Diving Andr__s Galarraga Stopping power Sauna Terminal ballistics Running Eye Herpes simplex virus Growth hormone treatment Menstrual cup Stroke Nutrition Rocky Mountain spotted fever Overtraining Local anesthesia Inclusion body myositis Protein Duchenne muscular dystrophy Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Narcolepsy Rigor mortis Dieting Bedsore Chronic fatigue syndrome Anabolic steroid Protein-energy malnutrition Triathlon Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Aortic dissection Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mouth ulcer Myopia Androgen Breast cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Elbow bondage Glucose Tourniquet Flat feet Childbirth Dog Psoriasis Homeostasis Epilepsy Enzyme Lactic acid Poliomyelitis Hay fever Insomnia Babe Ruth Triage Diazepam Alzheimer's disease Sexual differentiation Senescence Asthma Experiment Myasthenia gravis AIDS

whats better circumsiced or uncircumcised explain circumcision is a traditionally jewish and muslim procedure although it was introduced and encouraged to the western developed world as a way to stop masturbation especially with the help of dr kellogg see link however although scientific studies have discovered that circumcision harms masturbation by up to over needless to say it doesn t completely stop masturbation many circumcised guys find it more convenient to use a commercial lubricant as a result since the typically moist foreskin that is like the eyelids is not present to rub the glans with most developed nations quickly rejected circumcision after noticing its ineffectiveness against masturbation and as a result the united states remains the last developed nation doing it to a significant percentage of newborns this was done as a result of the for profit american health care system promoting myths about benefits of circumcision such preventing penile cancer a b preventing hiv c d despite the usa being the developed nation with the highest hiv rates and circumcision rates e and preventing stds d f as a result circumcision is now brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors and the american health system however circumcision has been becoming less popular as years have passed by in the s over of guys were circumcised in the usa now circumcision rates are as low as in some states more and more parents are discovering that circumcision carries more risks than benefits and realize that by leaving their sons uncircumcised they have the choice of choosing what they d like since the surgery is irreversible circumcision risks include the loss of sexual pleasure according to multiple studies those studies take into effect many sensation points including the foreskin and they involve many participants there have been other studies that claim no difference but they don t even take into effect the nerve endings on the foreskin which as seen in one study are some of the most sensitive points on the penis one study even found an increase in erectile dysfunction rates after circumcision a in another study it was found that females ended up reaching orgasm with and preferring uncircumcised males in out of cases b in addition circumcision is extremely painful on newborns and you risk many bad conditions such as a buried penis when too much foreskin is removed and limits the size of the penis or adhesions or skin bridges that develop from the head to the shaft when the skin heals after the surgery meatal stenosis occurs in up to of circumcised males when the opening of the penis becomes irritated from too much exposure and rubbing and begins to close up and meatal ulcers all those risks are of course not including the possibility of having too much skin removed which can cause discomfort during erections due to lack of skin to allow the penis to expand and could consequently cause a hairy penis by pulling pubic hair and skin to the shaft often a circumcision scar develops around the penis after circumcision in addition circumcision has negative effects on breastfeeding to conclude here is a link that describes the anatomy of the foreskin and the development of the foreskin with infants a link especially helpful for parents a ultimately one survey found that although uncircumcised guys are a bit more satisfied percentage wise it s within the margin of error the only difference is that those unsatisfied uncircumcised guys can simply get circumcised and end up satisfied either way in addition in one survey it was found that up to half of circumcised guys expressed concerns on wishing to have had the choice themselves that along with the risks and negative effects that are being seen more with the help of the internet may be what is bringing down circumcision rates  Brit milah Strap-on dildo AIDS Human penis size Hypospadias Erection Puberty Human sexual behavior Safe sex Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ridged band Clitoris History of intersex surgery Childbirth Gay slang Body modification Human sexuality Sex organ Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gliding action Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Gender role Radiation therapy Folic acid Child sexuality Balanitis Multiple sclerosis HIV Penis removal Chiropractic Stomach cancer Body piercing Sex assignment Medicine Microeconomics Vulva Birth control Gonorrhoea Single Transferable Vote Traumatic brain injury Chancroid Anal sex Domestic violence Divorce Circumcision in the Bible Sex toy Pain Malignant melanoma Acupuncture Zoophilia Urinary incontinence Genital integrity Methamphetamine Pneumonia Sexual arousal Intersexuality Growth hormone treatment Stroke Crohn's disease Hepatitis C Tattoo Colorectal cancer Tocopherol Transsexuality Gospel of Thomas Human sexual response cycle

guys i got a question i want to know what guys think about lesbians bisexuals because i have had a boyfriend for two years and i am attracted to him but i am also attracted to a girl should i tell him i really want to have some sort of sexual relations with her whether he knows about it or not but i don't want to lie to him what should i do i think you should tell him that you're bi sexual if he has a problem with it then he's obviously not for you so move on however he may not want you to see her too and that is a good quality for him to have too as long as he understands you then he's a good guy if he doesn't want you seeing her at the same time then you have to make the decision him or her but don't cheat it's not worth it every think about having a threesome he might be up for that whatever you do i wish you luck and hope you make the right choice  Sexual orientation Infantilism Gay Lesbian Homosexuality and Christianity Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Social rule Something Positive Homosexuality and Judaism Human sexual behavior Group sex Religion and sexual orientation Bisexuality Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bi-curious Friends Transsexuality Choice and sexual orientation LGBT Reparative therapy Biology and sexual orientation Coming out Transgender Goodness and value theory Heterosexuality Liz Phair Swinging The Ashlee Simpson Show Homosexuality M__nage __ trois Wonderland (McFly album) The nature of God in Western theology Quicksort Transwoman Sex education Humphrey Bogart Pornographic movie Theory of conduct Will & Grace Polyamory Incarnations of Immortality The Rules of Attraction Human sexuality Gender role Stewie Griffin Queer Galactic Civilizations Ra (board game) Recurring South Park characters Gay slang Sex and the City Good Morning, Vietnam Same-sex marriage Teen Girl Squad Pedophilia Kylie Minogue Anderson Cooper Microeconomics Don't ask, don't tell Decision making Zoophilia Hey Arnold!

ok all men serious question about sex is it really all physical attraction for the male sex i was thinking about it today and i realized that we women bash the men when honestly i as a woman also tend to judge a boy with how he looks you are very right both sexes judge each other attractiveness girls are just less obvious then boys about it it takes a long time and maturity before a guy realizes he is being looked at and judged just as he judges women and to be more subtle when he is attracted to a girl i was raised by my sisters as well as my mom and i know girls are harsh and judgmental with each other and the opposite sex they just express themselves differently it is not all about physical attraction a great personality and confidence in yourself goes a long way and men pick up on that every man loves attention and made to feel like he is the king it really does not matter what you look like if you can do that  Gender role Sexual orientation Physical attractiveness Human sexual behavior Gay slang Child sexuality Sex History of intersex surgery Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Transgender Dead Like Me Joke Kylie Minogue Androgen insensitivity syndrome Bisexuality Girl Social rule Sexual attraction John Money Childlove movement Puberty Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Man Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender identity Homosexuality and Christianity Gender Homosexuality and transgender Sex and the City Friends Sex and intelligence Mojave people Zoophilia Bish__jo game Human Cross-dressing Gender-neutral language Anal sex Polyamory Sexual selection Abortion debate Robert A.
