my dsl internet works on off i'm playing halo or surfing the web or whatever and then the internet will cut out on me it is getting super frustrating at first i thought and maybe it still is the cpu in the router getting overheated i had the dsl modem ethernet box placed on top of my router and it tended to get hot however it is starting to seem like something else as i've placed the router and dsl modem off of each other i've check the cables they're all plugged in everything seems fine sometimes i will have just turned the internet on and suddenly it won't work sometimes all the lights will be on on my modem but the activity light won't light up when i click on internet or turn on my xbox and thus i won't be able to go online any helpful ideas or info what a suprise my router is linksys coincidence why are the dsl modems and routers so sensitive to heat i actually have the a c going constantly now and the internet has been working like a charm i had a similar experience with my dsl modem a few years back it was overheating cutting out feel the underside of your modem see if it's very hot when it acts up if so then add some rubber feet to it place them over the small rubber feet that are there already to elevate it above the surface so it gets some air that did the trick for me as far as the router i've had linksys for years without a problem but everyone can get a bad unit so no matter the manufacturer go to their website check for firmware updates do this for both the router the modem oh remove the router from your configuration connect directly to your modem from your xbox or computer to see if this still happens if it does then it's your modem if not then it's your router or communication between the router modem good luck  Router Modem Digital Subscriber Line Xbox Broadband Internet access Password PlayStation 2 Cisco Systems Ethernet Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube Universal Serial Bus Cable modem Nintendo DS Denial-of-service attack Embedded system Laptop Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Xbox 360 Sega Dreamcast IMac Commodore 64 Multiplayer Halo 2 Cable television PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) Computer bus Asynchronous Transfer Mode Internet service provider AppleTalk Internet fraud IPod Computer hardware IEEE 802.11 Computer and video games MDAC Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Carburetor Wi-Fi Drill bit Differentiated services Nintendo Entertainment System Spyware Voice over IP NSA encryption systems Linux Softmodem Lag HomePNA PowerPC ZigBee Routing Dialer ZX Spectrum Internet security First-person shooter Broadband Sega Saturn Distributed computing Central processing unit Wireless LAN Alcatel WRT54G Network address translation Modchip Armored Core Local area network Tire Windows XP DOCSIS Spark plug Secure Digital card RS-232 USB flash drive Neverwinter Nights Thermal power station Serial port Prodigy (ISP) Internet Group Management Protocol Counter-Strike DVD Request for Comments World Wide Web Game.com Equine conformation Web crawler Communications protocol Copy protection ARPANET ALOHAnet

has anyone used an online diary before the concept seems pretty good but i wonder how private they really are i think someone behind the scenes must have access to your entries any suggestions on a good one i have used diary on my computer both online and offline few people prefer to have it handwritten in their notebooks whereas others want more password protected security for offline diaries idailydiary is a very good software the advantage of offline diaries is that it is not accessable from the internet you can access it from you personal computer i have provided the link below and for online diary you can blog your entries i am currently blogging privately which means my blog is password protected and can be accessed over the internet only people who know the password or the people you allow access can access your blog you have option as to if you want to publish over the internet or keep it private and password protected blogger com has features where one can allow access to your selected users your mom spouse etc to users over the internet to edit or add post you decide blogger can be accessed from your gmail account so it is upto you and let me know about your preference  Blog Password Windows XP Google LiveJournal Blogger Diary Trusted computing Internet forum Phishing Internet fraud Online banking Password cracking Steam (content delivery) E-mail Internet Webmail Google Talk Copy protection Computer security Open source culture Social software Podcasting Rootkit Database Opera (web browser) Mozilla Firefox America Online Stopping e-mail abuse Online shop Electronic voting Internet Relay Chat Website BitTorrent Spyware History of Microsoft Windows AOL Instant Messenger Xbox Live Surveillance Anonymity Oracle database Digital rights management MMORPG MSN Messenger IP Multimedia Subsystem Database management system Copyright infringement of software Pretty Good Privacy Slashdot Internet Explorer Internet phenomenon Open access Telnet Google search MDAC HTTP cookie Ebook GameFAQs Link spam Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act BlackBerry Electronic commerce User (computing) Instant messaging E-mail spam The Diary of a Young Girl Buffer overflow Microsoft Enterprise content management Uniform Resource Locator EGovernment Spam (electronic) Scientology versus The Internet Daily Kos File Transfer Protocol Neopets Two-factor authentication Mac OS 9 Virtual Network Computing Mouse (computing) Slashdot subculture Wikipedia Common Unix Printing System Web traffic ITunes Encarta Everything2 Floppy disk Hotmail Samuel Pepys Windows Vista Salam Pax Wi-Fi Protected Access World of Warcraft Malware

is it legal for online store not allowing u to cancel your order ok i bought a arcade stick from estarland com and its the th week since i placed my order and they still havent shipped it yesterday i called them to cancel my order but they told me it can not be cancelled because it was custom made no where on the site has the policy saying you can not cancel orders on custom made items and then they changed their story also first saying they were behind then when i said i want to cancel they said it was already shipped out which i believe they still havent shipped out so is this legal if they gave you a number to call them i would call the police and ask them about the topic and give the police hteir number hey worst case you can't cancel it so you get the arcade stick but if they dont ever plan on shipping it the police can get involved  America Online Something Awful Nintendo MAME Retailer Sega Electronic commerce Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Surveillance Whose Line Is It Anyway?

everytime i open internet explorer it closes i downloaded firefox which works think i should uninstall explo will it hurt to uninstall internet explorer and then maybe reinstall uninstalling ie can corrupt your operating system unless you are rolling back from ie to ie if you are having ie problems follow the steps below hopefully it will rectify it for you first update and scan your computer with your security products such as antivirus and antispyware applications if you computer comes up clean after running your resident security products you may want to consider running a system file checker sfc this can be run in safe mode should you prefer to get into safe mode either hold down or tap the f key repeatedly while the computer is starting up to run sfc close all applications such as office messenger email etc and go to start run type in sfc scannow include the space before the what sfc does is that it attempts to fix or replace critical operating system files sometimes this can be done without the installation disk however it may prompt you for the appropriate operating system installation disk if that is the case then you know that you definitely have file corruption or something missing insert the disk if prompted also you should run sfc using the administrator account if you have the vista operating system the steps are a bit different due to the uac see the link below http vistasupport mvps org system file checker htm don't surf play games or do anything while sfc runs after it is completed reboot your computer one of the major culprits in missing or corrupt operating system files is running a registry cleaner or optimizer they can flag important shared files for deletion or cleanup another cause is malware note before running any registry cleaner or editing the registry always ensure you back it up first if the registry cleaner you are using doesn't have that function you can do it manually http support microsoft com kb  Windows registry Mozilla Firefox History of Microsoft Windows Blue screen of death Rootkit Internet Explorer Malware Anti-virus software Windows Vista Gmail Domain Name System Microsoft Windows Windows Server 2003 Filename extension AmigaOS USB flash drive Mozilla Application Suite Microsoft DragonFly BSD NX bit Kazaa Computer security MSN Messenger Macromedia Flash MDAC Uninstaller Windows Installer Steam (content delivery) Windows Me C programming language Common Unix Printing System Redundant array of independent disks Web browser Patch (computing) Btrieve Novell NetWare Opera (web browser) Database management system Emacs Mach kernel Pretty Good Privacy Forth programming language Internet Relay Chat Linux NTFS Copy protection Phishing Password IBM PC compatible Super Nintendo Entertainment System WordStar ITunes Windows 3.x Mouse (computing) OpenBSD Hard disk Files-11 NPAPI Berkeley Software Distribution System/34 Microsoft AntiSpyware Unicode Skype Computer HTTP cookie Freenet Wget Library (computer science) Knoppix System/36 E-mail Ajax (programming) Common criticisms of Microsoft CPAN Enterprise content management OS/2 Web hosting PaX MS-DOS Macintosh Finder VMware Operating system Dialer Microsoft Jet Database Engine Proxy server Wine (software)

internet browser issues can anyone help alright at this point it seems i should just give up on the internet all together i've currently used internet explorer for the longest time now and i love firefox but recently both have been giving me nothing but trouble you can look at my previous browser related questions for more but basically firefox 's safe mode is giving me hell and it won't show on screen when i start it up but it still shows in the processes tab of task manager oh reinstalling doesn't do squat trust me and now internet explorer keeps freezing after a certain period of time and can't seem to handle more than one window for too long now maybe it's my pc maybe it's memory space issues i don't know what i want to know is what can i possibly do to clear some of these issues up without potentially destroying my computer i'm looking for any suggestions from people experienced with compters but anyone's free to answer thanks sorry that this is long and lengthy but i would suggest to print these out of save to a file copy and paste in notepad first and foremost these are my opinions and have experience several machines that had these on them as well as users using these product not to mention that i have ran each and every one of these myself so as to not confuse those that think that i have not my findings in these products are useless and sometimes scare the normal user also these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the manuals docs for what they download and or buy they just want to install and use stop using the following software avg avg has been known to report false positives also reports tracking cookies as trojan downloaders this is bad practice to me scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news anymore is about trojans worms and virus' maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine most if not all of your experts will tell you to leave this alone avoid it like the plaque ad aware se ad aware is a dangerous program if you do not know how to set it up although it comes with the basic 'normal' user settings those that go messing about will find after changing the settings will remove things from the windows system and then be stuck in a bad situation spybot search and destroy same as ad aware se ewido made by avg now although avg grisoft bought them out or merged which ever you avgt fanatics prefer this product does the same as their software av and scares the user see above avg mcafee system hog although this product is and has been around for decades it still isn't that great of a product as it eats up resources like a hungry dog housecalls not a bad product but installs while online and no option s to uninstall it trendmicro not a bad product but installs while online and no option s to uninstall it panda not a bad product but installs while online and no option s to uninstall it norton system hog although this product is and has been around for decades it still isn't that great of a product as it eats up resources like a hungry dog also this product has to use it's own uninstaller to get rid of it even if you take it out of add remove and reboot your system this pain in the arse software prompts the user to reinstall or it auto does it etrust now owned by ca ms used to ship this with it's feb security update cd set i know i have it and what a load of rubbish kaspersky maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine most if not all of your experts will tell you to leave this alone avoid it like the plaque decent programs to install and use removal software norton removal tool norton removal tool here if you have norton http

please give me the steps to going from dial up connection to wireless i am not a machine whiz nor is my hubby we need instructions step by step thanx we have dish satellite system first you need to determine what broadband technologies and companies are available where you live you may or may not have much of a choice to make depending on the availability of service the choices will be between cable dsl and satellite you may have more than one company to pick from under any of these consider the plan options and speed for price dsl is big on this as many providers will provide you with more speed for more money be aware that whatever speed is advertised is not what you will achieve the speed advertised is the capability under utopia or perfect conditions perfect lines close proximity to the source etc i can't speak for the process on satellite but with cable and many dsl providers you can actually sign up with a local store such as best buy circuit city or even radio shack i believe they will set you up as a customer with the provider and then provide you a self install kit which is often free although sometimes you have to wait on a rebate from there you just follow the directions that they give you and that are included in the install kit box the software cd usually does most of the work for you other than that you just need to consider how much you want to spend and how important speed is to you assuming you live in an area where all types of broadband are available to you consider a few things dsl is a dedicated line meaning no one shares that line with you and it uses your existing telephone line however speed seriously depends on your distance from their station and too much distance may not give you much if any benefit over dial up cable is in a sense a shared line this means that if you and everyone on your block has cable and everyone is downloading videos at the same time you will see a decrease in speed you may also need to have your residence fitted for cable if it is not already you may also be paying more because you are not a customer of the cable company good luck  Cable television Digital Subscriber Line Telephone exchange Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Modem Telephone Internet service provider Ethernet Eircom Voice over IP WiMAX TiVo Power line communication Communications satellite Bluetooth North American Numbering Plan Verizon Wireless Xbox 360 Acorn Computers Asynchronous Transfer Mode Private branch exchange UK telephone numbering plan Digital television Satellite television CPU design Cable modem Nintendo GameCube AT&T Frame relay NTL Telstra Vertical service code Solar power Telegraphy IPod Surveillance CPU cache GSM services Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telewest Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network Computer Central processing unit Teletext Air traffic control Network effect NorthwesTel Xbox Commodore 64 Capitalism Public transport Redundant array of independent disks Microeconomics Password Spyware Media in Canada Electric power transmission Television Alcatel Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Wi-Fi PDP-11 MIPS architecture Prodigy (ISP) NEC Corporation Router BT Group plc British Sky Broadcasting Radio PlayStation 2 Floppy disk Internet fraud Amateur radio Sega Dreamcast Computer and video games StarHub Telecommunications in the United Kingdom Dot-com USB flash drive Coaxial cable General Packet Radio Service Phreaking System/36 Predictive dialer Pirate decryption Satellite internet National Weather Service Television in the United States Tesco Nintendo Revolution ITV PlayStation 3 Oscilloscope

why i need to refresh so often the internet pages need more answers when im accesing internet pages most often i get a messege 'the page cannot be displayed' but after i refresh it works why is happening this all the time downloading torrents might be the problem or even when im not downloading two possibilities are slow processor and a shortage of memory the web page can't be displayed until it is loaded into the ram so if you have the ram tied up downloading or other programs are using it the browser can't display the page everything you do has to go through the processor so its speed controls everything a third possibility would be a slow internet connection it has to send the data to your computer before it can be displayed  Web crawler Sinclair ZX81 CPU cache Windows XP ZX Spectrum Sega Dreamcast CPU design Trusted computing Mandriva Linux Spyware PlayStation Portable Commodore 64 Game Boy Advance Computer BitTorrent File Transfer Protocol Domain Name System Dynamic random access memory Distributed computing Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 GIF Modem Super Nintendo Entertainment System Forth programming language Virtual memory Emacs Atari 8-bit family RISC Ajax (programming) Sega Saturn Web design Mac OS X v10.4 Internet Thread (computer science) Windows 2000 Computer virus Uploading and downloading Netscape Navigator Java programming language Microprogram Novell NetWare USB flash drive TRS-80 Color Computer AmigaOS Opera (web browser) Central processing unit Cell (microprocessor) Computer and video games Apple Macintosh PlayStation 2 Apple II family Google Sharp Zaurus Acorn Electron X Window System PowerPC MDAC Nintendo Entertainment System Windows Vista Programmable logic controller IBM PC compatible Cache Texas Instruments TI-99/4A NX bit System/34 Gmail IA-32 Internet Explorer for Mac Computer multitasking BBC Master Website Timeline of computing 1990-forward System/36 IBM PC ITunes Web application SETI@home Cray-1 System 7 (Macintosh) Web browser 64-bit TRS-80 TI-83 series Arabic alphabet Operating system Computer terminal Original Amiga chipset NeXT Parallel computing Random access memory Hyperlink Memory (computers) MOS Technology 6502 World Wide Web Word processor Mach kernel TI-89 series HTTP cookie Internet Explorer

demonoid invitation code i guess i need an invitation to demonoid could someone give me the code email it to me if possible invitations are hard to come by because demonoid holds its members responsible for those they invite if you download a bunch of stuff without seeding not only would you lose your membership but the person who invited you would lose theirs so people are very wary about those they give an invitation code too certainly isn't very likely to happen to a complete stranger who asks for one on some group or forum it does seem like registrations are never open but keep going there you might get lucky or have a little patience because the torrents first posted on demonoid start showing up on the other torrent sites just a few days later  BitTorrent Internet forum Something Awful Fark.com B3ta GameFAQs World Economic Forum RuneScape cheats Facebook (website) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Gmail Captcha MoveOn Social rule DeviantART Search engine optimization SCO-Linux controversies Internet fraud Homestar Runner Dog agility E-mail spam Wheel of Fortune The Standard Copy protection The Shining (film) Azureus Family Feud Data retention Orkut Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Social software UK telephone numbering plan Stopping e-mail abuse Extreme Programming 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Indian nationality law YaBB Suprnova.org Knoppix AFI 100 Years series Iranian presidential election, 2005 Jeopardy!

when creating a website why does it appear different in ie than firefox so i created a pretty basic website for my company for a new add campaign html host ftp publish and you're done i've got one mp and pdfs linked on the site but here is my curiosity i created with nvu and published all while creating editing in mozilla firefox the site looks crisp and perfect in mozilla but when somebody opens the url in internet explorer the link sizes are all different the fonts are different sizes etc can somebody with experience shed some light on this for me i'm stumped thanks it is because forefox and ie are different programs and use different interpreters to read the web pages they treat some of the html commands differently when developing a page you always have to check it in both browsers and on multiple computers if you use a non standard font for example on you page and someone opens it on a computer that does not have the font ie will suptitute either arial or new times romans for the missing font changing the page there are simple javascript programs that you can download that will detect what browser a person is using then you can set your page so that if someone is using ie they are redirected to version of you web page designed to work best with ie if they are using firefox they are directed to a different version of the page oh and don't forget about opera or safari both which display pages differently also  Mozilla Firefox Cascading Style Sheets User agent Opera (web browser) Mozilla Application Suite Web page Gmail Comparison of web browsers Gecko (layout engine) JavaScript Browser wars HTTP cookie Ajax (programming) International Phonetic Alphabet Portable Document Format Typeface HTML editor Unicode and HTML Ebook Web design Favicon XForms HTML Netscape Communications Corporation Mozilla Thunderbird NPAPI Mozilla Uniform Resource Locator Unicode Netscape Navigator Hyperlink World Wide Web Netscape Browser Website Internet Explorer for Mac Spyware Ruby character Stopping e-mail abuse Netscape Emacs Konqueror Scalable Vector Graphics Wiki Java programming language Domain Name System Forth programming language The Book of Mozilla Safari (web browser) Pop-up ad Neopets About: PostScript Web application OpenOffice.org Google search Tabbed document interface File Transfer Protocol Greasemonkey Windows XP HyperText Transfer Protocol PHP KHTML OmniWeb Wget GIF Konfabulator Arabic alphabet WYSIWYG Internationalized domain name Linspire Spamdexing XMLHTTP Link spam XSL Transformations Computer Apple typography TeX Common Unix Printing System Hexadecimal JADE programming language USB flash drive XHTML Markup language Blogger Web analytics Thumbnail gallery post Mouse (computing) Microsoft Office Rich Internet Application

how do i download faster i have verizon dsl and my comp use to download kb sec now its kb sec what can i do to make things download faster again do you think that downloading too much music and videos would slow down my internet speed there are many things that can affect download speed it would help to know what operating system and web browser you are using but in general deleting your temporary internet files and cookies can only help also possibly you have noticed a general slow down of your whole computer you also will want to run the defrag program to optimize your file locations for quicker access by the operating system it is a good idea to do all these things on a weekly basis to help your computer keep up to speed to delete temp internet files and cookies assuming you have a windows operating system and use internet explorer while the browser is open at the top of the page go to tools and then click internet options on the general tab you should see a button to delete temporary internet files and a button to delete cookies once this is done click ok or just 'x' out of the options box and then close your browser to degragment your hard drive go to start all programs accessories system tools and then click on disk defragmenter once it opens click on the defragment button and wait till the program completely finishes and then you can 'x' out of it hopefully this will help you speed up your system a little also to check your dsl line you can click this link and it will take you to verizon's speed checker so you can see if your line is giving you the correct speeds if not a call to verizon tech help will be needed http infospeed verizon net  Macromedia Flash Mouse (computing) Mozilla Firefox Windows XP HTTP cookie File system Gmail Virtual memory Java programming language Computer Opera (web browser) Google Web browser AmigaOS Macintosh Finder Object Desktop Mac OS X World Wide Web BitTorrent Cache Mozilla Application Suite Web crawler USB flash drive Linux CPU cache Forth programming language Floppy disk MSN Messenger Wget Internet Comparison of web browsers Thread (computer science) Microsoft Windows NeXT Common Unix Printing System Malware Screenshot Defrag HyperText Transfer Protocol PlayStation Portable Windows 95 JavaScript Ajax (programming) Emacs Internet Explorer Windows API Netscape Navigator Verizon Wireless Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Mac OS X v10.4 Kazaa Library (computer science) IBM PC compatible Dialer Portable Document Format EMule Visual Basic Trusted computing Uniform Resource Locator System 7 (Macintosh) Redundant array of independent disks Uploading and downloading File Allocation Table MAME Mach kernel GIF HTML element Hello world program Sega Dreamcast Domain Name System Password E-mail Minesweeper (computer game) Internet Explorer for Mac History of Microsoft Windows Cascading Style Sheets MDAC Btrieve Konqueror Apple Macintosh Computer security Hard disk History of the graphical user interface Wiki Operating system Linked list Wireless Application Protocol CPU design Rootkit Broadband Internet access Web page

will there ever be another com boom like between http en wikipedia org wiki dot com bubble as a web artist and developer by trade i would probably say no the huge boom of the s and early s was because internet technology in the home was new and the bubble burst because corporate investment was faster than adoption web has made information on the internet more accessible usable and fun but it's a gradual increase in visitors rather than a huge boom most of the people who use the internet will continue to use it and many of the people who don't use it regularly will never use it my guess is that the internet will grow slowly and steadily the more ubiquitous it becomes most first world children of late generation y and the upcoming new silent generation will never live life without technology so it's not really a question of whether or not the internet will expand or die but rather how many new ways it will be used  Dot-com Computer World Wide Web Web browser Uniform Resource Locator Linux Internet Explorer History of the Internet Website Mozilla Firefox Generation Y Domain Name System Microsoft Open access Wikipedia Mozilla Application Suite Ajax (programming) Wiki Supply-side economics HTTP cookie Modem Economic relations of Japan Technology HyperCard Wireless Application Protocol The Wiggles Public key infrastructure Open source culture Web traffic Java programming language Economic history of Canada HyperText Transfer Protocol MMORPG Economy of Taiwan Intranet 1990s Phishing Floppy disk Cinema of the United Kingdom IBM PC compatible X Window System Economic history of the United States Bubble Bobble 2000s Economic history of Britain Wget Amazon.com Scalable Vector Graphics Romania Stock market Netscape Communications Corporation Yahoo!

blog advice any pro's out there to all you great bloggers out there i am looking to start a blog that would be used next to my business website the idea would be that i could be more laid back with it but that it could be a lead to my website and business so a bit more professional so not looking for my space or something like that i am looking for one that has many users but that i could link to with my own web name and not so and so at blog company name where can i find such a thing and any bloggin advice appreciated thanx wow i humbly see that this is another world and another language am i gonna need some help or are there any sites for blog challenged no need to feel intimidated by what to write i tell you that you already are sincere and thoughful enough that your enthusiasm for whatever business interest you are pursuing will spill over and make a reader want to know more the links given by the answerer above might be helpful as to where to search here's some advice about what to write these are some things people are always curious about when it comes to enterpreneurs how did you decide what business to go into what advice would you give someone who wanted to start their own business how do you decide what products or services to specialize in you could write in interview format or perhaps strictly as a journal blogs can be very hard to start but once the comfort level is reached you'll find they're a natural extension of what you are thinking and they are a great way to put a personal touch on your business  Network effect Downing Street memo Milton H.

can someone explain to me in plain english how paypal works im confused i get the impression that paypal is easy to understand but i just cant get my head around it could someone explain step by step the process of me buying something if i have an account and also selling i cant work out if paypal is like a credit card or a middleman or what yep a complete newbie question thanks to those who put the effort in to answer this question when you sign up for pay pal you will enter in either your bank account number and bank info and or your credit card info pay pal is in effect a middle man when you purchase something you pay with pay pal and the money is debited from your checking account or credit card and deposited in the sellers account all without anyone except pay pal knowing your account info it is basically a quick and easy and safe way to transfer money if you were the seller when someone buys something the money will automatically be transfered to your account with pay pal you just go to your pay pal account and push the button to transfere into your bank or you can just keep it in your pay pal account and use the money to shop on ebay  PayPal Internet fraud Credit card Debit card Electronic money Money Bank Electronic commerce Automatic teller machine Money supply Credit card fraud Octopus card Cheque Bank fraud Short selling Personal finance Liberty Dollar Monetary policy SmartRider Phishing Monopoly (game) Security (finance) Skype Wheel of Fortune Mortgage Neopets Derivative (finance) Online shop E-gold MapleStory MMORPG Poker jargon Something Awful Forums Citigroup Smart card Schabir Shaik Trial Microeconomics Surveillance Slide rule Stored-value card Double-entry book-keeping Bond Hyperinflation Bank of America Floppy disk Mergers and acquisitions Bulk vending Credit union Economics Contract Option Stock Finance Money creation Mail fraud Visual Basic Tax Enron Corporation Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Commodore 64 Interac Scrip Argos (retailer) The Amazing Race Traveler's cheque Mutual fund Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Identity theft Financial markets Islamic banking Blackjack Certificate of deposit Supply and demand Say's law Filling station Ocean's Twelve Insurance Fiat money Surplus value Annuity Advance fee fraud Slot machine Automated Clearing House Debt Live 8 Economy of Chile London Underground Margin (finance) Financial services Auction Day trading Nintendo GameCube Corporation Loyalty program Oyster card Privatization Payroll

craig's list your experiences how does it compare to similar sites i don't like it because most of the offers you get are scams common sense will tell you that they are but if you don't pick up on it the emails generally say the same thing and saying they'll send you a money order or cashiers check but the way i look at it is it's free so its not costing me anything however i believe other methods of selling your item will produce better results  Advance fee fraud Internet fraud Neopets Spam (electronic) Make money fast E-mail spam MapleStory Lottery E-mail Mail-order bride Gmail Python programming language Stopping e-mail abuse Confidence trick Hash table Argos (retailer) Mail fraud MMORPG Software engineering HTML Inventory Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Surveillance Pyramid scheme RuneScape locations Gambling Octopus card Wal-Mart United States Postal Service Logo programming language Pretty Good Privacy Cheque Web crawler Commodity Credit card Cost accounting Flat tax Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Shogi Gross domestic product Search engine optimization Public good The Best Page in the Universe Overclocking Insurance Aldi Free trade Kazaa Google Mad Money Webcomic Legal research Phishing Internet pornography Magic (illusion) Inflation Law of value Anonymous remailer Filling station Customs and etiquette of Japan Mutual fund CPU cache Laserdisc Transmission Control Protocol Microeconomics Email authentication Bulk vending Vanity press Identity theft Mach kernel Copyleft Spamdexing Computer virus Transactional analysis Opportunity cost Scale (social sciences) Messaging spam Economics Hyperreal number Fuzion Common sense FairTax Jack Thompson Craps The Apprentice 2 Epistemology Open mail relay Tuition Capitalism Art forgery Cable television Scam baiting Arbitrage Hybrid vehicle

what is going on with our bt broadband connection the internet light on our router keeps going out sometimes when the dsl light is flashing but also sometimes when the dsl light is on normally at these times the internet won't work and the only way to solve the problem is by switching the router off to reset it we have also noticed that our broadband connection is running slower we think it may be something to do with our phone line as there is sometimes interference on the line but have no idea what might be causing this as we pretty much eliminated everything that was connected is it just a coincidence that a bt engineer was working in the box up the road from us just before the problems began and if the problem is down to bt themselves and their equipment how do we prove it last time we had problems bt would not accept it could be their fault and instead preferred to try and blame our equipment and yet that problem suddenly righted itself without us doing anything would we be better off having cable broadband i have the exact same problem when the interference on my bt line is really bad i cannot connect to the internet we believe the problem is with the line not any of our equipment we have called bt and an engineer is booked to come out you should definitely phone bt and report this problem although if the engineer finds that the problem is with the equipment inside your house you will be charged about for the call out so check and double check all your filters etc before you call them  Digital Subscriber Line Broadband Internet access Router Modem Embedded system Internet Cable television Voice over IP Telephone Telephone exchange Mach kernel Eircom Cisco Systems Power line communication Floppy disk Ethernet Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cable modem Oscilloscope Denial-of-service attack Integrated Services Digital Network Wi-Fi Satellite internet AT&T Broadband Skype Wireless LAN Public Switched Telephone Network Coaxial cable Phreaking Password HomePNA Global System for Mobile Communications IEEE 802.11 9-1-1 Residual-current device Alcatel Network address translation Universal Serial Bus Car handling High-voltage direct current Low-pass filter TGV Domain-specific programming language Nintendo DS Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor GSM services Fire alarm control panel MDAC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Internet censorship in mainland China New York City Subway nomenclature Federal Communications Commission WiMAX Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PowerPC Frame relay Bluetooth Private branch exchange Ground (electricity) Road-rule enforcement camera Safety engineering E85 IiNet Dialer Personal rapid transit Drag racing Nintendo Revolution Transformer Quality of service Syphon Filter Federal Standard 1037C USB flash drive Static inverter plant The Amazing Race Poker jargon Communications satellite M16 (rifle) Streaming media Computer and video games Uninterruptible power supply IP Multimedia Subsystem Jet engine Welding Routing Lag Border Gateway Protocol 2003 North America blackout Speed of light Dimmer Mobile phone Communications protocol Laserdisc Xbox Super Nintendo Entertainment System 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blue box

shuld i uninstall internet explorer i have internet browsers internent explorer and mozilla firefox i was thinking of uninstalling internet explorer because even with a support of a popup blocker popups still come up and irritate me i heard person telling me that safari is good and i shuld install that instead of i expolorer i wanna hear ur opinions ppl on whether or not i shuld keep i explorer ok you seem to have a couple issues here you think that you should only have one browser installed on your computer answer actually you can easily have browsers installed on your computer with minimal hassle you're getting pop ups if you're not using internet explorer at the time these are caused by spyware or viruses answer download and install the following anti virus avg free http free grisoft com doc us frt prd aff anti spyware spybot search destroy http www spybot info en mirrors index html make sure to also run the immunize section general cleaner ccleaner http www filehippo com download ccleaner firewall zonealarm free http www zonealarm com store content company products znalm freedownload jsp go to the very bottom of the screen you don't like internet explorer and want it gone answer i agree ie's a pain but you do need it on your computer what you can do is take away all the shortcuts and file associations it won't open if you open an old shortcut to a page ie's still on your computer so if when you need to go to the windows updates site it's there to remove ie click on start then control panel click on add remove programs and on the side click on add remove windows components find internet explorer and click remove i personally would just leave it there to rot in the corner and if you like firefox and how it has very few limits maybe you'll try the same idea computer wide linux feel free to get used to the idea look around at stuff etc i personally use ubuntu  Pop-up ad Macromedia Flash Kazaa Gmail Comparison of web browsers HTTP cookie User agent World Wide Web Domain Name System Konqueror Browser wars Wget Rootkit Computer virus Linux Gecko (layout engine) Web page Internet security Proxy server HyperText Transfer Protocol Pretty Good Privacy Spybot - Search & Destroy Uniform Resource Locator Malware Microsoft Windows AOL Instant Messenger Unicode and HTML Phishing Internet Anti-virus software USB flash drive Hello world program Common Unix Printing System Website Windows 2000 Netscape Navigator Blue screen of death Microsoft Web design Google Desktop Mandriva Linux Java programming language Netscape Object Desktop Filename extension Digital rights management Mac OS X International Phonetic Alphabet Wiki IPod Internet Explorer for Mac Ebook Prank flash Trusted computing HyperCard Streaming media Host file Cross site scripting Knoppix Netscape Browser AmigaOS Web crawler PHP Mac OS X v10.4 Emacs Warez New.net JavaScript Linspire Google Web application Trojan horse (computing) CoolWebSearch Screenshot Macintosh Finder Thumbnail gallery post XForms File Transfer Protocol Portable Document Format Apple Computer Spam (electronic) CPAN Scalable Vector Graphics

how do i delete an email i have a hotmail email address and i was wondering how to delete it i want to because i get so much spam emails and i'm sick of it so if you could please give me step by step deletion for a hotmail account thank you well i dont think u can like immediately delete it if u dont pay it but with ur account click on help at the top right corner then where it says click your topic click your account policies then you scroll down until you see the blue options when you get to the blue options under related topics you click where it says close your account then the first set of blue highlighted words say close account page you should click that then you should probably read the paragraph about close account once you have read that click close account warning i cant remember if from this piont you can sign out but if you can press that if not do not visit hotmail for days or your account will still be activated so you have to wait for a month to make another account because if you dont sign into your account within days it will be permenetly deleted which i guess is what you want hope this helped i might be a bit confusing but i think i gave you the right information  Gmail E-mail spam E-mail Internet fraud Hotmail Mouse (computing) Spam (electronic) Webmail Search engine optimization Phishing Stopping e-mail abuse Opera (web browser) Google Advance fee fraud HTTP cookie GameFAQs Cross site scripting Viral marketing Sender Policy Framework Plame affair The Standard Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Forum moderator Wheel of Fortune Password Denial-of-service attack Independent Media Center HTML element MSN Mozilla Thunderbird Malware Netfilter/iptables GameFAQs message boards Blue screen of death Web crawler Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mozilla Application Suite Computer virus Make money fast Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act E-mail address EIA-708 Option key Yahoo!

why do some advertisements online know where i am located i was just on mugglenet com and this advertisment said pete's bbq in my town texas obviously it didn't say my town it said the name of my town so my question is how does it know where i am every device connected to the internet must have an ip address your's is probably x x which is common to home networks your router uses a protocol call nat to convert your home ip address to a internet recognizable address this address is sent to the web server that you're looking so that it knows where to send the response these internet ip's are registered to the company that owns them and it's a simple matter to look up the location that they're coming from occasionally the registered address particularly with large isp's will be different from the office that actually issued yours which is why sometimes the ad's are 'aimed' at a location that's no where near you  Voice over IP IP address Router Denial-of-service attack Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act E-mail spam Routing E-mail Session Initiation Protocol IPv6 Email authentication Transmission Control Protocol AppleTalk Streaming media Password America Online BT Group plc Data retention Uniform Resource Locator IP Multimedia Subsystem Novell NetWare MAC address Internet Group Management Protocol Spam (electronic) History of the Internet Windows Server 2003 Skype Netfilter/iptables Usenet Common Unix Printing System Whois Firewall (networking) GSM services MSN Messenger X Window System Windows XP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Internet protocol suite Communications protocol Internet privacy Web hosting Internet Control Message Protocol Universal Plug and Play Phishing Open mail relay Internet Relay Chat Local area network Proxy server Domain name Border Gateway Protocol Internet fraud HyperText Transfer Protocol Wi-Fi Tor (anonymity network) PowerPC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Web traffic Server Spyware Satellite internet Distributed computing IPv4 address exhaustion Simple Network Management Protocol BitTorrent AOL Instant Messenger FidoNet Internet censorship in mainland China Ethernet Peer-to-peer Cisco Systems Private branch exchange I-name Internet Protocol IPv4 Microsoft Ping Service Location Protocol Opera (web browser) HTTP cookie File sharing OSI model File Transfer Protocol MDAC The Standard Web crawler Internet security Cable television Internet Advertising Spam Prevention Early Warning System Broadband Internet access Grid computing Direct marketing I-number Open Shortest Path First Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol

demonoid invite code could some one please send me one at scubasteveg comcast net invitations are hard to come by because demonoid holds its members responsible for those they invite if you download a bunch of stuff without seeding not only would you lose your membership but the person who invited you would lose theirs so people are very wary about those they give an invitation code too certainly isn't very likely to happen to a complete stranger who asks for one on some group or forum it does seem like registrations are never open but keep going there you might get lucky or have a little patience because the torrents first posted on demonoid start showing up on the other torrent sites just a few days later  Internet forum World Economic Forum Something Awful Fark.com Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bj__rk Social rule B3ta Jeopardy!

can you get scammed on ebay what if you pay with your credit card but they take more money than there suppose to i never used ebay and i was deciding to give ebay a try to look for affordable stuffs please and thanks it's definitely possible to get scammed on ebay never pay a seller by wire transfer my cousin was gonna buy a tractor trailer from a seller on ebay for the seller wanted him to transfer money to a swedish bank account using western union and my cousin did it and didn't consult me about it until after he sent the money i told him that sending a wire transfer to sweden was already suspicious enough and how scammers usually give fake addresses and phone numbers when making such transfers meaning they usually just take the money and run he freaked out and called western union to see if the transaction had gone through and miraculously enough he wrote his account number on the form wrong by one digit so he immediately canceled the transaction it's also preferrable you don't pay by check the safest way to pay for stuff on ebay is through paypal if you want your purchase delivered faster or by money order if you have the patience to wait an extra couple of weeks also beware of any e mails from ebay telling you that you violated their terms of service and that your account will be deleted they provide a link to a page that looks just like the ebay login page but it's meant to steal your information this happened to me once and i logged in only to be directed to another page that asked for my first last name credit card number and pin when i saw that they were asking for my pin i immediately put up a red flag reported this to ebay and was forced to change my password both on ebay and paypal it's also helpful to look at the seller's feedback score and read the feedback from buyers  Advance fee fraud PayPal Confidence trick RuneScape cheats Neopets Bank fraud Surveillance Password Online shop MapleStory Credit card Short selling Mail fraud Live 8 Something Awful Forums Stopping e-mail abuse Electronic commerce Credit card fraud EFTPOS Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Electronic money Stock MMORPG Contract Mail-order bride Bulk vending Something Awful Identity theft E-mail spam Two-factor authentication Western Union Wheel of Fortune Gmail ITunes Music Store Enterprise content management E-mail Spam (electronic) Skype Auction The Star Wars Holiday Special Money United States Postal Service Debit card CPU cache Automatic teller machine GSM services Real estate broker Bank Poker jargon Microeconomics Make money fast Telephone numbering plan Fraud Modem Islamic banking Derivative (finance) Arbitrage Wal-Mart Supply and demand Business-to-consumer electronic commerce The Amazing Race E-gold Craps Telegraphy Schabir Shaik Trial Spyware Universal Serial Bus Direct marketing Neighbours Plame affair Capitalism Futures contract Autograph Knots Landing Annuity Buffer overflow Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind British national identity card Domain Name System Alfie Moon The Inside Driver's license Mail Amazon.com Insurance Data retention Security (finance) Mortgage Teletext

how can i convince my mother rather buying in an online store than in a normal store i wanna buy vista home premiium full version royaldiscount com for half the street store price but she says buying electronics in an online store is a bad thing because the return policy is too hard my recommendation is to calmly and confidently provide her with lots of evidence in support of royaldiscount com royaldiscount com has an overall rating of stars out of stars according to ratings on yahoo's vendor rating site which is really quite excellent http shopping yahoo com merchrating user rv html merchant id as for the return policy it seems very similar to most in store policies plus when you're working with software such as vista home premium once you've opened it most vendors won't let you return it because you could have opened it made a copy of the disk and written down the license key typically you can only exchange it for another disk in the event that it's faulty or scratched so you shouldn't really be focusing on the return policy anyway http www royaldiscount com privacypolicy html i think the good pricing combined with the high ratings and the fact that the return policy is a moot point should help sway your mother to consider shopping online perhaps she's just afraid of the security of online stores if so you can point out that all purchases from royaldiscount com are actually directed through the yahoo store which is well know and secure i hope this helps resolve any concerns your mother may have had gl  Windows Vista Electronic commerce IBM PC compatible Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Microsoft Password Computer virus Floppy disk Microsoft Windows Online shop Linux MP3 Insurance AmigaOS Web crawler Bulk vending Windows 2000 America Online Atari ST Digital rights management HyperText Transfer Protocol NTFS Pretty Good Privacy Enterprise content management Surveillance Windows Server 2003 Atari 8-bit family HTML Internet E-mail spam History of Microsoft Windows HTTP cookie Warez Copy protection Wal-Mart Website Apple II family File Allocation Table Free software Everything2 Mutual fund Computer DVD Intellectual property Commodore 64 Opera (web browser) ZX Spectrum Mozilla Application Suite Microsoft Office Best Buy E-mail Xbox Hyperinflation Monetary policy OpenDocument Web browser Mozilla Firefox Cross site scripting Internet fraud OpenGL Files-11 Blue screen of death Computer forensics Neopets Uniform Resource Identifier World Wide Web Nintendo Microeconomics Contract Free trade MUMPS Lotus Notes Common criticisms of Microsoft Ebook Credit card GNU General Public License MS-DOS Amstrad CPC Gramophone record Open access Supply and demand Apple Computer Macromedia Flash Transport Layer Security Windows registry Steam (content delivery)

is it possible for porn sites to show up on a browser history without going to them at all there a ton of porn sites listed on my computer's internet history the last time i checked my husband denies visiting any i believe he didn't seek out each and every one of them but is it really possible that they all showed up without any of them being visited the browser history is a list of http requests made by the browser it doesn't record whether the page actually loaded why the request was made by typing in a url clicking on a link or by some automated mechanism within another webpage or whether the site was actually viewed there are a lot of schemes out there that will send a request to a url which will send back a redirect to another page or which will pull content from some other url into a frame somebody gets a nickel for each page that gets a hit and there are some nefarious websites that will attempt to open a new window anytime you try to close the window or leave the website pop up blockers and content monitors filters will stop most of this but the request may still get made and recorded there could also be spyware on the machine that is sending information to these sites rather than retrieving information from them finally it is possible that your computer has been infected with malware that runs in the background sending requests for these pages to inflate the website's hit count which enables the website to charge more for advertising i'd run a throurough virus scan and a throurough adware scan i think i'd also clear the history and watch what goes into it over a couple of days you may also want to check any browser add ons that you've installed many of them are infamous for doing things like this in the background  Windows XP Uniform Resource Locator Kazaa Malware HTTP cookie Stopping e-mail abuse Proxy server E-mail spam Website Web browser Computer virus Pop-up ad Cross site scripting Search engine optimization Internet Explorer Comparison of web browsers Common Unix Printing System Web page Thumbnail gallery post Internet fraud Web crawler Mozilla Firefox Prank flash Peer-to-peer Domain Name System World Wide Web Macromedia Flash Gmail AOL Instant Messenger Typosquatting Web traffic Phishing User agent Denial-of-service attack Google search Opera (web browser) NPAPI Rootkit Trojan horse (computing) Blue screen of death Google HTML element Computer Wget Windows 2000 MDAC Mozilla Application Suite Online advertising Web design Netscape Navigator File Transfer Protocol Browser wars Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spamdexing Link spam Favicon Wiki Internet security Cache XHTML BitTorrent Wireless Application Protocol HTML HyperCard Konqueror SAML Microsoft Windows Aggregator Mac OS X Trusted computing GameFAQs Anti-virus software Host file Filename extension Computer forensics Network address translation Enterprise content management Slashdot trolling phenomena Federal Standard 1037C Apple Computer Ethernet Fritz-chip X Window System Ad filtering Uniform Resource Identifier The Internet Movie Database Portable Document Format

safe downloading i usually use bit torrent given the choice of torrent files is huge and the download speed rather okay however i am somewhat concerned about the fact that bit torrent downloads are anything but anonymous everyone can just see my ip so can anyone suggest safer and preferably anonymous methods of downloading to me no p p protocol is completely secure however you can get a certain amount of anonymity by using peerguardian get it from here http phoenixlabs org pg what peerguardian does is that it block ip ranges associated with government agencies movie and music rights enforcement agencies etc thus you will be shielded from the prying eyes of the greedy corporations also azuereus has support for i p and tor routing which are relatively anonymous however it is in its early stage and won't give you an optimal user experience there is also an element of safety in numbers when it comes to p p almost everyone and their grandmothers use p p these days that it's not practical to enforce rights against such a huge number so there is not a lot to worry when you download off p p networks if you are extremely paranoid and cannot sleep unless you are as secure as in a nuclear bunker you can try usenet http en wikipedia org wiki usenet this is a service which has to be subscribed to and costs a small amount of money however usenets allow you to download with anonymity  BitTorrent Anonymous P2P Internet troll Wget Internet censorship in mainland China Azureus Proxy server Peer-to-peer Uniform Resource Locator IP Multimedia Subsystem Skype Spyware Web crawler Mozilla Firefox Freenet Data retention Gnutella Windows XP File sharing Surveillance Global Positioning System Streaming media Internet pornography Modem Independent Media Center Trusted computing Bluetooth America Online ITunes File Transfer Protocol Web browser Stopping e-mail abuse Perl Slashdot subculture History of the Internet Mozilla Application Suite Internet privacy E-mail Common Unix Printing System I2P Paintball HyperText Transfer Protocol Digital rights management Transmission Control Protocol Session Initiation Protocol MP3 Wireless Application Protocol Java programming language EMule Microsoft Redundant array of independent disks Anonymity Computer insecurity TiVo Computer security Spam (electronic) Digital Subscriber Line General Packet Radio Service Internet Relay Chat E-mail spam MSN Messenger Federal Standard 1037C Mach kernel MIRC Multimedia Messaging System Microeconomics Telegraphy SAML CPU cache Computer Corporate governance Pretty Good Privacy Nuclear power Microsoft Windows Open source culture Nuclear weapon design Napster Transport Layer Security Representational State Transfer Mandriva Linux Wiki Distributed hash table Wal-Mart Slackware Quantum computer Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Classified information John Lott DragonFly BSD Hardware random number generator

why do people prefer firefox over i e and opera okay here's the deal i want to know why use firefox when both ie and opera have been proven better tell me one thing firefox has that opera and or ie don't oh and you can't use anything thats been debunked by www firefoxmyths com off the bat this means no saying it's faster or more secure or saying that it has less holes or it has add ons while the other two browsers don't those are just the most obvious ones i wanted to put out there the rest are on the site oh and don't bother saying it has skins that's the least important feature for a browser i'm talking about security and userfriendliness etc p s firefox doesn't the pass the acid two test while opera does and this can even be proved yourself if you wish http www webstandards org files acid test html top it should be a smiley face if your browser passes i've tested it myself and ie and firefox both don't pass let's first go back to why firefox this is a mozilla project it would be against the law for multiple companies to collaborate to make the same product the whole idea is the develop a specification that everyone owns mozilla is that specification of how a browser can work so ie opera netscape sufari and countless other browsers were made to work following that mozilla standard firefox is the baseline development of that standard oddly enough there are many differences between browsers these are the tiny mistakes that designers make when inventing their own of course internet explorer added the activex crap that makes it unique it was in when spyware and adware really started to get rampant on the internet rendering ie nearly useless many windows users discovered that firefox did not have these problems because activex was the target of many of these problems but eventually ie caught up so the importance of firefox has dwindled but firefox made life easier for many windows oriented people so they are loyal to the product yes http www firefoxmyths com tells the story well but that does not mean that people would switch during the late s each version of internet explorer leaped over the previous version of netscape each version of netscape leaped over internet explorer opera gained ground during the ie vs netscape wars even today there are many netscape fans hey many people still hate ie it will take some time to grow i use ie and firefox at the same time i still use firefox to visit unknown websites it's just a habit good luck and happy computing  Netscape Communications Corporation User agent Netscape Gecko (layout engine) Netscape Navigator Windows XP Cascading Style Sheets NPAPI World Wide Web Phishing Mozilla Macromedia Flash Ajax (programming) XML Web page Netscape (web browser) Domain Name System Internet Explorer for Mac JavaScript Pretty Good Privacy Mouse (computing) Java programming language History of the Internet Microsoft Gmail Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cross site scripting Unicode and HTML XForms USB flash drive Pop-up ad OpenBSD The Book of Mozilla Scalable Vector Graphics Tabbed document interface PNG Web design Microsoft Windows Common Unix Printing System Internet Uniform Resource Locator Greasemonkey HyperText Transfer Protocol Konqueror ReactOS Open-source software Mozilla Foundation International Phonetic Alphabet Digital rights management Copy protection Internationalized domain name Spread Firefox Rootkit Component Object Model Ruby character Favicon GIF About: Kazaa Safari (web browser) Computer Trusted computing Wiki Object Desktop AOL Instant Messenger Mandriva Linux X Window System HTML editor Stopping e-mail abuse Internet Relay Chat Internet security Internet privacy Konfabulator MNG Ebook Wget Mach kernel SAML History of Microsoft Windows Trojan horse (computing) HyperCard Blue screen of death RSS (file format) Extreme Programming Common criticisms of Microsoft
