liebestraum no by liszt i'm learning to play this song and i need a good performer to listen to for guidance i don't want the song to be played as fast as lang lang does i want it to be slower and more dream like you wouldn't expect a love dream to just fly by without making an impression it's impressive how lang lang plays it but i don't think that is how it was originally intended anyhow i prefer a free link to just the song but if that's not possible suggest a cd to cubcur would you recommend that i try the cadenzas and other difficult spots first before taking the song step by step chronologically my teacher says that he usually does it step by step a few notes a day in the case of cadenzas but tackling the hard parts first is also a wise strategy i'm just finishing the first phase of the song so i would have to at least do one cadenza now anyway also since i won't see my teacher until two weeks could you tell me what exactly is meant by each of the statements in the piece i know poco allegro con afetto means a little fast with emotion but i do not know what any other sayings mean language translators don't help me much either beyond agreeing with the advice already given that copying others' views of any work is about the last thing one should do i'm concerned that you haven't mentioned the arrows liszt has already put in your quiver with which to tackle these three nocturnes so let's go there first the dreamlike quality you mentioned you will find in the first of the three 'hohe liebe' prefaced with a motto by uhland this third and final one however addresses quite a different aspect of love hence the conflict of climate between your imagined one and the one that's being asked for here some editions neglect to provide the motto for each of the pieces which does the performer no service at all so here it is for this third one 'o lieb' by freiligrath in a quick prose translation oh love love for as long as you are able to love for as long as you like to love the hour will come when you stand at gravesides and lament ensure that your heart glows and fosters and nurtures love for as long as another heart beats warmly with love towards you and when that other closes the breast towards you do what you can towards the other to love and make the other happy every hour and for no moment make the other sad and guard your tongue well all too soon a harsh word can escape from it o god it was not meant in malice but the other departs and weeps as you can see where 'love's sweet dream' is concerned this lisztian 'toto' is definitely not in 'kansas' anymore to support his understanding of this poetic motto liszt asks for 'poco allegro con affetto' incremented after one page by 'poco agitato' after another by 'piu animato' to drive it 'sempre stringendo' to an 'appassionato assai' that explodes into an inescapable cadenza of pyrotechnical glitter to try and diffuse the tension and prepare for the return were you a student of mine i'd certainly not play it for you the 'model cd' equivalent s as you shaping your own views is much more important but a stepping stone to provide a reference framework could be two metronome marks one for the baseline 'clock' and one for the heart of the stringendo episode at its most clamorous and declamatory 'poco allegro' dotted note 'sempre stringendo' pg 'ff' dotted note notating the mm figures as though there's an alla breve in force here gives more useful numbers to work accurately with everything's negotiable within and beyond this framework but it's worth bearing in mind that the central cadenza requires a clock much in range with the second one i have given for it to work at all it needs a minimum speed level to 'speak' edit you'll need to get yourself a good musical dictionary for the terminology in the long term but in the meantime flip what terms you need clarifying into my mailbox and i'll do them for you that way this reply doesn't become truly ridiculously longer than necessary g meanwhile you'll need to number the bars in your score if they're not already numbered so we don't end up at cross purposes referencing things thinking of which though i normally try to keep out of this one gg it would be really helpful to lose the term 'song' here and substitute 'piece' or 'work' as these three nocturnes were originally songs for voice and piano first and both versions still exist side by side in the repertoire edit it wouldn't be proper for me to comment directly on your teacher's suggestions you mention however you may find some general observations on performing liszt useful on his ornamental cadenzas in particular for which those in this specific work can serve as examples as well as any other busoni in one of many of his highly astute comments on liszt provides an insight of great value to performers the secret of liszt's ornamentation he said is its symmetry frequently such symmetry is immediately visible from the outset this can be at the level of gesture or literal text or a combination of both yet equally often you need to step back and widen the scope of your view of the material before the overall balance becomes clear the second cadenza here is a case in point in many performances it is rendered as though the cadenza as a whole consists of bars in which case a sense of symmetry is not immediate take a step back and include the lh part of bar and multiple symmetries are immediately visible a lh only opening and rh only close form the bookends to two blocks of gesture material in between they in their turn being each made up of two parts in the first case bar the second part is repeating the substance of the first an octave lower in the second case bar an overarching compound arpeggio gesture is made up of two one up one down quite distinctly differently contoured building blocks in bars the lh leads in the extended bar the rh does liszt assumes a player with a complete technique from the outset in all his works therefore learn the entire work as a single span architecture beginning to end if you encounter a major new technical feature for instance bar of the second cadenza don't deconstruct the work itself by practising fragments of it in isolation it will ultimately fragment your performance of it too instead deconstruct for instance bar technically and deal with the elements it's made up from instead it being a combination of broken major rds rh and minor rds lh descending chromatically in contrary motion to form a chain of chromatically descending broken v chords you now have all the elements from which to make up your own exercises severally and in any combination you care to dream up once the technical principles have become second nature to you practised in the abstract like this you will be able to apply them at will whenever the occasion arises all you will need to do is check the score in question for the starting and ending points of such a figuration and your hands will obligingly do the rest in bar you're dealing with arpeggios and chromatic passing notes in alternating hands the patterns are regular and repeating work out their 'formulas' and practise them in the abstract in all possible keys again until they have become second nature to you then apply the technique just acquired to where you need it in the piece in hand finally specifically between bar and there is an insistent use of tenths in the lh only one of which is marked as broken and it is the only one that needs to be broken all the others must be played as actual tenths 'in one' for they lay the foundation for the startling sound effect of the broken lh th in bar to make its mark if you 'dilute' the tenths in the preceding page bar and the rest of your closing sequence depending on it will flop without a trace not good as with most things lisztian enjoy the ride above all and good luck  Logic Philosophy of language Franz Liszt Chess terminology

how do i fine tune a violin how do i tune the pegs at the bottom for fine tuning do i need a special instrument are you talking about the pegs on the neck of the instrument or about the tuners next to the bridge for tuning with the pegs rotate it away from your face to make the pitch higher and towards your face to lower the pitch for fine tuning without using tuners hard to explain without showing you can pull out the string to the right or to the left where the neck meets the body of the violin to lower the pitch and you can compress push down in the area where the strings are attached to the pegs to raise the pitch when using the tuners rotate to the right clockwise to raise pitch and rotate to the left counter clowckwise to lower the pitch and no you do not need a special instrument just your fingers  Violin Cello Harp Double bass Guitar Floyd Rose Viola Bass guitar Piano Hurdy gurdy Banjo Tuning Lute Electric guitar Sitar Charango Strap-on dildo Harmonic series (music) Balalaika Clarinet Professional wrestling holds Guqin Hardingfele Pedal steel guitar String instrument Mandolin Strings (music) Bridge (stringed instrument) Fret Timpani Eddie Van Halen Equine conformation Experimental music Xalam Trombone Bassoon Harmonica Classical guitar Slide guitar Tin whistle Resonance Motorcycle Aerial (dance move) Lyre Mute (music) Bouzouki Santoor Tablature Fingerboard Saxophone Screw Professional wrestling throws Authentic performance Ukulele Propeller Synthesizer Volleyball Musical notation Carnatic music Diving Motility Piccolo Musical tuning Transposing instrument Equal temperament Drill bit Steinberger Anatomical terms of location Flight controls Bow (music) Rotation Acoustic bass guitar Hornbostel-Sachs Gayageum Uilleann pipes Morin khuur Three Stooges Turbocharger Cribbage Vibrato Drone (music) Blood on the Tracks Monetary policy Professional wrestling attacks Harmonic Bagpipes Bicycle Oboe Clef Dobro Flute Staff (music) United States dollar Babe Ruth Edward Elgar Chair Interval (music) C.F.

questions for piano courses if i buy a key keyboard and take the pop piano course would it be ok do i have to tell the teacher that i have a key keyboard and the piano has keys and my keyboard has keys am i going to learn properly cos there's a difference in the number of keys btw i'm gonna save money and buy a piano after learning from the course it's alright right you'll be fine for a bit once you start learning to pedal you'll probably want to get a piano because the pedals that they make for electric keyboards really don't feel at all like the pedal on a piano and switching from your keyboard at home to the piano at your lesson is going to be a big pain most of my students start on a keyboard now while i can't say that i'm thrilled with it it's okay for a start the main thing is that you've got something at home to practise on because if you don't do that between lessons you're not going to get anywhere work hard at it it's a rewarding pursuit  Piano Organ (music) Electronic organ Musical Instrument Digital Interface Brian Jones (musician) Queen (band) Player piano American Beauty (album) Harp Keyboard instrument Slow Train Coming Elton John Time Out of Mind Miles Davis Fortepiano Blood on the Tracks Accordion Steve Reich Diving Tai Chi Chuan Classical music era Sonata (music) Keyboard layout Bringing It All Back Home Musical keyboard Transactional analysis Sergei Prokofiev Hotel California Computer keyboard PLATO Empire Burlesque Blonde on Blonde Journey (band) Music lesson Alexander Technique Pat Metheny Keyboard technology Tony Banks (musician) Optigan Authentic performance Come on Over (1997 album) Jazz String instrument A Hard Day's Night (song) Electric guitar Highway 61 Revisited Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven) Bohemian Rhapsody Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Musical instrument The Who Harpsichord Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Digital A Course In Miracles Bartolomeo Cristofori Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jamiroquai The Kinks Suzuki method Chick Corea Typewriter Tom Petty Mouse (computing) Sonata form Enigma machine Tablature German grammar Arnold Schoenberg Snowboarding Major scale Self Portrait Max Martin String piano Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Double bass Musical mode Pipe organ Iggy Pop Jumpstart 3rd Grade B__la Bart__k True Crime: Streets of LA Herbie Hancock Saga (band) Language education Songwriter John Cage The Isley Brothers Scrooge McDuck Tina Turner Education in the United States Chicago (band) Teacher Maison Ikkoku Lesson Johannes Brahms Can't Buy a Thrill

is the violin easy to learn after learning flute and piano i started playing the piano when i was when i turned i decided to take violin lessons at first my fingertips hurt and felt that the awkward hand position for the left hand messed up my piano playing but in time everything worked out well i guess it's easier to start when you're young and the good part about having a background in piano and flute is that note reading ability you already have my violin teacher said it was faster to teach me violin because i already had a lot of piano background technique wise it doesn't make a lot of difference but overall yes good luck have fun  Sergei Prokofiev Sonata (music) Violin Social rule Suzuki method Clarinet Flute Franz Liszt Carnatic music Pitaten Western concert flute Authentic performance Mario Davidovsky Double bass Transposing instrument Heitor Villa-Lobos Igor Stravinsky George Crumb Philip Glass Clef Solomon Keal Andr__ Jolivet Theory of conduct Volleyball Walter Piston Piano trio Music lesson Johannes Brahms Pet Sounds Franz Schubert Viola Classical music era George Enescu Cello Felix Mendelssohn Alexander Technique Musical works of Mozart Johann Sebastian Bach Louis Andriessen Piano Little Britain Tenshinhan Fr__d__ric Chopin Piano concerto Toccata and Fugue in D Minor Niccol__ Paganini Goldberg Variations Great Teacher Onizuka Charlie Palmieri Charles Ives Witold Lutos__awski Erik Satie Big band Brian Jones (musician) Steve Reich Breaststroke Capoeira Harp Anton Webern Visual Basic Blonde on Blonde Contract bridge Gy__rgy Ligeti Pierre Boulez Fast bowling John Cage Orchestra Kodocha Little Snow Fairy Sugar Recorder Violin sonata Embouchure Itzhak Perlman Oh My Goddess!

how do i tune a violen i can tune a guitar i'm great at the guitar but how do i tune a violen do i have to use the stink thingy to hear the notes or could i just pick the strings to tune it oh and where to i tune with the modules at the top of something else hi samail to tune a violin you will need to have one of the following a tuner either violin or chromatic tuner you can find more information in the tuners section perfect pitch you can discern the pitch of a tone without the aide of any other device a keyboard or a tuned piano this is to give you a reference while tuning a violin teacher there are ways to tune a violin tuning pegs or fine tuners also called string adjusters tuning pegs are used for tuning when the string is at least a half note out of tune while the fine tuners are used when the string is less than a half note out of tune fine tuners' tuning range is a lot smaller than the tuning pegs for more experienced players you will find that their violins are not equipped with fine tuners on a d or g strings only e string is equipped with a fine tuner this is because e string is the most fragile and requires the most care during tuning if strings are very out of tune you need to take extra care while tuning if all strings are very out of tune gradually tighten each string in the sequence of g d a e the reason for starting from g string is to prevent damaging the thinner e and a strings tighten only note higher on one string at a time then tighten the next do not tighten one string all the way to the desire pitch while leaving the other strings very loose this will create unequal pressure on the bridge causing it to fall since the tuning will cause enough movement of the strings and sway the bridge you need to make sure the bridge continues to stay perpendicular to the violin surface while being tuned make sure the bridge is completely straight especially where it makes contact with the strings if it has become tilted carefully make it straight the violin bridge is neither glued nor screwed onto the violin it is the tension from the strings that keeps the bridge in its place in order to keep the tuning pegs from slipping you will need to apply inward pressure on the tuning pegs toward the violin head as you turn the tuning peg tuning pegs are tapered hence the inward pressure will ensure that they stay in position once released if you have tuner pluck the string and the tone will get registered on the tuner if you have a chromatic tuner it will tell you what note you are on and how much further you have to go if you have a violin tuner the tone will not register on the tuner until the tone is within the tuner's detection limit this is usually note below or above the desired pitch once you are within notes from the desired pitch you can use the fine tuners to adjust each string if you cannot tighten a fine tuner any more loose the fine tuner half way first then bring the string closer to the pitch by using the tuning peg then use the fine tuner again for the adjustment depending on the design of the fine tuner fine tuners that are tightened all the way are more likely to dent the violin top since the space between the violin top and the fine tuners is very small if you cannot loosen a fine tuner any more tighten the fine tuner half way first then loosen the string closer to the pitch by using the tuning peg then use the fine tuner again for the adjustment if strings are slightly out of tune you should always follow the instruction above you may be able to tune the strings with just the fine tuners however you should always check to make sure the bridge is still straight after tuning i would suggest that you either take a few violin lessons to get started or view the following sites to be perfectly blunt however nothing can take the place of an actual teacher when one is attempting to learn a new instrument good luck the violin is an absolutely exhilarating instrument to play http www
