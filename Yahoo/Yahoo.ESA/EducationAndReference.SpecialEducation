are workshops good for people with down s syndrome while it is important that schools set educational goals for students with disabilities that are of equal value to other students' goals many other factors contribute to successful learning and ultimately a successful transition to a life after school expanding transition and postsecondary opportunities for people with down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities has been of great interest to many for the past decade studies have shown students with intellectual disabilities including down syndrome that participate in postsecondary education are more likely to excel in academics employment and life many children with down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities are now being included k and want to pursue postsecondary education like their peers and siblings a request for proposal rfp was developed and distributed in february to all two and four year public and private colleges in new jersey with the rfp the schools applied for funds for a planning year to develop the program based on the criteria established by the steering committee upon successful completion of the planning year the college would be eligible for additional funding for the first and second operational years of the program with the understanding that following the second year the program must be self sustaining for centuries people with down syndrome have been alluded to in art literature and science it wasn't until the late th century however that john langdon down an english physician published an accurate description of a person with down syndrome it was this scholarly work published in which earned down the recognition as the father of the syndrome although others had previously recognized the characteristics of the syndrome it was down who described the condition as a distinct and separate entity throughout the th century advances in medicine and science enabled researchers to investigate the characteristics of people with down syndrome in the french physician jerome lejeune identified down syndrome as a chromosomal anomaly when he observed chromosomes present in each cell of individuals with down syndrome instead of the usual it was later determined that an extra partial or complete st chromosome results in the characteristics associated with down syndrome down syndrome occurs in one out of every live births and more than people in the u s have this genetic condition one of the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities down syndrome affects people of all ages races and economic levels today individuals with down syndrome are active participants in the educational vocational social and recreational aspects of our communities in fact there are more opportunities than ever before for individuals with down syndrome to develop their abilities discover their talents and realize their dreams for example more teens and adults with down syndrome each year are graduating from high school going to college finding employment and living independently the opportunities currently available to individuals with down syndrome have never been greater however it is only through the collective efforts of parents professionals and concerned citizens that acceptance is becoming even more widespread it is the mission of the national down syndrome society to ensure that all people with down syndrome are provided the opportunity to achieve their full potential in all aspects of their lives as for workshops places people with disabilities learn job life skills are helpful if you can teach a person with down syndrome can learn for more information on down syndrome see the link below for the national down sydnrome society  Intelligence quotient Education in Japan Turner syndrome GED

if someone is blind and deaf from birth do they know anything do they understand what they are what other people are or what existence is yes they understand what they are from feeling hunger and sleepiness they feel emotions just like everyone else i know because deafblind people feel intense feelings of frusteration from not being able to communicate or navigate in fact deafblind people even think like humans do however they cannot think visually or linguistically so they think cerebrally this is a universal way of thinking that is thought in the purest form their existence is limited to touch they can feel doorknobs and over time learn that there are rooms inside those doorknobs they learn to grasp forks like everyone else to flush a toilet to run and skip they still have the gift of movement movement is their way of expressing their thoughts and feelings while touch is their way of getting to know the world eventually they also become aware of the dangers they cannot see or hear that must be more frightening than anything imagine the shock of a dog sinking its teeth into your arm without seeing or hearing it you only feel the pain of your punctured flesh and the shock of what happened so yes this is another form of existence deafblind people might not ever be one hundred percent able to know what existence really is without having sight and hearing however they do know that there is a world with people and all kinds of things and ideas in it it just takes them longer to learn it they have a different perception but they still have a perception deafblind people eventually learn that there is a big wide world out there with color shapes sounds etc they learn about sounds from vibrations they learn communication techniques by learning braille sign language and finger spelling this enables them to communicate with others and as their vocabulary progresses they learn more and more ideas to build a better picture of what the world is really like to better understand what it is like to be deaf and blind maybe one day you should try putting on a pair of earmuffs and a blindfold  Deafblindness Milton H.

cochlear implant question for deaf teens or adults i'm unsure if i will receive any answers but here is my questions anyways i have an year old profoundly deaf student was implanted at the age of in with a recommendation to not implant surgery went ahead anyways the implant has never really worked well for my student he has the outdated advanced bionics ci parents do not bring my student in for updates or mapping my question is there is an update for the advanced bionics ci and wondering if any deaf teens or adults have had success with this updated ci i'm going to push for this update this year when i meet with his parents again in a few weeks the prior answerer is incorrect when saying that cis work only of the time if this were true they would not be fda approved the failure rate of cochlear implants are less than i don't understand how the parents got the surgery done when the implant team recommended against it that's very difficult to do if the implant has not worked for your student it probably has been due to difficulties such as poor family support and lack of training rather than a device failure you don't just put an implant on and all of a sudden a person knows how to do it there is a specific auditory rehabilitation process that must be followed or the wearer often cannot use it properly this is why going through candidacy has many aspects and is hard to find someone to do it if the team recommends against it your question is very difficult to answer without knowing either the internal component or external component of the implant internal pieces are made to be able to be updated with future technology you 'update' the external piece not the internal piece changing the internal peice would mean they would have to go back in surgery which could be risky however the external peice could be updated but if the student is not using the one he has properly an updated exernal peice will not help instead of pushing for a new peice push for more services for the child this child should have an iep and needs av therapy auditory verbal speech therapy and an oral teacher of the deaf these services if provided can be done at school the iep should also incude a complete audiological evaluation yearly which takes the cost off the parents which may be the reason they are hesitant to keep up with the implant this would help the child much more than trying to get the parents to pay for an expensive upgrade to equipment they obviously don't facilitate to begin with please email me if you have any questions sorry for the spelling spell check isn't working  Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Prostate cancer Medicine Scientology beliefs and practices Second language acquisition Education in the People's Republic of China Infantilism Growth hormone treatment Stuttering Special education Education Dyslexia Aphasia Hearing aid Abortion Condom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Food and Drug Administration Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transsexuality Urinary incontinence Divorce Models of deafness Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Graduate school Windows 2000 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RFID Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tai Chi Chuan Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Controversies in autism Motion picture rating system Antiretroviral drug Milton H.

what u do to develop ur personality give ur experience also im reading psychological books and watching films that r hard to understand such as the hours vanilla sky gramms and so on i also travel a lot i talk to people make friend everywhere five dimensions are involved in forming the human personality these are physical self energy self intellectual self mental self and blissful self well integrated personality is the sum total of harmonious expression of these five dimensions physical self relates to our senses proper nourishment and growth of physical faculties is essential by way of balanced diet recreation music and care and concern from near and dear ones a simple pat on the back for any achievement in life goes a long way to build up confidence however discretion and discrimination are the key words in this regard otherwise there is every chance that senses would create havoc by way of infatuation and attachment to the sense objects energy self is somewhat subtler than the first it relates to metabolism and the gross manifestations of energy prana for insatnce the act of breathing the control of prana is achieved by control of anger anxiety and restlessness intellectual self concerns with discriminative power and knowledge what we call buddhi in addition to sincere and formal studies reading other books like biographies of great and noble persons and invigorating literature helps us develop this faculty mental self is related to stress and psychology here selflessness control concentration and calmness of mind plays essential role anandamaya kosha or blissful self is the function of state of being it calls for remaining calm and unaffected nay to remain happy in all the frivolities of world in neck break competition and struggle in calamities and disasters in suffering and loss in failure and success the five fold method to attain to such state of heightened perfection and purity are a self effort b self control c self reliance d self sacrifice and e self knowledge next a practical program is needed to make this 'intellectual gymnastic' real in our lives the simple action plan to start with consists of daily physical exercise for ten minutes reading good literature for half an hour sincere prayers for two to five minutes and meditation and yoga for about ten minutes concentration and meditation meditation or dhyana comes after 'dharana' and before 'samadhi' as per the eight fold practice of patanjali yoga yama niyama asana pranayama pratyahara dharana dhyana and samadhi are the eight aspects i feel the main emphasis should start from pratyahara it means withdrawing our internal sense organs from the external sense objects for example our sense organ of taste runs after tasty food which is sense object pratyahara means not to allow the sense of taste to succumb to such temptations the same should be the case with sense of touch smell vision and hearing we should be able to control our senses this is a form of conscious detachment of mind from the objects of temptations with practice pratyahara is possible next is dharana it means trying to concentrate the mind on one thought or idea or form of the divine the mind would fail to concentrate on that which is not divine and in a short period of time one will lose all interest in the yoga and in one's attempts at meditation concentration of mind produces the feeling of truth in what one is concentrating upon thus we get feeling of existence or truth in the idea the thought or the form we are trying to concentrate upon gradually of course by nature the mind is restless chanchal it does not want to stay fixed on one object or thought or idea it wanders here and there many thoughts crowd our mind and we feel that we shall never be able to fix it on god moreover many unwanted thoughts spring up from nowhere and further put the sadhaka in get turmoil dirty passionate and evil thoughts come from our subconscious mind there these thoughts lie hidden as samskaras these are of this birth and many past births therefore one should not get perturbed when bad thoughts come to surface during dhyana and dharana how to tackle this problem one way is to neglect all thoughts whether good or bad just see them as waves rising on the lake of mind which are sure to subside in course of time thus we become sakshi subject of our own thought the second method is to bring the desirable and noble thought or form like the form of our ishta to mind again and again this is practice or abhyasa suppose there is an old ink pot with dried crust inside it when we try to clean the ink pot dirty water comes out initially but if we continue to pour fresh water repeatedly dirt is cleared and the water coming out is cleaner and cleaner same is the case with evil thoughts at the time of meditation by pouring fresh and clean water of mantra and concentrating on the form of our ishta we can soon get rid of bad and dirty thoughts over a period this period can be one year ten years one birth or ten births it depends on the efforts and grace of the guru but one thing is sure one has to go through the process if not today tomorrow therefore one should start today only howsoever useless and difficult sadhana may appear by this we become masters of ourselves there is no want or deficiency anymore feeling of loneliness and helplessness is replaced with feeling of identity with all and total fulfillment in life  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Adi Da Microeconomics The nature of God in Western theology Reincarnation

what are the causes of communication disorders what are some teaching strategies for students with communication disorders communication disorders include problems related speech language and auditory processing communication disorders may range from simple sound repetitions such as stuttering to occasional misarticulation of words and complete inability to use speech and language for communications aphasia some causes of communication disorders include hearing loss neurological disorders brain injury mental retardation drug abuse physical impairments such as cleft lip or palate vocal abuse or misuse emotional or psychiatric disorders and developmental disorders frequently however the cause is unknown it is estimated one in every americans of all ages races and genders have experienced or lived with some type of communication disorder including speech language and hearing disorders nearly million children under the age of have a speech or language disorder there are many potential causes of communication impairment the most common is mental retardation other causes include hearing impairment add learning disabilities autism schizophrenia cerebral palsy physical disability cleft lip and palate or malformations of the mouth or nose significant behavior or emotional problems including deficits in social skills vocal cord injury cri du chat syndrome gilles de la tourette syndrome poorly fitting dentures alcohol intoxication neurological disorders and diseases head trauma alzheimer's disease stroke transient ischemic attack the best treatment is prevention and early intervention parents should be aware of developmental milestones the most intensive period of speech and language development for humans is during the first three years of life a period when the brain is developing and maturing these skills appear to develop best in a world that is rich with sounds sights and consistent exposure to the speech and language of others there is increasing evidence suggesting that there are critical periods for speech and language development in infants and young children this means that the developing brain is best able to absorb a language any language during this period the ability to learn a language will be more difficult and perhaps less efficient or effective if these critical periods are allowed to pass without early exposure to a language the beginning signs of communication occur during the first few days of life when an infant learns that a cry will bring food comfort and companionship the newborn also begins to recognize important sounds in his or her environment the sound of a parent or voice can be one important sound as they grow infants begin to sort out the speech sounds phonemes or building blocks that compose the words of their language research has shown that by months of age most children recognize the basic sounds of their native language as the speech mechanism jaw lips and tongue and voice mature an infant is able to make controlled sound this begins in the first few months of life with cooing a quiet pleasant repetitive vocalization by months of age an infant usually babbles or produces repetitive syllables such as ba ba ba or da da da babbling soon turns into a type of nonsense speech jargon that often has the tone and cadence of human speech but does not contain real words by the end of their first year most children have mastered the ability to say a few simple words children are most likely unaware of the meaning of their first words but soon learn the power of those words as others respond to them by months of age most children can say eight to ten words by age most are putting words together in crude sentences such as more milk during this period children rapidly learn that words symbolize or represent objects actions and thoughts at this age they also engage in representational or pretend play at ages and a child's vocabulary rapidly increases and she begins to master the rules of language if you have concerns about your child's speech or language development you should talk to your family doctor your doctor may decide to refer you to a speech language pathologist a health professional trained to evaluate and treat people who have speech language voice or swallowing disorders including hearing impairment that affect their ability to communicate the speech language pathologist will talk to you about your child's communication and general development she will also evaluate your child with special speech and language tests a hearing test is often included in the evaluation because a hearing problem can affect speech and language development depending upon the test results the speech language pathologist may suggest activities for home to stimulate speech and language development these activities may include reading to your child regularly speaking in short sentences using simple words so that your child can successfully imitate you or repeating what your child says using correct grammar or pronunciation for example if your child says ball baybo you can respond with yes the ball is under the table this allows you to demonstrate more accurate speech and language without actually correcting your child which can eventually make speaking unpleasant for him or her the speech language pathologist may also recommend group or individual therapy or suggest further evaluation by other health professionals such as an audiologist or a developmental psychologist speech training is an involved and time consuming endeavor that can have profound results with consistent treatment speech training by a speech pathologist may include helping an individual with articulation disorders to learn proper production of speech sounds with voice disorders to develop proper control of the vocal and respiratory systems for correct voice production who stutters to cope with the disorders and to increase the amount of fluent speech with aphasia to relearn language and speech skills to understand their disorder and to help the individual achieve more fluent communication in educational social and vocational settings speech and language pathologists typically provide professional services in public and private schools hospitals rehabilitation centers nursing care facilities community clinics college and universities private practice state and local health departments state and federal government agencies centers for developmentally disabled research laboratories

what are potential signs of students with hearing impairment what are the intervations to assist students with hearing impairment a child's speech and language is a big indicator does the child leave out ed ing and s endings of words in speech or writing do they leave out prepositions and articles these are soft sounds and often children with hearing loss do not hear them so they do not produce them in their speech or writing vocabulary acquisition can be delayed because of the loss of incidental learning which can cause vocabulary delays and difficulty understanding new concepts if you suspect a child has a hearing loss he needs an audiological evaluation and a speech language eval there are some strategies you can use without an iep however such as keeping the doors closed during instruction keeping fans hvac systems and computers off during instruction putting felt or cloth on desks when using manipulatives allowing the student to sit closest to the speaker and making sure your face is always visible when speaking so that the child may speech read repeating what other students say especially if they are behind the student or at a distance where it's hard to speech read will help the student participate in classroom discussions use videos and books on tape with caution and always give the student a visual when you do use these repeat and rephrase questions and always use visuals when introducing new vocabulary or concepts if the student is old enough to be taking notes in class give him a copy of the notes or allow him to have a copy of a students' notes so that he may devote his attention to what you are saying instead of trying to write things down allow him to orally clarify written answers if writing is an issue  Hearing impairment Second language acquisition Dyslexia Aphasia Stuttering Asperger syndrome African American Vernacular English Literacy Learning disability Auditory processing disorder Non-native pronunciations of English Manually Coded English Education Deconstruction Columbine High School massacre Lisp programming language Computer Intelligent design movement Auslan Esperanto grammar English grammar Philosophy of language Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Esperanto as an international language Hearing aid No Child Left Behind Act Korean language Chinese language Tamil language Speech synthesis Logo programming language Signing Exact English Singlish Multilingual Linguistics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Polish language Cochlear implant Slovak language Hong Kong English CPU cache Translation Speech recognition Dialect Hiberno-English Visual Basic American Sign Language Esperanto vocabulary Quebec French Computer-assisted language learning TOEFL Cognitive science Education in Romania IBM PC compatible Floppy disk Vulgar Latin Royal Assent Acts of the Apostles Miranda warning Dutch language Windows 2000 Public-key cryptography Closed captioning Tonality Spanish language Standard Cantonese Storytelling Past teachings of Prem Rawat Simplified Chinese character Greek language German language Portuguese language Canadian House of Commons Ukrainian language Socrates A Course In Miracles Russian language Biblical inerrancy Neuro-linguistic programming Debate Hindi Czech language Mental retardation GED Liaison Deaf Education in the United States Noam Chomsky Hebrew language

this is a serious question busy as we are with our normal life have we ever though of the not so normal ones here i am specially referring to the border line cases of autistic children unlike the physically handicapped ones the severe cases of mentally handicapped ones these children look ablosuletly normal but are actually not normal at all their deceiving appearance actually adds to their problem as people fail to understand their problem these children do not need special institutions to train them they can be brought close to normal life in any mainstream school by allowing them to mingle with normal children but most schools in our country refuse to give entrance to such children the worst sufferers are the parents of these children who fight a lone battle receiving no support understanding from the society at present there seems to be no hope for them most people are ignorant regarding this problem please spare a thought for such children hey thanks really i was unaware of autism before most autistic children relate well to their parents and to their siblings and often to other adults too not all but most do but he will spend hours in solitude staring at a wall or making repetitive movements and sounds helping an autistic child can be frustrating because they need continuous intensive and multifaceted assistance autistic children in the to iq range tend to have a better outlook as do those who have spontaneous speech by age or pictures can help them to learn how to speak and communicate effectively for instance if a child wants a drink they will present a picture of a drink hen kids didn't know how to talk they were very frustrated that they could not communicate after a while they are able to construct simple sentences using pictures they are then taught to associate the pictures with words and many go on to speak interacting n playing with autistic children will help them tremendeously  Asperger syndrome Controversies in autism Ethical challenges to autism treatment Autistic community Autistic spectrum Neurodiversity Dyslexia Hearing impairment Mental illness Facilitated communication Aphasia Gifted Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autistic culture Transactional analysis Pervasive developmental disorder Mental retardation Theory of mind Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Neurotypical Hypoglycemia Autism epidemic Milton H.

why are the terms learning disabled and mentally retarded often used interchangeably these terms shouldn't be used interchangeably someone with a learning disability is someone who has an average iq but has a discrepancy between his her iq and actual performance for example a child has an iq score of but has a math score of standardized tests are used to get these scores children with the label learning disabled tend to have peaks and valleys they may read well but struggle in math furthermore those formally labeled mentally retarded are now known in other ways such as mildly mentally disabled since retarded is soooooooo politically incorrect these children have below average iq scores and performance scores some people like to refer to their scores as flatliners because both iq and performance scores are low and somewhat equal i hope that this answer helps  Mental retardation Learning disability Intelligence quotient Mental illness Controversies in autism SAT Dyslexia Autism Down syndrome Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Political correctness Charter school GED Eugenics American and British English differences Sex and intelligence Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 The Princeton Review Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Test (student assessment) Standard Mandarin Autism rights movement Rosemary Kennedy Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Quizbowl Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mathematics Contract Poverty Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Standardized testing Grade (education) Hypoglycemia Asperger syndrome Music Gifted Martial art Software testing Cephalic disorder Marilyn vos Savant Homeschooling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Intelligence (trait) Phenylketonuria Psychiatry Idiot Atkins v.

how do convince an autistic boy not to touch himself in public i have two sons with autism both have very serious speech delays and both have a terrible habit of holding their privates like they're afraid it's going to fall off i figure it's just a sensory issue but it's so embarassing they often attract enough attention as it is and most of the time people over look they're tics but this is one of those social tabboos that seems to be on the unforgivable list can anyone offer some advice please thank you everyone for your very helpful advice i was very concerned that if the boys continued with this behavoir it would continue onto adulthood but i now see that may not be the case once again thank you consider attaching a high stimulus item to his belt when he goes to touch his privates gently guide his hand to the other stimulus praise and or give a food reward make sure you aren't giving too much attention to the problem behavior in fact when you move his hand say nothing completely ignore it find out what sensory object he likes at home and then practice having him play with it on his belt sometime autistic kids find a particular enviornment too stimulating and need to be able to ground themselves by manipulating an item  Autism Asperger syndrome Autism rights movement Controversies in autism Sensory Integration Dysfunction Autism epidemic Ethical challenges to autism treatment Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Milton H.

an acceptable adult to child ratio for schools teaching five year olds is it varies from state to state and the setting the school is in i know it sounds crazy but daycare settings are often allowed to have a higher student to teacher ratio than a school is public and private schools also may differ because of funding issues like the previous answer stated it also depends on the severity of disability if any that the students may have also is there a teacher and assistant included in this arrangement that you are talking about i would say in most cases a teacher per typically developing students or less is the norm  Graduate school Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Charter school Homeschooling GED Education in England High school Culture of the United States Professor Asperger syndrome Education Private school Education in Japan Age of consent Divorce Student loan Nurse Education in Germany Teacher SAT Secondary education in Japan Religious education Hearing impairment Education in Australia Education in Portugal Tripartite System Gifted College Standardized testing Education in Taiwan Education in Romania Mutual fund Doctor of Philosophy Zen Independent school (UK) Education in Singapore Day care Boston Public Education in France Child sexuality Miami-Dade County Public Schools Librarian Public transport Education in India Education in Scotland Autism Separation of church and state Kindergarten Social work Automatic transmission Literacy Education reform Grade (education) Students' union Koan Bristol Grammar School School choice Japanese tea ceremony Infantilism Dyslexia Creation and evolution in public education School violence Public education Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Secondary education in France Education in Malaysia Pledge of Allegiance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Trigonometric function Columbia University Quizbowl National Certificate of Educational Achievement Caulfield Grammar School Irish dance Abortion debate Teaching English as a Foreign Language Teach the Controversy Middle school A Course In Miracles Annuity Teachers (film) Special education Education in Qu__bec Community college Education in Canada Embouchure MP3 University of Chicago Reiki Section 28 Child pornography Sant Mat Stuttering

to say somebody with learning difficulty is special needs is political correctness i think political correctness tries to remove bias from our language eg law inforcement officer instead of saying police man or police woman the word special has traditionally been applied to someone with superior and or extra ordinary ability it's use in describing people as having special needs who are mentally handicapped and often far less capable than the non handicapped is political correctness my sympathies jeanimus despite political correctness and perhaps because of it even people with all kinds of mental or physical handicaps are being put under the umbrella term of special needs i worked months in a residential house for mentally handicapped people all very very different they were defined as special needs even one of the staff had a child with special needs the child was profoundly disabled mentally and physically could do nothing nothing for herself while one of the residents in the house could catch a bus to town and back and look after herself but was unable to work while another resident had such manic behavior you had to protect him from the public and visa versa not that i think special needs is at all laughable but i just thought up something funny in relationship to miss use of the word special what if you went to a theatre and before the preformance a presenter told the audience and now for this very special preformance by and when the performer came out they were physically and mentally incapable of giving a performance the confusion in the use of the word special would leave an audience stunned and irate what's in a name a rose by any other name smells just as sweet or something like that its about sensitivities and not offending or labelling the affected or the inflicted english is a very strange language in my native language we call a spade a spade and don't keep changing names for it what is more important for us is that we acknowledge the condition and embrace and accomodate it into society political correctness is not therefore an issue change languages  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mental illness Mental retardation Disability Autism Transgender Philosophy of language Learning disability Franz Boas Rape Transsexuality Child sexual abuse Asperger syndrome Abortion debate Dyslexia Postmodernism Pedophilia 21 July 2005 London bombings Social rule Vulcan (Star Trek) Involuntary commitment Trademark Theory of conduct Models of deafness Homophobia Civil rights College Traumatic brain injury Mental Health Act 1983 Left-handed Second language acquisition Eugenics Animal rights Shamanism Divorce Hypnosis Human sexual behavior Autism rights movement Cultural relativism Motion picture rating system Homosexuality and transgender Coercion Domestic violence Gender-neutral language Abortion God Emperor of Dune Appeal Narcissism Brainwashing Milton H.

impacts of movies on youth i think that movies do have an impact on viewers i also believe that youths are especially impressionable and movies with inspirational themes can motivate them in a positive sense while movies with themes that are deemed disturbing by mainstream society can also influence them in a negative manner for example if young girls view movies where the characters are sexually promiscious these girls may believe that this type of behavior is acceptable don't misunderstand me i'm not saying that all girls would adopt this attitude but the most vunerable might so many factors influence the impact it is not just the movies themselves think about environment family school friends morals beliefs  Lesbian Pedophilia Gender role Anorexia nervosa Infantilism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Hentai Ethics Revolutionary Girl Utena Motion picture rating system Conservatism Atheism Rape Effeminacy Patriotism Science fiction film Morality Homophobia Pornographic movie Social psychology Zoophilia Childlove movement Scouting Church of Christ Religion and sexuality Artificial selection Young Earth creationism Schizophrenia Cross-dressing Abortion debate Meme Scientology beliefs and practices Motivation Sexual revolution Homosexuality Transsexuality Fundamentalism Pacifism Human nature Homosexuality and Christianity Second language acquisition Evil Race and intelligence Leadership Sigmund Freud Christian right Paraphilia Feminism Libertarianism Nihilism Modernism Human sexuality Sociocultural evolution Feminist movement Girl Sex education Choice and sexual orientation Green economics Horror film Reparative therapy David Hume Borderline personality disorder Sex Women in Islam Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Coercion Pornography in Japan Voter turnout Mind control Narcissism Human Hikikomori Belief Clothing Generation X Child sexual abuse Goth Propaganda Economics Traumatic incident reduction Grunge music Radical behaviorism Religious conversion Confucianism Pulp Fiction Indigenous peoples Adolescence Cult Anime Satanism Parapsychology Liberalism A Clockwork Orange (film) Mad scientist Cliff Richard Physical attractiveness Advertising

why do the handicapped have such a hard time finding a mate does this make the saying beauty is only skin deep meaningless i know so many good hearted autistic and cp people who can't find a partner just because of their disability does this prove how shallow and disgusting the general public is island monkey thanks for your example this is exactly wat i'm talking about people are disgusting aren't they no one can deny this i don't think it proves how disgusting and shallow the public is honestly look inside yourself and ask yourself would you date someone whom you find unattractive there has to be some kind of spark to get the chemistry and conversation flowing i am not suggesting that all disabled people are ugly many of them are beautiful people but there are many whom let's face it don't look or act normal it is very sad and i do have sympathy that they cannot find a mate it is heartbreaking but i also understand why a normal unhandicapped human would not want to date someone with a handicap to not understand this would also be shallow i know we have all heard the saying survival of the fittest it is nature's way of preserving our genepool we don't want people who have severe handicaps reproducing and passing on the defective genes this is just nature it is why the strongest male elk or deer who wins the fight gets to breed with the females for example human heart defects they are rare babies with severe heart defects cannot live long in nature therefore cannot reproduce spreading the bad gene that is why heart defects are so rare and why most people live long lives they are becoming more common than they used to b c technology has now the ability to fix these defects and more people with heart defects are reproducing now more heart defects are surfacing as a result imagine if our genepool was corrupt and the doctor told you that you have a in chance of having an autistic or severe cp child or one with a severe heart defect would you want to get pregnant i know a couple that went to genetic counseling after having a two children that are expected to die early b c they have cystic fibrosis the doc told them they have a one in four chance of having another one with it a chance that it would not have the disease but would be a carrier and a chance that it would not have the disease and would not be a carrier they are already going to lose two children they decided not to have another child they could not put themselves and another kid through this heartache it is a sad but true fact of life i don't think people are knowingly shallow humans have a great ability to help one another out many people would do anything they could to help a handicapped person but there is just something instinctively that makes many people unattracted to them sexually it is the instinctive part that tries to keep our genepool stable  Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cystic fibrosis Genetic disorder Theory of conduct Abortion debate Species Cephalic disorder Eugenics Hearing impairment Mental retardation Haemophilia Spina bifida Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Evolution Genetically modified organism Extinction Sexual attraction Urinary incontinence Sexual selection Cancer Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Autism rights movement Acne Turner syndrome Sickle-cell disease Equine conformation Duchenne muscular dystrophy Autistic community Prenatal diagnosis Mental illness Tocopherol God Emperor of Dune Heterozygote advantage Left-handed Thalassemia Nietzschean Incest Stroke Sexual dimorphism Senescence Human cloning The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Human sexual behavior Infantilism Empathy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus X chromosome Congenital disorder Human nature Altruism Dragons (Pern) Color blindness Kakapo The Origin of Species Gender role Human variability Autism epidemic Human skin color Physical attractiveness K' Price equation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dog Congenital adrenal hyperplasia House Mouse Ontological argument Genetics The End of the World (Doctor Who) Reproduction Down syndrome Liger Irreducible complexity Neurodiversity One Tree Hill (TV series) Theodicy Human Bene Gesserit Meaning of life Spider Humphrey Bogart Ethical challenges to autism treatment Cholera Jon Secada Vitamin C Organ transplant Cerebral palsy Recessive gene Plame affair Y chromosome Love

slow learner what defines a slow learner as many of us have discussed the line between a slow learner and a child who qualifies for special education services and the services available for each seem to be backwards many as well as myself have said it doesn t seem right that a child who is low in one area gets the help they need but a child who struggles in all areas receives no special services in researching the topic of a slow learner i have found this to be correct however there are a number of things we as teachers can do to accommodate the slow learner in our own classrooms first let s define a slow learner a slow learner is difficult to identify because he she is no different in appearance and can function normally in most situations he she usually has normal physical dexterity has adequate memory and possesses common sense the fact that a slow learner possesses these qualities sometimes is why parents find it difficult to understand how their child can be a slow learner what they need to realize is that although the child has these qualities he she does not necessarily have the ability to do school work common characteristics of a slow learner are their measured intelligence is of the average child the ability to read comes about a year later than most and the rate at which they learn is to that of the normal rate abstract thinking is difficult for a slow learner and their attention span is short a slow learner reacts slower than average self expression is awkward and self esteem is low it is hard to figure things out themselves especially if given multiple step instructions most slow learners function below grade level in all subject areas and generally score consistently low on achievement tests it may appear that slow learners are not capable of learning however servio carroll wrote slow learners are handicapped in the regular classroom to approximately the same degree as students with average abilities when competing with gifted students they are able to learn although the mastery of skills comes much slower on a national level not much is done to accommodate the slow learner no special services are provided nation wide nor are there services provided at a state or district level it is up to the teachers and parents to provide the help needed for slow learners to progress school psychologists are available to give advice and inform teachers and parents of strategies to use to assist slow learners however the service is provided by the classroom teachers we are fortunate enough in our school to have a sap student assistance program team who works very hard at looking for new strategies and resources to help teachers with slow learners today a teacher is likely to have three to five students who are slow learners so it is very important that we take the time to learn how to accommodate these students in our classrooms the goal of helping a slow learner is not to get them performing at grade level but to get them performing at their highest level possible this level is different for all students whether they are a slow learner average or above average however once told that a student does not qualify for special education services it is left up to us to help the child with only the help of the sap team sadly we are not alone someone needs to reach out to these students and there are numerous strategies and interventions we could try a few things i have tried in my own room are the use of volunteers peer tutoring and reducing the amount of work required volunteers are a must we do not have the time to give students the one on one help that many need the added adults in the room make it easier to give attention to those who need extra time or instruction the volunteers shouldn t be used to give initial instruction but to reinforce what has already been taught peer tutors are great to use in addition to volunteers sometimes by simply placing the right students together in pairs or group situations you can utilize peer tutoring without drawing attention to the slow learner last i will reduce the number of spelling words or math problems to name a few because this reduces the level of stress and is less likely to overwhelm the student there are several other strategies that are useful computers are great to use in the classroom computers never tire or get interrupted making the drill and practice more effective and fun it is important to allow the student time to get out of his her seat to let off energy and relieve a little stress a classroom that utilizes centers is good for this in giving instructions you should say the child s name or touch them before giving the direction write the directions on the board or paper for each child to keep and ask that the student repeat the direction orally this helps to reinforce the direction and gives them something to refer back to if they forget once the student turns in the work or answers orally provide immediate feedback this assures the student of their answer or allows them to correct the answer and keeps them on task the hardest and probably the most important strategies is to provide three or four hours of academic work slow learners are not efficient learners and therefore require more hours of academic instruction to keep pace remember it is up to us to determine who is a slow learner and to do our best to meet the needs of slow learners in our classrooms there are no special services available for them so in order to effectively meet their needs we have to educate ourselves and keep the lines of communication open with the parents  Literacy Autism Expert system Asperger syndrome Infantilism Education in Japan Special education CPU design SAT Grade (education)

special education for disability what is better integrated education or in separate schools the number of special schools for disabled is very less an experiment to reach such children has given good results if atleast one teacher in each school is trained to handle such students but some teachers object as the consider this an extra burden this really depends on the teachers and schools in the area some teachers in integrated schools do feel like it is an extra burden as you said however there are teachers who like to be challenged into learning new things and ways of teaching however in schools specified for the disabled every teacher is trained to teach according to the needs of each student though in these schools the child may lose some of the social skills and adapting skills that they may learn in integrated schools  Waldorf Education Education Experiential education Education in the United States Teacher Alexander Technique Homeschooling Education in Singapore Japanese tea ceremony No Child Left Behind Act Education in Hong Kong Mental retardation Graduate school Special education __mile Durkheim Education in Japan Learning Nurse Education in Portugal Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Danish Folkeskole Education Aikido Brown v.

is autism sometimes faked to get special priveledges and funding i'm wondering if people have faked mental handicaps to get gov't funds or special placements in jobs or school blaster as to the comment that cutie pie is spolied she did mention that she sees this everyday perhaps she can comment on whether she's been handed everything in life first of all you need an official diagnosis of autism from a real doctor or psychiatrist to be labeled as autistic you can't just walk around spinning things and rocking back and forth or pretend like you can't talk the only way the district will fund an autistic program for you r child is if he has a diagnosis of autism secondly adhd is not misdiagnosed of the time it is a real affliction and it is not attributed to lazy parents i know a lot of parents who have to work twice as hard as people with regular children when they have a child with adhd the girl who wrote that comment either has never dealt with these kinds of kids on a personal level or it never effected her she sounds spoiled to me a little ignorant and thirdly autism or adhd is not caused by drinking a drugs during pregnancy both are genetic disorders and again it takes a strong person to deal with children with these disabilities i don't think you should be criticizing parents for dealing with these children but praising them the one girl sounds like she's been handed everything to her in life doesn't have to work for anything probably spoiled  Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autism epidemic Controversies in autism Autism rights movement Ethical challenges to autism treatment Autistic community Autistic spectrum Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Neurodiversity Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Mental illness Pervasive developmental disorder Learning disability Anti-psychiatry Mental retardation Methylphenidate Gifted Bernard Rimland Facilitated communication Thimerosal The New School at West Heath Rain Man Urinary incontinence Narcissism Refrigerator mother Psychiatry Political correctness Neurotypical Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Recurring South Park characters Friends Speculation of famous people who might have autism Sensory Integration Dysfunction Chemical imbalance theory M.I.N.D.

what responsibilities are part of the high school inclusion aide position if you work in a high school where inclusion aides are employed can you share what you know about this position also do you think that taking this position would increase one's chances of getting a teaching job with the district good advice so far just to add to what's been said so far aide positions can vary greatly and when the position is posted you should know at least a little about what kind of job it will be for example our school has behavior room aides cbi aides esl aides content mastery aides etc all of these provide inclusion services in one way or another as far as what's involved with the job in addition to what's been said you may also help students keep their materials organized you may have to read assignments reading passages aloud to them you may have to haul equipment around for them like the machine to make printed materials larger for seriously visually impaired students you may work with only one student have several that you follow or simply just stay with one teacher and help everybody in the class like i said it just depends on your school and your job some advice i might give carry supplies around with you often the students you work with forget things like pencil and paper you might also carry around a notebook to take notes in for yourself don't just help the students you are supposed to help ideally no one is supposed to be able to tell which students in a classroom are special ed and which ones are not of couse some special needs are pretty obvious but most are not so if you only help one student it will be pretty obvious that that student is special ed but if you help all the students then it won't be so obvious observe as much as you can while you are in a classroom discipline methods classroom procedures posters on the wall etc this will help you once you do become a teacher another thing aides are often asked to do many other things not just inclusion the inclusion aides at my school also have to do one lunch duty per day they often sub for teachers who have to leave the room briefly for an ard they go on field trips when extra people are needed they monitor the bathrooms and hallways during standardized testing so be prepared to do more than just inclusion as for increasing your chances of getting a job yes you will some other things you may not have thought about sometimes your degree program will consider your work experience for credit some of the aides at my school have been told they will not need to complete student teaching the way that others do their experience in the school is their student teaching so they will complete their degree a little more quickly also some school districts financially contribute to employees' education my district pays back employees up to a year for education including aides oh and here's something kind of strange the district pays of health insurance premiums for our aides but only about half of teacher premiums you will also have your foot in the door have already built a relationship with coworkers and administrators and you are likely to know what jobs are really available not just what's posted on the website  Graduate school GED Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education in Japan Education Education in Romania Beavis and Butt-head Education in Portugal Experiential education Academia Librarian Health insurance Insurance Teacher Annuity Professor Secondary education in Japan Columbine High School massacre No Child Left Behind Act Teach the Controversy Computer Japanese tea ceremony Great Teacher Onizuka College Education in Australia Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 College admissions Alexander Technique Education in Hong Kong Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Nurse A Course In Miracles Extreme Programming Physician Expert system Law school Theory of conduct Students' union Boston Public Economics Homeschooling Juris Doctor Separation of church and state Intelligent design movement Community emergency response team Marshall McLuhan Bristol Grammar School Dyslexia Literacy Ludwig Wittgenstein Trade union Church of Christ, Scientist High school Explosive material G-Man (Half-Life) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scholarship Education reform Consensus decision-making Teaching English as a Foreign Language Quizbowl Poker jargon Inflation Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Money Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Reiki Martial art Scientology beliefs and practices Microeconomics Adult attention-deficit disorder Social Security (United States) Emergency Medical Services Blackjack Apprenticeship Corporate governance Master's degree CPU cache Life insurance Milton H.

how can a person with nld learn to improve social skills i was recently diagnosed with nld as an adult and was told that people with this disorder have trouble interacting socially because we don't always pick up on non verbal cues can anyone give me some tips on how to improve my social skills so that i can communicate with people without them thinking i am a weirdo or not interested in what they are saying i also have add and sensory integration issues that were diagnosed when i was a child for children there are social groups that help with the many issues that you are speaking about picking up on non verbal cues it is typically suggested that you work with a counselor or therapist so that you can work on social skills the counselor or therapist would do role playing with you and model strategies that may work for you if you have a trusted friend or family member that goes to social gatherings you can develop a hand single or tactile cue to let you know something needs to be adjusted for example i work with a young man that likes to sit very close to another on a coach we developed a single that is socially accepted he will look at me i will tuck my hair behind my left ear if i need him to move to the left and my hair behind the right ear if i need him to move to the right no one in the room knows that i am cueing him it just looks like i am tucking my hair behind my ear if you are having symptoms of your add and sensory integration you may want to talk to an occupational therapist that specializes in sensory integration most ot's that specialized in sensory integration work with children but they maybe able to offer you some suggestions that will work in work place for example a stress ball is an example of something that might be suggested  Autism Hearing impairment Asperger syndrome Psychotherapy Dyslexia Controversies in autism Alexander Technique Dissociative identity disorder Psychoanalysis Transsexuality Traumatic brain injury Psychosis Nurse Aphasia Milton H.

why are some autistic kids fixated on pleasuring themselves my neighbor is upset because her yo autistic son spends most of his time touching himself she thought it was a phase that he'd go through but that doesn't seem to be the case he's probably too weird and spastic to get a girlfriend she hopes he would what can she do should she look for a paid sex surrogate or something maybe some meds rebecca i don't think calling them retards is very nice people with autism have a tendency to stimulate themselves because their sensory systems are not wired the same way as a neurotypical person's are because autism is a spectrum disorder no two cases of autism are the same the autistic symptoms my year old daughter displays may be very different from someone else's year old son or year old nephew etc etc some individuals with autism are hypersensitive to things like bright lights loud noises scratchy fabrics etc while others may be impervious to pain or gain pleasure from rubbing a piece of fabric over and over again etc the repetitive behavior of spinning banging heads rocking flapping hands or yes even touching themselves brings comfort by calming their nerves that are inflamed by living in a world that is not built to accommodate their particular sensitivities and which they don't particularly even understand and let's face it having those parts touched and fondled is something that is pleasurable to just about all year old boys not just those with autism although he probably gains more than just sexual arousal from it the big question here is how to teach him that there is a time and a place for that type of behavior stimming behavior as those types of repetitive behaviors are called in the autism world is actually beneficial to helping those with autism to stay calm without it they'd probably be a lot more prone to extreme meltdowns than they already are so your neighbor just needs to teach her son when and where it's appropriate if she wants to say that it's only ok in his room with the door shut at bedtime then once he learns that's the rule he will follow it the rest of the time she needs to teach him a command word like hands or something like that that means hands need to be out of his pockets or on the table or something like that every time he goes back to the undesireable behavior say the command and remove his hands when he goes the whole day or the whole morning or whatever keep a chart without engaging in the inappropriate behavior he gets a reward gradually you can extend the length of time he has to go without engaging in the problematic behavior in order to achieve the desired reward maybe having an hour of alone time in his room each night can be the reward for abstaining from it all day this really is not all that unusual of a problem in the autism world i urge your neighbor to contact an autism support group to get some input from other parents who have faced similar problems also there are lots of books out there that address similar issues as well http www autism resources com nonfictiontopics adolescent html it's not the end of the world she'll teach him and he'll come around it just might take a while is all hope this helps  Sensory Integration Dysfunction Autistic community Neurodiversity Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Ethical challenges to autism treatment Autistic spectrum Gifted Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autism epidemic Human sexual behavior Clinical depression Infantilism Drug addiction Pervasive developmental disorder Traumatic incident reduction Addiction Brain Milton H.

why do the special needs get builled a lot i have a slight autism and always get bullied a lot at school it's like some people are going to make fun of the thing what i do on the class i hate the class i hate the lunch break too since it's the high time to get beaten or get cheated i've even ever get smashed some chows into my face when they noticed it was way too gross looks like they do consider the special needs as the disturbs who are just crazy and can't do every stuffs i can't also do sort of things so quick as everyone does and it looks like making them so mad and things sometimes go really bad it'll just cause to the discrimination i can see the special needs are pretty easy to get builled or ignored because of their unique ways of thinking or doing please help me out from under so i can be little positive i'm years old i'm in japan where do you live and how old are you i'm actually asking those two questions out of curiosity and i apologize for that but our local schools don't even let the children talk literally for the first half of their lunch period anyway talking to a counselor is probably a good idea but i'm not sure that will do too much good the hardest and most important thing for you to understand and remember is that some people have so little self confidence or self worth that they have to bully and insult others to give themselves a false sense of worth the only way they have to make themselves feel better about who they are is unfortunately to put someone else down understanding that they are the one with the problem not you may help you deal with the situation but most likely won't make it stop hurting good luck  Social rule Kodocha Theory of conduct Great Teacher Onizuka Asperger syndrome The nature of God in Western theology Boston Public Spidey Super Stories 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shit Hip hop rivalries Time Out of Mind Poker jargon Autism Autism rights movement Pitaten Socrates The Ashlee Simpson Show The Fairly OddParents Goodness and value theory Microeconomics K' About a Boy Little Britain The Adventures of Pete & Pete Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ethics Cheating in Counter-Strike Columbine High School massacre Teen Girl Squad Bully Cheating in poker Political correctness Sydney Riot of 1879 Stuttering Domestic violence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Recurring South Park characters Hey Jude Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Drama Bat Lash Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Avenue Q The Emancipation of Mimi 1957 World Series Shaggy dog story Craps The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Computer chess Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Scientology beliefs and practices Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters God Emperor of Dune Tenshinhan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Theodicy The Shining (film) Chess Logic Stanton Macdonald-Wright Atheism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Atomism Beat generation Garfield Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Full Metal Panic?

what can you do to stop this from happening to special ed after spending up big on updating special education support units for children with intellectual disabilities we now find that the state government is trying to close down special ed support units they do this by what i think is an underhand method by putting special ed support units under review knowing that while a special ed support unit is under review it can't accept new enrollments thus giving the government the ability to say that they are closing these units due to low numbers knowing full well that parents with kids are trying to no avail to enroll their special need kids but can't because the unit is under review the state government has decided in it's armchair wisdom that integration is the way to go and is obviously trying to force it to happen considering the amazing job that special ed teachers and their aids do with these kids it is obviously a bad idea just ask any teacher parent or special ed student special ed kids not only have to be taught their abcs but they have to be taught living and social skills they are also put in supported work experience programs which are invaluable for their future a lot of special ed students have physical disabilities which require the support unit to look after i e some students have to be toileted and or bathed the students also enjoy the support of their fellow classmates who have disabilities and to integrate them into main stream classes would only alienate them besides what teacher in the main stream could possibly have the time to teach main stream kids and look after the needs of child with intellectual disabilities and it's associated problems the special ed support units have been doing an amazing and difficult job with special need kids and their parents so why try and fix something that's already working even a simpleton could see that integration is an amazingly stupid thing to do my question is mr prime minister is simple can you stop this ludicrous thing from happening don't underestimate the power of organized dissent you have a number of groups who will be gravely affected by this policy the parents of students with special needs the teachers who will have to take on yet more responsibilities in the integrated classrooms the former teachers and aides for special education the educational psychologists who test and make recommendations for children with special needs and adults with disabilities who have had experience in the school system an organized group of parents can make a huge impact through a letter writing campaign a few very angry parents may get the attention of the news media a teacher who is fed up and planning to leave the system may make a parting statement that will get the attention to this issue that is needed there are some parents however that do want their children mainstreamed for their own reasons and accommodation for these families needs to be made one other hope might be to get close to one of these decision makers through the social network by trying to find someone sympathetic to the cause perhaps someone in the government who has been frank about having a child with special needs you have a lot to lose it is a sickening situation so why not go for speaking out and organized protest  Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Intelligent design movement Education Homeschooling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Autism Special education GED Center for Science and Culture Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Teach the Controversy Extreme Programming No Child Left Behind Act Education reform Unemployment Affirmative action Graduate school Autism rights movement Education in Japan Education in Romania Education in Malaysia Infantilism School choice Education in India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Hong Kong Tripartite System Education in Portugal Charter school Alexander Technique Education in Germany Fathers' rights Down syndrome Section 28 Experiential education Abortion Equal Protection Clause Brown v.

i have a year autistic child who wears diapers at night he shreds the diaper to pieces by morning ideas we've tried everything from duct tape to wrestles singlets which another mom told me worked for her my child is potty trained during the day now yeah but is severely autistic non verbal so i can't have a conversation with him to reprimand or explain he can't do that to his diaper many autistic children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain textures some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable you might try changing the type of diaper that you are using your child may also have a sleep problem that includes difficulty falling asleep frequent nighttime awakenings and early morning awakenings stimulation of the limbic system of the brain may also help treat autism aromas from essential oils have the ability to stimulate this part of the brain since the sense of smell is tied directly into the mind's emotional and hormonal center try diffusing therapeutic grade essential oils such as young living's vetiver or frankincense or add a few drops on the soles of your child's feet to help her sleep better with less diaper shredding improving the diet can be helpful in cases of autism try replacing high glycemic sweeteners with a low glycemic sweetener such as blue agave nectar gastrointestinal disorders may be linked to brain dysfunction that cause autism in children try adding a digestive enzyme to your child's diet to improve digestion hope this helps good luck  Autism Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nutrition Autism epidemic Autism rights movement Traumatic brain injury Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Sensory Integration Dysfunction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Brain Narcolepsy Infantilism Insulin Medicine Gifted Autistic spectrum Diaper Breastfeeding Cancer Omega-3 fatty acid Puberty Insomnia Autistic enterocolitis Ethical challenges to autism treatment Hypnosis Addiction Autistic culture Prostate cancer Essential oil Autistic community Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Glucokinase Bedwetting Diabetes mellitus Sleep Clinical depression Andrew Wakefield Perfume Neurodiversity Intelligence quotient Erectile dysfunction Stomach cancer Aromatherapy Kimberly-Clark Corporation Autoimmune diseases Coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Thimerosal Adult attention-deficit disorder Stroke Diazepam Dyslexia Acne Clomipramine Sleep apnea Empathy Pervasive developmental disorder National Institutes of Health Honey Domestic rabbit Electroconvulsive therapy Autistic savant Fibromyalgia Haloperidol Gastrointestinal tract Endocrinology Acromegaly Gluten-free, casein-free diet Dream Vomiting Out-of-body experience Epilepsy Glycemic index Orgasm Theory of mind Thyroid Growth hormone deficiency Diabetic neuropathy Borderline personality disorder Motivation Consciousness Narcissism Radiation therapy Bipolar disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach

special needs statement hi my yr old son has been going through a special needs assestment for months last week i finally had his proposed statement of special needs does this mean he will definatly be statmented hi i to have had of my children with statements not they mean a thing if the wording is not very precise to meet your childs needs have there been problems identyifing your childs needs as no way should it take months to just get to the proposed statement the government have now time limits for the statement procedure and you can request this from your local education authority this a full booklet with the code of practice for such procedure as statements this tells you all the information on how long each part will take from the school getting involved other agencies being involved and also the education pyshchologist there are set amount of weeks for all these various parts and the proposed statement should be with you by weeks sometimes there can be holds ups when waiting for various agencies to write their reports and also at the end of the summer term as most of the professioanals are away at this time please get a code of practice and this will give you some indications of time limits you do need a very suportive school and a senco who knows their stuff does everyone involved know all the full details of your childs difficulties as many are just not trained in specific areas of special needs yes you will definately get a statement as you have been offered a propssed one but you do need help to make sure that are not being fobbed off we used an educational solicitor from lancaster to check ours over this is not as expensive as it may seem and if you are on low incomes sometimes you can get help i know if you where on benefits not to sure which ones that you got a lot of help as you did not have the money toy the full fees not to sure on that situation just now but it is well contacting a solicitor who will gladly tell you their fees before they start if you think that any of the stuff that you would like included has not been put in the propssed one you have the right to send them a letter stating so in the letter you need to tell them what you want putting in and be very precise if your child need help for so many hours a day from a learning support assiatant say this clearly as all leas are not good at offering stuff if they do not really have to do this sooner rather than later as i think there is a time limit for this cannot remember the exact amount off hand if they do send you a new statement which still is not up to your expectations you can ask for them to look at it again in the end we still never got what we wanted in our statements so asked for it to be finalised this then gave us the next route which was to appeal against the statement as it would not meet our childs needs and was not specific enough if you ask for this code of practice this also tells you all about these things and with their individual timescales we got fanatastic advice and help in preparing for the tribunial from ipsea who give free advice on all sorts of special needs education they even have representives who can come to the tribunial with you someting that all people should know is that if you go to a tribunial they can advise the lea what to include in the statement but ultimately they are not obliged to do so a bit of a cop out in my opinion as the leas know this we have now had to take my son out of school and home educate as they would not put the help in school for him apparently he did not meet their criteria which we found out changes on a regular basis i wish you all the best and keep fighting for the best for them as they deserve the very best every childs education is precious  Barrister

help describe ways students with ld could describe ways students with ld could be included in the regular education science or social studies class if their reading levels were well below the textbook level this is where you and the teacher need to collaborate you would modify the curriculum for those students even have an aide go to class with them for support students should not be sitting together as a group for that would defeat the one of the purposes of inclusion but among their peers there are times that this might be ok for certain activities but make sure gen ed students were also included the aide would be in the classroom to learn what the students are learning and to 'help' any student having difficulty but also concentrating on your students at times a behavior may need to be addressed and that could be accomplished just by the presence of the teacher or aide moving into the vicinity all work could certainly be modified shorter assignments taking tests back in their classroom oral testing give any notes to students ahead of time directly from the teacher during their class time in the sp ed class can be a time for them to get direct instruction for that class in that someone can read the material to them giving only the pertinent information alternative assignments may be accepted such as a drawing or other project in place of the gen ed assignment another advantage of inclusion is for the sp ed students to have peer models for behavior and social skills not to mention work habits and to be exposed to grade level curriculum make sure the teacher knows the limitations of each student so that they are not put in awkward positions as this can be the direct cause of behavior issues these are some of the things we did when i worked at a full inclusion school well mostly full  Homeschooling Intelligent design movement Experiential education Education in the United States Teach the Controversy Kindergarten Secondary education in Japan Graduate school Education in Romania SAT CPU cache Asperger syndrome Master's degree No Child Left Behind Act Affirmative action Center for Science and Culture Secondary education in France Education in Taiwan Special education Education in Germany Sex education Education in Australia Massachusetts Institute of Technology Standardized testing Grade (education) College Academia A Course In Miracles Dyslexia Economics Test (student assessment) Education in Portugal Waldorf Education Reading recovery Education in Hong Kong IB Diploma Programme Medical school Education reform Murdock-Portal Elementary School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Teacher Assessment College admissions Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Extreme Programming Education in Albania James Ruse Agricultural High School Martial art Creation and evolution in public education Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Hampshire College Social psychology Primary education __mile Durkheim Literacy A-level Physician Section 28 Middle school Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Tripartite System Hogwarts subjects Japanese tea ceremony Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Danish Folkeskole Education Cooperative education Psychology Boston Public Franklin W.

what is an example of physical retardation not to be cruel i have heard of mental and physical but never seen a person that is physically retarded no one actually uses the term physical retardation it's usually physical impaired physically disabled or physical handicapped these could be someone who had this trouble from birth cerebral palsy spina bifida etc or it could be as result of something else car accident stroke etc the term retardation actually means that development is slowed down so it doesn't apply here the same way it would in person with mental disability also known as mental retardation an adult with a mental disability the person would have things that he or she was relatively good at and then just like everyone else have relative weaknesses a person who has mental retardation can have a physcial disability but having one doesn't mean that the person has to have the other to help us understand the person's abilities quickly those serving individuals further divide the mental retardation into categories mild moderate severe and profound to keep it short and sweet mildly retarded adults can usually perform entry level min wage type jobs with some help adults in the moderate mental retardation range usually work in groups with coaches there to supervise at all times those in the severe to profound range are more towards the nursing care range but hopefully interact with the community in a way they enjoy people with physical impairments and no mental retardation lead lives as normally as possible with the help of technology and the people around them they may go on to earn a cpa teach history etc  Cerebral palsy Disability Cephalic disorder Traumatic brain injury Mental illness Autism Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Hypoglycemia Mental Health Act 1983 Asperger syndrome Rett syndrome Stroke Unemployment Nurse Urinary incontinence Spina bifida Political correctness Models of deafness Involuntary commitment Down syndrome Growth hormone treatment Labour economics Euphemism Abortion debate Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder Controversies in autism Cytomegalovirus Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Autism rights movement Aphasia DSM-IV Codes Atkins v.

i'm to begin teaching a nd rd grade moderate severe autistic class what do i do it's my first year teaching and i will be taking teaching credential classes at the same time i'm having a hard time figuring how i'm going to teaching these students i will have plenty of aides but how do i develop lesson plans and actually teach them i've searched online libraries and am not finding anything really helpful also are the learning state standards the same for autistic children thanks for any help i am going to be very honest if you do not have the educational background in special ed had any experience in teaching other than student teaching and the school and district are not providing you with the information and assitance you need to teach these children you need to reconsider this position moderate to severe autistic children face a myriad of challanges and it take a well educated experienced and supported educator to work with them it sounds as if you have very little understanding of autism the behavioral interventions you will need or the best ways to present information these kids are at a point where they can not afford to be placed with someone who has to figure this out as she goes along this is not a field to enter into as a way to get free tuition unless you are sure this is what you want to do if you are planning to take this get your credentials and then move onto a normal class as soon as possible please do not do it if i am wrong i do apologize that being said the school will provide you with copies of each child's iep this will include the targeted goals for each child in most academic areas as well as in speech and behavior you will be expected to use these goals in developing curriculum and lesson plans the behavioral plan for each child will also tell you what to expect as far as acting out towards others themselves and property and the way to handle it in general this will be different for each child you will need to come up with a general curriculum that you can then adapt to one to one teaching with each child all of this is not easy even expereienced teachers find it challanging you should have a mentor assigned to you use them for all they can offer schedule time to talk to all the specialists working with your students speech ot pt and get thier ideas and input read as much as you can in books that include commentary from parents and teachers with practical suggestions go back through the archives here and see what has been posted look up information on applied beharioral anylasis education for children with learning disabilities and alternate forms of communication your school should provide you with access to any books websites and the like they use you will more than likely need access to a site that provides simple images for use in visual schedule and communication books all of this sounds overwhelming as i said it is you will need to be smart enough to know that you need help and aggressive enough to make sure you get it good luck hope while i agree many general ed teachers have done outstanding jobs with inclusion students this young lady is teaching moderate to severe students in what would appear to be a self contained class for autism that can indicate that these are students with more intense needs and issues many of the suggestions being given are what we know to be the basics of teaching kids on the spectrum read the iep's firm schedules meeting with parents etc if this is informatation she has not heard or known it would seem she did not get even a basic class during college on special ed a huge issue in today's educational climate becuase nearly every class will have up to of it's students on an iep or it also seems to point to the fact that her administration team is not supporting her as it should this is clearly a new teacher going into a very challanging classroom she should be working one on one with a mentor to answer these questions and develop her plan for the year at the very least they should have given her the testing and curriculum standards as they apply to her class as without them she really can't develop much of a curriculum i support any person who wants to go into special ed however and i admit there are always things we don't hear or read in postings online this young lady seems totally unprepared for this move which could mean she had no intention of being a special ed teacher many of our best teachers come to the field in similiar situations but just as many come in spend a year struggling and leave leaving some of our most succestible students to try and make up what may have been missed overlooked or just not taught as the teacher was unprepared on how to run such a class i would rather have someone so unsure take the time to talk to her supervisors and peers get a few extra classes under her belt and build her confidence before entering this class  Education Homeschooling No Child Left

special education i am and was in special ed until second grade my teachers and parents have helped me a lot and i have slowly worked up to getting strait as in school now i help tutor the special ed class for math in the morning during the school year i was wondering why do some people not accept special ed kids how do they get into special ed in the first place why is it that some people like me are really successful and some don't quite make it i feel really guilty sometimes for getting through my learning disability like maybe i didn't deserve it i have learned a lot from tutoring but still have a few questions that i am too afraid to ask the teacher hi judy i will help you with your questions but these are good questions and the teachers you are working with would be more than happy to answer them i know they would because i am a special ed teacher myself people do not accept others because they are afraid annoyed or they do not wish to be bothered with someone that is different from them although this is more profoundly experienced when you have more severity in the disabilities that a person may have it happens to all of us people will not like a person because they have red hair or brown skin or are a different religion disabilities often make someone different from what a group of people might consider normal however the more a person is different the more they often feel like they are not 'accepted' they are our prejudices i call them the isms like racism agism sexism and others children are referred to special education by a person or group of people that have noticed a child experiencing troubles academically socially physically behaviorally or a combination of those factors to a teacher or school administrator there is a three tier process that must occur for a child to identified with a disability according to federal standards the first is called the iat process an intervention assistance team of people who work with the child meet and try to solve problems in the classroom with the regular education teacher if it works the process stops there if not then a formal assessment involving a lot of testing is done with various professionals that testing process is called a multi factored evaluation if these people determine that a child has a certain type of legal disability then the third step occurs a special program of study with a special education teacher it is written up with goals and accommodations designed to help that child and called an iep which means individual education plan everyone has different levels of ability and motivation some children work harder than others some have more or less support at home alot of things will affect how successful a child can be with the program i am so happy you have been successful i have children like you who may simply have been behind for reasons that could not be controlled early on and sometimes disabilities are either overcome or worked around this is not about whether or not you deserved it more than another it was just how it worked out for you you are a precious person to have gone on to be so grateful for the help you did get to now wish to share it with others you would make a wonderful special ed teacher my dear perhaps you might think about doing this in the future best wishes to you i have to run if you have any more questions write to me debi lockwood yahoo com  Education in the United States Education Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Special education Dyslexia GED Extreme Programming SAT Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Charter school Affirmative action Autism Education in Romania Clinical depression Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Gifted Learning disability Scientology beliefs and practices Kindergarten Education reform Expert system Cancer Experiential education Intelligent design movement Abortion debate Boston Public Economic inequality Controversies in autism College A Course In Miracles Education in Portugal Milton H.

my daughter is being forced to take a math class that is way above her head what can i do she's diagnosed with mild mental retardation and is in the california public school system she has to take an algebra class and she is barely able to understand multiplication and division i don't want her in this class and want her to continue to focus the division and multiplication and move on from there once she grasps that has anyone been in this situation and can give me a better understanding of why the school wants her to continue this algebra and fail her final grade last year was a d it was so sad because she tried so hard to understand it she'll be starting her sophomore year in hs i have asked the school for a tutor in the class room that is dedicated to her and maybe just a few other kids they have a tutor but he's dedicated to the whole class it is a special ed math class but it seems my daughter is one of the ones who just can't grasp it i do work with her at home also math is just the hardest thing for her to understand also does anyone know what my daughter's rights are concerning a tutor wow sorry that's happening here is a link to the ca board of ed parents' rights for students with disabilities i can tell you having previously lived there how hard you're going to have to fight this is going to depend on your district you may have quite the fight ahead of you http www cde ca gov sp se fp index asp the school could have any number of reasons for wanting her to continue my guess is it could have something to do with the nclb regs algebra requires a lot of abstract reasoning skills something that your daughter just may not have yet if she's still working on mastery with multiplication and division she may not have a strong grasp of variables fractions percentages ratios or decimals all of which are necessary for success in algebra here's a link that explains most likely why they are pushing her into algebra ca has determined that all students including disabled students are fully able to grasp algebraic coursework and need it in order to graduate they have apparently decided that remedial coursework for disabled students is a hindrance rather than a benefit to them so it isn't to be offered however it does state that disabled kids are to be taught in alternate ways making algebra more concrete with manipulatives calculators activities etc to make it more accessible to them this is a requirement according to the site your daughter should have the right to an iep that allows her to take the class in an alternate way http www cde ca gov sp se fp algebra asp hopefully it will be an easier road but from what you've said they haven't been terribly helpful hopefully this info will help  No Child Left Behind Act GED Education in the United States Mathematics Graduate school Grade (education) Education in Romania Stuyvesant High School Homeschooling Education in Australia Master's degree Milton H.

dose a person with dyslexia and discalculus come under pwd act dyslexia is a specific language disability most dyslexic kids that have received any remediation only qualify under section if they happen to fall standard deviations below the mean then they will qualify under the regular special education statutes it is difficult for these kids to qualify because many of them can read and write well but they have gaps all over the place i have students that can read any one under the bus but they don't have a clue about the plot i also have those that read painfully slow but have high comprehension they don't qualify on fluency alone but reading slow puts kids at an extreme disadvantage they put off reading and fall behind quickly i could go on and on describing the many situations that would cause these kids to not qualify dyslexia is a huge gray area special education doesn't want to recognize it as a named disability so parents have to fight for services  Dyslexia Learning disability Stuttering GED No Child Left Behind Act Education in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Milton H.

he was just over one year of age he started to regress he stopped talking cried a lot and stopped moving forward with his development soon after that elad was diagnosed with autism and the rollercoaster began autism is best described as a group of disorders with a similar pattern of behavior in three key areas communication social interaction and imaginative thought as a child with severe autism elad has difficulties with communication social development learning and behavior at present elad is not talking at all this makes his world very confusing frustrating and scary elad s lack of communication skills means that interacting and forming relationships with the people around him is very difficult and at times impossible i began to look into programs for my son i sought advice from a psychologist at autism victoria my son s pediatrician and read a great deal of information and research from around the world based on this research the general consensus from professionals in the field of autism is that aba applied behavioral analysis therapy is the most effective treatment program for children with autism evidence gathered that the best outcomes for children with autism are achieves by intensive early behavioural intervention recent studies have shown that quite dramatic and long lasting improvements can result aba is a treatment program focusing on the skills a child needs to be able to function successfully and to enjoy life to the fullest language social play academic and self help skills are all addressed aba is effective for children with autism as it teaches skills through a very structured program targeting the fact that such children do not learn naturally for the environment research indicates that the best outcomes for children with autism come from early and intensive intervention the new york state department of health has identified that for programs to be effective they must start early and include curriculum specifically designed for autism the intervention must be intensive a minimum of hours of one on one in other parts of the world including the usa uk and canada governments provide adequate funding for families to access early and intensive evidence based treatment they clearly recognise the importance of getting maximum and appropriate treatment at a very early age they know that if they don t provide this type of intensive intervention then the cost to the tax payer government of not treating those children in later life will be enormous autism and related conditions such as asperger syndrome and rhett's syndrome cost the australian community up to billion each year according to a new report on the economic impact of the disorder the report due to be released in brisbane today at the start of autism awareness week analyses healthcare costs education social services unemployment and informal care related to people with autism unemployment of people with autism was the greatest burden at an estimated billion a year autism spectrum disorders which affect one in australians are characterized by impaired social activity communication and imagination an estimated australian children suffer from the conditions synergy economic consulting which prepared the report for the autism early intervention outcomes unit described its modeling as conservative the report recommends greater investment in early intervention strategies that maximize the capabilities of people with autism if this improves education and employment outcomes for even a small number of people the benefits via reduction in costs and improvements in quality of life outcomes will be sizeable the report says in the federal government released a report entitled a review of the research to identify the most effective models of practice in early intervention of children with autism spectrum disorders which concluded to be successful early intervention needs to be extensive and intensive a minimum of hours a week over two or more years is essential for young children to make major gains unfortunately the australian and victorian governments do not fund early intensive therapy without the intensive therapy i might lose my son forever what other condition affects thousand australian children and their families costs the community billion per annum and receives little or no federal government funding i trust you will be happy to know that thanks to the help from some wonderful people organizations elad started his aba therapy on june he is doing very well learning new ways to communicate and express his needs which reduces his stress level it is really great for me to see that there is a hope for a better future for my son we still have so much more to accomplish at the moment elad is getting hours of therapy a week for the amount of per week my only source of income is centerlink payments allowance these payments do not adequately cover our daily living costs never mind the additional financial burden of my son s ongoing therapy and medical costs i am extremely worried about how i will be able to go on and support my children we desperately need a lot of financial support if you reside in the us you can call your local social security office and ask them to send you an application for supplemental security income ssi since autism is a life long disability states also offer insurance for children based on your income like for fl it covers doctors visits prescriptions and dental if or older my sons are covered through the state i pay for primary care visits for specialty care such as therapy for prescriptions and for er i too have a son who has autism i'm very grateful to have this coverage for my kids there's also the women's infants and children program wic in which they will give you checks per month for certain types of foods such as milk formula peanut butter tuna dried beans cheese eggs and a few other items you can apply for a medical government grant just as long you use the money for what it's intended for you don't have to pay it back some companies offers grants to people to help cover medical costs or medical equipment may look into area autism help support groups good luck
