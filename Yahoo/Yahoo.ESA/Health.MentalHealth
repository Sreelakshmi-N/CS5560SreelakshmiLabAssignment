i have this horrible fear of throwing up can i stop it i can actually pinpoint when it started back in fourth grade the stomach flu was going around and i was avoiding everyone who got it so much i actually stayed away from them i was afraid every time someone coughed they would throw up too now it's not so bad when someone says they feel sick i tell myself 'what if you didn't hear them say that you would never have known or worried' and it works somewhat i have a feeling that if i throw up naturally i'll get over it but i haven't thrown up in years and i don't want to force myself to throw up but is there an alternate way of getting over it this is actually kind of embarrassing for me to ask this but i know i'm not the only one and i just want to get rid of this fear please help also i'm not sure if i put this in the right category but this is my first time asking a question here lol i don't know if i can actually answer your question i have the same fear of throwing up and when people do it makes me want to as well it helps me to close my eyes and just breath really deep perhaps even use ice to cool u off and shock you a little into not thinking about it if you actually are sick and the sickness causes throwing up its aweful i know but it does kinda help your body get better quicker so just think ok i have to otherwise i'm gonna be sick forever even though it may not be true lol but something to that affect i hope i helped a little best wishes  Night (book) Milton H.

my mother is bi polar and crazy ok my mother has children and step children currently she has of them currently living full time with her step and of hers i can almost guarantee you that she bi polar b c she goes into the expisodes that i recognize from my bipolar friend yes there is a chance she has a deppression problem as i do but she's a little bit more extreme then i am anyways i am married and no longer live at home but when she has the episodes i usually get called either by her or my siblings in tears and i have to pull the family together i grew up with this and it caused me to resent my mother for many years i'm there for her b c she's always been there for me during my deppression times but it's really starting to ware on me my younger siblings all under get really emotional about this and start blaming themselves no matter how many times i tell them it's not them is there anything i can do to make her get help she doesn't beleie in drugs to help her problems but i know that she can't do this on her own and i am on anti depressants and it's a miracle how my life has turned around please if your anti drug dont comment i need help with this not criticism i do not live with my mother in fact i live one state and hours away i feel helpless b c i can't go and help her but i have a full time job and a husband cats that i have to take care of and does anyone know if i were to do a talk with her when is the best time of her moods to convince her to get help if she's convincible this is for my th post and whether or not you read this i'm still going to say it you'v obviously never had someone close to you who has a deppression problem it's not about lieing in bed and not being able to feed yourself it's about not being able to cop with everyday things like normal people its a handicap that theres nothing you can do about it and there's a wheelchair you could use but you refuse to excuse me for wanting my mother to be able to go a whole days and not feel like the world is going to crush her yes she works hard and she needs time off but she can't have it yes everyone has bad days but does everyone have bad days where they feel like nothing is worth doing the world might as well crush her everything is wrong and it's everybodys fault and there's no thinking happy thoughts at this time b c everything she tries to think of that is happy her brain will automatically think negatively so keep your niave and ignerant comments to yourself i can completely understand where you are coming from i currently live with my bi polar ocd grandmother my grandmother has been a mess ever since i met her and has this god like complex sometimes some days she'll be sweet and the next thing i know she throwing pots and pans she doesn't believe in medications either sadly there is no way to make her get help trust me i have tried someone will only get help when they realize that they really need it and that there is something wrong with them it is hard on everyone to live through this first i must suggest to try and talk to her honestly and bring everyone in on this to express their feelings to her that they love her very much but cannot see her live this way express the pain you feel and encourage everyone to do the same promise that you'll support her if she chooses to get help and describe to her what she is doing wrong it may not work and i know how it feels when someone refuses the help but the thing that scares people the most is fear that they will have no support and be left alone but it also is scary and angering to know that you are the only one who is receiving help or perceived to need it so bring the whole family in on a counseling session and heal everyone together that way it doesn't feel as if anyone is being singled out i can't say it will work but i pray that for you it does good luck  Pitaten Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Theory of conduct Friends Social rule Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.

i think i developed a cocaine addiction help i'm years old married and my husband and i started using cocaine a couple years ago at that time we tried it with then acquantiances but after a couple times we stopped and didn't have the desire to continue within the last two months however we have used cocaine several times a week and i'm scared that we have become addicted to it every time we make a pact to not do it anymore when the weekend comes someone will hint to it and the other will support us getting more i'm really scared i don't want to ruin my life and i see that it's not as easy as we thought to stop cold turkey because we rationalize the weekend use as just having a good time on the weekend i told my husband i was going to a na meeting this evening because i think we need help at this time he doesn't have the desire to go any advice thank you good for you for wanting to stop thats the first step first of all cocaine is absolutely psychologically and physically addicting i have been there and i had it bad so i can relate you are watching the slow motion movie of your life unraveling and the only way to change the upcoming scenes is to make sure you take charge of them now you do that by getting help changing your friends acknowledging your addiction and facing it with counseling therapy and maintaining a clean and sober lifestyle let me make this very clear you will not be able to maintain the same friends that you have now and possibly never will be able to be around them again they are enabling you to stay coked up and want you to it helps them justify their use if you do it too added afterthought danielle make sure that if you quit and start feeling depressed that you seek medical help and or counseling it is absolutely important that you do cocaine addictions use a part of your brain called neurotransmitters and neurons to create the high those same neuro's are used normally without drugs to help stabilize and experience emotions cocaine depletes those from the brain to make the high and as a result its why you need more and more coke to get high there are less and less neurotransmitters to create it quitting can lead to emotional unstability and its very important that you do not rationalize getting high when this happens but rather to seek medical attn immediately you cannot justify using other drugs either only medical treatments no pot coke or street drugs allowed period only medications that are prescribed ok you will need to go to your meetings and appts religiously and face the fact in your mind that you either are an addict or are becoming one and that you are taking control of your life now the next step is getting help for your husband because he will continue to use and it will either drag you back into it or destroy your relationship when you quit and he continues first things first get help now then get him help if you need more info or input or suggestions ask here and we will all gladly offer our help as best we can but first and foremost admit you have a problem and face it on a local homefront tell a mom friend dad brother sister cousin and ask them for help non illegal drug help  Drug addiction Addiction Alcoholics Anonymous Clinical depression Cocaine Transsexuality Drug abuse Neighbours Sigmund Freud Borderline personality disorder Antidepressant Friends Knots Landing Bipolar disorder EastEnders Dopamine Mental illness Withdrawal Alcoholism Meditation Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paroxetine Psychotherapy Arguments for and against drug prohibition Schizophrenia Prostate cancer Ex-gay Infantilism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Psoriasis Tobacco smoking Stroke Obsessive-compulsive disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psychopharmacology Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Scientology beliefs and practices Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatry Reparative therapy Neuro-linguistic programming Psychosis Methylphenidate Illegal drug trade Days of our Lives Post-traumatic stress disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Married... with Children Cancer Dead Like Me Diazepam Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Self-harm Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Multiple sclerosis Urinary incontinence Alprazolam Kurt Cobain Cannabis (drug) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Neurofeedback Mind control Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Motivation Goodness and value theory Narcotic Oz (TV series) Sleep LSD Clomipramine Social rule Health insurance Panic attack Fight Club Humphrey Bogart Anxiety Procrastination Stomach cancer Whitney Houston Divorce Doxepin Psychoanalysis Anorexia nervosa Sin City Narcolepsy Dualism (philosophy of mind) Boogie Nights Action potential The Amber Spyglass

can a residential treatment center deny treatment i live here in wi and my child is in need of rtc she's currently misdiagnosed with bipolar and is using substance or substance abuse there is a rtc that will address all of her needs and get her on track to a healthy lifestyle but they say that they don't feel their program would benefit my child this rtc boasts intense therapy in all aspects of their care but they have referred me to out of state in illinois and mn the facility in mn has referred me to south dakota to send my child how can i actively participate in my childs recovery if she is in illinois or south dakota i have adequate insurance to cover cost of rtc but seems like the facility don't want to take a chance on my insurance insurance has informed them that there is no limited bed stay and my only cost is for deductible i feel that my child is being discriminated against in some form or or another and why can't she be treated in her home state i'm having a big problem with this yes a private psychiatric or medical facility can deny treatment to patients whose conditions are not immediately life threatening and refer out medicine at least in the usa is not socialized as it is in canada and the uk for example and is a privilege rather than a right your child may or may not benefit from the particular program in question it sounds like the facility there believes that your child would be better served elsewhere when facilities refer out there is an excellent reason keep in mind your child means to a rtc as ugly as it sounds that is the bottom line not all rtcs will benefit all children hollering discrimination when a particular rtc does not meet your needs or when the facility that will meet your child's needs is inconvenient to you is not going to help your child discrimination has not occurred just because you do not happen to live near a facility that is equipped to treat your child unfortunate sure discriminatory not by a longshot if your child needs residential treatment the likelihood that you'll find a good one next door is slim you may need to get used to the fact that this will definitely present an inconvenience and possibly considerable expense to get your child the treatment he she needs i encourage you to do what needs to be done get on the phone with the facilities to which you were referred and see what you can do about arranging an intake ask them about ways in which you can still be an active participant in your child's treatment e g weekly family therapy sessions where you participate via phone the idea of residential treatment is to remove the child from his her current environment for an extended period of time as hard as this may be for you to swallow you are part of the current environment even if you lived next door to an rtc you would only be allowed to visit most likely for very circumscribed periods of time in other words the physical location of your child's rtc makes little to no difference in the larger scheme of things  Health insurance Bipolar disorder Prostate cancer Psychiatry Publicly funded medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Stomach cancer Medicine Insurance Infantilism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Opposition to cults and new religious movements Addiction Schizophrenia Stroke Cancer Borderline personality disorder Psychoanalysis Drug addiction Electroconvulsive therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Folic acid Homeopathy Breastfeeding Church of Scientology Terri Schiavo Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Involuntary commitment Mental illness Discrimination Canadian and American health care systems compared Psychology Urinary incontinence Ex-gay Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Password Autism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Same-sex marriage Drug abuse Legal aspects of transsexualism Adult attention-deficit disorder Alternative medicine Milton H.

can you be a good parent if you smoke marijuana i only smoke at night when my daughter is asleep never ever around her or anything where she is exposed to it do you still think that makes me a bad parent i am a very high anxiety person and smoking marijuana is almost like medicine to me it calms me down and centers me you're not a bad parent and niether is smoking pot the only reason why society believe marijuana is bad is because it can't be legalized and regulated marijuana has certain healing properties such as helping anxiety dulling pain and it can actually enhance memory if it were to be legalized the price would be much higher in the stores than it would be on the street and people would continue to buy it off the streets the taxes would also be through the roof maybe it would be best for you to find a different way a more legal way of helping your anxiety it wouldn't do your daughter much good if you were arrested for possesion would it  Cannabis (drug) Medical cannabis Arguments for and against drug prohibition Health issues and the effects of cannabis Health insurance Tobacco smoking Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cigarette Hypnosis Breastfeeding Legal issues of cannabis Free trade Cannabinoids Poker jargon Capitalism Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Cannabis cultivation Cocaine Consensual crime Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Hashish Black market Urinary incontinence Cannabis Gonzales v.

how can i feel more secure about making decisions i have a hard time making decisions i know it is somewhat of a fear i don't want to be responsible for a bad decision especially when it involves others i don't want to be the one to blame for anything it can be something as simple as where we go to eat to more trying things such as how to spend my money i feel like i let opportunities pass me by but at the same time i feel i am doing good by being cautious i have so many thoughts and ideas that i never act upon and i feel it is holding me back this affects many things in my life i have just as hard time making risky decisions as i do simple ones this also pertains to standing up for what i believe in i believe in keeping the peace as much as possible but at the same time i would feel great if i could express my concerns about issues but most of the time i cower in silence i don't think i have dystimia or anything mine is too emotionally charged i am worried about making a decision because of making the wrong one i don't want to hurt anyone feel guilty embarrassed ashamed whatever the possible wrong outcome of a decision is why i don't want to make that decision but thanks for taking the time to answer mike linda it's funny that you mention this because my wife used to be worse than you did she could never make decisions about anything where to eat what to wear what to buy you name it she couldn't decide on it she's much better than she used to be because i had to explain to her that if she makes the wrong decision it's not the end of the world i know it sounds simple but it's true if you go to a restaurant and half way into the meal you find that you don't like the food or that it's not what you crave so what that's a minor decision think about that a minor decision it's very important to distinguish minor decisions decisions that will only affect us for a short period of time from a moderate or a major decision that will go a long way in helping to cure you of this problem you're having understand that minor decisions should be easier for you to make my advice to you in making minor decisions is to put yourself in the absolute worst case scenario then think of how you'd deal with the situation if that scenario did indeed come to pass you'd find that many more times than not your wrong decision wouldn't really be that bad try it you'll see another thing you can try doing which won't be easy is to stop second guessing yourself oh goodness maybe i should have done it this way or did i make the right choice second guessing yourself will drive you mad the fact is you could second guess every decision you make for the rest of your life even if you knew you made the right decision i know this was the right decision but was the other option better make it a goal to stick with decisions once you've made them don't think about them at night dont' think about them in your free time just make them and forget them this will take practice but if you conciously practice this a lot of the anxiety will naturally subside with your decision making and subsequently give you more confidence to make decisions now there are some decisions that take time research and a lot of trepidation i know i probably spelled that wrong buying a car a house choosing a job whether or not to relocate i mean there are a lot of decisions out there that can really change the course of your life for quite a while but by the same token a decision still has to be made and it's important that you truly realize that mulling over an important decision is a good thing big decisions should never be rushed in to that much is obvious but dwelling on it grinding it out day after day playing out each scenario over and over again will eventually make the decision tougher and tougher then when you finally make the decision i guarantee you will second guess yourself constantly why because you'll tell yourself this decision can't be right because i took so long to make it if this truly was the right decision it would have been obvious from the start right yes no it's an endless cycle that again will drive you mad the bottom line is that you have to trust yourself everyone i mean everyone has made bad decisions and plenty of them and i know you know that even if you've made the wrong decision every single day of your life it's extremely important that you remember this it is human nature to self preserve that is it comes naturally to us to do what it takes to survive we don't even conciously think about it we just do it this is what we call instinct and most people will tell you that their first instinct is usually correct the reason you can trust your first instinct most of the time is because it's natural for you as a human being to do what's best for your survival dont' get me wrong i'm not advocating making snap decisions we all know that buying the first car we test drive or purchasing the first house we look at isn't a good habit to get in to but it's very important to trust the fact that ultimately whatever decision you make will be the correct one you've made it this far in life right you're not dead or paralized or seriously ill or in prison or anything horrible as a result of a decision you've made to this point right it sounds silly but it's true no decision you've made has ended your life your sanity or your freedom give yourself credit for that and trust yourself that you have no intention to start making horrible life altering decisions in that respect every decision you've made so far has been the right one don't believe me look in the mirror you're still here remember to also practice distinguishing the small decisions from the big ones once you get a handle on that you can start to mentally decide how much time or effort you can spend on a decision but start with the minor decisions and stick with them work your way up from there if you practice this consistently you should find that making even tough or major decisions won't be so scary painstaking or frustrating let's start now what are you eating for dinner tonight good luck linda  Poker jargon Goodness and

someone to talk to my life is not quite the way i'd like it to be and there are things that i'd like to talk about with somebody where can i find information about counseling or someone to talk to i've called those hotline numbers beforee but they really are no help and plus i think i need to talk to someone on a regular basis oh and also i'm not able to afford counseling or therapy tell me about it i called one of those 'suicide crisis hotline' numbers the night i took a major overdose of benzs they did nothing not even encourage me to seek help a lot of descent sized cities have available some type of counseling for free or based on income and if yours is incredibly low probably free still in my community they have catholic charities unfortunately what is available may or may not be good enough for someone with severe problems and needs i for example really need something called dialectic behavioural therapy which can really only be done by a psychiatrist or psychologist which is nearly impossible as these doctors are too expensive for individuals to pay for insurance virtually never will pick up the tab and because it is so unusual now for people to do this the waning demand has made for very few people of this qualification to actually be around with time to do these kinds of things finding the resources for counseling therapy on a charity basis can be tricky but check with like your county health department state contributed mental health place or psychiatrist's office of private practice and see if they can give you some referances my thinking now is that help is at least to some extent available at least in good sized cities  Psychotherapy Psychiatric hospital Psychology Involuntary commitment Clinical depression Psychiatry Transsexuality Mental illness Psychoanalysis Reparative therapy Sigmund Freud Suicide Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cancer Unemployment Microeconomics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Scientology beliefs and practices Bipolar disorder Divorce Psychiatric and mental health nursing Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Schizophrenia Transactional analysis Medicine Health insurance Procrastination Altruism Milton H.

please help i tend to be over analytical about things but i've always been this way since i was little it just seems i do it more lately for instance on occasion someone might make a remark that on the surface seems pretty normal but i will later replay the situation in my head over and over until i find fault like hidden sarcasm or condescendence in what someone said i don't do this every day but i notice i do it usually around people that i don't trust sometimes i will over analyze something my boyfriend said and turn on him until it becomes a 'witch hunt' like he calls it i usually feel horrible afterward i know i could let these things go but i usually wind up obsessing over them why do i do this is there a bigger issue here should i seek help are these the symptoms of some psychological disorder like ocd after reading your question i realized i could've written it myself about my husband he is in retail and if someone says something like i want plastic not paper in a tone that isn't friendly to his ears he will obsess and replay over and over we also get in torrential fights sometimes he went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ocd they put him on lexapro and he is a new man you should try and make an appointment with a psychiatrist and see if you can get a diagnosis if you are ocd this could be a pivotal point in your life that could make your world easier and your relationships stronger good luck  Obsessive-compulsive disorder Autism Asperger syndrome Anxiety Narcissism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Procrastination Bipolar disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Milton H.

is there an alternative my entire life i had been trying to figure out what i was abused by my mother and i finally found out that it's because she thought my father cheated on her when she was pregnant with me she drank six wine coolers a day to try to make him feel guilty for if she lost me or i was born with a defect thank goodness i wasn't then for most of my life actually until i moved out for college she told me how much she didn't like me how ugly i was threatening to kill me etc a bunch of stuff but now i finally know why i don't feel better like i thought i would you know i have tried talking to her about it but as you could have possibly guessed that was futile so how can i be helped to get over this would you suggest a therapist therapy can help some it's worth a shot it never helped me with my dad becoming spiritual helped me but everyone is different what you need is a mindset to help you feel content you can't change her but you are strong enough to realize that her behavior is wrong you know that she is unstable you don't want to be treated like that and you don't want to treat people like that but this is all because you are your own person you are not her so try to draw the separation between her and yourself and while still trying to maintain some sort of distant relationship with her because you don't need the guilt and find you what makes you feel good it makes me feel good to help children and make people feel good on a daily basis what are you interested in i enjoy reading academic work socializing etc these will help find out whether you need a spiritual sort of guidance or more psychological guidance i can tell you that considering what you have written you seem to be doing well for yourself you recognize the problem and want to attack it e mail me if you want to talk  Friends Alcoholics Anonymous About a Boy Theory of conduct Milton H.

why does it feel like my emotions are trying to kill me not all the time but sometimes things will hurt or disappoint me so much it feels like my emotions are trying to strangle me from the inside today for instance i had a couple disappointments for me after the last one i just wanted to lash and slam doors but that's not the type of person i want to be temper tantrums solve nothing so i just curled up on my bed and rocked flexing muscles until i was too numb to feel the disappointment anymore i generally think that being an emotional person is a bitter sweet gift it's hard to go through such deep unhappy times but the sky high good times are great plus being an emtional person makes you a better artist however times like this makes me wonder if it's really worth it i don't want to be an unhappy person but sometimes i just don't have anything left inside of me sometimes the hurt is all i have and i don't know how to make it go away is there anything i can do other than endure no pat answers please most people go through these feelings at some point in their life you are overwhelmed and you need to talk to people as you are doing now to get more than one viewpoint you have your viewpoint but it is not the only one and your viewpoint of life may be limited or inaccurate that is why you need the input of others who have been through this and to talk to others  Shaggy dog story Social rule Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Out-of-body experience Cliff Richard Self-harm Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Babe Ruth One Tree Hill (TV series) Goodness and value theory Traumatic incident reduction Asperger syndrome Jon Secada Anger management Stoicism Grief Richard Rahl Boston Public Aretha Franklin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Futurama (TV series - season 2) Nirvana (band) K' Equine conformation Borderline personality disorder Narcissism Polyamory Domestic violence The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Yoko Ono Year of the Spider One Life to Live Strap-on dildo Tina Turner The Curse of Fenric The Death Gate Cycle Customs and etiquette of Japan Humphrey Bogart Luck EastEnders Nicomachean Ethics Force (Star Wars) Wheel of Fortune Bernard Williams The Lovely Bones Professional wrestling holds Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dead Like Me Marilyn Monroe Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Emperor of Dune The Fairly OddParents Friends Knots Landing Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mahatma Gandhi Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Immortality Sant Thakar Singh Kill Bill Current teachings of Prem Rawat Anne Boleyn Utilitarianism Religion Bat Lash Sadism and masochism Scientology beliefs and practices The Wall Shit Storytelling Blonde on Blonde Fleetwood Mac Aesthetic Realism Shania Twain Avenue Q The Smoking Room Orgasm Martial art Rich Mullins Function (mathematics) Another Side of Bob Dylan Ayyavazhi mythology Sinfest Drill bit Richard Nixon Copyleft Emotions (album) Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Inside Rei Ayanami Carpenters The nature of God in Western theology G-Man (Half-Life) Alignment (role-playing games) Ty Cobb Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)

find something you enjoy yeah great advice except what if you don't enjoy things i guess i can't really say that i am in here right typing right there must be something of interest even if it's in the exploration of my present state of mind i guess i hear that phrase alot as if being told yeah okay i forgot that and move on as if the problem solution is that simple i realize it isn't that simple maybe it's from a lifetime of killing time on education without a focus or complaint since i did well in that maybe if's from my lifelong isolation from society as there isn't the focus of people seeing the problem maybe it's cause i just have no concept on my identity who knows so how does one find something to enjoy if one does not know what that is been told to just explore new things which is good advice for an extrovert but i'm clearly not that i realize i am seeking help otherwise wouldn't be in here i don't know maybe i just convinced myself i'm different from society around me and has no clue on what to do thanks for the early advice i guess that's why i didn't want to use the introvert word for i get how it could be viewed as an excuse i also get that with the limitations of space it's difficult to detail the things that happen in one's life that brought them to this point what concerns me and explored this with previous therapists is i'm starting to get the appeal of rage not in harming others for i don't have that desire but am starting to get why or rather how someone can close themselves off to feed on their own darkness i guess like an addiction if previously not stated has tried medications therapy group etc in the past and not ect not an option either it was a noted concern of my last therapist of growing possibility of not finding any place to fit in but uncertain where to go so therapy was halted i know sounds like i've given up but really haven't just no concept on where to go besides all the methods that already failed i posted the same question albeit in a different way a couple of days ago what makes me happy i honestly have no idea but thinking about it has brought some clues to mind i enjoy talking to my psychiatrist and psychologist i have started enjoying talking to my mom better and my two sisters and their children too i have had my meds substantially increased i think that helped too my good friend is going to meet me for lunch on friday i realize i enjoy talking to only certain people in a reciprocal way others i like to help at my clubhouse by talking positively to them i hope to be a peer specialist one day as you can tell grin i named myself that i am an introvert but that's not all bad i enjoy being here on this website and sharing experiences i enjoy receiving connections talking my nephews and niece live far away and e mailing all of them life can be good i truly think if we open up our minds to the possibility of happiness and then see what we think of try it you are extremely intelligent i sense that try it take care  Carl Jung Theory of conduct Medicine Milton H.

finding peace with theology okay i'm going to post this in both the mental health section and the religion and spirituality section since i don't really know which it belongs in i've always been obsessed with theology i started becoming completely taken in by it when i was about and was amazed by the different belief systems and religions of the world i hopped from church to church and from religion to religion on the one hand wanting to 'settle down' into the 'true religion' and on the other hand just wanting to learn and see as much as possible i've just turned and it's starting to seem like a burden the problem isn't just 'finding the right religion' although undoubtedly that's a part of it but rather an unceasing power it has over my life even my dreams are religious my whole life it's been an almost schizophrenic thought pattern and i never seem to be able to escape thinking about it it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just who i am and i've learned a lot but i can't switch off and it's exhausting even though i can see the world around me it seems to have almost lost it's value worldly things stop mattering when all you can think about is what's beyond that what should i do you are a mystic in the making that's a beautiful thing but i can tell you that the world will never understand it you probably will get people telling you that you are crazy but i hope that you will not succumb to those doubt thoughts your mind is opening wide it may be a while before you can understand it theology ideas and thoughts will never bring you peace of mind although they can help light your path for a while i don't know if you ever read krishnamurti's works but you might take a look at his books he was all done with religion and theology but was one of the most amazing spiritual philosophical thinkers ever okay so that's my opinion but it sounds like you are ready for that and you'd probably appreciate it most can't just keep asking questions the first part of it is the hardest part because you start to figure out that everything you thought you knew about yourself and the world gets turned upside down but it will be okay don't fight your calling my friend follow it  Jiddu Krishnamurti A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Socrates Religious Society of Friends Theology Friedrich Schleiermacher John Wycliffe Meaning of life Religious pluralism Max Weber Scientology beliefs and practices Discordianism Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Reality Jewish philosophy Jon Secada Alcoholics Anonymous Ontological argument Theory of conduct Past teachings of Prem Rawat Gospel of Thomas Human Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Summa Theologiae Predestination Rudolf Hermann Lotze Supernatural Causality Prayer Emanuel Swedenborg Theodicy Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Epistemology Philosophy of language Confucius Philipp Melanchthon Sant Mat Justification (theology) Anthroposophy George Fox Atheism Opus Dei Ludwig Wittgenstein Francis Crick Satanism John Howard Yoder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophical skepticism Meme Al-Ghazali Human nature Metaphysics God Christianity Free will Calvinism Belief Taoism Milton H.

no sleep what can i do when i first started working because i had different shift some in the day and some into mid morning i lost my sleeping routine now that i'm not working and back to trying to make a sleeping routine aside my husbands snoring i just can't manage to sleep i wonder if i have a sleeping disorder and if there is anything i can do about it my mind just thinks and thinks about anything and won't stop i take benadryl to sleep but with that it's harder for me to wake up in the morning because it makes me tired and fatigued is there anything i can do about this besides ear plugs but then how to i stop by brain from thinking you can restore your sleep routine by moving your sleep schedule forward a few hours every day until you find yourself sleeping at a time that you find more favorable having trouble sleeping happens to everyone at some point in their life sleep disorders usually have more symptoms than having trouble getting to sleep do you kick punch while sleeping do you find yourself going for sleep walks do you talk in your sleep do you snore and stop breathing while you sleep those are some potential symptoms of sleep disorders talking to your husband call help you find out what you do while you sleep if you do something unusual while sleeping like moving talking walking around then you might want to talk to a doctor about that i have taken tylenol pm benadryl tylenol to help me get to sleep and stay asleep when i'm extremely anxious i find that it does work however benadryl is an anti histamine and can make you drowsy after you wake up it effects the quantity and quality of your restorative sleep cycle this is different than just being asleep when people take sleeping pills sometimes the are asleep but not going through the stages of sleep properly in order to make you feel rested in the morning i have stopped using tylenol pm since learning about how it helps me sleep since i tend to sleep longer and don't feel rested afterwards now i know why it happens i do lay awake for hours sometimes but i feel decent in the morning after i eventually fall asleep on my own some things that can help you sleep are a cool environment too warm can keep you awake take your shower several hours before you go to bed avoid bright lights close to bedtime try to have a quiet sleeping place try to relax and not worry about not being able to get to sleep not drinking coffee other caffeinated drinks or alcohol within a few hours of bed time can help too  Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Out-of-body experience Sleep apnea Caffeine Social rule Clinical depression Sleep debt Sleep disorder Lucid dreaming Daylight saving time Diazepam Anxiety Breastfeeding Mattress Bipolar disorder Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carpal tunnel syndrome The Amber Spyglass Avenue Q Hypoglycemia Sedative Cannabis (drug) Chronic fatigue syndrome Coffee Delayed sleep phase syndrome Dream Humphrey Bogart Hypnosis Traumatic brain injury Milton H.

is it normal to want to be alone i feel like i want attachments like friends but i mostly want to be alone i feel like i want attachments like friends but only sometimes but there are more times when i just want to be by myself its definately normal to want to be alone its perfectly natural to go back into your shell whenever you need to chill out from the world it can be a bit stressful sometimes it is important to find a balance between time alone and time for sharing with others whether it is family friends or strangers because if you spend too much time by yourself you may end up forgetting what life is all about it is also important to value friendship without attachment becuase these are the most fulfilling kind of relationships based on mutual respect and enjoyment rather than needyness and comfort hope you found this useful  Love Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.

does emdr and eft effectively work in erasing the traumatic experiences of a person had are they behavior modification techniques or psychotherapy techniques they are supposed to be the best ways at the mo but check this out the words of a physiologist i'm seeing soon thank you for the enquiry i am always pleased to see people taking their personal mental health seriously and it is important to ask questions to clarify treatments or the people they are intending to see and i fully encourage any searching questions and points as raised i would certainly not disagree with your friend about the current lack of scientific evidence currently available around the rewind technique and this is currently being addressed by the human givens institute by engaging in research projects the fact however does remain that it has helped a great deal of people and hence cannot be discounted it is interesting to note that one of the most accepted theraputic approaches for years has been a psychodynamic approach which itself has little positive scientific evidence behind it one of the most scientifically researched and evidence based treatments is hypnosis and yet this is often termed a fad in certain quarters i feel the most important point to reassure you on is that i use a range of approaches and that no one technique has all the answers what i always do in an initial session is to give information on how trauma works and ways it can be effectively treated we then move on to building in a number of approaches which will help ou move on right from the first meeting these approaches can include the rewind cbt and other aspects which having spoken and discussed with you can be identified as the best way forward my phd dissertation completed only last year was on the effective treatments of ptsd and trauma and i know the limitation but also the possibilities i think the most important thing to recognise and one well evidence in various research projects is that medication alone is not the answer to any psychological issue and that the relationship and rapport between client and therapist is one of the key factors to success regardless of the theraputice approach i feel sure that we can help you to move on and hope to have the opportunity to meet with you in order that you can make your own mind up i am more than happy to answer any questions you have and anything i can do to help you move in the right direction which ever way you feel that is i will be happy to do so  Traumatic incident reduction Clinical depression Hypnosis Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychology Neuro-linguistic programming Dissociative identity disorder Scientology beliefs and practices Sexual orientation Milton H.

therapy and insurance future problems my parents are driving me crazy so i thought i'd see a therapist then i read this scary story about a woman who was turned down for insurance because she saw a therapist years earlier even though she wasn't medicated or anything i know whatever i do through my insurance company will be disclosed in the future but how bad could it get i don't need medication or anything i just want to talk through the problems with someone before my baby comes in months but i'm more stressed out about this insurance stuff than i am about the actual problem with my parents i can't afford it out of pocket should i be worried it actually depends upon your insurance carrier get your folks to get a benefit booklet and pore over what is covered and what is not my youngest has adhd odd our insurance paid for the psychiatrist but not the therapist odd yes daughter is only on medication for depression and not adhd and her psychiatrist gets paid after a yearly deductible is met we are responsible for the rest of the cost the therapist worked out a schedule where we could pay what would normally be our insurance copay so it is okay altogether an insurance company can change its policy in the middle of coverage and many do too many change so what you heard may very well have been true you have to sign consent forms for the insurance to review your case regardless of where you go and who treats you good luck  Health insurance Insurance Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Life insurance Transsexuality Auto insurance Clinical depression Unemployment Psychotherapy Dissociative identity disorder Medicine Publicly funded medicine Social Security (United States) Procrastination Adult attention-deficit disorder US health reform under FDR Ex-gay Variable universal life insurance Health care in the United States Legal aspects of transsexualism Milton H.

how do you deal with a hypochondriac my husband is constantly telling me how much is wrong with him and has something new every other day he's physically one of the strongest people i know and i know this is all in his head nothing i say or do is right i can agree or disagree and he gets upset what's the best way to handle someone who believes he is ill and is not also he goes to the dr and tells them what is wrong with himself he doesn't like any dr he's ever been to and he's over i tell him maybe he should switch doctors but he doesn't like the next one either we've been together years and this part is getting old ignore his behavior nod your head silently and go off into dreamland when he starts i have a close friend who is the same way and except for that facet of her personality she is a great person my theory about hypochondriacs is that they desperately need attention maybe if you don't give him any feedback either verbally or with body language when he begins his litany he will tire of getting nowhere with you he can only help himself if he cannot see that he has a psychological dependence on attention and fear then you have to steel yourself against it by being non comittal but still letting him know you love him you can't have him committed so grit your teeth and seriously go off into dreamland that's what i do when my friend starts in good luck it must be horrible to live with this  Theory of conduct Social rule Le Malade imaginaire Milton H.

can you buy prozac or any other antidepressants without prescription my friend in new zealand has been on them permenently for the last yrs i cant see her dr prescribing them for that long so i was just wondering if they are readily available to buy anywhere no except illegally of course it is not at all uncommon however for a dr to prescribe them for a very long time even in some cases for a lifetime prozac is considered safe over the long term though more studies will be needed to confirm this once it has been around for a longer period of time the only anti depressants you can buy over the counter are herbal remedies e g st john's wort which have not been tested in line with fda requirements for drugs so have not been proven effective prozac cannot be bought over the counter in new zealand prozac is relatively easy to find on the black market and is often taken by teenagers who generally in error think it will give them some kind of quick high since prozac takes time to build up in the bloodstream one dose won't do much but make you a little jittery hope this helps nathan  Antidepressant Fluoxetine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Clinical depression St John's wort Psychopharmacology Paroxetine Bipolar disorder Pharmaceutical company Food and Drug Administration Psychiatry Herbalism Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Withdrawal Antiretroviral drug Bupropion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Illegal drug trade Maprotiline Methylphenidate Aspartame Chlorpromazine Amphetamine Diazepam Methamphetamine Borderline personality disorder Migraine Medical prescription COX-2 inhibitor Sertraline Medical cannabis Growth hormone treatment Post-traumatic stress disorder Drug addiction Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Clomipramine Fibromyalgia Lamotrigine Kevin Trudeau Off-label use Generic drug Arguments for and against drug prohibition Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Drug test Prostate cancer Anxiolytic Medicine Cannabis (drug) LSD Prescription drug Gabapentin Duesberg hypothesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Fluvoxamine Premenstrual stress syndrome Acne Pharmacopoeia Haloperidol Sildenafil 5-HTP Prozac Nation Hypoglycemia Herpes simplex virus Atomoxetine Controlled Substances Act Erectile dysfunction Oxycodone U.S. Electoral College Isotretinoin Chemical imbalance theory Analgesic Doxepin Transsexuality Eczema Stroke Codeine Thimerosal Contract Kurt Cobain Paracetamol Convention on Psychotropic Substances Venlafaxine Anorexia nervosa Folic acid Baldness treatments Biological psychiatry Mood stabilizer Lorazepam Tocopherol Abortion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trimipramine Antipsychotic Methadone

have you ever taken klonopin what side effects if any did you have my doctor just prescribed me mg of klonopin to take once a day or as needed for my anxiety i was just wondering if anyone has any experience that they can share in regards to this drug any side effects such as weight gain irritability drowsiness etc thanks hi cheyanne i also take klonopin to control panic attacks i have not experienced any side effects today most experts will advocate klonopin as a much wiser choice than valium or xanax as there is much less scope for addiction and abuse i have not had any side effects of weight gain irritability or drowsiness and i have found it to be very effective in getting my panic attacks under control another good thing it that it is available in the generic form and so it is very cheap to fill my prescription each month the most important thing is to take it exactly as directed and be very cautious about drinking alcohol with it until you know exactly how it effects you combined with alcohol the effects of both are increased follow your doctor's instructions and you will be fine especially don't stop taking it abruptly or fool around with the dose please don't let people make you feel bad about taking this medication and don't get freaked out by so called addiction issues panic and anxiety are medical disorders that seriously impact on the lives of sufferers it is like telling a diabetic to not take insulin as they will end up an addict congratulations for taking charge of your health this is an effective med and i hope you have the same good experience with it i have had  Anxiety Diazepam Panic attack Drug addiction Alprazolam Bipolar disorder Migraine Chlorpromazine Doxepin Maprotiline Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Clomipramine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Addiction Paroxetine Chronic fatigue syndrome Benzodiazepine Folic acid Sedative Drug abuse Anorexia nervosa Hypertension Borderline personality disorder Cannabis (drug) Opioid Medical prescription Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Psoriasis Atkins Nutritional Approach Medicine Methylphenidate Antidepressant Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Caffeine COX-2 inhibitor Flunitrazepam Antipsychotic Stroke Withdrawal Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Narcotic LSD Common cold Controlled Substances Act Clonazepam Tobacco smoking Obesity Psychopharmacology Anxiolytic Sleep Obsessive-compulsive disorder Haloperidol Oxycodone Convention on Psychotropic Substances Epilepsy Fluoxetine Lorazepam Asthma Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone treatment Meditation Insulin Animal testing Dieting Venlafaxine Cocaine Bupropion Aspartame Kurt Cobain Buprenorphine Trimipramine Pharmaceutical company Medical cannabis Pneumonia Alzheimer's disease Alternative medicine Hypnosis Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Word of Wisdom Charles Darwin's illness Chlorprothixene Paracetamol Propranolol Rush Limbaugh Gastroparesis Fecal incontinence Health insurance Homeopathy Traumatic brain injury

my poor self esteem is causing me to be a lesbian can this statement be true i don't want to be rude or anything honestly what is wrong with you people for many years homosexuality has been a taboo now that people are coming to their minds they are making a taboo in favor of homosexuality can't you just see something without prejudice or any feeling of guilt for a moment look back at your answers can't you see they mostly lack any logic she's asking if poor self esteem may push someone toward being a lesbian not if every lesbian is so because of low self esteem i think that's quite possible i give you a couple of examples if somebody has been sexually abused by a man during childhood he or she is more likely to show homosexual behavior an abused girl is likely to develop hatred or disgust toward men while an abused boy has an early sexual experience with a man and that definitely affects his mind set and senses if a girl is masculine or for some reason is more attractive to lesbian woman than to men she's more likely to try being with a woman isn't this obvious not being attractive to men causes low self esteem and having homosexual women around adds to the temptation one may think why not being with someone who can appreciate my beauty and so on the same for a girly boy not that my word has any scientific basis but i've seen more than a few examples and i try to use my mind  Transsexuality Pedophilia Homosexuality Human sexual behavior Homophobia Sexual orientation Gay Bisexuality Gender role Biology and sexual orientation Lesbian Reparative therapy Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and Christianity Yuri (animation) Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Child sexuality Effeminacy Gay rights Theory of conduct Infantilism Religion Homosexuality and transgender Gay slang Friends Homosexuality in China Aesthetic Realism Pederasty Transgender Serial killer Childlove movement Social rule LGBT Rape Domestic violence Homosexuality and Islam Strap-on dildo Anglican views of homosexuality Religion and sexuality Paragraph 175 Philosophy of language Homosexuality in Japan Sex education Cross-dressing Incest Sigmund Freud Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sex and the City Friendship Feminism Germaine Greer Butch and femme History of sex Same-sex marriage Falsifiability Age of consent Gay rights timeline Physical attractiveness Heterosexuality Joke Girl Choice and sexual orientation Coming out Transvestism Married... with Children North American Man/Boy Love Association Marriage Epistemology Anal sex Sexual revolution Oral sex Pornographic movie Atheism Adoption The nature of God in Western theology Baldness Sex in science fiction Alignment (role-playing games) Laura Schlessinger Rosie O'Donnell South Park Sexual intercourse Sadism and masochism Pornography Homosexuality and medical science Gender

problem with socializing it happens a lot with people i barely know but also sometimes with those i do when i have a chance to speak up or ask questions i don't it's almost like i lack the energy to express myself what could be wrong it sounds like self esteem or confidence issues are you concerned what they might think of your questions do you think they will find them trivial or stupid sometimes people don't want to express themselves because they don't want to have to defend thier position or inquiry just a thought i know that's true for me a lot of times the only solution is to speak up most of the time it's just built up in our head but it's really nothing in reality  Social rule Philosophy of language Reality Epistemology Theodicy Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Consensus decision-making Franz Boas Atheism Philosophy Victor Cousin Condon Committee Plame affair Randomness Time Out of Mind Aristotle Criticism of libertarianism Ethics Cultural relativism New Testament Martin Heidegger Theory of conduct Sponsorship scandal Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Irony Australian English Law of value Ontological argument Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Simone Weil Freedom of speech Goodness and value theory Leadership The Wealth of Nations Scientific method Linguistics Halting problem Science Drama Self-esteem A Course In Miracles Radio Yerevan Identity and change Metaphysics Vivian Solon Abortion debate Religious Society of Friends Shit Current teachings of Prem Rawat David Hume Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Hutton Inquiry Transformation problem Derek Parfit Modernism Adoption Joseph Louis Lagrange Rudolf Hermann Lotze Fair use Esperanto as an international language Particle in a box 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Transactional analysis Intelligent design Falsifiability Meaning of life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophical skepticism Porter J.

for those of you with depression how do you function in a society where in my case anyway i have to raise a year old boy with no help work full time go through a divorce be in the midst of recovering from drugs dealing with parents who say things such as we wish you were never born etc i do as much as i possibly can during the day including going to therapy and support groups but at some point every single day i just can't take it anymore where just having dinner with my brother becomes a huge chore and i cannot do it then the cycle begins of my family saying that i don' t try enough i am turning my life around and starting from scratch and doing it all by myself and yet those around me don't udnerstand my depression and never look at all that i do do it's all about what i don't do you didn't have dinner w your brother my son and i aside i can't take the pressure of having to please my parents friends etc i am just running on empty and have been doing so for way too long i was a victim most my life most recent was an abusive sister who was telling me i was pessimistic was unreliable violent a bad mother and the punishments lord after years of this i totally lost myself i no longer knew who i was my confidence was gone i was shattered i couldn't believe people who said i was a good person all the good i'd done dissolved into a grim dismal haze i turned to sleeping pills and overdosed several times eventually i realized i had to escape when i saw what i had endured witnessed and allowed i became enraged furious the only things i could feel was depression rage or absolute numbness people avoided me due to my anger i finally hit rock bottom which created change i actually began to face my anger and pain i got off pain meds and decided to just deal with my physical pain i realized my thoughts were molded from birth and forgave those who taught me for they were also taught blame is pointless forgiveness everything the hardest part is forgiving our abusers mom quoted the saying poison destroys the vessel in which it is kept she d remind me of my grandfather s face the permanent frown etched there from years of hate i won't be a vessel like my him for i saw his destruction that still ripples out dreadful emotions fester spilling over to contaminate all that's precious leaving merely empty wasteland my abusers cruelties will no longer infect me like that sometimes we must remove ourselves from negative situations especially when people intentionally hurt us are pulling us down or try drawing us back to old patterns change frightens them it is scary because we become a different person sometimes friends and even family no longer play a part in our new life i found myself grieving for awhile because i didn't seem to fit in but it passed i discovered new friends that inspired rather than drained family can learn acceptance and may even change because you've set an example however i had to leave some behind i moved across the us to find peace but you cannot run from problems or you will recreate them elsewhere i dealt with them before i left this part is most important the way i saw myself i had to see myself as strong and worthy i had to learn to value myself before others could i had to see myself for who i was a book called how we choose to be happy helped me with that it really changed my life along with other powerful books i also had to consider what i wanted in life something i never really gave much thought to because i was taught to please others it took some time to consider but i finally left california to find myself i'm still in the process of that but i've healed tremendously i had to face the fact that i was groomed to be a victim there are things we do to remain victimized and there are predators who recognize this to prey on us i have been working very hard on my feelings mind set and behaviors i am changing for myself and as an example to my daughter and son who have also suffered i suffered excessive negativity night terrors and sleeplessness because of sexual and emotional abuses and traumas i have gotten so much better because of self help books color therapy and meditations these have changed my life though it takes time work and lots of commitment perhaps it could help you i've been working very hard changing myself and my thinking like seeing what i've gained not what i've lost i'm happier because i've been changing the way i see myself and my world but change takes time so be patient it's doesn't happen over night if you are interested in meditation let me know i will provide a couple that helped me or you can purchase books on it energy is real we actually carry negative energy left behind by our abusers people who have been abused have higher rates of health problems i have spent a great deal of time releasing that energy into the earth there's so much more that i have done like change the way i allow myself to be treated learning to love myself realizing i am worthy god bless you love recovery and healing is a difficult road but definitely well worth it the rewards and peace of mind are indescribable take care good luck and god bless  Traumatic incident reduction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Anger management The Amber Spyglass Grief Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Force

is bullying 'belittling someone and making yourself superior or more powerful' in this story bully or not my brother made alot of belittling jokes to me and argued with my over life and parenting decisions and made me feel embarrassed and inferior i told him this is how i felt and please stop my brother was rude in return and said that i can't take a joke so i told him i and my children felt bullied and to stop or stay out of our lives he got very angry and phoned me and was swearing and yelling when he stopped i said a few things and he started yelling again and swearing i listened for awhile and finally hung up so he emailed me 'i love you and will forever but until you get over your issues and quit creating conflict wherever you go we will never have a normal relationship if you can't get over the past you will die a old alone and bitter woman' i am wondering if that email is another form of bullying it once again made me look inferior and him superior my girlfriend thought this was more bullying but i am not sure so i am wondering what others opinons would be your question really touched me because i've been there i lived years with an abusive sister i was blind because i was taught that that kind of behavior was ok well it isn't i used to make excuses and defended her for years until i actually saw the very real brutal repercussions it was an awful shock and i wondered how i never recognized it people underestimate the damage done by bullies they don't realize the truly destructive wound left by verbal abuse i didn't even realize it was abuse because it wasn't physical this kind of devastation isn't against the body it attacks the soul it destroys the victims from within like being caught by a spider you are slowly wrapped in a web of manipulation lies and deceit once entangled you no longer have the strength to struggle or the will to leave isolated from everything you love they feed on your energy draining you sounds bleak i know but that is how it works people who suffer abuse have many more physical problems and illnesses the things i ve seen now i m trying my best to help prevent and heal abuses you see by the time my sister was done with me there was nothing left she had stripped away my hopes and dreams my pride and endurance my friends and family the list goes on i couldn't even stand to be seen on the street because i felt an embarrassment to my children i ended up with a severe breakdown i believed that i was the problem because abusers make it look like it s the other person it took my children to open my eyes my son had me listen to an atlantis morset song saying it was my sister i believe the song is called perfect i had to listen several times for it to really sink in when i realized what he was trying to tell me it hurt deeply but it wasn't until i caught my daughter mutilating her exquisite body that i knew i had to leave you see my sister s daughter did the same thing when she was young that s when i knew it wasn't me i wasn't the main problem like she led me to believe she was a bully is no joke their cruel intentions h a r m period as for me and my sister well we don't speak my other sisters gave up on her too sad but true i cannot say i don't love her or miss the good times we had but i am so much happier and so are those who've gotten away from her i would like to have helped her but she couldn't hear anything negative about herself she could only point out everything wrong with me plus things that didn't even apply things that were really her i don't want to tell you to stay away from your brother forgiveness became necessary for my healing hate anger and resentments were harming me and my family still separation became my only option after the horrible things she did for myself and my kids it was our only solution here s a poem i wrote after leaving my sister about the power of words beware the words you choose it s not hollow when the bible states in the beginning was the word words divulge opinions and truths they convey the abstract and absurd they help poets compose their poems they can embody a friend or foe enlightening a love of the passion one holds or striking a powerful blow beware oh friend the words you use to cause one pain and sorrow though they suit your needs today you may repent them on the morrow the right words chosen with care can shatter the strongest man they can demolish the brightest dreams and crush the gentle lamb an angry tongue can change your life a life you once enjoyed once harsh words escape your lips they can never be made void it may seem gratifying at the time to bring your love to tears but bitter words can pierce the heart and fester through the years look intensely upon yourself find the scars that lay thereon reminders of ancient wounds though physical pain is gone look now deeply into your heart recall when you were young are there wounds that still ache from words of a hostile tongue merciless vindictive callous words carry a deadly stinger many years may pass away but their painful wound may linger if this was your intent if you're conscious of what s inflicted in wounding another s heart you can t escape unaffected each conquest has a cost it s victory with a double edged sword its harsh bittersweet taste yields a dissonant heart as reward dispensing lies won t help cause your heart knows the truth for the cold hard reality is a brutal heart can t be soothed residue of your words clings to you a gloom you can t escape with each wound that you inflict a darker soul takes shape charity is the antidote it brings illumination to the night forgiveness a gift one can give oneself for with it comes respite  Theodicy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Infantilism Boston Public

teen depression how to solve it without adults how do you overcome depression when you're a teen without going to an adult for help i know it's best to go to an adult for these kinds of things but that would ruin my friend's life even more she doesn't see an end to it and feels that the only reason she's still alive is because it'd hurt others too much she doesn't want to do anything fun she feels like just sitting in her room by herself it's hard to explain but the way i can is that she can feel the sadness sinking in her taking over her life what can we do how can i help her get through this so i can see her happy again i'm thinking of research what exactly should i look for thanks in advance for any suggestions and answers she's already had therapy her parents use to take her but after a while they gave up and nothing terrible or horrible or drastic has happened in her life the good news is it will pass in time around it really started lifting for me try to get her to go outside and enjoy herself hang out with friends go to parties etc any physical activity usually helps excercising is a big one or if she doesn't want to leave her room bring things to her video games get take out and watch a lot of movies just any activity besides sitting alone in the dark if she writes try to hint that she write out all the thoughts before she goes to bed each night they'll regroup but the more she does it the less intense it will get i think all forms of medication if you're under need to be through your parents so that might be a last resort bottom line is to keep the activity and physical focus up and the emotions out either written if she wants it private or talking about it and it will pass as the teen years progress much like acne does  Pitaten Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Prostate cancer Transactional analysis Social rule The Lovely Bones Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Infantilism Borderline personality disorder The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.

having some really weird mental problems i'm going to try to describe some stuff here that has always been part of my life but i cannot explain it a little background my mom is skitso effective she is not full but just has some symptoms of it she is also on medication for anxiety and depression all my life i have felt like i have to hurry myself i am always worried and anxious about things and then i look at others and see people do not act the same way i do i will sometimes just worry about things for hours and cannot stop them in my head also when i am in public sometimes i get very anxious or nervice for just no apparent reason it's like i cannot control it and am telling myself i'll be fine but i shake and move very oddly almost fidgety sometimes i also think about death and am very depressed i don't want my life to just be lost and forgotten when i die i just want to make a difference in the world so my time is not meaningless at times i feel like i can almost be two sided like angry and sad i am years old and am male i would definitely see a psychologist from what you've described it sounds like you're suffering from an anxiety disorder with a side of depression this is especially likely if your mother is schizoaffective so i would make an appointment and get a perscription for anti anxiety or anti depressant medications it's nothing to be ashamed of it's a chemical imbalance in your brain and the medications can correct the balance and one in five people will suffer from mental illness at some part in their life believe me you're not alone  Anxiety Clinical depression Mental illness Obsessive-compulsive disorder Panic attack Bipolar disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Chemical imbalance theory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Borderline personality disorder Schizophrenia Transsexuality Shaggy dog story Baldness Multiple sclerosis Charles Darwin's illness Psychiatry Anorexia nervosa Adult attention-deficit disorder Alcoholism General anxiety disorder Eating disorder Stress (medicine) Hypoglycemia Parkinson's disease Insomnia Stroke Schizoaffective disorder Childbirth Binge eating disorder Sigmund Freud DSM-IV Codes Psychosurgery Narcissism Drug addiction Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Phobia Antidepressant Clomipramine Psychosis Diazepam Multiple chemical sensitivity Stuttering Anti-psychiatry Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Social anxiety Tobacco smoking Psychopharmacology Autism Bupropion Hypnosis Psychotherapy Paroxetine Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Controversies in autism Electroconvulsive therapy Balance disorder Intelligence quotient Social psychology Self-harm Sleep Fibromyalgia Series finale Avenue Q Drug abuse Sexual orientation Meditation Asperger syndrome Psychoanalysis Haloperidol Urinary incontinence Medicine Anger management Breastfeeding Methamphetamine Chlorpromazine Bulimia nervosa Dead Like Me Social rule Depression (mood) Cerebral palsy Abortion Cephalic disorder Venlafaxine

why am i having these nightmares i am having nightmares a lot and they concern me they are all about ghosts and dead people and people not knowing that there was even a ghost i just woke up from a dream and can't get back to sleep and here is what happened it was dark i was in my room and i walked into the hallway my moms room is right across the hall and i see a little white figure staring up at me of course i scream and run downstairs to my mom she didn't hear my scream but i guess i was holding a manga and she started reading it random anyways so i was very scared so i grabbed her hand something i always do when i am scared all of a sudden our hands kept like shocking i dunno how to explain it but ever few seconds the screen in my head went black and i saw a little bit of white where our hands are to represent the shocking i woke up of course almost to tears because of how scared i was i realized that i think the shocking may have been my heartbeat interrupting my dream help i recently had a nightmare like this not long ago it was odd me my best friend britany and two elderly people were walking down a hallway i don't know what hallway it was though one part of me remembers it to be a long white hallway one part remembers it to be a long hallway with only a bit of light so anyways there were no windows just doors i think i touched the door handle to open the door and all of a sudden i saw a ghost and i like shocked as if a big wave of electricity went through me it feels like i did it in real life too i fell to the ground in my dream and everyone got down to help me they didn't see the ghost another dream i had was that i was at my grandmas house and it was a huge infestation of ghosts everywhere i guess in the dream i tried to knock myself out or something to get them away from me once i did that i woke up it was a short dream if it helps for the first dream my old friend britany doesn't like me anymore i can't get out of my bed at all after i have a nightmare if i get on the computer or something it's in the corner of the room so i keep looking behind me to make sure nothings there also whenever i see something white ever i get scared even if it's just my eyes tricking me i can't type very well because of my fright at the moment but please ignore i try to think of happy stuff when i wake up from the bad dream but the happy stuff seems to turn into something that i just dreamed about this may be odd but whenever i have one of these nightmares i usually wake up with my teddy bear not in my hands ha ha yes i use a teddy bear it helps but could this be causing it do i just need something to hold onto while i sleep maybe it is a good thing i can't remember all of my dreams if you believe in the spiritual world then these nightmares might mean that you are in tune to that world and these spirits are trying to communicate with you in your next dream try to talk to one of them are you having any life issues that has affected you strongly lately some say that dreams are the brain's way of sorting out the days events try to change your interpretation of the dreams use words that are not as strong instead of ghosts refer to them as spirits the shocks think of it as a tingling sensation i do not know about but some people say that they can control their actions in their dreams you should try that too when you experience the shocks don't fear it but focus on it and focus on what it is doing to you take control of the shock and redirect it somewhere else in regards to your teddy bear does it have a name some people have security items in their life that makes them feel better some have security blankets and some have teddy bears sleeping with a teddy bear provides a 'safe' atmosphere it increases your feeling of security is your teddy bear with you in your dream that you are able to talk about it is a good sign maybe talk to your mom about it dreams are only nightmares when you fear them ie the dream was written for you usually with strong emotions do an edit so that it is not as strong if you take the time to understand the dream then you would not fear them as much  The Amber Spyglass Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) Milton H.

i'm scared please answer me i'm scared to talk to someone new i found this person who is willing to talk to me and willing to try to help me but i'm really scared to let her in i've trusted people before and it always turned out bad i know that i need to talk to someone but i don't know how to talk to someone new and i'm really scared to talk to talk to someone new what should i do they are from an organization did not meet them online it doesn't feel like my family is there for me so i don't feel that i can talk to them i also have this but i found that looking at the possible outcome of your situation greatly affects your decision based on a third party analysis such as this what can happen for you if you don't let her in you'll go away and go damn it and bang your head against the wall and that's it for this particular situation besides you wondering down the road what if or you can talk to her just by asking questions to her and try to find something in common and have a great time and if shes not that friendly or tries to mess with you why care about what you feel toward her and consider it a learning experience if she is willing to help you and talk to you i seriously doubt she is going to try to take advantage of your trust unless shes related to the mob or something if all else fails in the end what do you have to loose pride is it worth something that may be a great experience in your life that can greatly help you  Social rule Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune True Crime: Streets of LA Time Out of Mind Goodness and value theory Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transactional analysis Pitaten Coming of Age (TNG episode) Milton H.

why does this happen i'm doing something like watching tv or playing soccer and suddenly i have a totally random perverted thought um i think something is wrong with me what can i do to stop it its bad bad bad if you are having this same thought a lot then you may need to deal with it and find out maybe where it could be coming from we are all just human and can have terrible thoughts to creep into our minds the devil will do this especially if he knows your weak spots prayer and asking god for help in removing these thoughts from your mind is a great place to start also maybe go and talk to a counselor if you feel the need to find help in getting rid of these bad thoughts please give it to the lord and ask him to take these thoughts away he is able and his grace is sufficient if you will trust in him i know he can and will help god bless and happy good thoughts  Theory of conduct K' The nature of God in Western theology Summa Theologiae 2000 Australian Grand Prix Church of Christ, Scientist Karma Evil Ten Commandments Predestination John Wesley Repentance Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

help i'm worried about my friend she's depressed and anxious my friend hasn't left the house in months now she only wears a house coat and it's rare for her to even shower she was let go from a job she had been working at for over a year she has put on about pounds in the past year she cries all the time i know she has seen a doctor about this and is on medication how can i help her get out of this rut she hates herself she used to be really fun to be around and really healthy thank you so much for any help i am sorry that your friend is having such a bad time of it can you tell from talking with her if she is still able to communicate to you in a way that makes sense i mean if she is not talking nonsense like about things that make no sense to you then there is probably much hope for her recovery is she aware of what she is doing to herself these types of behaviors can be caused by real mental and physical problems they can also be caused by the persons reaction to the conversation that they are having with their self have you been able to talk to her enough to find out if this is a mental health issue where she does not know why this is happening or if it is a mental health issue that is being created by herself based on her thinking you said she hates herself she must obviously be very depressed depression can be caused by physical abnormalities in our body or it can be caused as a reaction to a very negative conversation that we are having with our self in her condition she may not be capable of taking care of the problem or even want to recognize that she needs help she will eventually be very thankful to have a friend as wonderful as you are helping her to get the professional medical mental help that she needs is probably your best bet right now i hope i have helped in some little way  Autism Infantilism Social rule Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Medicine Mental retardation Scientology beliefs and practices Pitaten Prostate cancer Adult attention-deficit disorder Borderline personality disorder Drug abuse Psychosis Mental illness Addiction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Stuttering Alcoholics Anonymous Psychiatry Bipolar disorder Milton H.

my therapist told me today that she invests more time in me than most of her clients then she was telling me about how typically they cant take my insurance be she decided to take me on as a client anyway thats when i said thats what i dont get then she said in the most roundabout way that it must have been fate this kinda all confuses me does anyone know what this all means and why she would bring that up i actually find this positive your therapist must really care about you and believe that she can help you perhaps she invests more time in you because her feelings for you want you to be well and succeed so what if something about you triggered her to be more personal and caring as long as she does not harm you there is no problem there are many styles of therapy she sounds very humanistic i had a therapist like this and i did the best work with her she cared incredibly about me and i knew it sometimes therapists find people they are more attracted to and it makes therapy more personal it's not a bad thing unless you feel it is harming you  Psychotherapy Transsexuality Reparative therapy Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Psychoanalysis Dissociative identity disorder Gestalt therapy Massage Clinical depression Physical therapy Borderline personality disorder Ex-gay Medicine Traumatic incident reduction Avenue Q Psychiatry Milton H.

even though they seem to get plenty of sleep some studies suggest that this sleep problem is the result of a sleep disorder called alpha wave interrupted sleep pattern a condition in which deep sleep is frequently interrupted by bursts of brain activity similar to wakefulness so people with fibromyalgia miss the deep restorative stage of sleep nighttime muscle spasms in your legs and restless legs syndrome also may be associated with fibromyalgia irritable bowel syndrome ibs the constipation diarrhea abdominal pain and bloating associated with ibs are common in people with fibromyalgia headaches and facial pain many people who have fibromyalgia also have headaches and facial pain that may be related to tenderness or stiffness in their neck and shoulders temporomandibular joint tmj dysfunction which affects the jaw joints and surrounding muscles also is common in people with fibromyalgia heightened sensitivity it's common for people with fibromyalgia to report being sensitive to odors noises bright lights and touch other common signs and symptoms include depression numbness or tingling sensations in the hands and feet paresthesia difficulty concentrating mood changes chest pain dry eyes skin and mouth painful menstrual periods dizziness anxiety doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia current thinking centers around a theory called central sensitization this theory states that people with fibromyalgia have a lower threshold for pain because of increased sensitivity in the brain to pain signals researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change this change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain neurotransmitters in addition the brain's pain receptors neurons which receive signals from the neurotransmitters seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive meaning they can overreact to pain signals in this way pressure on a spot on the body that wouldn't hurt someone without fibromyalgia can be very painful to someone who has the condition but what initiates this process of central sensitization isn't known it's likely that a number of factors contribute to the development of fibromyalgia other theories as to the cause of fibromyalgia include sleep disturbances some researchers theorize that disturbed sleep patterns may be a cause rather than just a symptom of fibromyalgia injury an injury or trauma particularly in the upper spinal region may trigger the development of fibromyalgia in some people an injury may affect your central nervous system which may trigger fibromyalgia infection some researchers believe that a viral or bacterial infection may trigger fibromyalgia abnormalities of the autonomic sympathetic nervous system part of your autonomic nervous system the sympathetic or involuntary system controls bodily functions that you don't consciously control such as heart rate blood vessel contraction sweating salivary flow and intestinal movements it s thought that sympathetic nervous system dysfunction occurs in people with fibromyalgia particularly at night which leads to fatigue stiffness dizziness and other signs and symptoms associated with the condition changes in muscle metabolism for example deconditioning and decreased blood flow to muscles may contribute to decreased strength and fatigue differences in metabolism and abnormalities in the hormonal substance that influences the activity of nerves may play a role psychological stress and hormonal changes also may be possible causes of fibromyalgia diagnosing fibromyalgia is difficult because there isn't a single specific diagnostic laboratory test in fact before receiving a diagnosis of fibromyalgia you may go through several medical tests such as blood tests and x rays only to have the results come back normal although these tests may rule out other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis lupus and multiple sclerosis they can't confirm fibromyalgia the american college of rheumatology has established general classification guidelines for fibromyalgia to help in the assessment and study of the condition according to these guidelines to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia you must have experienced widespread aching pain for at least three months and have a minimum of locations on your body that are abnormally tender under relatively mild firm pressure in addition to taking your medical history a doctor checking for fibromyalgia will likely press firmly on specific points on your head upper body and certain joints so that you can confirm which cause pain not all doctors agree with these guidelines some believe that the criteria are too rigid and that you can have fibromyalgia even if you don't meet the required number of tender points others question how reliable and valid tender points are as a diagnostic tool

how do i deal with this me and my sister and iming and talking about our family and the lack of love and all the anger and hatred and it's really getting to me because i've always felt unloved and attacked by the majority of my family now i feel like cutting because i'm sitting here sobbing and i don't like crying i don't like showing emotion like that but i don't really want to cut either whats another way i can deal with this i've been a si for years now and i figure it's about time i tried learning other ways of dealing si is self injury if you feel like inflicting pain on yourself please find alternatives to cutting many people say that snapping rubber bands or just making marks on themselves with pens or markers is a suitable alternative another good way to cope is to do something that keeps you busy and also lets you release your emotions try writing playing an instrument doing art or even taking up a craft like sewing or knitting in addition to making yourself feel better by doing these things you get stuff you made yourself out of the process it's good that you're able to talk to your sister about this as talking is very important in dealing with these feelings  Anger management The Amber Spyglass Self-harm Emotions (album) Blood on the Tracks Social rule Grief Knitting The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Teen Girl Squad The Marshall Mathers LP Time Out of Mind Pitaten Textile manufacturing Evil Prostate cancer Milton H.

what is raising a bipolar adhd teenager like kids answer too my year old son has bipolar and adhd as he gets older some characteristics improve others worsen the past few years have been rough can anyone tell me their experiences with teeneagers with either both disorders i would love to hear from kids too my son takes meds in the morning and at night he sees his doctor every month and therapist every week i'm going to type but my bipolar husband is going to be the one responding to you here is what he says to that yes it is hard but here are some tips and tricks i always had a problem with my mom not believing what i said like if i learned something at school or from tv my mom always pushed her opinion and everything else on me so maybe if you incorporate his opinion or his knowledge and let him know that learning about that is cool that will make him less apt to lash out because he feels he is not being taken seriously so when he tells you something stop and listen don't just half listen or interrupt him in the middle of a thought or stop him from explaining what he knows he needs to feel like you respect him and take him seriously my mom wouldn't do that for me most of the time i would get so mad i would just run away she wouldn't know where i was for hours sometimes days when i would get back she wouldn't even talk to me when he gets mad just back off and let him cool down do not argue back with him even if you know you are right just let him calm down first and say okay go back later and talk about it openly like adults my mom also like the above parent who posted reacted badly and ashamedly to how i behaved this really was fuel for my fire the madder she got and the more she pleaded with me to cut it out the more i wanted to push her buttons as a general rule if his embarassing behavior is not harming him physically or causing physical harm to others or property then ignore it as best as you can try redirecting him by focusing him on something else or even asking him a question about something he knows a lot about tell him to explain it to someone else around him or something most of his public behavior is for everyone around him to look at him he will feel like everyone is watching him explain what he knows best if you ask him questions i hope my husband helped you out  Clinical depression Plame affair Stuttering Autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Borderline personality disorder Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adult attention-deficit disorder Bipolar disorder Social rule Milton H.

guilt issues anxiety my yr old daughter went to talk to the counselor today to find out what is wrong she has been taking cymbalta for depression for about a year and for the past weeks has had changes in her demeanor lots of anxiety she started a new job weeks ago but never got through a day without crying and then feeling guilty about crying she ended up having to quit because of the tremendous stress she felt at work even though in her own words i don't know why i feel so stressed the job isn't that hard and my boss tells me i'm doing a good job but felt so overwhelmed she didn't think mentally she could continue so the counselor today said she has guilt issues and anxiety she wants to meet with her again to see if they can figure out where the guilt issues stem from she has a very good and stable home life and has never given us an ounce of trouble she hasn't experienced any type of personal trauma or loss and has never been guilted or shamed by us what could cause guilt gretch wow your comment about describes her to a t i can definitely see that being the case with her intro yes she saw a mental health counselor magic i have asked her what she thinks could be the cause of her feeling this way and she says i don't know and i know it sounds ridiculous she really liked the counselor and wants to go back thanks for the into on cymbalta i will be talking to her doctor tomorrow there are many things that could cause guilt i have struggled with this myself throughout the years i am by the way sometimes guilt stems from the anxiety anxiety can cause a person to become obsessive if she is trying very hard to be perfect then slipping up could cause guilt also she is which means she is probably figuring out what to do with her life or might be about ready to leave for college i had that crisis last year at this time and i was also very anxious if this is the case i would just try to be encouraging and help her to build self confidence many times i have had to switch medications because my body would build up a tolerance for them and they would no longer be beneficial you did the best thing you possibly could by taking her to see a counselor for now i would just suggest that you be patient with her if she wants to talk listen if she doesn't want to talk don't push the issue i hope this helps best of luck to you and your daughter  Procrastination Psychoanalysis Social rule Friends EastEnders Narcissism Bipolar disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Anxiety Post-traumatic stress disorder Scenes from a Memory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Transactional analysis Suicide Kodocha Traumatic incident reduction Alcoholics Anonymous Plame affair Cannabis (drug) Milton H.

can u help i have a nerve problem or something i meet people every day in the business world but when it is a serious conversation my face twitches sometimes i slure words etc its about to drive me nuts as well as threaten my business life does any one know what i could do for this is there pills or something i could take to calm my nerves it sounds as though you have a form of anxiety called social anxiety disorder it usually means that people get especially nervous around other people in your case it only happens when talking one on one to people which is good because your situation could be worse depending on how serious a problem this is for you you could either take a deep breath focus on what you are talking about to the person and then focus carefully on your words and facial movements if you feel that this is not possible you can see a doctor or psychiatrist for medication they will most likely subscribe you a pill like zoloft which is excellent for anxiety and anxiety related disorders i understand having this condition can be unpleasant because people may ask you what is wrong think you are sick or taking drugs etc not many people are aware of this condition and may take it the wrong way i hope that this information helps to shed some light for you and i wish you all the best in overcoming this  Clinical depression Stuttering Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Diazepam Chronic fatigue syndrome Bipolar disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychiatry Panic attack Psychoanalysis Autism Sleep Asperger syndrome Sigmund Freud Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anorexia nervosa Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Transsexuality Epilepsy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Obsessive-compulsive disorder Controversies in autism Antidepressant Psychosis Addiction Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Borderline personality disorder Alcoholism Agoraphobia Meditation Psychotherapy Cephalic disorder Phobia Medicine Fibromyalgia Social rule Sedative Psychosurgery DSM-IV Codes Drug abuse Hypnosis Chemical imbalance theory Chlorpromazine Procrastination Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Social anxiety Homophobia Balance disorder Binge eating disorder Gastroparesis Gender identity disorder Narcolepsy Hyperhidrosis Religious Society of Friends Sertraline Charles Darwin's illness Premature ejaculation Narcissism Dog Migraine Muscle Opioid Mental Health Act 1983 Psychiatric hospital Psoriasis Clomipramine Aphasia Cerebral palsy Drug addiction Methylphenidate Alexander Technique Mental illness Parkinson's disease Hypertension Infantilism Ex-gay Triage LSD Neon Genesis Evangelion Diabetic neuropathy Goodness and value theory Alprazolam Milton H.

can someone give me a little info about endorphins i want to know how to make my body create them how hard do i have to work out i wrestle and do mma ufc fighting and the training is really hard how do i know if i ever experienced them before i also workout times a week and try to run thank you doctors are not sure if endorphin rush and strenuous activity are directly related they may be because endorphins are your body's natural painkillers when released into the bloodstream they have an opiate like effect the other leading theory for second wind during strenuous activity is that the body fluctuates with the amount of lactic acid to oxygen production that occurs during a workout many believe the second wind occurs when the body figures out the correct ratio that allows the body to work at maximum efficiency once it has done so you feel a shot of energy if you were to quickly burn off this extra energy you will be tired again leading many to believe that lactic acid production outran oxygen production once again in any case all of us have felt it when we workout for an extended period of time and suddenly feel refreshed  Endorphin Exercise Cellular respiration Energy development Blood Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Wound healing phases Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Addiction Withdrawal Drug addiction Stomach cancer Nutrition Lactic acid Martial art Aluminium LSD Drowning Welding Clinical depression Explosive material Urinary incontinence Hydrogen Biochemistry Rocket fuel Hydrogen economy Solar variation Fuel injection Water (molecule) Enzyme Sulfuric acid Self-harm Hypoglycemia Ecology E85 Sadism and masochism Bodybuilding Tire Battery (electricity) Ionosphere Titanium Photosynthesis Opioid Antiretroviral drug Hydrogen sulfide Muscle Nuclear fusion Ozone depletion Chronic fatigue syndrome Milk Carburetor Skeletal muscle Circuit design Coal Gasoline Nuclear magnetic resonance Labour economics Diabetic ketoacidosis Helium Acne Alcohol fuel Prostate cancer Opium Ozone hole Iron Fermentation Red blood cell Aurora (astronomy) Renewable energy Causality Psoriasis Suicide methods Yawn Temperature Ozone layer Law of value Miller-Urey experiment Insulin Solar system Carbon dioxide sink Natural Selection (computer game) Productive and unproductive labour Wind turbine Post Polio syndrome Foodborne illness DNA repair Babe Ruth Tooth Atkins Nutritional Approach Folic acid Transformer Hydrogen vehicle Turbocharger Cocaine Eutrophication

how do you deal with a brother who is not mentally all there he is not retarded mentally handicapped nor challenged he does not suffer from any mental illness far as i know nothing very severe and yet he is mentally not there for example he tries to hang clothes all over his apartment without hangers and does not think about getting hangars until i mentioned it to him he buys funiture that is about dollars yet refuses to buy a dollar screwdriver to put the stuff together he buys canned food and yet never even considers buying a can opener the thought never enters his mind how can i bring him back to reality what may be causing this non sensical behavior not to mention the finances i will not mention details of this however he is my roomate and the person i am supposedly be sharing expenses with he cares about rent yet does not get the idea that saving money may actual help him with this he can't seem get the concept to his head help please he does not shave wash himself nor his uniform for work unless i yell at him for it may i remind you this is a year old man i am talking about imagining having to babysit someone which in his own words says the basic concepts don't enter my mind ever common sense is something he his lacking very much and it is to the point i have to baby him to do what a normal person does for themself i am not offended by suggesting he is stupid however since he is my brother and finding people i can get along with is very dificult i do want to help him out before bailing out on him however i am not his mother not his father nor babysitter and should not have be one of those roles while i am his roomate no he does not make alot of money he works a minium wage job saving money should be the way he should handle future exspenses he one time tried to row a canoe to russia i am not kidding i think your brother might have some mental disorder are you sure he's not mentally retarded i would recommend he get tested he might have autism or obsessive compulsive disorder or something like that his behavior doesn't make sense clearly good luck to you dana  Autism Mental illness Mental retardation Autism rights movement Obsessive-compulsive disorder Asperger syndrome Intelligence quotient Friends Rain Man Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Theory of conduct Psychosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mental Health Act 1983 Procrastination Milton H.

is a hour observation real i really need to see a psychiatrist and good put on meds the average wait around here is month to see one so my insurance company suggested i go to the er and ask to be observed evaluated for hours my question is can i really leave after only day i can't spend a week in the mental hospital i'm having a lot of thoughts of self harm but no real plan for suicide i just feel like i'm quickly losing it bipolar heading towards manic if you really need to see someone for psychiatric treatment i don't know that a hour observation is going to be for the best for you in your situation people are often put on hour watches because anything over hours refers you to the inpatient part of your insurance which will not get paid for unless authorized by the insurance company in advance which requires an evaluation if you are drug seeking which is what it sounds like to me then you can ask your regular doctor to prescribe you something safe for your symptoms until you can be properly evaluated of course you can leave after only day in fact they will encourage it for you since you dont' have prior authorization from your insurance company for anything other than a hour watch and no one wants to foot the bill for you so they arent going to take the chance on an inpatient stay that is not getting reimbursed just be careful with all that since timing is key here if you go in for a hour evaluation and they deem you to be a threat or pose any harm to you or anyone in public they will get preauthorization from your insurance company while you are on your hour watch and then you are screwed you will be in there for as long as the insurance company has agreed to pay and no going back to change your mind because then you are financially responsible for all the bills and your insurance company will not only not pay but probably drop you for good  Health insurance Bipolar disorder Psychiatry Publicly funded medicine Mental Health Act 1983 Prostate cancer Antidepressant Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychiatric hospital Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Involuntary commitment Insurance Homeopathy Schizophrenia Stomach cancer Life insurance Pharmaceutical company Nurse Palliative care Triage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Health Service Firefighter Unemployment Wal-Mart Transsexuality Psychosis Emergency Medical Services Reparative therapy Childbirth Medical record Autism Ethics Anorexia nervosa Antipsychotic Paroxetine Alternative medicine Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Stroke Lamotrigine Medical views of suicide Public policy Medicare (Canada) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Cornelia Rau Eating disorder Buprenorphine Traditional Chinese medicine Breastfeeding Alcoholism Psychotherapy Milton H.

my friend thinks he has a mental disorder what could it be the symptoms are basically he thinks he's falling behind other people in life he finds the simplest things not worth doing he says if he thinks too much it effects him he also said that it feels like something is wrong with him he says it's all in his head but it comes out like there is something wrong physically he said it's old like he's tired of feeling that way when he comes home from work it gets worse when nobody is awake he talks about wanting to admit himself somewhere i love him a lot and don't want to see him suffer it's been happening the last two or three years so sad to hear him talk about it any ideas he has been to a doctor before regarding all of this and they diagnosed him with mdd major depressive disorder and gave him lexapro which totally changed him and he's finally off of it the last few months i'm proud of him but like he still gets bouts he has anxiety to go along with it because of his lack of not doing anything and it snow balls into something really bad basically he feels like things aren't worth doing then he worries about it and it creates anxiety and it just cycles i know i've had that happen in the past to me it still happens i just manage it apparently he can't and that's where the disorder comes in i suppose i don't want to see him on lexapro again he made him like a zombie it was so bad and it didn't help him meds are bad in general there has to be an alternative like a way of thinking or something to fix this what are alternative treatments to anti depressants and other medications i mean this is some sort of new diease popping up in society or has it been common for people to have it through history and never been identified or what it just seems like people are quick to throw medication at the problem i'm glad that your friend is getting treatment for depression and that he is responding to it with only occasional setbacks depression and anxiety are evil twins it is hard to change depressed and anxious behaviour because those behaviours become habitual just be patient and upbeat with your friend all things in good time  Anxiety Bipolar disorder Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Antidepressant Borderline personality disorder Procrastination Charles Darwin's illness Obsessive-compulsive disorder Eating disorder Sigmund Freud Panic attack Social rule Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct Multiple sclerosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autism Medicine Insomnia Mental illness Alcoholism Traumatic brain injury Schizophrenia Cognitive therapy Adult attention-deficit disorder Ex-gay Narcissism Psychotherapy Psychiatry Shaggy dog story Controversies in autism Psychosis Coeliac disease Debugging Stuttering Gender identity disorder Addiction Mental Health Act 1983 General anxiety disorder Psychoanalysis Parkinson's disease Post-traumatic stress disorder Combat stress reaction Baldness Magical thinking Transactional analysis Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Evil Asperger syndrome Alcoholics Anonymous Unemployment Binge eating disorder Sleep Migraine Psychosurgery Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Asthma Humphrey Bogart Involuntary commitment Karen Horney Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homeopathy Drug addiction Philosophical skepticism Phobia Pitaten Sin City Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Psychopharmacology Ethics Stress (medicine) Postpartum depression Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Hearing impairment Dualism (philosophy of mind) Homophobia Behavioral therapy Sexual dysfunction Balance disorder Neurosis St John's wort Stroke Anger management Avenue Q Mania Placebo effect Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

i don't know what's wrong w me emotionally my thoughts are driving me crazy it's ruining myself and any romantic relationship i have when i'm in a relationship i become very afraid i'm not good enough and that i'm gonna be left like i get very jealous and am afraid the other person's gonna leave me for someone else and they get sick of it and leave anyway and my emotions are driving me crazy it's not that i'm depressed all the time but sometimes my moods change really quick like i'll become extremely angry or extremely anxious to make myself feel better and somewhat stable i often drink or smoke cigarrettes anything to make me feel somewhat good i just don't feel like i'm good enough and am not confident in who i am i'm a year old female btw p s i can't afford counseling so that's out of the question for now i guess i'm just desperate for some clarity sometimes i will feel somewhat happy too but my moods fluctuate constantly so it's usually never like that for like oh and i'm not pregnant either you sound as though you have some issues with self esteem which i had at your age too part of it just takes time to be able to accept yourself for who you are and be satisfied with who you are i don't think anyone ever is totally satisfied it is good that you realize that these things are happening and that they are not healthy there should be some type of clinic in your area so you can speak to someone about your mood swings i know you said you can't afford but often there are free clinics and counselors who charge a fee based on your income you probably pay more on the unhealthy cigs and booze if you use these things to help your moods you could very well get stuck in a downward spiral believe that you're worth it and seek out some professional help for your mood swings and anxiety and just be patient with the jealousy issues because they will disappear as your self confidence grows believe in your self and invest in your health and you'll be just fine good luck  Psychoanalysis Transsexuality Clinical depression Narcissism Sigmund Freud Borderline personality disorder Bipolar disorder Psychotherapy Anxiety Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Humphrey Bogart The Smoking Room Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nicomachean Ethics Dead Like Me Everwood Meditation Scientology beliefs and practices R.E.M.

is it true that if you dont sleep you'll crazy and if so why it is not a matter of going crazy as much as it is of becoming unbalanced sleep in humans and other higher animals seems to have two completely different functions one is physical the time during sleep allows the body to repair itself faster because there are no active muscles requiring great amounts of energy and oxygen hormone levels in several parks of the body are also adjusted sleep also has several functions that seems to be strictly mental in nature these are less understood during not rem sleep the brain does housekeeping functions some of which seem to be relate to long term memory it also seems to restore the neurotransmitters required for effective brain functions in addition rem dream sleep seems to be required for proper emotional control in humans this is why a good night's sleep will often help during times of crisis the effects of sleep deprivation covers a very wide difference in type and severity some people need far more sleep than others it is one thing to get less sleep than you need for several days running it is entirely different if you get no sleep for more than a couple of days any person who goes more than two nights without any sleep should seek help or move to a location which is less stressful in times of crisis short naps are better than no sleep at all experiments done on preventing humans from getting any sleep not just studying what happens long term when a person does not get enough sleep all seem to report that the brain and therefore the mind begins to have serious breaks with the perception of reality after hours things just get worse after that  Sleep Rapid eye movement Polyphasic sleep Clinical depression Sleep deprivation Brain Psychosis Urinary incontinence Dream Mind Chronic fatigue syndrome Human Insomnia Cognitive science Consciousness Traumatic brain injury Hypnosis Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lucid dreaming Psychology Insulin Soul Puberty Nutrition Aikido Homeostasis Human brain Epilepsy Growth hormone deficiency Eye Weight training Prostate cancer Cancer Methamphetamine Electroconvulsive therapy Social psychology Color A Course In Miracles Dieting Decompression sickness Carpal tunnel syndrome Bipolar disorder Telepathy Grief Labour economics Diazepam Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Electroencephalography Person LSD Sexual differentiation Philosophy of perception Transsexuality Dualism (philosophy of mind) Carl Jung Health issues and the effects of cannabis Neurofeedback Diabetes mellitus Panic attack Happiness Fibromyalgia Orgasm Growth hormone Scientology beliefs and practices Stress (medicine) Sleep paralysis Reality Anorexia nervosa First aid Gender role Sleep apnea Cerebral palsy Muscle Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cerebral hemisphere Borderline personality disorder Radiation poisoning Mattress Objectivist philosophy Empathy Neuroscience Whale Human adaptation to space Sadism and masochism Causality Scientific method Artificial consciousness Alexander Technique Stuttering Chakra

who's got the magic wand i'm so fed up feeling the way i do i'm sick and tired of it i just wanna be better please find me the magic wand i don't want to carry on like this forever i got that magic wand but i give it from my heart for free i've been in some very negative states of mind and emotion and i know it's not easy sometimes we think that the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off especially when we don't have money to pay the bills school fees homework family problem rather than being annoyed be amused instead of getting angry become curious in place of envy feel admiration in place of worry take action in place of doubt have faith negative energy is just positive energy that's flowing in the opposite direction there's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy all you need to do is change its direction the more negative you are the more positive you can be an automobile that can travel miles per hour to the east can also travel just as fast when going west but first someone must turn it around when you sense yourself becoming negative stop and consider what it would mean to apply that negative energy in the opposite direction turn your sadness into caring transform your complaints into useful suggestions change your bitterness into determination the energy is already there all you need to do is change its direction if it's something that lightens your mood and doesn't hurt anyone yes some very simple things can calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind simple but very soothing and it took me a long time to learn that i didn't need to let my thoughts and emotions control me it's normal to worry a bit sometimes we do have to spend a few minutes worrying or on the pity pot as long as we don't stay there maybe what you can think about working on is just taking a baby step toward what you want you can make a start by being grateful for the things you already have food in your stomach a roof over your head clothes on your back and internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it my suggestion would be for you to attend school do you have your high school diploma yet or anything if not go get it go to college school do not sit in your house worrying get out into the world and get busy talk with a counselor at the college school so you can find out what courses then decide which one would interest you do not stop educating yourself until you are at the point where you can smarter and become that extremely successful person you want to be the key is to work hard and get out in the world and do something else another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they ask themselves a question before beginning look at your surroundings right now what do you see if your life is in chaos your surroundings are a mess literally and figuratively your health is substandard have addictions or a number of spirit killing situations then you need to work on yourself first remember god is not the author of chaos this is also true for those who have asked for advice paid for programs and or coaches and nothing seems to work if the advice received is good and nothing is working then something of a higher priority should be attended to if you are in bad health or physical pain your body is trying to tell you something listen to the alarms going off your state of mind has manifested everything you are experiencing right now working on yourself first before starting any new venture or relationship is absolutely necessary because it is you holding you back the traditional way is to gather a group that has an interest in what is being stormed go around the table and each person may present an idea only one at a time someone must act as secretary and record the ideas on a large tablet that everyone can read only one or two ideas to a page keep going around the room until no one has anything further to offer no idea or comment is off limits doing this once everyone is done the moderator of the group goes back over each idea some will need to be discounted as not being practical others will have merit to consider further the refined list then goes to management who will decide which ideas are implemented focus on quantity no criticism unusual ideas are welcome combine and improve ideas set the problem determine and specify the problem which needs a solution every participant must know the problem generate ideas generate as many ideas as possible keep in mind the four basic brainstorm rules and record the good ideas continue for five to fifteen minutes select best idea select the most appropriated idea from the suggested ideas i have tried to get you to see that the power to change is within you that when you focus on others and see yourself as a victim that you will give that power to them and forever remain a victim the key is in knowing clearly what you want and focusing on that not what stops you then let go and let god allow ideas to come to you have faith that people will help you if you don't trust them as you don't trust anyone in singapore then you will reject god's attempts at sending you helpers finally be ready to take action when the moment arrives and don't fear what comes next go forth boldly this is what i came into your life to tell you now it's up to you to make it happen there's a book called great failures of the extremely successful it describes how failures happen to everyone only the successful people never give up they understand that failure is part of the process so when things go wrong or people try to stop them they just keep going until they succeed somehow someway you got to where you are now because of how you think i'm going to make a suggestion please take the time to read a very short book you can also go to any bookstore in the classic section and buy it it's called as a man thinketh by james allen and was written in the 's this book is deep and every single sentence has wisdom so it is something that has to be read and studied slowly i highly recommend this little book because it changed many life in a profound way after reading as a man thinketh and absorbing what it says you will begin to understand why i am sending you in this direction before starting your journey my idea how to win friends and influence people is an awesome book and i highly recommend you pick it up the book goes into detail on how to be more of a selfless encouraging and humble person and those attributes we'll attract people to you one of my favorite lines of the book says that 'you can make more friends in two weeks by taking an interest in others then you can in two years trying to tell others about yourself' my suggestion to a book it s a book called the conversations with god there are in the series you may want to read them and see where that takes you as a start to getting your life on track you can go on the web and search neale donald walsh as he is the author and has several very good sites life can always be difficult at times the key is to realize that there is another law called the law of polarity for every negative there is a positive for every up there is a down we tend to stay focused on the negative but the sight should be on the fact that there is a positive in direct proportion to the negative always keep your focus on your dream and possibility and never on your current situation create what you do want in your mind and ignore what you don't want and don't let the present situation that you don't like be your focus againfocus on what you do like and want then trust and believe if you do not then your situation cannot change i'm wishing you well and sending love your way hope this helps warm regards and thank you for your question

how do we survive a miserable life what do you do when you have been losing battles fo the past years i've been in some very negative states of mind and emotion and i know it's not easy sometimes we think that the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off especially when we don't have money to pay the bills school fees homework family problem rather than being annoyed be amused instead of getting angry become curious in place of envy feel admiration in place of worry take action in place of doubt have faith negative energy is just positive energy that's flowing in the opposite direction there's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy all you need to do is change its direction the more negative you are the more positive you can be an automobile that can travel miles per hour to the east can also travel just as fast when going west but first someone must turn it around when you sense yourself becoming negative stop and consider what it would mean to apply that negative energy in the opposite direction turn your sadness into caring transform your complaints into useful suggestions change your bitterness into determination the energy is already there all you need to do is change its direction if it's something that lightens your mood and doesn't hurt anyone yes some very simple things can calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind simple but very soothing and it took me a long time to learn that i didn't need to let my thoughts and emotions control me it's normal to worry a bit sometimes we do have to spend a few minutes worrying or on the pity pot as long as we don't stay there maybe what you can think about working on is just taking a baby step toward what you want you can make a start by being grateful for the things you already have food in your stomach a roof over your head clothes on your back and internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it my suggestion would be for you to attend school do you have your high school diploma yet or anything if not go get it go to college school do not sit in your house worrying get out into the world and get busy talk with a counselor at the college school so you can find out what courses then decide which one would interest you do not stop educating yourself until you are at the point where you can smarter and become that extremely successful person you want to be the key is to work hard and get out in the world and do something else another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they

what are the chances that my boyfriend could get alzheimer's disease my boyfriend's grandpa died of alzheimer's his mom's dad a few years ago i get mad at him sometimes because when we have a conversation it's usually one sided it's not just with me though it's with everyone i know he said he just has a hard time putting his thoughts into words quickly he can never find the right words to say i looked up to see if anyone else was like this and i found that this is actually a sign of alzheimer's i know that it's very unlikely that he has it now but maybe it's a sign that he will have it in the future i know that ad can be hereditary what are his chances of getting it if it was not his parent that had it but his grandparent as of right now i'm not aware of anyone else who has had it in his family but it is possible anyway i'm just curious i know it's early to worry but if it's possible to do something about it now i'd like to i love him so much and want to do anything i can to keep him healthy thanks there are a lot of things that go into causes of alzheimer's disease i would recommend that you suggest he goes to a doctor preferably a specialist or at least one that knows alzheimer's well a couple questions to keep in mind would be what's in his diet good and bad what supplements he's taking if any and if he's taking a cholesterol blocking drug it seems that a lot of doctors may not know or at least don't acknowledge that the typical cholesterol drugs stop your body from producing cholesterol altogether while that might seem like a good idea you need some cholesterol in your body and especially in your brain one of the most common complaints with those drugs is complaints about memory and cognitive problems some of which are even symptoms of alzheimer's if he's not taking any drugs and or if the doctor doesn't know what might help you could always try natural supplements that a lot of people get benefits for with mental support clarity and memory there's ginkgo biloba acetyl l carnitine fish oil huperzine a phosphatidylserine vinpocetine choline inositol bacopa moniera or monieri dmae and some of the b vitamins which also help with energy unfortunately different people respond differently to different supplements so it's hard to say which of these may be the best for him in particular unless you can see a doctor that knows about supplements edit in response to the person who said you can't die from alzheimer's that's not true if it advances far enough a person can literally forget to breathe that's what happened to my great aunt when she passed away from alzheimer's but it's literally in the final stages usually a decade or two after the onset  Alzheimer's disease Prostate cancer Tocopherol Nutrition Folic acid Bipolar disorder Coronary heart disease Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Schizophrenia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stomach cancer Fish oil Traumatic brain injury Cholesterol Hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Brain Omega-3 fatty acid Vitamin C Veganism Nootropic Stroke Cancer Tobacco smoking Hypnosis Psychosis Atherosclerosis Atkins Nutritional Approach Social rule Myocardial infarction Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Parkinson's disease Diabetes mellitus Anorexia nervosa Soul Anxiety Mental illness Immortality Milk Addiction Theory of conduct Hypercholesterolemia Antiretroviral drug Consciousness Abortion debate Yoga Sutras of Patanjali A Course In Miracles Adult attention-deficit disorder Obesity Down syndrome Vitamin D Dementia Terri Schiavo Epilepsy Coeliac disease Grief Milton H.

what can i expect from a visit with a hypnotist is it better than a pain psychologist a lot of people tend to think about barking like a dog clucking like a chicken or doing weird things when under hypnosis the truth is that it's just a very deep form of relaxation much like meditation the therapist will use soothing words and imagery to help you relax and depending why you're going they will make suggestions to help you through your particular issue for example say you are visiting a hypnotherapist for quitting smoking they will use imagery to relax you and then make suggestions like you do not like the smell of cigarettes to stick in your subconscious that way when your conscious mind says you want a cigarette your subconscious kicks in and says yuck no thanks i found hypnosis and self hypnosis to be far more helpful than cognitive or any other types of therapy hope this helps  Hypnosis Milton H.

how do i have elusive dreams i've had lucid dreams this is what you do keep a dream journal write down your dreams when you wake up everyday this keeps you in the habit of being mindful of your dreams practice every half hour or hour that you are awake pinch yourself and ask yourself if you are in a dream then you get in the habit and you will ask yourself this same question when you are dreaming when you ask yourself if you are in a dream during the day really try to imagine that it could be a dream look around you do clocks change their numbers are words on a newspaper changing is there anything odd when you pinch yourself do you feel it you should be doing this a minimum of times a day but the more times you ask yourself it during the day say times the sooner you will ask yourself that question in a dream have patience it can take a month or more to have your first lucid dream but you must have decent dream recall first which the dream journal helps you with what to do when you are in a lucid dream have a plan of what you want to do already write down your plan the more you write it down the better for me it is always meeting a certain celebrity that i crush over and having haha intimate relations that's my favorite lucid dream but another time i wanted to build a palace that worked okay if you want to meet a celebrity or see something specific don't just say appear that is very hard to do in a dream say something to yourself like when i turn the corner a palace will appear or when i walk down this hallway then i will meet a specific person let the experience come to you if you are losing control of the lucid dream then try to spin around the motion sometimes helps you regain control of it even with all that practice my lucid dreaming was only about twice a month i got really sick of practicing also the lucid dreams were hard to control maybe lasting only to minutes or so it appeared in the dream and once your dream is fulfilled well i mean i wasn't that motivated to practice anymore good luck  Lucid dreaming Dream Consciousness Milton H.

help with add so i told my mom i needed to change add medication cause the one i currently take makes me depressed she didn't believe me and grounded me i showed her the facts and finally now she believes me but she thinks she can shove anything down my throat do i have any right as a minor to say what drugs go into my body i think you need to stop doing that and just go out and start moving yourself i've been in some very negative states of mind and emotion and i know it's not easy sometimes we think that the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off especially when we don't have money to pay the bills school fees homework family problem rather than being annoyed be amused instead of getting angry become curious in place of envy feel admiration in place of worry take action in place of doubt have faith negative energy is just positive energy that's flowing in the opposite direction there's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy all you need to do is change its direction the more negative you are the more positive you can be an automobile that can travel miles per hour to the east can also travel just as fast when going west but first someone must turn it around when you sense yourself becoming negative stop and consider what it would mean to apply that negative energy in the opposite direction turn your sadness into caring transform your complaints into useful suggestions change your bitterness into determination the energy is already there all you need to do is change its direction if it's something that lightens your mood and doesn't hurt anyone yes some very simple things can calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind simple but very soothing and it took me a long time to learn that i didn't need to let my thoughts and emotions control me it's normal to worry a bit sometimes we do have to spend a few minutes worrying or on the pity pot as long as we don't stay there maybe what you can think about working on is just taking a baby step toward what you want you can make a start by being grateful for the things you already have food in your stomach a roof over your head clothes on your back and internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they ask themselves a question before beginning look at your surroundings right now what do you see if your life is in chaos your surroundings are a mess literally and figuratively your health is substandard have addictions or a number of spirit killing situations then you need to work on yourself first remember god is not the author of chaos this is also true for those who have asked for advice paid for programs and or coaches and nothing seems to work if the advice received is good and nothing is working then something of a higher priority should be attended to if you are in bad health or physical pain your body is trying to tell you something listen to the alarms going off your state of mind has manifested everything you are experiencing right now working on yourself first before starting any new venture or relationship is absolutely necessary because it is you holding you back the traditional way is to gather a group that has an interest in what is being stormed go around the table and each person may present an idea only one at a time someone must act as secretary and record the ideas on a large tablet that everyone can read only one or two ideas to a page keep going around the room until no one has anything further to offer no idea or comment is off limits doing this once everyone is done the moderator of the group goes back over each idea some will need to be discounted as not being practical others will have merit to consider further the refined list then goes to management who will decide which ideas are implemented focus on quantity no criticism unusual ideas are welcome combine and improve ideas set the problem determine and specify the problem which needs a solution every participant must know the problem generate ideas generate as many ideas as possible keep in mind the four basic brainstorm rules and record the good ideas continue for five to fifteen minutes select best idea select the most appropriated idea from the suggested ideas i have tried to get you to see that the power to change is within you that when you focus on others and see yourself as a victim that you will give that power to them and forever remain a victim the key is in knowing clearly what you want and focusing on that not what stops you then let go and let god allow ideas to come to you have faith that people will help you if you don't trust them as you don't trust anyone in singapore then you will reject god's attempts at sending you helpers finally be ready to take action when the moment arrives and don't fear what comes next go forth boldly this is what i came into your life to tell you now it's up to you to make it happen there's a book called great failures of the extremely successful it describes how failures happen to everyone only the successful people never give up they understand that failure is part of the process so when things go wrong or people try to stop them they just keep going until they succeed somehow someway you got to where you are now because of how you think i'm going to make a suggestion please take the time to read a very short book you can also go to any bookstore in the classic section and buy it it's called as a man thinketh by james allen and was written in the 's this book is deep and every single sentence has wisdom so it is something that has to be read and studied slowly i highly recommend this little book because it changed many life in a profound way after reading as a man thinketh and absorbing what it says you will begin to understand why i am sending you in this direction before starting your journey my idea how to win friends and influence people is an awesome book and i highly recommend you pick it up the book goes into detail on how to be more of a selfless encouraging and humble person and those attributes we'll attract people to you one of my favorite lines of the book says that 'you can make more friends in two weeks by taking an interest in others then you can in two years trying to tell others about yourself' my suggestion to a book it s a book called the conversations with god there are in the series you may want to read them and see where that takes you as a start to getting your life on track you can go on the web and search neale donald walsh as he is the author and has several very good sites life can always be difficult at times the key is to realize that there is another law called the law of polarity for every negative there is a positive for every up there is a down we tend to stay focused on the negative but the sight should be on the fact that there is a positive in direct proportion to the negative always keep your focus on your dream and possibility and never on your current situation create what you do want in your mind and ignore what you don't want and don't let the present situation that you don't like be your focus againfocus on what you do like and want then trust and believe if you do not then your situation cannot change i'm wishing you well and sending love your way hope this helps warm regards and thank you for your question

what is the best way to deal with a drug addict parent i moved into my dad's home last summer as he is in the last stages of emphesema the kicker is he is a drug addict and very difficult to live with what is the best way to tell him his behavior the emotional abuse guilt trips and violent mood swings are making me want to leave him to die alone it is getting to the point where i am ready to let him die by himself i hate that he has got me to this point but i am now getting sick due to his sickness the worst part of all this is that he will die soon within six months yet his drug addict behavior is making me sick i am so mad at him that i pray for his death it makes no sense to me to needlessly suffer and be a miserable prick to those around you i know it's his addiction but it doesn't make it any easier when he's acting like a reall ass kit kat i know i can't change him ive dealt with this my whole life it's a hard decision to make to leave a parent to die alone or stay with them and take the shit probably the toughest decision i've ever had to make so far i can say one thing though if he keeps treating me the way he's been treating me i'll have no problem letting him die alone i put my life on hold to come help him and this is the thanks i get drug addiction is such a wonderful thing lol you are in a very hard place and your dad is obviously suffering too he's biting at the nearest person who he feels safe to do so the question is can you take it without being completely destroyed yourself give yourself the space to think things through if the answer's yes then steel yourself you dont have to accept his behaviour calmly tell him when things are not acceptable and walk away for a while but i suspect he won't change if no then do what is right for you and seek help later you will do the guilt thing at some point try getting some counselling to help you decide  Addiction EastEnders Narcissism Divorce Borderline personality disorder Domestic violence Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Procrastination Daredevil Alcoholism Theory of conduct Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Transsexuality Alcoholics Anonymous Sigmund Freud Rape Kurt Cobain Social rule Bipolar disorder Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transactional analysis Adult attention-deficit disorder Friends Anxiety One Tree Hill (TV series) Anorexia nervosa Ethics Bradley Nowell Nicomachean Ethics The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fathers' rights Alignment (role-playing games) Self-harm Stomach cancer Sexual orientation The Marshall Mathers LP Dog training Vernon Schillinger Infantilism T'Pol Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Calvin and Hobbes Illegal drug trade Traumatic brain injury Sexual addiction Abortion debate Health insurance Charles Darwin's illness Mental illness 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Poker jargon Rent (musical) Goodness and value theory Grief Dead Like Me Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Days of our Lives Obsessive-compulsive disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Good Times Babe Ruth The nature of God in Western theology Knots Landing Utilitarianism Reparative therapy Scientology beliefs and practices Everwood Fitz Hugh Ludlow Schizophrenia Coming of Age (TNG episode) Sant Thakar Singh A Course In Miracles Milton H.

how do you improve your attention span thanks healthy breakfast i read somewhere that the most brain damaging habit is not to have a breakfast after the overnight fast and lack of glucose in the body it is imperative to consume some protein and fiber rich food products when i used to stay with my parents there was not a single day that i missed my breakfast and all credit goes to my mother but since i have been staying on my own i have become more and more negligent running our body on low fuel till noon is not good so start having a healthy breakfast and get a good start for the day limit tv control your tv watching if you observe your tv watching habits you will realize that mostly it is waste of time but that is not the only problem all the programmes on tv show ads in every minutes so it breaks the continuity also most likely you have a tv with a remote controller and your fingers are always playing with it skipping channels and surfing back n forth this increases fidgetiness in your behaviour and it affects other aspects of your life too i have reduced tv watching by restricting myself to hours of tv per week and when i want to watch more i just rent a movie and watch it without a break limit internet use this is easy to say but difficult to do it depends on how much necessary it is for you to be online to get your work done most of the time either i am searching for articles for my research or looking for some solution to software bugs but now i have made it a habit to print the article of my interest leave my cubicle and read it somewhere where i don t have access to net but still many times i see myself using refresh button unnecessarily in the middle of some task i am still looking for efficient ways to reduce the effect of this distraction take time outs not just simple breaks but rewarding breaks i reward myself with sunshine by going out for a walk after getting a task done in the lab breaks are generally distracting unless they are for a purpose so give a purpose to every break even if it is just talking to a colleague or checking your emails you need to figure out what you need to do in your time out to get a fulfilling break read books reading definitely increases your attention span read what interests you but try to avoid short stories if i find some interesting novel book to read i find myself sitting for hours straight without any breaks even if the tv is on get close to nature this i accomplish by taking walks during my breaks or taking a weekend off for some outdoor activity like camping attention span is mostly affected by stress most of which comes from external sources when you are with nature you tend to go back into your natural state which is free from any kind of stress worries or and anxiety because that s the way you were born obviously you can see how the same activities can help in other aspects of your life we all already know these things but still don t follow them why because we don t assign a goal to them without a goal we cannot measure our development here i am targeting to increase the attention span you will notice the difference if you follow even some of the steps and it will motivate you further moreover you will observe positive effects in other aspects of your personal development  Surveillance Hypoglycemia Dieting Insulin Second language acquisition Compiler optimization Extreme Programming Prostate cancer Procrastination Alexander Technique Capitalism Light pollution Atkins Nutritional Approach Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Breastfeeding Energy development Social psychology CPU design Poker jargon Milton H.

is there a psychologist specialized in healing urges like the need of meeting people and questioning my friend has this urge to meet girls and question them about their childhood or other personal details from their past he really has this urge and from time to time he has to meet up with different women to talk about that but those girls don't know why he meets up with them they might think he is interested in them but after or meetings he doesn't want to meet the same person any more please if there is someone there able to tell me what to do to heal him of this urge i'd really appreciate that thank you it sounds to me like your friend may have his own issues from childhood that he needs to deal with meeting these girls two to three times questioning them about intimate details and then not seeing them anymore may indicate a fear of intimacy he may be hoping that someone will share with him some of his own issues the best thing you can do for your friend is be supportive you might suggest that he go to a therapist but prepare for him to be defensive if some of your other friends are noticing the same behaviours you might want to work together to get him help  Human sexual behavior Transsexuality Reparative therapy Sigmund Freud Transactional analysis Dissociative identity disorder Ex-gay Child sexuality Milton H.

conscience or 'voice' i'm worried that my conscience may be a little over developed in the personality department it speaks to me like a conversation it's male soft spoken does anyone else have this i'm not on drugs i have severe depression what should i do if i'm on an episode he tells me i'm worthless world would be better off without me etc if i'm ok he largely just controls my impulses i think you need to stop doing that and just go out and start moving yourself i've been in some very negative states of mind and emotion and i know it's not easy sometimes we think that the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off especially when we don't have money to pay the bills school fees homework family problem rather than being annoyed be amused instead of getting angry become curious in place of envy feel admiration in place of worry take action in place of doubt have faith negative energy is just positive energy that's flowing in the opposite direction there's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy all you need to do is change its direction the more negative you are the more positive you can be an automobile that can travel miles per hour to the east can also travel just as fast when going west but first someone must turn it around when you sense yourself becoming negative stop and consider what it would mean to apply that negative energy in the opposite direction turn your sadness into caring transform your complaints into useful suggestions change your bitterness into determination the energy is already there all you need to do is change its direction if it's something that lightens your mood and doesn't hurt anyone yes some very simple things can calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind simple but very soothing and it took me a long time to learn that i didn't need to let my thoughts and emotions control me it's normal to worry a bit sometimes we do have to spend a few minutes worrying or on the pity pot as long as we don't stay there maybe what you can think about working on is just taking a baby step toward what you want you can make a start by being grateful for the things you already have food in your stomach a roof over your head clothes on your back and internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it my suggestion would be for you to attend school do you have your high school diploma yet or anything if not go get it go to college school do not sit in your house worrying get out into the world and get busy talk with a counselor at the college school so you can find out what courses then decide which one would interest you do not stop educating yourself until you are at the point where you can smarter and become that extremely successful person you want to be the key is to work hard and get out in the world and do something else another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they ask themselves a question before beginning look at your surroundings right now what do you see if your life is in chaos your surroundings are a mess literally and figuratively your health is substandard have addictions or a number of spirit killing situations then you need to work on yourself first remember god is not the author of chaos this is also true for those who have asked for advice paid for programs and or coaches and nothing seems to work if the advice received is good and nothing is working then something of a higher priority should be attended to if you are in bad health or physical pain your body is trying to tell you something listen to the alarms going off your state of mind has manifested everything you are experiencing right now working on yourself first before starting any new venture or relationship is absolutely necessary because it is you holding you back the traditional way is to gather a group that has an interest in what is being stormed go around the table and each person may present an idea only one at a time someone must act as secretary and record the ideas on a large tablet that everyone can read only one or two ideas to a page keep going around the room until no one has anything further to offer no idea or comment is off limits doing this once everyone is done the moderator of the group goes back over each idea some will need to be discounted as not being practical others will have merit to consider further the refined list then goes to management who will decide which ideas are implemented focus on quantity no criticism unusual ideas are welcome combine and improve ideas set the problem determine and specify the problem which needs a solution every participant must know the problem generate ideas generate as many ideas as possible keep in mind the four basic brainstorm rules and record the good ideas continue for five to fifteen minutes select best idea select the most appropriated idea from the suggested ideas i have tried to get you to see that the power to change is within you that when you focus on others and see yourself as a victim that you will give that power to them and forever remain a victim the key is in knowing clearly what you want and focusing on that not what stops you then let go and let god allow ideas to come to you have faith that people will help you if you don't trust them as you don't trust anyone in singapore then you will reject god's attempts at sending you helpers finally be ready to take action when the moment arrives and don't fear what comes next go forth boldly this is what i came into your life to tell you now it's up to you to make it happen there's a book called great failures of the extremely successful it describes how failures happen to everyone only the successful people never give up they understand that failure is part of the process so when things go wrong or people try to stop them they just keep going until they succeed somehow someway you got to where you are now because of how you think i'm going to make a suggestion please take the time to read a very short book you can also go to any bookstore in the classic section and buy it it's called as a man thinketh by james allen and was written in the 's this book is deep and every single sentence has wisdom so it is something that has to be read and studied slowly i highly recommend this little book because it changed many life in a profound way after reading as a man thinketh and absorbing what it says you will begin to understand why i am sending you in this direction before starting your journey my idea how to win friends and influence people is an awesome book and i highly recommend you pick it up the book goes into detail on how to be more of a selfless encouraging and humble person and those attributes we'll attract people to you one of my favorite lines of the book says that 'you can make more friends in two weeks by taking an interest in others then you can in two years trying to tell others about yourself' my suggestion to a book it s a book called the conversations with god there are in the series you may want to read them and see where that takes you as a start to getting your life on track you can go on the web and search neale donald walsh as he is the author and has several very good sites life can always be difficult at times the key is to realize that there is another law called the law of polarity for every negative there is a positive for every up there is a down we tend to stay focused on the negative but the sight should be on the fact that there is a positive in direct proportion to the negative always keep your focus on your dream and possibility and never on your current situation create what you do want in your mind and ignore what you don't want and don't let the present situation that you don't like be your focus againfocus on what you do like and want then trust and believe if you do not then your situation cannot change i'm wishing you well and sending love your way hope this helps warm regards and thank you for your question

internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it my suggestion would be for you to attend school do you have your high school diploma yet or anything if not go get it go to college school do not sit in your house worrying get out into the world and get busy talk with a counselor at the college school so you can find out what courses then decide which one would interest you do not stop educating yourself until you are at the point where you can smarter and become that extremely successful person you want to be the key is to work hard and get out in the world and do something else another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they ask themselves a question before beginning look at your surroundings right now what do you see if your life is in chaos your surroundings are a mess literally and figuratively your health is substandard have addictions or a number of spirit killing situations then you need to work on yourself first remember god is not the author of chaos this is also true for those who have asked for advice paid for programs and or coaches and nothing seems to work if the advice received is good and nothing is working then something of a higher priority should be attended to if you are in bad health or physical pain your body is trying to tell you something listen to the alarms going off your state of mind has manifested everything you are experiencing right now working on yourself first before starting any new venture or relationship is absolutely necessary because it is you holding you back the traditional way is to gather a group that has an interest in what is being stormed go around the table and each person may present an idea only one at a time someone must act as secretary and record the ideas on a large tablet that everyone can read only one or two ideas to a page keep going around the room until no one has anything further to offer no idea or comment is off limits doing this once everyone is done the moderator of the group goes back over each idea some will need to be discounted as not being practical others will have merit to consider further the refined list then goes to management who will decide which ideas are implemented focus on quantity no criticism unusual ideas are welcome combine and improve ideas set the problem determine and specify the problem which needs a solution every participant must know the problem generate ideas generate as many ideas as possible keep in mind the four basic brainstorm rules and record the good ideas continue for five to fifteen minutes select best idea select the most appropriated idea from the suggested ideas i have tried to get you to see that the power to change is within you that when you focus on others and see yourself as a victim that you will give that power to them and forever remain a victim the key is in knowing clearly what you want and focusing on that not what stops you then let go and let god allow ideas to come to you have faith that people will help you if you don't trust them as you don't trust anyone in singapore then you will reject god's attempts at sending you helpers finally be ready to take action when the moment arrives and don't fear what comes next go forth boldly this is what i came into your life to tell you now it's up to you to make it happen there's a book called great failures of the extremely successful it describes how failures happen to everyone only the successful people never give up they understand that failure is part of the process so when things go wrong or people try to stop them they just keep going until they succeed somehow someway you got to where you are now because of how you think i'm going to make a suggestion please take the time to read a very short book you can also go to any bookstore in the classic section and buy it it's called as a man thinketh by james allen and was written in the 's this book is deep and every single sentence has wisdom so it is something that has to be read and studied slowly i highly recommend this little book because it changed many life in a profound way after reading as a man thinketh and absorbing what it says you will begin to understand why i am sending you in this direction before starting your journey my idea how to win friends and influence people is an awesome book and i highly recommend you pick it up the book goes into detail on how to be more of a selfless encouraging and humble person and those attributes we'll attract people to you one of my favorite lines of the book says that 'you can make more friends in two weeks by taking an interest in others then you can in two years trying to tell others about yourself' my suggestion to a book it s a book called the conversations with god there are in the series you may want to read them and see where that takes you as a start to getting your life on track you can go on the web and search neale donald walsh as he is the author and has several very good sites life can always be difficult at times the key is to realize that there is another law called the law of polarity for every negative there is a positive for every up there is a down we tend to stay focused on the negative but the sight should be on the fact that there is a positive in direct proportion to the negative always keep your focus on your dream and possibility and never on your current situation create what you do want in your mind and ignore what you don't want and don't let the present situation that you don't like be your focus againfocus on what you do like and want then trust and believe if you do not then your situation cannot change i'm wishing you well and sending love your way hope this helps warm regards and thank you for your question

panic disorder can someone please explain what panic disorder is thanks panic disorder is a real illness that can be successfully treated it is characterized by sudden attacks of terror usually accompanied by a pounding heart sweatiness weakness faintness or dizziness during these attacks people with panic disorder may flush or feel chilled their hands may tingle or feel numb and they may experience nausea chest pain or smothering sensations panic attacks usually produce a sense of unreality a fear of impending doom or a fear of losing control a fear of one's own unexplained physical symptoms is also a symptom of panic disorder people having panic attacks sometimes believe they are having heart attacks losing their minds or on the verge of death they can't predict when or where an attack will occur and between episodes many worry intensely and dread the next attack panic attacks can occur at any time even during sleep an attack usually peaks within minutes but some symptoms may last much longer panic disorder affects about million american adults and is twice as common in women as men panic attacks often begin in late adolescence or early adulthood but not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder many people have just one attack and never have another the tendency to develop panic attacks appears to be inherited people who have full blown repeated panic attacks can become very disabled by their condition and should seek treatment before they start to avoid places or situations where panic attacks have occurred for example if a panic attack happened in an elevator someone with panic disorder may develop a fear of elevators that could affect the choice of a job or an apartment and restrict where that person can seek medical attention or enjoy entertainment some people's lives become so restricted that they avoid normal activities such as grocery shopping or driving about one third become housebound or are able to confront a feared situation only when accompanied by a spouse or other trusted person when the condition progresses this far it is called agoraphobia or fear of open spaces early treatment can often prevent agoraphobia but people with panic disorder may sometimes go from doctor to doctor for years and visit the emergency room repeatedly before someone correctly diagnoses their condition this is unfortunate because panic disorder is one of the most treatable of all the anxiety disorders responding in most cases to certain kinds of medication or certain kinds of cognitive psychotherapy which help change thinking patterns that lead to fear and anxiety panic disorder is often accompanied by other serious problems such as depression drug abuse or alcoholism these conditions need to be treated separately symptoms of depression include feelings of sadness or hopelessness changes in appetite or sleep patterns low energy and difficulty concentrating most people with depression can be effectively treated with antidepressant medications certain types of psychotherapy or a combination of the two  Epilepsy Alcoholism Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Adult attention-deficit disorder Schizophrenia Diazepam Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Charles Darwin's illness Myocardial infarction Narcissism DSM-IV Codes Fibromyalgia Parkinson's disease Sexual dysfunction Psychotherapy Balance disorder Asthma M__ni__re___s disease Insomnia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cardiac arrhythmia Stomach cancer Combat stress reaction Chlorpromazine Addiction Sigmund Freud Sleep Cancer Drug addiction Psychoanalysis Cephalic disorder Childbirth First aid Hearing impairment Hypnosis Grief Sleep apnea Diabetic neuropathy Cannabis (drug) Infantilism Asperger syndrome Haloperidol Drug abuse Psoriasis Procrastination Meditation Doxepin Narcotic Child sexual abuse Controversies in autism Hikikomori Milton H.

is remeron usually prescribed first line for anxiety i believe i have gad but my doctors dx was a depressive episode i told him i dont feel depressed and he wrote me low dose script i dont like nassas because it can cause hallucinations and vivid dreaming and i dont sleep well anyways what should i do of course medications can originally be made for something else and discovered to work for other things i understand your fear of the side effects you either need to trust your dr enough to follow his orders and take the medication or if you do not feel comfortable you can always go get a second opinion i have never heard of this type of medication being prescribed for strictly anxiety but i am by no means a dr follow your gut and do what feels comfortable and safe to you you ultimately have to feel comfortable not only with your dr but what you are putting in your body and if you are leery from the get go about the medication that is probably not going to help your anxiety i had fears at first too extreme fears about taking meds but finally found a dr that listened to my concerns and worked with me also realise that every medication is going to have possible serious side effects i often found it best just to find out the most common to watch out for and not read the scare sheets as they are often called sometimes people with gad have been known to go inpatient so they are in an environment where they feel safe enough to get stabilised on meds i wish you the best on whatever you decide and hope your anxiety is better soon  Bipolar disorder Anxiety Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Milton H.

i feel depression creeping up to me slowly how do i avoid it i've moved to a new place and i hardly know anyone there life seems pretty tough i have no choice but to stay coz i just got a job there how do i go on without feeling so lost and alone i've been in some very negative states of mind and emotion and i know it's not easy sometimes we think that the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off especially when we don't have money to pay the bills school fees homework family problem rather than being annoyed be amused instead of getting angry become curious in place of envy feel admiration in place of worry take action in place of doubt have faith negative energy is just positive energy that's flowing in the opposite direction there's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy all you need to do is change its direction the more negative you are the more positive you can be an automobile that can travel miles per hour to the east can also travel just as fast when going west but first someone must turn it around when you sense yourself becoming negative stop and consider what it would mean to apply that negative energy in the opposite direction turn your sadness into caring transform your complaints into useful suggestions change your bitterness into determination the energy is already there all you need to do is change its direction if it's something that lightens your mood and doesn't hurt anyone yes some very simple things can calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind simple but very soothing and it took me a long time to learn that i didn't need to let my thoughts and emotions control me it's normal to worry a bit sometimes we do have to spend a few minutes worrying or on the pity pot as long as we don't stay there maybe what you can think about working on is just taking a baby step toward what you want you can make a start by being grateful for the things you already have food in your stomach a roof over your head clothes on your back and internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it my suggestion would be for you to attend school do you have your high school diploma yet or anything if not go get it go to college school do not sit in your house worrying get out into the world and get busy talk with a counselor at the college school so you can find out what courses then decide which one would interest you do not stop educating yourself until you are at the point where you can smarter and become that extremely successful person you want to be the key is to work hard and get out in the world and do something else another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they ask themselves a question before beginning look at your surroundings right now what do you see if your life is in chaos your surroundings are a mess literally and figuratively your health is substandard have addictions or a number of spirit killing situations then you need to work on yourself first remember god is not the author of chaos this is also true for those who have asked for advice paid for programs and or coaches and nothing seems to work if the advice received is good and nothing is working then something of a higher priority should be attended to if you are in bad health or physical pain your body is trying to tell you something listen to the alarms going off your state of mind has manifested everything you are experiencing right now working on yourself first before starting any new venture or relationship is absolutely necessary because it is you holding you back the traditional way is to gather a group that has an interest in what is being stormed go around the table and each person may present an idea only one at a time someone must act as secretary and record the ideas on a large tablet that everyone can read only one or two ideas to a page keep going around the room until no one has anything further to offer no idea or comment is off limits doing this once everyone is done the moderator of the group goes back over each idea some will need to be discounted as not being practical others will have merit to consider further the refined list then goes to management who will decide which ideas are implemented focus on quantity no criticism unusual ideas are welcome combine and improve ideas set the problem determine and specify the problem which needs a solution every participant must know the problem generate ideas generate as many ideas as possible keep in mind the four basic brainstorm rules and record the good ideas continue for five to fifteen minutes select best idea select the most appropriated idea from the suggested ideas i have tried to get you to see that the power to change is within you that when you focus on others and see yourself as a victim that you will give that power to them and forever remain a victim the key is in knowing clearly what you want and focusing on that not what stops you then let go and let god allow ideas to come to you have faith that people will help you if you don't trust them as you don't trust anyone in singapore then you will reject god's attempts at sending you helpers finally be ready to take action when the moment arrives and don't fear what comes next go forth boldly this is what i came into your life to tell you now it's up to you to make it happen there's a book called great failures of the extremely successful it describes how failures happen to everyone only the successful people never give up they understand that failure is part of the process so when things go wrong or people try to stop them they just keep going until they succeed somehow someway you got to where you are now because of how you think i'm going to make a suggestion please take the time to read a very short book you can also go to any bookstore in the classic section and buy it it's called as a man thinketh by james allen and was written in the 's this book is deep and every single sentence has wisdom so it is something that has to be read and studied slowly i highly recommend this little book because it changed many life in a profound way after reading as a man thinketh and absorbing what it says you will begin to understand why i am sending you in this direction before starting your journey my idea how to win friends and influence people is an awesome book and i highly recommend you pick it up the book goes into detail on how to be more of a selfless encouraging and humble person and those attributes we'll attract people to you one of my favorite lines of the book says that 'you can make more friends in two weeks by taking an interest in others then you can in two years trying to tell others about yourself' my suggestion to a book it s a book called the conversations with god there are in the series you may want to read them and see where that takes you as a start to getting your life on track you can go on the web and search neale donald walsh as he is the author and has several very good sites life can always be difficult at times the key is to realize that there is another law called the law of polarity for every negative there is a positive for every up there is a down we tend to stay focused on the negative but the sight should be on the fact that there is a positive in direct proportion to the negative always keep your focus on your dream and possibility and never on your current situation create what you do want in your mind and ignore what you don't want and don't let the present situation that you don't like be your focus againfocus on what you do like and want then trust and believe if you do not then your situation cannot change i'm wishing you well and sending love your way hope this helps warm regards and thank you for your question

what is wrong with me is this depression i can never commit to anything i will make an appointment to something and just not show up i get like scared or something like my sat test i just didn't go or my community service orientation or my dmv appointment i just get like scared to go so i don't and after on i always regret it and i never ever look forward to anything i am always worried oh am i going to know people here or am i dressed right or blah blah why can't i just live with no worries is this depression cause i dont think so or what is it i think it could possibly be a mild form of depression in other words i don't think you'd be diagnosed as clinically depressed sounds more like something called social anxiety since you specifically mention situations in which you feel like it doesn't matter whether or not you show up when and where you're expected this is a disorder characterized by the person suffering from it not realizing or appreciating that his or her actions do have an effect on others worry is also a common feature of this disorder you mentioned your sat test so i'm assuming you're a teen i hope you understand that being unsure of yourself during your high school years is very common i hope you'll talk to your parents your doctor or a school counselor or another trusted adult about how you're feeling and i can assure you that you are not alone in feeling the way you do you do seem very mature to have realized that something is bothering you and to be able to describe it so well good luck to you i'm pretty sure you'll be fine and you'll feel a lot better after talking with someone who understands  Anxiety Adult attention-deficit disorder Asperger syndrome Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Transsexuality Bipolar disorder Controversies in autism Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Borderline personality disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Karen Horney Psychoanalysis God Emperor of Dune Social rule Homophobia Antisocial personality disorder Autism Psychosis Obsessive-compulsive disorder Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Milton H.

does anyone else find porn disgusting after orgasm when i'm watching a porno pre orgasm it seems very sexy and exciting but after i suddenly find myself disgusted by it especially the noise and have to shut it off anyone else experience this lol yes i do believe that's totally normal sometimes it can have to do with your upbringing if you were taught that sex is dirty that could effect how you feel after watching porn in general people use porn to get off after they have an orgasm there's no reason to continue to watch in some ways it resembles sex once you have an orgasm after sex you don't usually feel like continuing unless you are one of the people who can have multiple orgasms you probably just want to lay there and cuddle up with your lover so watching someone still getting it on can seem kind of gross when you're no longer in the mode  Orgasm Strap-on dildo Child sexuality Prostate cancer Sexual dysfunction Masturbation Oral sex Pornographic movie Human sexual behavior Zoophilia Obscenity Masters and Johnson Deep Throat (film) Sex and the City Sexual intercourse Anorgasmia Bondage (BDSM) Anal sex Sexual orientation Infantilism Little Britain Pornographic actor Avenue Q Wilhelm Reich Human sexual response cycle Motion picture rating system Group sex Crystal methamphetamine and sex Demographics of sexual orientation Sexual arousal Pornography Puberty Rape Sexual addiction Friends Buzzcocks Jamie Gillis Cybersex Tom Cruise Rob Cryston Ion Davidov Social rule Erotic sexual denial Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Normal distribution One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Child pornography John Holmes (actor) Birth control Cyberspace Eric Cartman Missionary position Gender identity The Children of Men Kender Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

anti anxiety meds i am considering taking medication for my anxiety disorder but i don't know whether it will actually help or not and i am kind of apprehensive to start going on something does anyone have an opinion on those drugs it's different for everyone let the prescribing doctor know about your concerns they can walk you through the potential outcomes keep a log of how you feel now and how you feel on the new meds it may take a while for the meds to work and it may take trying several different meds before you find ones that work for you i recommend not giving up ona drug in the first few weeks and keeping the journal of the effects and talking in detail with your doctor about it  Anxiety Migraine Antidepressant Clinical depression Prostate cancer Bipolar disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma St John's wort Multiple sclerosis Medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypertension Folic acid Anorexia nervosa Antipsychotic Borderline personality disorder Rofecoxib Alcoholism Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Malaria Clomipramine Medical cannabis Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Venlafaxine Drug addiction Anxiolytic Drug abuse Paroxetine 5-HTP Pneumonia Psychotherapy Schizophrenia Fluoxetine Asthma Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Aspartame Placebo effect Cannabis (drug) Psychiatry Medical prescription Antiretroviral drug Diazepam Psychopharmacology Eczema Obesity Osteoarthritis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Opioid History of intersex surgery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Homeopathy Paracetamol Prayer Pharmaceutical company Meditation Doxepin Sleep apnea Rabies Alternative medicine Epilepsy Word of Wisdom Reparative therapy Propranolol Maprotiline Hypoglycemia Abortion Charles Darwin's illness Duesberg hypothesis Post-traumatic stress disorder Insomnia Common cold Parkinson's disease Psoriasis Herpes simplex virus Transsexuality Alzheimer's disease Adderall Physician Sigmund Freud Controversies in autism Gastroparesis Benzodiazepine Amiodarone Panic attack Tobacco smoking Milton H.

it's not the fact that we've ended things that bothers me it's the fact that we ended things on such a bad note that depresses me i've pretty much made up for everything i did wrong except one thing and she still refuses to talk to me i just want my peace of mind back but this whole break up is weighing me down help you cant force the pace of someone else's recovery as i have discovered through experience i think that for now you have to consciously make an effort to let go and do what is good for you if that means turning your back for a while on someone who you still care about so be it you can only hope that she will understand and if she needs the space and time to recover grant it to her give it to her with love say in your mind i am giving you this because you need it in the final analysis i think the test of a solid relationship is whether it survives a break up and you can still respect each other in thought word and spirit forgive her and forgive yourself you are both human its not easy i myself have lost not just a lover and a friend but she took many of my friends with her by telling them horrible things about me but i am alive i have people i love and trust and most importantly i believe in myself and my ability to care for others  Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Scenes from a Memory God Emperor of Dune Social rule EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Sin City Current teachings of Prem Rawat John Howard Yoder About a Boy Socrates One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Athrun Zala Alcoholics Anonymous Friends Meaning of life Milton H.

worried about starting high school i'm and i'm going to be in october and i'm just now going to high school i got held back in th grade because of my dads health and ever since ive just gave up on school i dropped out half way through th and th grade because i have like a social anxiety problem and a social problem i'm always quiet in school and never talk i'm just so worried about starting high school some of the kids in high school are such jackasses school doesnt start until next month but im worried about starting its like i never grew outta my shyness because kids keep talking about my bigness or shyness and its made me just stay locked in my house staying online lol ive been to counseling and it helped some sometimes i never know when my dad will go back to the hospital for something wrong with him again or what not so i'm like fuck school and just stayed home when people hit puberty they start to value the opinions of others they start to watch what they say and how they look everyone wants to fit into the crowd everyone wants to be accepted it is human nature to want to be you have to not really care about what people think and base what you say and do off of what you think and feel do not base your whole life around what if s and what would they think s you have to be comfortable enough in your own skin to be yourself people mask the real them in order to be who everyone wants them to be you must not let your father's illness and the worries you have for his well being stop you from caring about life how will you survive without an education people in high school are not that bad why kids get to high school they do not really care as much and do not all want to show off and be mean high school students are much more laid back than middle school students in middle school everyone thinks they are so tough but not anymore they have pretty much all mellowed out do not worry so much if the counseling worked see the school counselor i am sure they would be happy to help try to talk a little try to make friends that is all you can do i am sure you will find someone school days will become routine and by the end of the year you will be talking to the people in the desks around you you just need to calm down a bit and be nonchalant about talking to the people around you  Kodocha Hikikomori Social rule Pitaten Shaggy dog story Transsexuality EastEnders Prostate cancer Theory of conduct The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Piccolo Junior Saga Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide One Tree Hill (TV series) Saved by the Bell Education in the United States Grandview, U.S.A.

i need help managing stress recently a lot of major changes have happened in my life my mother is suicidal and very depressed no one in my family will take care of her it's up to me to be there for her i'm not complaining about that by any means my father sent the whole family for a loop when he said he didn't want anything to do with us anymore because his real family his gf of months family is his family and not us i can't find a job and to be truthful though i go on countless interviews i'm almost happy i can't get one but i really do want one just the one i want not a crappy min wage one i need to find a way to deal with the stress because it's harming my relationship with my boyfriend of three years what makes it more stressful is that it's in long distance mode right now any advice or management ideas would be greatly appreciated thank you coping with stress how can i change my lifestyle habits to manage stress better get enough sleep adequate sleep fuels your mind as well as your body feeling tired will increase your stress because it may cause you to think irrationally see helpguide's getting the sleep you need connect with others develop a support system and share your feelings perhaps a friend family member teacher clergy person or counselor can help you see your problem in a different light talking with someone else can help clear your mind of confusion so that you can focus on problem solving exercise regularly find at least minutes three times per week to do something physical nothing beats aerobic exercise to dissipate the excess energy physical activity plays a key role in reducing and preventing the effects of stress during times of high stress choose things you like to do it also is beneficial to have a variety of exercise outlets be physically fit in ways appropriate for your age rather than being sedentary eat a balanced nutritious diet be mindful of what you put in your body healthy eating fuels your mind as well as your body take time to eat breakfast in the morning it will help keep you going throughout the day eating several balanced nutritious meals throughout the day will give you the energy to think rationally and clearly well nourished bodies are better prepared to cope with stress see helpguide's healthy diet healthy eating reduce caffeine and sugar avoid consuming too much caffeine and sugar in excessive amounts the temporary highs they provide often end in fatigue or a crash later you ll feel more relaxed less jittery or nervous and you ll sleep better in addition you ll have more energy less heartburn and fewer muscle aches don t self medicate with alcohol or drugs while consuming alcohol or drugs may appear to alleviate stress it is only temporary when sober the problems and stress will still be there don t mask the issue at hand deal with it head on and with a clear mind do something for yourself everyday take time out from the hustle and bustle of life for leisure time too much work is actually inefficient and can lead to burnout recognize when you are most stressed and allow yourself some reasonable breaks when things feel especially difficult take a walk or change your scenery most importantly have fun do things that make you happy how can i change my thinking and emotional responses to handle stress better have realistic expectations know your limits whether personally or professionally be realistic about how much you can do set limits for yourself and learn to say no to more work and commitments reframe problems see problems as opportunities as a result of positive thinking you will be able to handle whatever is causing your stress refute negative thoughts and try to see the glass as half full it is easy to fall into the rut of seeing only the negative when you are stressed your thoughts can become like a pair of dark glasses allowing little light or joy into your life maintain your sense of humor this includes the ability to laugh at yourself watch a funny movie the sillier the plot the better the act of laughing helps your body fight stress in a number of ways see helpguide's humor laughter and health express your feelings instead of bottling them up in order to live a less stressful life learn to calm your emotions a good cry during periods of stress or sharing your concerns with someone you trust can be healthy ways to bring relief to your anxiety don t try to control events or other people many circumstances in life are beyond your control particularly the behavior of others consider that we live in an imperfect world learn to accept what is for now until the time comes when perhaps you can change things ask yourself is this my problem if it isn't leave it alone if it is can you resolve it now once the problem is settled leave it alone don't agonize over the decision and try to accept situations you cannot change http www helpguide org mental stress management relief coping htm  Borderline personality disorder Stomach cancer

everyday anxiety intensified during exams there have been many changes for me in the last few years and the importance of doing well in school has increased i have been a constant worrier since i was very young i have talked to a couple of different therapists but they never seem to understand exactly how stressed i get during exams and conclude that deep breathing will solve it or they pass it off as a result of being over tired well i've tried the breathing exervises and it hasn't helped it gets so bad that once i panic i am incapable of thinking and even moving and i know this isn't good it doesn't seem to affect any other aspects of my life except my education at the moment but i fear it will spread i don't know what my next steps in conquering my anxiety should be because it is a serious problem that i want to gain control over i am not a huge advocate of medication for this does anyone have any suggestions or advice for me it is all welcomed greatly appreciated it's hard to believe a physician would blow you off like you describe you could use an anti anxiety agent such as xanax speak to your personal physician about it only an m d can prescribe that medication  Anxiety Panic attack Prostate cancer Clinical depression Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Alexander Technique Traumatic brain injury Charles Darwin's illness Reparative therapy Asthma Psychotherapy Transsexuality Theory of conduct Procrastination Stuttering Borderline personality disorder Multiple sclerosis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Physician Psychiatry Medicine Psychoanalysis Drug addiction Alprazolam Post-traumatic stress disorder Cancer Fecal incontinence Stroke Physical therapy Goodness and value theory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.

low self esteem confidence i'm going to come straight out about this i have extremely low self esteem i have absolutely no confidence it makes life very difficult i always look down on everything when someone says something bad about me it gets to me very badly i care way too much about what other people think about me i kind of hate myself some of this is due to an ex boyfriend who basically made my life hell he put me down every given second he could now i believe all of it i'm going into my senior year of highschool how can i build my confidence and love life without caring about what other people think about it i can sympathize with you since i went thru that when i was young up until my sophomore year and that was when i came out of my shell but considering you have someone to blame and not yourself stop blaming yourself and lift your chin and be proud of what and who you are i know it's easier said than done but you can do it even if you have to reinvent yourself to be someone different start with telling yourself that you aren't going to take the same bs from anyone you took from your boyfriend who in the heck did he think he was that he made you feel less of a person than you are oh i have known a couple like him in my young life they are beyond the word jerk you can't control the guy but you can control how you feel now about yourself so it's time you took a good look at how you can make some changes in you and for you start with changing your appearance tomorrow go for a free facial or make up session at a dept store where they will use their products on you and give you a makeover if you want to try another makeup co another day try someone else spend a girlie day by yourself and just for you call it a 'reward day' if you need an excuse reward yourself for getting rid of that jerk would be good for starters try on something new you can wear to school and buy it if you like it well enough do your nails or have your nails done buy a gooey ice cream sundae or eat something really pleasureable do all the things you probably would not splurge on and do them all in one day then when you've done something about your outward appearance to make yourself look better you should feel better too then start on your inner self go to the library and start looking for books to build your confidence and read to actually learn what you can do to do just that you can also repeat to yourself til you believe it that you are a great person worth knowing and loving and you have alot to share with the world around you each guy you meet and may have a re lationship with will be a stepping stone to finding the right person who you will share your life with you will learn from your mistakes as you must learn from this last one you will not fall for a controlling guy again or one to talk down to you or make you embarrassed or one who disrespects you for you've already been there and done that to not repeat yourself haven't you so maybe the next guy will not be the type in love with himself or gods' gift to women as this one probably did you might even go for the brainy type that is more quiet and reserved you might meet over a book in the library or at a computer station or even a magazine rack but you won't be looking and he won't either but you'll just happen to walk into each others' life and you'll strike up a friendship and relationships that start out as friends are usually long lasting and often don't disolve as the lover types will you've got alot of living to do and lots more males to associate with before you find the right guy who for once will treat you as his equal so don't fall into the doldrums the guy isn't worth it no guy is not even if he's your husband you never ever let a man take control of you he can claim your heart but he can't claim your soul so remember that always be inde pendant and self reliant always and you'll never go wrong and males will always find you interesting when you are that way because you'll always be a challenge that will keep them interested and you interesting now lift your chin and open your eyes and get rid of that houndog look smile and the world will soon be smiling with you greet people with a smile at school say hello in the halls to people you don't even know soon when they see you they'll smile at you first when they recognize you for your friendliness in order to make friends you have to be open to friendships and that is what you need now more than ever are friends and lots of them what you don't need now is another love interest don't be in a hurry to love again that will come when you have made some changes and you will be more ready stop going to places where the two of you hung out distance yourself from those areas get an after school hobby or volunteer for something that interests you work part time for some spending money that will make anyone feel good getting a paycheck you can spend on yourself do things that will make you take on responsibility all things different from the norm will be building opportun ities for you take my word on that good luck and if you need any advice on things you'll find my email as close as my avatar  Social rule

how can i learn to relax with chronic anxiety and high blood pressure i have had to live excessive stress for the past years my health has been changed because of the stress i have high blood pressure and anxiety doctors all say i need to relax how can one do that it is very difficult to remove yourself from stress when your life is swimming in it thru no fault of your own it is equally impossible to just accept the chaos that you feel all the time is surrounding you you do need to get on an anti anxiety medication and try to exercise to try to get rid of some of the stress i can tell you from experience that nothing helps like medication especially if your life circumstances are such that you can do nothing to change them much luck  Anxiety Hypertension Chronic fatigue syndrome Stress (medicine) Stuttering Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Tai Chi Chuan Meditation Panic attack Hypoglycemia Traumatic brain injury Drug addiction Asthma Transsexuality Bipolar disorder Psoriasis Alcoholism Procrastination Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Borderline personality disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Drowning Cannabis (drug) Atherosclerosis Premature ejaculation Charles Darwin's illness Diabetes mellitus Angina Combat stress reaction Insomnia Tobacco smoking Reflexology Multiple sclerosis Massage Health insurance Abortion Eating disorder Scientology beliefs and practices Aikido Vomiting Fecal incontinence Aspartame Narcissism Stroke Migraine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psychoanalysis Adult attention-deficit disorder Breastfeeding Diazepam Hypnosis Sauna Reparative therapy Myocardial infarction Recreation Insulin Psychiatry Prostate cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Balance disorder Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Coffee Psychotherapy Human adaptation to space Transactional analysis Stomach cancer Meditation (alternative medicine) Aortic insufficiency Childbirth Blood pressure Medicine Alexander Technique Medical cannabis Neurofeedback Cancer Traumatic incident reduction Philipp Melanchthon Natural Hygiene Sigmund Freud Doxepin Osteoarthritis Torture LSD Baldness Hikikomori Entropy Cortisol Electroconvulsive therapy Ex-gay Exercise Shock Caffeine Eczema Diving

am i messed up i can't believe i'm even asking about this but i have really bad emotional problems i know i need help but i'm so afraid and i'm depressed and i don't know what to do or how to get help i would never really hurt myself like some people cut but i've recently started pinching myself i don't do it a lot but it helps me sometimes when i'm feeling so low i could hit the floor has anyone ever had a problem like this it's okay it sounds like you just need to get some help for depression but it's not as bad as it could get at all if you're just pinching yourself there are a lot of people with emotional problems and most of them won't admit it so admitting it and getting help for it is courageous and necessary to feel better i have had that problem but it got worse after an ex left me so i did start scratching myself and then attempted suicide a couple of times and i put myself in the hospital got on meds and did a lot of soul searching and emotional growth it doesn't have to get as bad as it did for me just get help now i am actually completely free from depression now so there is a light at the end of the tunnel i am now working on issues for anxiety which i have also always had but since i defeated depression i know i can do the same for anxiety so go talk to a psychiatrist they will get you on the right meds if necessary and i highly recommend talking to a psychologist to explore the roots of these problems and come up with a plan for behavior modification  Clinical depression EastEnders Chronic fatigue syndrome Procrastination Psychoanalysis Transsexuality Post-traumatic stress disorder Anorexia nervosa Borderline personality disorder 1957 World Series Cognitive therapy Divorce Psychiatry Antidepressant Suicide Obsessive-compulsive disorder Stuttering Combat stress reaction Psychotherapy Binge eating disorder Panic attack Ex-gay Pitaten Bipolar disorder Narcissism Alcoholism Theory of conduct Addiction The Ashlee Simpson Show Homophobia Traumatic incident reduction Prayer Multiple sclerosis Sigmund Freud Antisocial personality disorder Meditation Charles Darwin's illness Breastfeeding Anger management Controversies in autism Fathers' rights Refugee Phoebe Halliwell Schizophrenia Drug addiction Vernon Schillinger Postpartum depression Asperger syndrome Autism Friends Domestic violence Emotions (album) Out-of-body experience Transactional analysis Keynesian economics Medicine Dog Psychology Columbine High School massacre Unemployment Diving Cult Boston Public Reparative therapy Psychiatric hospital Real Love (song) Mental illness Traumatic brain injury Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Equine conformation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Screenwriting Karen Horney About a Boy Oh My Goddess!

can someone tell me if i'm depressed or not 'm a year old girl going into the th grade i don't have any friends seriously i sit alone by myself at lunch no one talks to me etc etc i always have this terrible aching feeling kind of like longing for someone or something that can understand me and will love me for who i am i cant tell my parents anything or suggest anything to anyone because i am afraid that they will either laugh at me or tell me that i am stupid and to get over it i'm not suicidal and i don't cut my wrists i am overweight so that might have something to do with it i hate my life and i think that everyone else around me has perfect everything and it always makes me want to cry help me please from personal experience you may be despondent which is not quite depressed but you still have that depressed feeling you say that you have that aching feeling a longing for someone well i used to feel just like that but i had some good friends and many acquaintances if you really have no friends you may be farther down the road than i was i also felt that everyone else had things that i did not whether material emotional egotistical and did not deserve it if you keep dwelling on negative things and only dwell on pay attention to those i think you are definitely at least despondent if not depressed but hey that's about all i can guess from your description  Shaggy dog story Pitaten Kurt Cobain Friends The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Transactional analysis Milton H.

plz read my last question no it's more along the lines of i have some reasons to believe that i myself am dying i don't want to i mean listen to me i'm talking to strangers on yahoo answers in full english at just while most of year olds prefer to talk in short i've absorbed too much in life to lose it all and just yet at this early age it's an upsetting thought and i just wonder what happens at death a lot i'm not really scared just nervous of the pain that i could possibly feel and the pain from those around me empathy and yet worry for myself i just want to be again thank you all for your answers i will choose a best one after some time when more people have posted replies me again lol i gave an answer to your last question and now reading this i think your stressing yourself out dont be so hard on yourself many people of all ages have been in the same position as you and have felt the same anxieties i'v had problems with depression and worrying about dying and the only thing i could say is that i'v read lots of books watched lots of great psychic medium programmes have been to see a few spiritualists and i strongly believe that when it's our rite time to die we go to another world one that doesnt need to be feared and meat with family that have went before us somepeople would say that i'm not helping but for me just knowing that when we die its not the end is very reasuring i think that a lot of people have felt how you do at some point in their life talkin to a doctor or someone you know and trust would really help to end your problem xxx  Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Empathy Anorexia nervosa Shaggy dog story Goodness and value theory Singlish Panic attack Charles Darwin's illness EastEnders Milton H.

i'am always stressed lately i haven't been sleeping real well i have bad dreams often i'am self consouse i lack in confidence my family are km from where iam but they never want to talk my nan gives me no encouragement she is mostly putting me down my family are one of these familys that play mind games i got that alot when i was younger so i have moed away from them and now live with my bf but lately all lil things really piss me off like my dog i snap i get moody often im not sleeping well i think people hate me as i have no friends my own age i can't talk with anyone when i do have a problem what's wrong with me any suggestions on what i might do to help me relax please sencible answers only any stupid ones and i will report i'm here for help not to be humiliated aww bless sounds just like what i've been through and am still dealing with i have so many issues from my past which i have been letting rule the future and getting real worked up over but it's not how i want to be sounds like me that you need someone to talk to someone who doesn't know you in any way like a counsellor who will not judge you who you can talk to about anything and who you know will treat your conversation with confidentiality you're paranoid when you say you think people hate you i used to be like that too but now i think so what if they hate me then that's fine it has nothing to do with not having friends your own age in school i had very few friends i left school years ago and don't keep in regular contact with anyone from there now other than my boyfriend who i have been with for years and friends with for and two younger girls aged and i'm now who live next door but one to my mums house and i've known them years too that i treat as if they were my little sisters and my dad too i have no other real friends you don't say how old you are and rightly so but maybe if i'm not too far away from your age you would like to be my friend maybe you live a long way from me in england but we can still talk via email for some reason i have you as one of my contacts i think you added me first so in the past i must have answered one of your questions will have to look back through my profile now and see what my suggestion to help you relax is to take time out and do things that you want to do go for a walk to the movies treat yourself to a facial or other beauty treatments and always remember you're a princess when you start feeling like you will become snappy and moody learn to identify the moment and then walk away so don't allow the feeling to deepen if you want to get in touch further please use the link via my profile i'd be more than happy to talk with you further you say you can't talk to anyone when you have a problem why you get stressed because you bottle things up but you can talk to me i must point out that i'm not a trained counsellor but do have lots of life experience and will help you to the best of my ability  Social rule Little Britain Theory of conduct Friends Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha EastEnders The Smoking Room Scenes from a Memory The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.

my father has sustained a brain injury years ago he is verbal and abusive he hurts me and my family i hate my father so much i never do anything to him but he baits me and then it turns into a full screaming match which in the end he says its all my fault and then writes me a document outlining all the things that 'i don't know about his life' and that i'm the one with the problem every day he is lazy is not flexible he always has to stay in his routine everything is about him he does nothing for me and everything is 'tit of tat' he will only do something for myself or others if he is going to get something out of it he doesn't play the father role he hates taking my sister to and from school claims 'why do i have to do it' blames everything on everyone else contradicts himself in arguments and then the arguments just go right of subject because all he wants to do is win the argument and the list goes on i need help i believe my father has gone and i have a angry over bearing defensive abusive person to replace him i don't want to leave my family home what do i do couple things contradict themselves yes your father is correct that people with traumatic brain injuries can be violent and impulsive however manipulation and verbal abuse do not occur with the injury you and your sisters are in an abusive home your father does need help and so do you and your sisters you need to be brave and tell an adult what he is doing so there can be an intervention and some safety is there another adult in the household and are they supportive of your fathers behaviors there are so many factors here the bottom line is that your dad needs to be held accountable for his actions and being treated like that can have life long effects on children please tell some one and let us know how you are doing if you need any contact resources feel free to email me  Domestic violence Fathers' rights Divorce Rape Narcissism Autism Transactional analysis Traumatic brain injury Spanking Borderline personality disorder Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Scientology beliefs and practices Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Schizophrenia Fathers' rights movement in the UK Psychoanalysis Theory of conduct Theodicy Anger management 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The O.C.

dealing with depression is medication the only way i am in a relationship breakdown and in a state if grief will it pass i'm so scared should i take medication what if i can't get off them i too have been very depressed and i have been taking anti depressants for many years one thing my therapist has stressed to me throughout the years has been to exercise when you exercise your body releases many endorphins into your system and exercise definitely has positive effects on the brain endorphins trigger natural opiates in your brain similar to opiates such as morphine endorphins increase the level of seratonin dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain and have been associated with elavated mood so what i am getting at is that you should get some exercise every day to elavate your state of mind grief is something we all have to deal with at one time or another like when my only child died now that is true grief and it has taken me years just to be able to talk about it without bursting into tears so we all deal with our grief at different time frames but i wouldn't be afraid to take medication if your doctor feels it is in order i want to wish you the best of luck in the future with your situation and may god bless and keep you safe and happy  Clinical depression Endorphin Addiction Drug addiction Withdrawal Psychosis Happiness Opioid Post-traumatic stress disorder Serotonin Bipolar disorder Cocaine Fibromyalgia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Meditation Grief Schizophrenia Transsexuality Chronic fatigue syndrome Parkinson's disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Self-harm Antidepressant Electroconvulsive therapy Weight training Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Psychiatry EastEnders Urinary incontinence Anxiety Stress (medicine) Neurotransmitter Borderline personality disorder Hulk (comics) Migraine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Adult attention-deficit disorder Stroke Arguments for and against drug prohibition Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Tetrahydrocannabinol Obsessive-compulsive disorder Nitrous oxide Yawn Methylphenidate Venlafaxine Raphe nuclei Drug abuse LSD Sadism and masochism Alzheimer's disease Property (ownership right) Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis Narcissism Diabetes mellitus Massage Amphetamine Religion Sigmund Freud Psychoanalysis Multiple sclerosis Hypoglycemia Adrenal gland Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Milton H.

i am afraid to go to sleep here i am resisting the urge to go to sleep why i don't know why i do this i'm serious and fyi i don't take medication a few years back and then farther back then that i'd have this dream where someone breaks in the house with a knife and me and my parents hide in this closet then the guy runs down the hall and i lock the door and we're all up on each other and when the guy is in the process of sticking the knife in the door i wake up i've had that dream a lot but nothing has ever gone that wrong to where i should be dreaming about someone trying to kill me when i was younger for me to be able to go to sleep my mom or dad would have to act like they were going to sleep in my room until i fell asleep and then they'd go to their room and sleep i'm oh and i've never watched a horror scary movie i've never done drugs alcohol ok no more youtube videos i have conflicting feelings towards one ex girlfriend and one girl i like who found out in the worst possible way i also have a lot of stress im and i'm absolutely terrified of the dark and going to sleep and someone trying to kill me in my sleep perhaps it's just an age thing but i also have a lot going on emotionally and i had a traumatic childhood so maybe that has something to do with my anxiety of sleeping if you don't leave a light on at night try it it's helped to make things better with me other than that there's this excercise you can do where you think of the colours of the rainbow and everything that is that colour for example you start with red and then think of everything possible that's red and then you go on to orange most of the time i drop off to sleep before i've got to blue so it must work sounds crazy lol but try it  The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass Sin City Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Out-of-body experience EastEnders Sleep Urinary incontinence Miss Saigon Friends Phoebe Buffay's songs Anxiety RuneScape quests Treehouse of Horror V Scream (film) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Cure The Subtle Knife The Ashlee Simpson Show Oh My Goddess!

when therapy outpatient and hospitalization inpatient aren't effective what rd options exist hi i guess for while i've circle around this question in seeking help i've felt it important to realize that i have and am trying even if it's not in the forms that seem to work hence my question having tried multiple therapy group progams and hospitalizations and asking in here i know even if i don't believe it that i'm trying to get help what i've also noticed are my shortcomings on getting help given my lack of socialization economic status insurance etc though i get that recent line is somewhat an excuse so what isn't my journals indicate all the things i don't want to be or do or become though can't seem to list any of the do's no matter how much i've tried i get i have multiple issues ranging from detachments isolation despair etc so the is what options are there i know i'm not suicidal though i know i'm not an extrovert nor any desire to become one so what do i do thinking more is needed to be posted by me quick clarifications yes i do walk miles every day to and from work no i don't take meds last therapists a few yrs ago recommended not taking them stating issues are personality not chemical though thanks for early bit of advise thanks for the advise so far though presently it's ideas i've considered before obviously you all couldn't have known that lol maybe i'm seeking a th or th option who knows i feel as two persons the one knowing i need help for which i don't think is out there and the other who still has the ideation of hoping to not wake up though i also know i can't go anywhere since i pay the bills for myself and others others are actually disabled wondering if maybe the issue is i have no respect and am disgusted with myself but no concept of what happiness is for i can't see a lifestyle out there that appears happy to me who knows still looking i guess thanks for the ideas regarding ect been informed ect doesn't work for those with dysthymia mild depression schizoid narassistic personality disorder which is my situation though again i do appreciate the rd option if there are any more out there since to be honest tired of a dozen attempts of therapy group therapy and meds and seeking something else out let me know though not pray spiritual but not religious so please no come to god ideas okay thanks question are you the kind of person that gets suggestions from professional caregivers therapists psychiatrist and answers yes but and then explains why it can't won't work i'm working on a hunch here that may be totally wrong but in my practice i've found it very difficult to treat patients who will reject all suggestions made for various reasons they usually end up being the treatment failures and being convinced that no one no treatment can help them if this sounds like it could possibly be you consider doing therapy and medication and following the suggestions given instead of finding reasons why they won't work i know that involves trust and that may be a hard thing for you but it's the only way i see you getting better if you have tried everything and nothing's worked you are an ideal cadidate for ect shock therapy as the success rate for turning around episodes of major depression is better than any medication however in order to maintain gains made there you'd need to continue with medication and therapy afterwards or else the positive effects would likely be lost quickly ect has an success rate in turning around serious depressive episodes best antidepressant works no better than of the time  Reparative therapy Bipolar disorder Psychiatric hospital Transsexuality Psychiatry Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antidepressant Chronic fatigue syndrome Palliative care Psychoanalysis Medicine Borderline personality disorder Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Milton H.

are you scare to death i am too much maybe what can i do thanks i am reading every single answer sorry english is my th language just need some help with my life i think you need to stop doing that and just go out and start moving yourself i've been in some very negative states of mind and emotion and i know it's not easy sometimes we think that the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off especially when we don't have money to pay the bills school fees homework family problem rather than being annoyed be amused instead of getting angry become curious in place of envy feel admiration in place of worry take action in place of doubt have faith negative energy is just positive energy that's flowing in the opposite direction there's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy all you need to do is change its direction the more negative you are the more positive you can be an automobile that can travel miles per hour to the east can also travel just as fast when going west but first someone must turn it around when you sense yourself becoming negative stop and consider what it would mean to apply that negative energy in the opposite direction turn your sadness into caring transform your complaints into useful suggestions change your bitterness into determination the energy is already there all you need to do is change its direction if it's something that lightens your mood and doesn't hurt anyone yes some very simple things can calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind simple but very soothing and it took me a long time to learn that i didn't need to let my thoughts and emotions control me it's normal to worry a bit sometimes we do have to spend a few minutes worrying or on the pity pot as long as we don't stay there maybe what you can think about working on is just taking a baby step toward what you want you can make a start by being grateful for the things you already have food in your stomach a roof over your head clothes on your back and internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it my suggestion would be for you to attend school do you have your high school diploma yet or anything if not go get it go to college school do not sit in your house worrying get out into the world and get busy talk with a counselor at the college school so you can find out what courses then decide which one would interest you do not stop educating yourself until you are at the point where you can smarter and become that extremely successful person you want to be the key is to work hard and get out in the world and do something else another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they ask themselves a question before beginning look at your surroundings right now what do you see if your life is in chaos your surroundings are a mess literally and figuratively your health is substandard have addictions or a number of spirit killing situations then you need to work on yourself first remember god is not the author of chaos this is also true for those who have asked for advice paid for programs and or coaches and nothing seems to work if the advice received is good and nothing is working then something of a higher priority should be attended to if you are in bad health or physical pain your body is trying to tell you something listen to the alarms going off your state of mind has manifested everything you are experiencing right now working on yourself first before starting any new venture or relationship is absolutely necessary because it is you holding you back the traditional way is to gather a group that has an interest in what is being stormed go around the table and each person may present an idea only one at a time someone must act as secretary and record the ideas on a large tablet that everyone can read only one or two ideas to a page keep going around the room until no one has anything further to offer no idea or comment is off limits doing this once everyone is done the moderator of the group goes back over each idea some will need to be discounted as not being practical others will have merit to consider further the refined list then goes to management who will decide which ideas are implemented focus on quantity no criticism unusual ideas are welcome combine and improve ideas set the problem determine and specify the problem which needs a solution every participant must know the problem generate ideas generate as many ideas as possible keep in mind the four basic brainstorm rules and record the good ideas continue for five to fifteen minutes select best idea select the most appropriated idea from the suggested ideas i have tried to get you to see that the power to change is within you that when you focus on others and see yourself as a victim that you will give that power to them and forever remain a victim the key is in knowing clearly what you want and focusing on that not what stops you then let go and let god allow ideas to come to you have faith that people will help you if you don't trust them as you don't trust anyone in singapore then you will reject god's attempts at sending you helpers finally be ready to take action when the moment arrives and don't fear what comes next go forth boldly this is what i came into your life to tell you now it's up to you to make it happen there's a book called great failures of the extremely successful it describes how failures happen to everyone only the successful people never give up they understand that failure is part of the process so when things go wrong or people try to stop them they just keep going until they succeed somehow someway you got to where you are now because of how you think i'm going to make a suggestion please take the time to read a very short book you can also go to any bookstore in the classic section and buy it it's called as a man thinketh by james allen and was written in the 's this book is deep and every single sentence has wisdom so it is something that has to be read and studied slowly i highly recommend this little book because it changed many life in a profound way after reading as a man thinketh and absorbing what it says you will begin to understand why i am sending you in this direction before starting your journey my idea how to win friends and influence people is an awesome book and i highly recommend you pick it up the book goes into detail on how to be more of a selfless encouraging and humble person and those attributes we'll attract people to you one of my favorite lines of the book says that 'you can make more friends in two weeks by taking an interest in others then you can in two years trying to tell others about yourself' my suggestion to a book it s a book called the conversations with god there are in the series you may want to read them and see where that takes you as a start to getting your life on track you can go on the web and search neale donald walsh as he is the author and has several very good sites life can always be difficult at times the key is to realize that there is another law called the law of polarity for every negative there is a positive for every up there is a down we tend to stay focused on the negative but the sight should be on the fact that there is a positive in direct proportion to the negative always keep your focus on your dream and possibility and never on your current situation create what you do want in your mind and ignore what you don't want and don't let the present situation that you don't like be your focus againfocus on what you do like and want then trust and believe if you do not then your situation cannot change i'm wishing you well and sending love your way hope this helps warm regards and thank you for your question

if there are any doctors or clinics please answer this question i have ocd and i'm years old i have to touch things multiple amount of times or i think in my mind something bad is going to happen to me or i'll turn gay i know it sounds weird but i cant stop it when i scratch myself i have to do it a certain amount of times while i count aloud in my head or when i shut my dresser i have to touch it times or when i put on deoderant i have to put more under my left arm than my right sometimes my ocd is so bad it makes me hate my voice and i don't want to talk to people or just completely ignore them and also for some reason i have been suffering from memory loss an example is that i can't even remember what i did yesterday or remember names that people told me an hour ago or yesterday in some cases getting back to my ocd i also try to be better than a person because i have to even though i don't want to i have to make people like me more than another person like my brother for some reason thank for your help points best answer my parents don't want me to see a doctor or clinic hi i am really sorry you are going through this that is also very sad how your parents dont want you to seek help left untreated obsessive compulsive disorder can make your life unpleasant and unenjoyable you may feel that you're being held hostage by ocd because you're unable to go about your normal routine and activities school work and social relationships all can suffer as more of your time is devoted to your obsessions and compulsive behavior ocd can also increase the risk of suicide because it can be so demoralizing and distressing and it increases the risk of alcohol and substance abuse as people turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms in some cases ocd can cause physical complications for instance you may feel compelled to wash your hands so often and so harshly that you wind up with dermatitis there's no specific way to prevent obsessive compulsive disorder from developing since its cause isn't known however getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent ocd from worsening obsessive compulsive disorder is a chronic condition which means it may be part of your life for the long term however psychotherapy medications and self care can help you control ocd symptoms so that you can live a normal life please take care i wish you only the best  Clinical depression Anxiety Addiction Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Milton H.

afraid of heights when i think of climbing high poles trees ladders i get this tingling feeling in my feet toes mostly and my fingers i can only assume this is a fear of heights however when i actually do go up on things high up i don't get the same feeling it's odd i'm only afraid of heights when i think about them before or afterwards yet when i'm in the act of being high off the ground i'm perfectly fine does this happen to anyone else also does anyone else get that tingling sensation in your feet and fingers when you think of hieghts for example balancing on something high off the ground just imagining it i get tingles the first reply nailed it in my opinion in my case i never had any fear of heights at all and in fact was excited by them i always loved the window seat on a plane enjoyed the view from tall buildings and climbing trees in my neighborhood the place where i have a problem is when i don't feel as though i'm in complete control i know that sounds silly i mean i wasn't the one flying the plane and people fall out of trees all the time but i never doubted the pilot and felt in control while holding the branches but you put me on the top of a building that has no railings and i won't get within feet of the edge ladders didn't used to bother me but as a kid i never had a reason to climb them very high these days when i sometimes have to use a ladder to reach the roof of a two story house i damn near need a diaper if a breeze blows while i'm on it you seem to be the complete opposite perhaps you're afraid of depths lol my simple answer to the title of this question would be not when i'm on the ground  Shaggy dog story Diving Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an B-47 Stratojet Milton H.

diazepam abuse help needed i am not asked this for myself but i am very worried about a family member she has been taking diazepam for a very long time now about years from what i have been told and what worries me more is that she hasn t spoken directly to her doctor about this for a very long time as all she has to do is go across the road to the local clinic and speak to the receptionist and order a repeat prescription which is available the next day surely the doctor is wrong to keep issuing this drug to her without speaking to her first and also when i have spoken to my own gp about my concerns he say s this is not a good drug to be issuing without examining the patient first and also that it is only meant to be used in a short term capacity and not the answer i know that if i was to question her about this all i will get is mind my own business i have spoken to her partner and he is at a loss about what to do for the best as he can t talk to her properly because it ends in an arguement thanks so far all routine is that she will take the drug when getting up and will also take more during the day if needed not everyday she is also drinking whilst on this drug not much really about litres of cider normal from pm that is when it is impossible to talk to her as she is right and you are wrong i said abuse in question header as i think that after over a decade of taking the drug you are now dependent on it and when you are refusing to even get a part time hrs job to help out your family as they are struggling then it is affecting your life as a person and as a mum she has never done a bad thing to anyone but her kids need more as they are getting older and seeing other kids enjoying time with there parents but as she do sent drive or work they never have enough money to go anywhere or do anything your doctor is right valium diazepam is only meant for short term use however i'm not sure that she is abusing or addicted to the drug the first thing you need to find out is if she is taking her medication as prescribed so if it's mg a day is she only taking mg if she is taking the prescribed amount she's not addicted if she's taking more than the prescribed amount she's addicted valium is a sedative and it can be dangerous coming off of it especially after a long period of time you are right her doctor should not be prescribing her medication without examining her first and i honestly don't know what to tell you about that why does she need the valium before you jump to conclusions about abuse or addiction find out if she's taking it as prescribed if she's not talk to her about it and tell her even though you really should mind your business you're concerned about her  Diazepam Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Drug addiction Medical prescription Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Controlled Substances Act Benzodiazepine Drug abuse Arguments for and against drug prohibition Addiction Epilepsy Theory of conduct Social rule Bipolar disorder Sedative Insomnia Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Sant Thakar Singh Clinical depression LSD The nature of God in Western theology Physician Rush Limbaugh Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Drug test Alcoholism Infantilism Abortion Adverse effect (medicine) Medicine Milton H.

help i need to see a counselor but i do i know what kind i need i have never seen a counselor before but i need to see one now i was sexually abused as a kid i have major trust issues and i really don't take rejection very well i have anger management problems exspecially when i feel rejected last night i lost it my husband wouldn't kiss me because he didn't want to feel like he was forced to i was so hurt it was like tearing my heart out i got drunk not something that i usually do i threw a mirior at the floor and broke it yep years of bad luck i hit him and then well then i really just wanted to grab a knife and kill myself the only thing that stopped me was that i didn't know how to stab myself that would make me die then i would end up in a hospital in the psych ward and i am closterphobic is that how you spell it so that would not be good so what kind of counselor do i need look for a therapist who specializes in trauma someone who is trained in edmr might also be a good idea depending on what you are experiencing make sure s he has a license to practice and is someone you respect and believe you could grow to trust what you've described sounds fairly typical of post child abuse you are not alone and with commitment you can get beyond this apologize to your hubby and explain what's going on too  Theory of conduct Psychotherapy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Boston Public EastEnders Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Dissociative identity disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psychoanalysis Sin City Transactional analysis Traumatic incident reduction Tenshinhan Knots Landing Narcissism Humphrey Bogart The Beach Boys Laura Schlessinger The Inside Anger management Milton H.

why do we have so many bipolar people these days it seems like one out of people are bipolar when i grew up in the 's i never knew anyone with the illness i mean these people today are really sick they're not making this up they scream and talk nonstop jump up and down think they have super powers over others etc it seems like when the 's came along bipolarism was born does anyone know what caused this your thoughts are appreciated i'm a little appauled that you got so many ignorant answers in the s bipolar was called manic depression it was treated with lithium and a few first generation anti psychotics not much of a med selection it is still treated with lithium i am on it and i love it we now have other mood stabilizers so nearly all can find something that really does work back in the s people didn't talk about mental illness we also had those big mental institutions to warehouse us crazies in the s manic depression was renamed bipolar why good question bipolar doesn't describe it there are no poles and you can be both manic and depressed at the same time today science and psychiatry recognize that what once was thought of as a type of untreatable depression is actually a form of bipolar and it responds to bipolar meds that adds a little to the number approximately of the population is bipolar that stat has remained fairly constant the illness has a strong hereditary link and you have to have the right gene make up to ever get it so population explosion might explain some of what you are seeing but it's not a contagious outbreak lol btw regular life adult stress isn't gonna trigger bp something seriously stressful in childhood is what probably does it perhaps increasing divorce rates play a little into setting it off who knows here's another stat the average length of time to be properly diagnosed is years for those with bipolar type ii that's a lot of hell to go thru and it's partly why pdocs are making the diagnosis sooner even if they temporarily over diagnose better than having your patient commit suicide if you know what i mean last because there is greater acceptance of mental illness in society bipolar children are being diagnosed bipolar earlier past trend was to stick with the adhd or problem child label much longer and the suicide rate is it's a serious illness actually it is a neurological brain disease it is not something that can be fixed with talk therapy  Psychiatry Autism Borderline personality disorder Controversies in autism Antipsychotic Pneumonia Medicine Mania Chronic fatigue syndrome Multiple sclerosis Cancer Post-traumatic stress disorder Lamotrigine Antidepressant Transsexuality Electroconvulsive therapy Asperger syndrome Homeopathy Anti-psychiatry Chemical imbalance theory Migraine Psychiatric hospital DSM-IV Codes Mixed state (psychology) Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Epilepsy Autism epidemic Divorce Depression (mood) Neurology Asthma Herpes simplex virus Combat stress reaction Coeliac disease Psychoanalysis Haloperidol Suicide Fibromyalgia Psoriasis Narcissism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual orientation Cannabis (drug) Alzheimer's disease Mental health Schizoaffective disorder Traumatic brain injury Motor neurone disease Alcoholism Involuntary commitment Sigmund Freud Maprotiline Anorexia nervosa Urinary incontinence Obsessive-compulsive disorder Abortion Growth hormone treatment Dissociative identity disorder Psychotherapy Alternative medicine Primidone Autism rights movement Lithium salt Stuttering Obesity Stomach cancer Cephalic disorder Mental retardation Intelligence quotient Hypnosis Stroke Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Infantilism Postpartum depression Leukemia Cerebral palsy John Cade Procrastination Emil Kraepelin Virus Drug addiction Unemployment AIDS reappraisal Tobacco smoking Sickle-cell disease Multiple chemical sensitivity Grief Lesch-Nyhan syndrome

ssri antidepressants my doctor prescribed me a ssri antidepressant for my major depression fluvoxamine maleate i've read on the internet something about ssris but i didn't quit understand what is serotonin and what how do these help in treating depression what are the most common side effects of ssris in the prospect it says that there is high possibility of suicide attempt but it's part of the treatment i have suicidal thoughts but i most certainly don't want to die so can these pills make me feel so miserable at one point in the adjusting period so i may try to kill myself i'm very scared to take these pills what should i do thank you i think ssri's are like anything else in america they can work for hundreds of thousands of people but then one person that happens to be on them commits suicide and now suddenly they get a bad rap don't even sweat that here's how it works serotonin is one of several things that basically regulates a handfull of things anger aggression mood sleep body temperature even but namely in this case depression a lack of serotonin can cause many or even all of these negative things but often simply results in horrible depression and different mood and sleep habits how it works in very basic form is a circular effect if you will ssri's or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors work by inhibiting stopping the reuptake of serotonin in layman's terms so much goes out so much comes in the ssri makes less come back in making more available to you so the body isn't short thus negating all of the negative effects the lack of serotonin was causing hope that makes a little more sense  Paroxetine Borderline personality disorder Serotonin Maprotiline Fluoxetine Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Bipolar disorder Venlafaxine Clomipramine Fluvoxamine Citalopram Tricyclic antidepressant Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Sertraline Monoamine oxidase inhibitor Anxiety St John's wort Zimelidine Doxepin Obsessive-compulsive disorder Anxiolytic Reboxetine Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Psychopharmacology Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Electroconvulsive therapy Antipsychotic Withdrawal Diabetic neuropathy Anorexia nervosa Neuropathy Alprazolam Chronic fatigue syndrome Multiple sclerosis Seasonal affective disorder Suicide Tianeptine Fibromyalgia Erectile dysfunction Orgasm Chlorpromazine Psychosis Raphe nuclei Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trimipramine Sleep Addiction Diazepam Anorgasmia Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Suicide methods Schizophrenia Procrastination Parkinson's disease Cognitive therapy Nortriptyline Narcolepsy Theory of conduct Anger management Topiramate English grammar Norepinephrine Enzyme Buspirone Pharmacology Drug addiction Amphetamine Lithium salt Chemotherapy Learning disability Cocaine Premature ejaculation Ranma __ characters LSD Urinary incontinence Quetiapine Stroke Singlish Weight training Happiness Traumatic brain injury Postpartum depression Sleep apnea Tryptophan Sigmund Freud Antiretroviral drug Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus

how can i tell which thoughts are mine and which are just caused by my depression i just don't want to end up doing something i'll regret because i listen to some of the thoughts i have when i'm depressed first off don't dwell on it to some degree you can't tell what thoughts you'd have if you weren't depressed but they are still all your thoughts if depression is something you continue to deal with in your life you'll get a better feel for your emotions you'll learn to tell the difference between your normal moods and your depressed moods and keep things in perspective better though hopefully you'll never have to deal with it again back to what i said first though don't dwell on it it's a slippery road to get headed down when you start questioning what thoughts and emotions are real and what's because of depression when you start to question the reality of who you are in light of depression it can just make you even more confused than you already are it's an easy way to put yourself further down the hole it really helps to have a friend you can talk things out with get them off your chest your friend can help you remind you who you are when you're not depressed if nothing else keep a journal of your feelings and keep track of how they change day to day  Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Procrastination About a Boy Philosophy of language Cognitive therapy Out-of-body experience English grammar Friends Social rule Transsexuality Milton H.

am i just too compassionate or depressed sometimes i wonder if there is really something wrong with me and this is serious so please no flaming hearing about cruelty to children and animals affects me to the degree where i can't get things i see and hear out of my mind and it makes me really angry at the world in general i know there's a ton of really good people out there that would never do horrible things to kids and animals but i'm also just floored but the sheer number of incredibly sick and heartless people that do i feel like the world is going to hell in a hand basket sometimes and i'm only in my s i feel like i don't have much to look forward to i have friends and a good job and family and i don't see anyone affected by the stuff that goes on in the world like i do i wish i could be more egocentric honestly is this normal to be so affected by stuff you see and hear in the news and on the internet that it can really ruin your day and give you such a negative outlook on life hi i am very much like you i also am very sensitive to cruelty of any form and hearing about it on the news or thinking about it also makes me depressed sometimes for days and when i realize there's nothing i can do about it it makes me negative feeling as if i don't belong in this cruel world but i don't think there is anything wrong with you and me in statistics i learned that most things are distributed on a normal curve like a wave form starting low then high then low again that means in this case the majority of people feel moderately about cruelty the center bulge of the curve near the average less people are towards left and right sides of the curve on the left the few that care very much have strong feelings about cruelty and few people also minority who don't care much on the other side of the curve so you and i are from the minority on the one side e mail me if you want to talk more  Theory of conduct Social rule Inflation YuYu Hakusho Shit K' Pitaten Hearing impairment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Explosive material Empathy Intelligence quotient Microeconomics Keynesian economics Economic inequality Jon Secada About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ELO rating system Time Out of Mind Care Bears Animal rights Milton H.

how do you treat cure agoraphobia i have agoraphobia and it has really been rough for me i can't ever leave my house without having panic attacks sometimes i even get them while i am at my house it makes my life so miserable i can't even get a job or go out anywhere with my girlfriend because of my agoraphobia i am on prozac and lithium for it but it doesn't seem to help please give me some advise first let me say you are not alone i am a fellow sufferer and on the outside i look perfectly normal i go to work every day and have a full social life but my agoraphobia has eroded my life because i have so many restrictions i am afraid of highways busses subways elevators and going far from home at work i am afraid they will want me to travel and i don't know what to tell them that i'm afraid it sounds ridiculous to refuse to go a measly one exit on the highway i am coming to accept that my disorder is serious and while simple to treat the recovery is far from easy let me share some of my experiences with you maybe some of what i will help and maybe not i am no expert on agoraphobia and i am still suffering from it things that have helped me cognitive behavioral therapy cbt helps you look at your limiting thoughts and practice exposure to things you are afraid it helps having a calm and caring professional by my side online support at www panicsurvivor com these people have a fighters attitude when it comes to dealing with anxiety it is by far my favorite community that deals with anxiety turning to friends and loved ones my friends and family have been supportive although i let them enable me sometimes my friends have gone on exposures with me and told me to do it have a good cry when i cry and get the feelings out my anxiety lessens i used to cry before exposures which helped me release all the negative feelings working with a psychiatrist i admit medications have not worked for me yet but i keep trying research has found that a combination of medication and cbt works best however cbt alone is pretty effective too reading books by people who understand bourne's anxiety and phobia workbook is a classic also wish i were there is a memoir about agoraphobia what i liked about the memoir by allen shawn is that is realistic the man still has agoraphobia but he is coping with it better spirituality i am not religious but i have come to believe in a higher power to make sense of my senseless condition i don't think you have to be spiritual but it helps me to rely on something greater than myself self care i am working to eat right and exercise and get plenty of rest agoraphobia is stressful and takes its toll on my nerves when i take care of myself i send the message that i am important and worthy of love love tends to displace panic there is a lot more that i do but i don't want to bore you with all the details google agoraphobia panic attacks and anxiety there is a lot of good information out there good luck  Borderline personality disorder Panic attack Chronic fatigue syndrome Charles Darwin's illness Bipolar disorder Stuttering Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychoanalysis Transsexuality Psychiatry Psychotherapy Autism Antidepressant Behavioral therapy Prostate cancer Sigmund Freud Traumatic incident reduction Social anxiety EastEnders Procrastination Mental illness Drug addiction Reparative therapy Dissociative identity disorder Infantilism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Monk (TV series) Schizophrenia Homophobia Traumatic brain injury Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Combat stress reaction Urinary incontinence Controversies in autism Alcoholics Anonymous DSM-IV Codes Hypoglycemia Stroke Asperger syndrome Ex-gay Narcissism Avoidant personality disorder Hikikomori Cult Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daredevil Diabetes mellitus Meditation Psychopharmacology Medicine Hearing impairment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Eating disorder Social rule Hypnosis Neuro-linguistic programming -phobia Adult attention-deficit disorder Alternative medicine Second language acquisition Tobacco smoking Empathy Psychiatric hospital Hypertension Stress (medicine) Narcolepsy Ethics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.

help for a burned out shy stay at home mom i am a mom that has three young children and i stay at home with my children i have always wanted to be at home with them i love and adore my children the problem is i am also very shy in that i have a really hard time initiating friendships have a phobia of calling people on the phone and it has become even harder to get out with my young children my spouse because of work is not available for extended periods of time i just feel like i am dragging all the time like i am trying to get my motors started everyday to get through one long stressful yet boring unexciting day i think i am just really really burned out i feel moody and irritable much of the day sometimes i feel like i am in a depression sometimes i just feel like i have no desire to do this i feel like i am doing the same thing over and over i have no contact with the adult world my kids of course are being kids but it would feel nice for someone to realize i am a person with needs too it sounds like you've lost yourself in motherhood don't worry it happens to all of us they don't call it the hardest job in the world for nothing you've already conquered the hard part which is realizing it you need to find ways to make your day less boring and more exciting you really have to force yourself to get out of the house with the kids start off with at least times a week take them to the park take them to play at mcdonald's take them to visit an old friend or a relative this will start to rid the groundhog day feelings mix it up a little go different places just make sure you are getting out while you are out strike up conversations with other mothers that you see open up tell them how you're feeling and i promise you will meet others that are either feeling the same way or used to feel the same way this will give you some much needed adult contact you'll be floored with how many mothers are going through the same exact thing as you don't be afraid to tell them how much you enjoy talking to them and give out your phone number also let them know how you are about calling you'll find someone who will call you once you make some friends with kids your outings will include meeting up with others having them over to your house or going to their house kids are a great way to make friends another thing you need to do is find some way to get some time alone no kids no husband hire a sitter or take the kids to a relatives house while your husband is at work even if it's just a few hours a week time alone will really help get rid of some stress and you'll be a better mother and wife for it don't use the time to be productive just veg out a little take a hike in the woods read a book stare off into space just be you also need to let your husband know how you are feeling you need his help it sounds like he's off working much of the time and i know exactly how that is let him know that when he is home you need family time with him and couple time too make dates go to places where you guys can reconnect as a couple find ways to look forward to the time you can spend together also when he is home let him have alone time with the kids as well so that you can escape a little remember that he needs down time too and arrange for him to have his alone time as well he will really appreciate it my last bit of advice is for you to rediscover your passion what is it that you loved doing before the kids came along are you doing it now do you have a hobby or interest that gets you going if you do start doing it again if you didn't have something before it's time to find out what that is now having something that you love doing is a great way to get you through the day you need something to look forward to kids go to bed at night don't spend that time cleaning or zoning out at the tv use that time to do your hobby that few hours of time before bed while kids are sleeping is like gold to me my passion is music after i put the kids to bed i light some candles pour a glass of wine sit at my piano with headphones on and write songs i love it i look forward to it and i can really tune into the kids knowing that i have this time after they get to sleep if you can do these things i promise you can turn around how you feel in a very short period of time if i had your number i'd call you and check in and make sure you were making changes hang in there and know that you can turn it around and be the most positive influence in your kids life you will also spark some lost passion in your marriage most of all you will start building your sense of self worth again you can do this good luck  The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Avenue Q EastEnders Shaggy dog story Knots Landing About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind W.I.T.C.H.

is there such thing as photographic memory yes some people have this ability to see and remember hundreds and thousands of images etc and be able to recall them when needed eidetic memory photographic memory or total recall is the ability to recall images sounds or objects in memory with extreme accuracy and in seemingly abundant volume the word eidetic comes from the greek word eidos which means image or form eidetic memory can have a very different meaning for memory experts who use the picture elicitation method to detect it eidetic memory as observed in children is typified by the ability of an individual to study an image for approx seconds and maintain a nearly perfect photographic memory of that image for a short time once it has been removed  Eidetic memory Cognitive science Visual memory Digital photography Photography Memory Aphasia False memory Dyslexia Asperger syndrome Computer Picture thinking Astronomy Numerology Image Hypnosis Asteroid Lucid dreaming Scientology beliefs and practices Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Religious studies Extrasolar planet Science Magnetic resonance imaging Infantilism Photograph Digital camera Holography Reincarnation Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Mnemonic Computer forensics Theory of conduct Dream Dune universe Datalore (TNG episode) Idealism Visual sociology General intelligence factor Mnemonic major system Typewriter Great Pyramid of Giza Radar Intelligence quotient Speed of light Determinism Parallax Psychology Radiography Fundamentalism Pinhole camera Modern naval tactics Seismometer Traumatic brain injury Information Digital Wolverine (comics) Literacy Causality Short-term memory Simone Weil Aberration in optical systems Bene Gesserit Burkhard Heim Working memory Doomsday argument Derren Brown Opportunity rover Reading (activity) CPU cache Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child Nintendo GameCube Computed tomography Autistic savant Open cluster Empathy Orders of magnitude (numbers) Drama Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Geographic information system Information warfare Autism Functional magnetic resonance imaging JPEG Greek language Political economy Cheating in Counter-Strike Sabretooth (comics) Athenian democracy Essentialism Surveillance Animal cognition Explosive material Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Prank flash Morse Code Dither Iconic memory Ancient Greek

is having an anxiety attack n mania the same thing really dontcha think answers r fair enough yes i agree but i get them gether at the same time i guess there is some similarity because the person is kind of wired or hyperactive with either one i never really thought of it but i guess it's possible to have a panic attack during a manic episode people can have panic attacks as part of other mental disorders so it seems reasonable i can't remember reading anything that said it wasn't possible i know for certain it's possible to have panic during an anxious or depressed episode because i have experienced both i have had a few episodes where i was kind of giddy or euphoric and it seemed like mania but this never lasted more than a few hours so i don't think that qualifies as a true manic episode the dsm iv does indicate that either depression or mania can include psychotic features psychotic features can either be mood congruent or mood incongruent for example if someone was manic and the psychosis included themes of being god that would be mood congruent while themes of persecution would be mood incongruent because it's not consistent with the euphoric mood of mania i am not trying to say you have psychotic features but it just seems reasonable that someone could have mania with a panic attack if it's possible to have mania with mood incongruent psychotic features  Psychosis Clinical depression Mania DSM-IV Codes Schizophrenia Mixed state (psychology) Haloperidol Panic attack Electroconvulsive therapy Transsexuality Borderline personality disorder Depression (mood) Antipsychotic Adult attention-deficit disorder Schizotypy Meditation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anxiety Charles Darwin's illness Psychopharmacology Psychiatry Mood stabilizer Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Schizoaffective disorder Anorexia nervosa Controversies in autism Clomipramine Personality disorder Chlorpromazine Asperger syndrome Obsessive-compulsive disorder Dissociative identity disorder Agoraphobia Delusion Narcissism Hypomania Fluoxetine Paranoia Psychotherapy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Homophobia Autism Hyperactivity LSD Schizotypal personality disorder Mental illness John Cade Scientology beliefs and practices Insomnia Folie __ deux Amphetamine psychosis Joker (comics) Lorazepam Maprotiline Stroke Post-traumatic stress disorder Involuntary commitment Theory of conduct Postpartum depression Methamphetamine Venlafaxine Cocaine Diazepam Procrastination Cult Phobia Psychoanalysis Manic Street Preachers Sleep Project MKULTRA 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Cannabis (drug) Cognitive therapy Sleep disorder The Ashlee Simpson Show Affective spectrum Psychedelic mushroom Theodicy Paranoid personality disorder Avoidant personality disorder Alignment (role-playing games) Vigabatrin Anger management Therianthropy Social anxiety Telepathy Fluvoxamine Alcoholism Augustus De Morgan Wheel of Fortune Traumatic incident reduction Grammatical mood Summa Theologiae R.

worst and best experience with a psychiatrist i've only seen one who i swear was trying to get me to kill myself by letting me take prozac for months and upping my dosage when i told him the medication was making me so much worse i did try to kill myself but i never say any professionals after that i quit the meds on my own do they get paid more for hospitalizations he worked at a psychward too that's why i wonder i had appointments with him one both were shorter than minutes since that was years ago and i never saw anyone since i have no best impression of a psycho doctor i think when i try meds again and i will i'll just see my gp he usually has about even minutes i just wanted to provide a context to your question that may be helpful i've been a therapist working with severely mentally ill people for about years in both inpatient and outpatient settings most people expect that a psychiatrist is going to be a therapist and when they get only a or minute interview and then get medication prescribed they are disappointed or angry up until about years ago psychiatrists were trained and functioned as both psychotherapists and medication prescribers however in the last years insurance companies figured out that it was cheaper to pay psychiatrists just to prescribe medications during a or minute visit and to have other therapists who cost less provide the minute therapy sessions up until then standard psychiatry visits were an hour long and included both medication and psychotherapy a lot of the psychiatrists fought their loss of the psychotherapy role but they ended up losing this battle while the older psychiatrists say years old or older have training and experience doing therapy ones younger than that may have had very little training in therapy especially in comparison to the training in therapy that use to be standard for psychiatrists instead their training is mostly about diagnosis and medication as well as general physical medicine so they may not be all that empathetic or trained in therapy because the insurance only pays for a brief visit they just get the basic information in sessions needed to determine if you need immediate hospitalization what is your diagnosis what is your general medical condition what medications have you been on before and what did and didn't work for you what side effects have you had from medications before or currently and what medication will the psychiatrist prescribe for you they also are suppose to try to establish a rapport with you in the minutes too that's a lot to figure out in minutes and so while the doctor may want to know if you've had suicidal thoughts or been abused as a child they don't really need to know the details and furthermore just don't have the time given the other things they need to establish in their brief visit with you for therapy and enough time to discuss these things in detail you need to see a therapist as well as a psychiatrist as first of all it is their job to be your therapist and second they will have the time to be able to talk with you in more depth about your own particular circumstance in order to get the best care you want to get a psychiatrist and therapist who share the same office as this way they are more likely to discuss your care and work together although sometimes therapists and psychiatrists who don't share office space will communicate sufficiently by phone to coordinate your care in the real world everyone is superbusy and so the odds are against it therapists would include psychologists clinical social workers or marriage and family therapists your insurance heathcare finder number on insurance id card if you have insurance should be able to direct you to a psychiatrist and therapist who share the same office do psychiatrists get paid more for hospitalizations only to the extent that they have more tasks to do so they get paid more for doing more work i have been in this business years and can't recall even one time where a patient admission was motivated by desire for making money that's out of more than admissions i've been involved with in several psychiatric hospitals in town people are hospitalized because they are a danger to themselves or others or because they can't function in society or because they can't be safely treated in a home environment most psychiatrists today either see patients as outpatients or inpatients so it's somewhat rare these days for the same psychaitrist to treat an individual in both settings most psychiatrists are superbusy and not looking for work and are in fact putting in longer days than they'd like i know there's always an exception somewhere however i can say absolutely that i've never seen a hospitalization take place where the motivation was making money i would strongly urge you not to get psych meds from a primary care doctor because if the medicine doesn't work they don't have the training on how to adjust medication or prescribe adjunct meds i see lots of inpatients who went the route you suggested seeing the general practitioner for meds when the prescribed meds didn't work the gp didn't know what to do next most people who take psych meds will need multiple medication trials and adjustments and the general practitioner just doesn't have the training to do this instead consider getting a psychiatrist and therapist who work in the same office understanding that each has a different role to play in your care you'll get much better care from your question i think you would benefit from medications and therapy and treating your depression with only medicine is not as effective as getting both meds and therapy multiple research studies in the treatment of depression show medications and therapy together work better than just therapy or just medication and since you have a history of trying to kill yourself your depression has been bad enough to be life threatening you shouldn't be messing around with anything less than the most effective treatment good luck to you with good treatment you will be so much better off  National Health Service Medical record Carl Jung Asthma

if you've had a serious episode of depression or mania do you remember that portion of your life clearly i spent the better part of years during and after my freshman year of college severely depressed and experimenting with different medications with my doctor i remember things that happened during that time but not as clearly as things from before the depression it may have been the meds but i think it was the depression anyone else turned out i'm bipolar but i deal almost exclusively with depression and mixed episodes my period with depression was much shorter three months but it was deep i too took some mediction for a month of it but i started to find my way out without it as for what i remember i had been a habitual marijuana user for years prior to my depression and i remember that period of my life much more clearly than when i was depressed i only am able to rekindle memories of those times with smells thus far for instance i don't know why but i was obsessed with the abrasiveness of apricot scrub almost to the point of a masochistic interest when ever i smell it now i am drawn into that place i could see how a leng period of depression could start to warp your memories of events prior i wouldn't doubt the meds play a part of it though especially the experimenting that you had to do  Psychosis Clinical depression Antidepressant Kurt Cobain Lamotrigine Electroconvulsive therapy Theory of conduct Social rule Mixed state (psychology) Sleep Cannabis (drug) Friends Obsessive-compulsive disorder Mental Health Act 1983 Eating disorder Boards of Canada Milton H.

healthier alternative to zoloft i take zoloft mg day and it helps a good bit is there anything non pharmaceutical herbal etc that i could use as an alternative if i decide to stop taking it due to some personal side effects on it for ocd and anxiety but this low dosage has helped a lot i just think about kidney and liver etc damage later on in life i don't want to sacrifice my physical health for my mental health it's not any worse for you than an herbal treatment if you're tolerating it well if you're not tolerating the zoloft why not try another antidepressant i suppose you're getting sexual side effects well there are other options apparently wellbutrin is supposed to help i know when i was taking prozac my sex drive was insanely high so there you go st john's wort is commonly used but like other herbal remedies only helps with mild cases of depression if you're bad enough to need zoloft it probably won't help at all besides just because it's 'natural' doesn't make it safe st john's wort does have plenty of unpleasant side effects and does interact with prescription medications too other herbal 'medications' will have side effects and interactions too you should consider therapy in addition to your medication if you use both your chances of being cured and not needing medications are much higher cbt is suposed to be really good for anxiety  Clinical depression Herbalism St John's wort Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chlorpromazine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clomipramine Bipolar disorder Bupropion Sertraline Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Paroxetine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Maprotiline Diazepam Psychopharmacology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alcoholism Homeopathy Electroconvulsive therapy LSD Psoriasis Multiple sclerosis Fluoxetine Folic acid Borderline personality disorder Venlafaxine Stuttering Paracetamol Psychoanalysis Trimipramine Fibromyalgia Herpes simplex virus Stomach cancer Hepatitis C Anorexia nervosa Vitamin C Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Migraine Cancer Emergency contraception Radiation therapy Ulcerative colitis Propranolol Doxepin Tobacco smoking Addiction Insomnia Autism Transsexuality Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Traditional Chinese medicine Acne Drug addiction Psychiatry Withdrawal Pharmaceutical company Fluvoxamine Medical cannabis Pneumonia Chemical imbalance theory 5-HTP Alternative medicine Torture Kevin Trudeau Premenstrual stress syndrome Off-label use Cocaine Sigmund Freud Premature ejaculation Cannabinoids Theory of conduct Cognitive therapy Tocopherol Cannabis (drug) Natural health Stroke Naturopathic medicine Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Psychiatric hospital Panic attack Patent medicine Psychosurgery Rabies Traumatic brain injury

increase in negative and depressive feelings after drinking alcohol with bipolar ii i was recently diagnosed with bipolar ii and i'm taking lamictal my psychiatrist told me not to frequently drink while taking lamictal i rarely drink but last night i had a margarita one shot jose cuervo i've been feeling wonderful lately but today i'm feeling like my old depressed self could it possibly be from the alcohol even though i'm taking lamictal i heard alcohol may induce rapid cycling meaning it might have caused me to become depressed again does this make sense or does anyone have any information about bipolar ii and alcohol don't drink alcohol if your taking lamictal and your drinking don't you think your defeating the purpose of the treatment your doctor is providing are people who drink happy if your choosing to drink then why take your meds at all one drink or ten doesn't really matter you'll still be depressed edgy moody tempermental the next day you'll be in a funk and it will take a couple days to get over not a hangover funk but rather more of an i don't like how i feel i don't want to deal with anything or anyone and i just don't care type of funk you heard alcohol may induce rapid cycling with the lamictal now you were able to experience it first hand realize this now either save your money don't see the doctor don't take the meds drink it up and be your depressed unhappy self or see your doctor don't drink take your meds and learn to be who you truely are and you'll be okay with that picture this hopefully this makes sense take lamictal to help stabalize yourself two steps forward in the right direction add alcohol five steps backwards not a good thing now you are three steps behind where you originally started and you feel depressed again you don't have the peaceful contentment you did prior to the one drink alcohol took you back to where you were before taking lamictal now you feel the same as you did prior to the treatment and you wonder if the alcohol has something to do with it i would say so your now three feet back further then when you started the good thing is is that you have the opportunity to realize learn you should not drink at all because it will not make you feel good in the long run it put's you right back at square one it is defeating the purpose and it's not who you really want to be good luck  Bipolar disorder Lamotrigine Clinical depression Alcoholism Alcoholics Anonymous Psychosis Addiction Breastfeeding Dead Like Me Humphrey Bogart Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pitaten Schizophrenia Drowning Medicine Obsessive-compulsive disorder Happiness Milton H.

how to talk to counselor about cutting ok to put it plainly i cut like once a week idk if i'm going to get addicted in fact i don't even want to stop i get state a's and my family loves me but i still cut i don't got really any friends well like but iv finally decided to go talk to a school counselor then it hit me how wtf do i just walk in there and be like i'm depressed counsel me i don't think so lol anyone got any ideas ok to specify im im not suicidal and im anot addicted well at least not yet idk i kinda want attention but at the same time i do it for stress i just don't no what to do i don't want to get addicted or anything when i was younger i used to cut too i have over on my body but i've quit cutting for the most part by now since you are only the counsellor will tell your parents about your cutting a lot of counsellors are really silly when it comes to cutting and think it's a suicide attempt or that you'll kill yourself doing it although i've never encountered this personally i've had doctors see my cuts and a psychologist none which made much of a deal about it it was clear i wasn't cutting to kill myself it's really hard to cut 'too deep' and not once did i ever get an infection it's not something that you can get locked up in the psychward for as an adult as a teenager you have like no mental health rights so your parents can get you locked up and even force fed medications on a whim in my experience a psychologist or psychiatrist will like to focus mainly on the issues that cause you to cut yourself cutting on it's own is considered a symptom of an underlying problem not a disorder itself i think they think there's no point in talking about it as a main issue really and i agree it's better to work on the causes of your cutting than worrying about stopping if you focus on the cutting you'll never stop and could even make your problems worse because not being able to quit can cause feelings of guilt shame and helplessness and cutting will be on your mind all the time cutting is a coping mechanism you need to learn better coping mechanisms and keeps on your mind when i was younger i used to really worry about cutting i joined a support group i tried to focus on quitting cutting without worry about my other problems the cutting got worse until i stopped worrying about being a 'cutter' and faced the real issues i think it's probably safer for you to just talk to your school counsellor about your depression issues for now this way you're not risking your parents finding out and all the drama that that may cause or an involuntary hospitalization you say you're depressed so if you work on the depression get help for your depression you should find that you're not cutting as often or even at all  Clinical depression Bipolar disorder Psychotherapy Self-harm Transsexuality Ex-gay Anxiety Adult attention-deficit disorder Suicide EastEnders Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Narcissism Prostate cancer Reparative therapy Medicine Mental illness Autism Procrastination Cult Psychiatry Psychoanalysis Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychosis Hikikomori Borderline personality disorder Methamphetamine Sigmund Freud Psychiatric hospital Obsessive-compulsive disorder Tobacco smoking Anti-psychiatry Breastfeeding Unemployment Drug addiction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma About a Boy Drug abuse Post-traumatic stress disorder Abortion Domestic violence Teenage suicide Grief Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Panic attack Combat stress reaction Anorexia nervosa Stress (medicine) Childbirth Traumatic brain injury Days of our Lives Friends Meditation Controversies in autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Deprogramming Hypnosis Shaggy dog story Mental health Aikido Social rule Antidepressant Fathers' rights Kurt Cobain Psychopharmacology Electroconvulsive therapy Stuttering Involuntary commitment Charles Darwin's illness Medical views of suicide Alcoholics Anonymous Hearing impairment Ethics Sleep Paroxetine The Lovely Bones Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Alzheimer's disease Empathy A Course In Miracles Sex education Exit counseling Goodness and value theory Knots Landing Stomach cancer Sexual addiction Binge eating disorder

should i admit myself to the state hospital im fwwling very suicidal homicidaal and i feel like i should but im drunk and my gf said shed break up w me if i go cuz ive been there alot i dunno wat to dko ne more a girl friend who isn't there for you or support you at the lowest time of your life especially when you're trying to make rightful decisions to help yourself isn't worth your time think about it if she doesn't approve is she better off having you commit suicide if she really loves you and the both of you have a potential for long term dating which can lead to marriage vowes in sickness in health she should actually be concerned and involved in helping you get the help you need she might actually be adding to your problems by giving you more stress to worry about you don't need that right now sit her down and talk to her if she can't see things your way or you guys can't find a middle ground to agree on then she has to go as for your own health i would recommend that you stop getting drunk this is one of the reasons why you're confused don't know what to do more stressed suicidal and can't make decisions although you know your choices well by doing this you'll not only benefit your health you'll be sober enough to make wise decisions based on the situation you're in and how things are also you're probably feeling useless right now which is probably one of the reasons why you're getting drunk in the first place getting back to the state hospital will not help you at all as you already know from being there many times as you mentioned already i believe that you're depressed and it has been going on for a while a psychologist or a psychiatrist might be able to help you get to the root of your depression if you want to know what is causing it if you don't already know this alone isn't enough though because all they would most likely do is put you on some prescibed medication while this might help a little you'll become dependent upon it and so forth i tell you this from experience first hand i've been depressed all my life and started to notice it at the age of i've gone through enough and i've never found a solution until resently i believe that god's extending his hand to you to help you as he's doing to me come to him as you are repent and be saved he is waiting on you to make your move he'll not only heal you from your pains but will as well renew you entirely won't you come to chirst today i'll pray for you and i wish you all the best remain blessed  Friends Clinical depression Procrastination Transsexuality Breastfeeding Ex-gay Alcoholics Anonymous Kodocha Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Prostate cancer Euthanasia Psychiatric hospital Fathers' rights EastEnders Suicide Divorce Theodicy Theory of conduct Jon Secada Reparative therapy Ethics Bipolar disorder Anorexia nervosa Shaggy dog story About a Boy Hillary Rodham Clinton Eastern Orthodox Church Abortion Maison Ikkoku Same-sex marriage Humphrey Bogart Drug abuse Cult Arguments for and against drug prohibition Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meditation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

anxiety leading to suicidal thoughts i've always had anxiety problems but for the past months or so the anxiety has given away to suicidal urges i haven't attempted obviously because i'm afraid of having my boyfriend find me half dead all i've ever wanted is access to a gun now my boyfriend wants to buy one i tried to tell him but he thinks i'm just making it up so he won't get one i won't slit my wrists because of the time it takes to bleed out no jumping off buildings because i could just ruin my body not overdosing on pills because i've known people who have tried someone tell me how to get him not to buy a gun i am treated for anxiety there is something called an anxiety based depression i have it and yes it does lead to suicidal thoughts if not treated get yourself to a doctor and get help you will be surprised how an antidepressant just makes you feel calm and normal if you are to the point of suicidal thoughts then probably all thoughts are negative think how nice it will be to just enjoy life and enjoy being yourself and liking yourself again depression gives you a false perspective of yourself and your surroundings little things seem unsurmountable and everything seems like hard work hope you reach out and will be ok  Clinical depression Antidepressant Sigmund Freud Bipolar disorder Maprotiline Cognitive therapy Diazepam Psychoanalysis Anorexia nervosa Suicide methods About a Boy EastEnders Clomipramine Panic attack Borderline personality disorder Doxepin Paroxetine Paranoia Agent Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bupropion Behavioral therapy Procrastination Obsessive-compulsive disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Alprazolam Insomnia Stuttering Escape from New York Drug addiction Chronic fatigue syndrome Phoebe Halliwell Teenage suicide Infantilism Sertraline Fluoxetine Sedative George Costanza Kurt Cobain One Tree Hill (TV series) Chlorpromazine Alcoholism The Virgin Suicides Venom (comics) The Catcher in the Rye Bully Shaggy dog story Tricyclic antidepressant Boom Town (Doctor Who) Columbine High School massacre Menstrual cycle Enneagram Self-harm Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ex-gay Meditation Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychiatric hospital The Inside Tianeptine Knots Landing Arguments for and against drug prohibition Autism Ludwig Wittgenstein Electroconvulsive therapy Neighbours Piccolo Junior Saga Citalopram Dead Like Me Caffeine Psychotherapy Kingdom Hospital Ten Commandments Traumatic brain injury Unemployment Hypnosis Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Iris Chang Just Like That Stroke General anxiety disorder Medical views of suicide Avenue Q Sant Thakar Singh Opioid Everwood Methylphenidate Very special episode Sexual dysfunction St John's wort Alexander Technique Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind StarCraft: Uprising Theory of conduct Hormone replacement therapy (trans) 2005 Bali bombings

i haven't been myself lately i can't figure out why i am unconnected all the sudden i felt like i was going into a depression but instead of letting it take the best of me i fought it this is a normal part of my life but now i have completely lost interest in everything my sex drive is gone nothing is funny i'm not happy or sad but from what i am told i'm just straight up mean and i don't quite understand it or know how to go along dealing with this oh and i did just start using a different kind of birth control pill within the last couple weeks which is contributing to this also i used to party alot and use drugs all the time but i met a man about years ago that i loved enough to stop doing it all so i have been sober years and i guess i kinda feel like i'm peddling backwards i'm actually starting to think that i was alot better of a person when i did drugs i wasn't so high strung bitchy mean and so serious about everything i don't have the money to go back to a counsler what do i do i have questions for you are you sober like going to meetings sober or are you abstinent from drugs and alcohol without support if you don't have the support your emotions will always default to the way you used to think and feel it never fails if you do go to meetings and have a good support network then this is just a part of your growth process in sobriety i went through the same thing at about years sober i stopped going to meetings and i became an angry bastard worse than i was when i was drinking luckily i got back to meetings before i drank got the support i needed and the emotional growth continued also if you stopped using for some guy you probably didn't grow emotionally like you would if you got sober for yourself first and then got into a relationship finally don't underestimate the power of the pill talk to your gyno and see if you can change it up  Alcoholics Anonymous Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Friends Happiness Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind EastEnders Motivation Alcoholism The Smoking Room Theory of conduct Narcissism Milton H.

why don't i feel anything when people die my father died when i was and i remember running into my room and locking the door because i did not want no one to see that i was not crying but the thing is while i was still shocked i was thinking about what i was going to wear to school the next day or how much more freedom i could have and he was not even a bad father and i never gave him any problems but in general when i hear that someone has died i just don't feel anything and i sometimes get an urge to laugh when i see the way some people carry on crying this is something i am very embarassed and ashamed of and i hate being this way i am now and i am a little better at showing sympathy but some of the ways are still here honestly is there something wrong with me do i need help also i have a problem telling people i love them no matter who it is i feel it but i just can't say it my year old nephew told me he loves me and i could not say it back i feel so ashamed please any advice no there is nothing wrong with you it shows that you served your purpose to them gave them a good time during their lifetime and they died loving you if you knew em your strong it doesn't mean you have to cry to show something my grandma died at the age of i smiled the whole funeral i wasn't cruel i knew my grandma wanted me to live a good life she always told me to look left and right for cars when crossing the street watch out for creeps i helped her up whenever she fell down i didn't cry because i knew i was there all the time for her and i served my purpose for being there for her i smiled because i gave it my all to live her life till the last of her remaining days you are probably the same however this doesn't mean that your heartless emotions die but it doesn't mean we can't show emotions but in this case you may feel something but you can't say it back because you are either shocked or happy about it and your emotions temporarily break down and you can't say anything but stand there and smile at them or just stare at em to conclude this there is nothing wrong with you it means you are a strong person and you love your family and friends very much  Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Social rule Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Knots Landing Friends Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Real Love (song) Good Times Futurama (TV series - season 5) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time Out of Mind The Smoking Room Obi-Wan Kenobi Coming of Age (TNG episode) 10 Things I Hate About You Night (book) Avenue Q Grandview, U.S.A.

how do i raise my self esteem up i have very low self esteem because im overweight and i like this boy who like me but i don't want to talk to him because i don't like the way i look and i wish he could wait for me but i know that won't happen so how do increase it p s do u think he will wait know that you are beautiful and totally awesome no matter how much you weight physical beauty fades for most of us so focus more on strengthening and beautifying the person within because boys may come and go standards of beauty may change but you are stuck with yourself until the day you die and if you validate your self worth through others or society in general you will never be happy i've been there and done that never let others have that much control over you attraction and love is always greater and more pure when the opposite sex is able to love more about you than your attractiveness if you are to loose weight and boast your self esteem do it for yourself and your health not some boy or man once you develop a strong self esteem and are comfortable in your own skin men who are actually worth a damn will naturally come to you take a look at yourself in the mirror and or write down qualities that you like about yourself and what you wish to change develop a plan to change or work on those things but realize that change does not happen over night best of luck sweetie  Obesity Jon Secada Puberty Social rule Transsexuality Sexual attraction Love Gay slang Sexual orientation Anne Rice Inflation Human sexual behavior Urinary incontinence Self-esteem Human Objectivist philosophy Simone Weil Gay Summa Theologiae Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Microeconomics The Inside Pitaten Phaedo Paradox Ex-gay The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex George Abbott AFI 100 Years series Theory of conduct Milton H.

my mother has got depression how to solve it she doesnt have showers since the past days she sleeps alot she makes food and then she doesnt clean up the kitchen she goes out with her friend and talk about the same thingg and she stinks you have a funny avatar here you go you must let her read this if possible how to get out of a depression you're depressed for whatever reason you're tired of coping and you want out getting back on track can often appear impossible but with the right attitude it rarely is so long as you know how steps have the will to get out many depressed people remain so simply out of a lack of the will to want to get out attaining this will may require focus if so focus you need to have the confidence that you're capable of changing and the motivation to buckle down and change otherwise you won't get anywhere establish a clear understanding of what made you depressed was it the break up are you unsure about your career self worth many people remain unhappy because they attribute their unhappiness to the wrong things or to nothing at all social pressure can often keep you from even questioning your happiness about certain things be honest with yourself or you wont even know what to move on from change your state of affairs if you're unhappy and want to become happy something about your life clearly needs to change for many people this means their surroundings are you still living in the small town that caused your feeling's of rural inadequacy move are you still working at the company that gives you no sense of meaning whatsoever quit are you still in the relationship that is making you feel manipulated break up this may seem trivial but it's often the most overlooked obstacle between you and you're satisfaction gain some perspective you have access to the internet that places you well above the social circumstances of the majority of the world there's a point at which you simply have to accept that your happiness is your own responsibility and it's comprised of the decisions you make everything in your life capable of breaking is going to at some point you've got hands fix them seek help from a mental health professional many studies prove that talk therapy helps with depression to get the most out of talk therapy you need to find a therapist that you like and trust and work with him or her over a longer period of time it doesn't have to be years but don't expect that serious depression will evaporate without some consistent work on your part cost doesn't have to be a barrier most cities have reduced fee clinics and many universities offer help through their psychology training programs tips wake up earlier or later your problem may just be the way you're managing your day waking up earlier may make you feel more productive and lucent waking up later may make you feel freer and more alive figure out which one you need and adjust or buy your alarm get a pet having something alive depend on you can make you feel needed and consequently valuable it also provides you with something to love which though not a surrogate can do a lot for you if loneliness or rejection is the cause of your depression improve some aspect of yourself one obvious way to improve your sense of self worth is to improve your self worth learn more about a field of knowledge language or instrument go to the gym help out in the community go to or back to school even if these things don't work you'll at the very least become a better person for it don't take yourself too seriously all in all there may be more important and interesting things in the world than yourself especially if you're young and aren't supporting a family chill out you might be missing a good joke in all of this warnings let a doctor decide if your depression is clinical and don't lie to him or her so you can get anti depressants if you aren't clinically depressed and you take medication for it you may run the risk of permanently damaging yourself  Clinical depression Social rule Theory of conduct Reparative therapy Scientology beliefs and practices Hypnosis Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social psychology Prostate cancer Autism Second language acquisition Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Chronic fatigue syndrome Milton H.

can't get rid of my black dog as winston churchill used to describe his bouts depression my metaphoric black dog follows me around everywhere i am especially depressed at the fact that i can't make meaningful friendships or even have a relationship with a girl i'm in my 's and i don't see any point in living i am very lonely and it hurts to see so many people enjoying life and i can't my black dog never leaves my side he never goes away when i want him to nothing i do ever seems to help i don't want to go through more years of this all it takes is one pull of the trigger and its done no more pain and i won't go to hell because i am forgiven i don't think that jesus would refuse to forgive me because i chose to take my own life he wouldn't be happy with me but he wouldn't condemn me i've already had all my sins forgiven so give me a good reason to stay alive on this stupid earth ok before i go any further i have to say that i completely empathize with where you are although i am several years older than you and have dealt with this same issue off and on for most of my life and actually am dealing with it pretty seriously right now as well i just wanted to say that so you would know that i hear you loud and clear what is keeping me here is the knowledge i have that god loves me and he loves me so much that he sent his son to die just for me that alone tells me how much i'm worth having said that it's still not easy right so what to do first you have to know that so many of us are out there going through exactly what you are going through which makes me so angry that the enemy of us all is having such a field day messing with our minds and trying to make us do something to take away that incredible gift of life that we have been given by the one who loves us beyond our comprehension you have to also realize that you are in a war while you are here on earth you are in a war for your very soul you have to put on the full armor of god to prepare for this war and get in there and fight how you do this and i'm talking to myself as i write these words is to constantly fill your mind with the word of god as that is the only truth on earth that is real and genuine and powerful whenever you hear something in your mind that is negative push it aside with a truth from god for me my verse that i have clinged to to the point where my fingers are bloody is jeremiah jeremiah for i know the plans i have for you says the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future whenever i think i just can't go on another second i remind myself of this promise that i have been given and actually it is your promise also and i know that every word is true and will come to pass no matter how long i have to hang in there and fight i could go on and on but i'm at work and can't really take the time but i just happened to see your question and something inside of me felt this pull to try to put into words what i have been going through and how i've been doing it not only for your benefit but for mine as well so all i can really say to you and me is to never quit never give up and never ever forget how much you are loved and not alone it is my belief that there are heavenly beings all around us trying to help us in our struggles if we will just let them you do not want the enemy to win give god a chance to bring to pass what he has promised you for your life he loves you more than you will ever know this side of heaven you are worth everything to him and i am sure that there are people in your life who also love you and would be devastated if you were to take your own life you are valuable my friend as am i  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Divine grace Jon Secada Simone Weil Summa Theologiae Sola

is it safe to tell okay so i talk to our school psychologist on a regular basis now and i have become really comfortable with talking to her the thing is i was raped about two months ago and i really need to tell someone if i do tell her is she like legally required to tell that to like someone higher up or my parents or will it stay between the two of us you counselor is mandated by law meaning she can be fined if she does not report abuse however there are many variables here it depends on whether this was date rape someone under age or if it was rape by a caretaker if it was a caretaker then child protective services would investigate with the police if it was someone under age then the juvenile authorities would have to know however you counselor has to obey the law of course you could report without giving the name if you even know the name but she will encourage you to report it however you really should not hold this in it saddens me that you can't talk to your parents but rape is never the victims fault it is all about control for some reason the perpatrator needs control and if he she did it once they will do it again to someone else always remember if this happens it should be report right away so evidence can be collected if there is no evidence then it becomes your word against theirs if the perpatrator still has access to you it will happen again if you keep quiet if he does not have access then he will do it to another it is very important to not feel guilty and like you caused it because it is always a problem within the perpatrator it is not how you dressed or where you were  Rape Domestic violence Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Probation officer Child sexuality Abortion debate Child abuse Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child sexual abuse Status of religious freedom in Sudan Abortion Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Divorce Torture Abortion in the United States Deprogramming Terri Schiavo Scientology beliefs and practices Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Capital punishment Arguments for and against drug prohibition Transsexuality Infantilism Breastfeeding Autism Marriage Affirmative action Pornography Rosa Parks Fathers' rights Statutory rape Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 Miranda warning Satanic ritual abuse USA PATRIOT Act Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Serial killer French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Human sexual behavior Property (ownership right) Female genital cutting Charter school The Lovely Bones Karla Homolka Age of consent Children of God Narcissism Child Gun politics Pedophilia Sexual abuse Drug abuse Psychoanalysis Education in the United States Traumatic incident reduction Ted Kennedy Ethics Same-sex marriage James Hanratty Criminal justice system of Japan Plan de S__nchez massacre Scientology Hypnosis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Trademark Luke and Laura Spencer Women in Islam Parental Alienation Syndrome Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Theodicy Causality Plame affair Marc Dutroux History of British nationality law Schapelle Corby Grief Democracy Information warfare Convention on Psychotropic Substances Columbine High School massacre Dissociative identity disorder Jizya Prostate cancer Vernon Schillinger Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Childbirth Drug test Teenage suicide United Nations Protection Force Murder Polyamory Appeal

when life and particularly work become too much is it better to face it down or step off the treadmill for a while i am talking stress anxiety eventual depression carlyan thank you for your lovely considerate and kind answer think you may have the tomorrow if you know what i mean learn relaxation techniques and practice them regularly to reduce stress however if it is past that then sometimes it is necessary to step off the treadmill if only for a short time here are a few tips minute relaxation technique at work or at home whether you work in a crowded office or in the home there are ways to grab a little relaxation during the course of the day again this starts with making the decision to take a few minutes for yourself find an herbal tea you like now you don't have to like to drink it we are more concerned with aroma it gives off let it sit for a moment and feel the relaxation response you body has to the warm smells slip on the headphones and let the music play low if you can slip off your shoes under the desk and stretch your toes this can add a little extra pleasure to this relaxation technique take a moment to feel your breathing for this to work you can't sit there thinking of problems just enjoy the moment of your own company breathing exercises to do at work to minute relaxing exercise on your commute sit up straight be aware of your back and shoulders breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth at first this can fell odd but with time will become more natural feel the way your body responds to the deep breaths how your chest and shoulders move you will be amazed how with time this practice can dissolve tension listen to some relaxing music the great thing about relaxation music is that it will not distract the mind after time and a few listens the music will act as a barrier to distractions you will forget that it is there at all whether you are stuck in traffic or on a pact bus train a few minute is all you need remember if you are driving always drive carefully this exercise is not designed to make you sleepy but help focus your mind at the start of the day and relax it at the end the inner pleasure you will feel when you see everybody else struggling through there frustration will reset and recharge your mind will be wonderful relaxation therapy and easy techniques min to one hour relaxation exercise lighting is important for relaxation therapy soft low lighting from lamps or even candles aroma your favorite smells can have a huge impact on what you feel experiment with different blends of fragrances to see what suits you best scented candles come in various combinations or single aromas music of course is wonderful for therapy purposes it can fill a room even at low volume allowing you to focus on other things while it completes the relaxing experience a basin of warm water with some foot salts can be a beautiful addition feel the tension slip into the ground as you soak your feet if you have the time or a locked bathroom is the only place in the house you can get some me time a full soak in a hot bath is even better remember this is your time you have to lay down the law with your loved ones this is your time it will not take long but you are not to be disturbed even better would be to do it while there is nobody else around the main thing with all these relaxation exercises is to experiment and find out what works best for you you are the best judge when it comes to your own relaxation  Aikido Massage Stuttering Social rule Milton H.

childhood abuse and dealing with it when i was years old i was abused and raped by a priest this went on for years because as the priest told me no one would believe me he was right for two years i begged and pleaded with my parents to no avail i finally convinced my grandfather who took me to a doctor and he verified the abuse this was in the 's and the laws were not the same as now my doctor and my parents decieded the best thing would be for me to just forget about it my grandfather died a week later of a heart attack and my parents then decieded it would be a good idea to beat the living crap out of me on a daily basis all of this i found out about months ago i went into therapy for depression and remembered this i have since verified the incident with the only two family members still alive and they both confirm it happened i'm now very upset and mad and all the people invoolved are dead the priest my parents the doctor any ideas on how to move on i am now and confused i had recovered memories of sexual abuse too at age to me it was like getting my life turned upside down and a whole new history shaken out of my pockets unsettling to say the least all my relationships were called into question how could so much horrible abuse have happened to me and i didn't remember it why didn't anybody recognize what trouble i was in and help me so questioning strong emotions and confusion are all pretty common after remembering something like this i'm glad you got confirmation at least you don't have to question that are you still seeing your therapist if you have a good relationship with them and they seem to be helpful i'd stick with them if not i'd seek out somebody who has experience working with trauma and sexual abuse there's a lot of good information out there doing some research is probably a good idea to help you get a better understanding of trauma and its effects you might want to look for a support group for survivors of sexual abuse possibly even for survivors of clergy abuse lastly i think people recover memories because on some deep level they feel ready to deal with them now your mind has its own healing process pay attention to it and treat yourself kindly this is tough stuff to deal with i'm wishing you good luck  False memory Milton H.

manic depression can anyone tell me what manic depression is and has anyone suffered from it thanks xx i do it's hard to explain this sight doesn't quite hit the nail on the head but start here honey most people have moods that swing from sadness to happiness in the person who suffers from manic depression these moods swings are greatly exaggerated there are two features to this disorder the depressive phase often arises out of the blue and with no obvious cause the depression is quite profound and often associated with guilt feelings which centre on something that may have happened in the past the person's judgement is impaired and so he does not believe himself to be ill the manic phase is often the opposite of the depressive phase the patient becomes elated and has far more energy than normal he often stays up all night not because he can't sleep but because he has so much to do he is very talkative and speaks fast he often has several ideas but often loses his train of thought he has great optimism and blind faith and enormous self confidence sometimes believing himself capable of irrational deeds this belief in himself can lead to spending a great deal of money on impractical projects he is less inhibited and sometimes remarks made can offend or hurt relatives or friends he does not appear to recognise that he is ill or that his behaviour is irrational if challenged about this he can often become impatient irritable and angry some sufferers have both manic and depressive illnesses at different times while others just have a manic phase the phases may last for weeks or months and there is a tendency for them to recur and become more frequent with age how does manic depression occur the cause of this condition is not known some people think that the underlying illness is depression and that the manic phase is purely a defensive reaction against the depression others believe that there is an undiscovered chemical cause for this disorder hereditary factors may play a part and it can certainly run in families why does manic depression occur it is not clear why the disorder may have been brought on sometimes there is an obvious external trigger such as disappointment or stress at work treatment involved for manic depression sometimes admission to hospital is considered necessary in milder cases treatment may be started at home treatment is mainly in the form of drugs in the depressive phase antidepressants are used the main drugs used here are known as tricyclic antidepressants electroconvulsive therapy ect is used occasionally when the depression is very severe and when there has been no response to drugs in the manic phase a group of drugs known as the major tranquillizers or neuroleptic drugs are particularly useful these drugs are often used in the short term to calm the agitated person examples of these are chlorpromazine and haloperidol lithium priadel is particularly useful in manic depression this drug appears to lower mood in the manic phase and lessens the frequency and extent of the mood swings it is therefore more often used to prevent further recurrences during treatment for manic depression although side effects are common with antidepressant drugs they are not usually too troublesome they consist mainly of drowsiness blurred vision dry mouth and constipation these tend to decrease after a few days of starting the medication the major tranquillizers can also cause excessive drowsiness and sedation they can also cause trembling restlessness and uncontrollable movements these resemble the symptoms of parkinson's disease sometimes severe muscle spasms or cramps can occur these particular side effects can be controlled and prevented by giving anticholinergic drugs at the same time they reduce the action of a substance in the brain called acetylcholine the commonest drug used in this group is procyclidine which may be taken by mouth or by injection anticholinergic drugs can cause dryness of the mouth and blurring of vision lithium has the potential for side effects and therefore its dose is usually monitored by regular blood tests to measure the amount of the drug in the blood if the dose is not carefully maintained side effects such as trembling nausea diarrhoea speech difficulties and unsteadiness can occur lithium can produce an unusual condition of excessive urination and thirst it may also affect the function of the thyroid gland reducing its activity if manic depression is left untreated although there is a natural tendency for this condition to get better the consequences that arise out of the behaviour of the patient may be serious in the manic phase it is possible that behaviour may lead to serious financial and marital problems which may be difficult to reverse furthermore there is a potential risk of attempted suicide in the depressive phase it is therefore recommended that help is sought early effects on family of manic depression this is a very distressing condition for relatives and friends the depressive phase can obviously be very worrying and the irrational behaviour in the manic phase can sour relationships exhaust the family and lead to serious financial concerns family and friends have an enormous role to play in the treatment of these sufferers and will need to work closely with the doctors sadly the patient may refuse treatment either in the form of medication or admission to hospital tactful advice may be more acceptable from relatives than from a doctor sometimes the behaviour of the manic depressive becomes so worrying that compulsory admission to hospital may be required

am i a bad person i worry if an action i take could cause a horrible reaction like if i call my mom and she happens to be driving i don't want my call to cause her to crash or if i accidently snap at someone i don't want to make them upset and sometimes i accidently do make people upset i worry that people may do something like hurt themselves or someone else because of any action i take or a if i wake my brother up a bit early for school he'll perform worse and fail a test or the class i don't know what to do does doing these things make me a bad person could i worry that anything i do could hurt someone and i don't want that to happen i'm talking small actions like a i mentioned above i'm not saying i do anything extreme like hurt people i just worry if small everyday actions could hurt my loved ones and if im a bad person for thinking this or doing these things brandon for a while when i was younger i too used to think about such things now many years later i have realized that there are things in the universe which control the destiny of every one of us it is true that we must be responsible for not only our acts but also our thoughts as they influence our choices human shoulders were never made to carry the burden of worrying about every thing we do it is obvious that you care a great deal about the others in your life which is a very good thing try thinking only positive thoughts about those you love and quit worrying worry is a destructive emotion and in my experience carries no benefits whatsoever the universe will unfold exactly as it is supposed to try to enjoy your life and the time you spend with your loved ones they will pass from this world at the appointed time whenever that might be make the most of what little time we have here and try not to carry too many deep concerns everything will be ok you will see peace be unto you will  Theory of conduct Evil One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule God Emperor of Dune Philosophical skepticism Earth Girl Arjuna John Howard Yoder Jon Secada Social psychology The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Jiddu Krishnamurti Meaning of life Predestination The nature of God in Western theology Karma Meme Avenue Q Abortion debate Milton H.

what can i do for this young women literally just a few minutes ago from writing this question a young women walked through the door of my apartment building hysterical and crying and told me she was raped she came to me for comfort and asked that i not leave her so i held her until some people got the police over the cops said that i should return to my room while they speak to her when they came to my room they told me that they believe that she had not been raped recently but this was a sudden 'triggered' response which was probably the result of post tramatic stress disorder i know her first name but can't seem to find her university profile on facebook we are both students or at least i think she is a student i have no idea if she has any family support or anyone to get through this it is clear that her roommate is mentally ill and can't provide much solice for her i want to walk back up to her room later and ask her how she is doing any reason why i shouldn't or is this a bad idea i don't know there is no way she can accuse me of raping her the cops saw her coming to me for comfort they would never believe such an accusation that's assuming she would do such a thing which i know is not the case this is the real thing i can just tell how sacry triggers can be very disturbing and hard for both the survivor and who witnesses it i would go up especially if she really doesnt have a room mate that isnt there i wouldnt worry about getting too forward just letting her know that you were concerned for her and if she is ok and if your comfortable with it leave the door open to further friendship let her bring it up dont press it being there is worth a million times more than you could ever know to a survivor going through the healing processes check out rainn see what they have for rape crisis ctrs in your area rape sexual abuse is painful and many many survivors dont start doing healing work or even remembering that they were assaulted until they are triggered i would be ready with a list of resources rainn is a good place to start theres also several other really good web based survivor sites that you can pass onto her when shes ready read that as when she asks welcome to barbados after silence and surviving to thriving are all amazing empowering sites most have parts to them for supporters of survivors thank you for being with her  Rape Sin City The Inside Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Post-traumatic stress disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Friends Katelyn Faber Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Silent Night, Deadly Night 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Traumatic incident reduction The Invisibles Milton H.

i forget things quick not that my memory is bad but recalling the recent past is the difficulty i'm just as far as my memory is concerned i remember things that had happened even those of my childhood but instances when i forget that i had to keep that certain thing back at its place or dry the shower place after shower or what i had to buy in the market happen a lot damn to much and due to that i always get scolding from my mom and dad please help gratitude in advance forgetfulness can be from a lot of different things stress being overtired not eating properly or having a lot going on are some of the most common using certain drugs or substances your elders might call drugs but your peers might not can also cause memory loss such as what you describe try to see if any of these things are true about you then seek to modify those things and see if your memory doesn't improve also something i have found helpful is if i am forgetting things such as the grocery needs i actually do make a list it won't help you with the shower curtain but it can help you not come to the end of each day saying to yourself rats i forgot to do can you talk with your parents about your concerns are you doing ok in school how about when you are with your friends are you having the same forgetfulness with them if your memory for recent events is functioning even in one setting then it is not a matter of something wrong with your brain which i am assuming may be the reason you have posted this question there can be other causes but it is best to check and eliminate the simplest ones first and generally if you are getting along ok in most of your life and it sounds rather like you are perhaps this is a case of normal forgetfulness we forget stuff from time to time doesn't mean there is anything wrong and you are looking just a wee bit too close and worrying just a bit more than you need to be it may just be that if you relax a bit with yourself and try not to focus on your possible memory problem you will find the problem goes away on its own absent the above causes memory issues in a year old are thankfully very very rare  Social rule Infantilism CPU cache Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Philosophy of language False memory Pitaten Avenue Q Hey Jude Shit Out-of-body experience IBM PC compatible Computer virus Transsexuality Second language acquisition Hypnosis Time Out of Mind Mediation Equine conformation Victor Cousin Philosophical skepticism Halting problem Sin City Prostate cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Traumatic incident reduction Drug test Stuttering Kimi Finster Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Kim Possible Genetically modified food Blood (computer game) Extreme Programming Intelligence quotient Modem Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) Debugging Spanish verbs Deconstruction Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fathers' rights Scenes from a Memory Intersex surgery Multiple sclerosis Transformation problem Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Amnesia Memory The Fairly OddParents English grammar Humphrey Bogart Cerebral palsy Garfield Fecal incontinence K' Poker jargon Milton H.

depression question i have depression and i've noticed that i don't wanna take my meds for it i think i wanna stay sad and miserable is this normal is it just another symptom of the depression please no rude answers yup its normal your mind is a funny thing we like to sit and stew in our misery but the problem here is the mind will continue to make the chemicals that help you feel depressed if you keep focusing on those feelings meds also are not always the solution often a change of mindset is required and it can be done i know because i have personally gone through it see what you can do by speaking to a therapist and look into something called cognitive therapy  Clinical depression Autism Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis Meditation Milton H.

any advice one helping my husband deal with my mood swings i have been diagnosed with bi polar disorder and my husband is a mental health nurse but constantly escalates rows this was years ago but my husband is becomming worse and worse at dealing with this i feel he mentally bullies me and mocks my illness aswell as threatening and being intimidating towords me just yesterday he has threatened to beat me up when he gets pissed he promptly went to the pub and came back with his friends and acted as if nothing has happened meanwhile he has reduced me to a state of extreme anxiety i am trying to protect my children ans he knows i wont call the police as we have had social service involvement in the past he jokes about it like 'see you at the conference' and becomes really spiteful don't get me wrong i argue right back but it is usually like a nervous energy as deep down i am petrified of this man but don't know if i can cope on my own any advice please i don't have family up here so it is not an option i had to reluctantly move up here as he ran away with one of the children as i could not bear for them to be parted and i have a frosty relationship with the in laws who think it's all my fault when i know it's only partly me the first sentence of your question is very revealing you ask how you can help your husband deal with your mood swings you then describe his casual cruelty towards you and by definition to his children who presumably witness the hostility between the two of you i hate to make judgements but this sounds like a destructive relationship and you sound understandably very unhappy and frightened my own view is that if life has become intolerable you need to change it change can be very frightening but you have only one life and you deserve some peace and happiness obviously women's aid are a very good organisation also your local council should be able to advise you about alternative housing the other big idea would be to ask your husband to leave surely to be on your own is preferable to this living hell all this conflict with your husband is almost certainly not your fault hold on to that belief good luck and i wish you well x  Rape Transsexuality EastEnders Divorce Theory of conduct Chronic fatigue syndrome Charles Darwin's illness Homophobia Asperger syndrome Recurring South Park characters Domestic violence Clinical depression Abortion debate Borderline personality disorder Meme Discordianism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Social rule Karen Horney Franz Boas Appeal Reparative therapy Stuttering Polyamory Pedophilia Sin City Torture Psychiatric hospital Narcissism Hikikomori Pitaten Adult attention-deficit disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Free will Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Schizophrenia Medicine Cult Ethics Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Boston Public Capital punishment 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Hip hop rivalries Dissociative identity disorder Daredevil Humphrey Bogart Combat stress reaction Marriage Friends Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Philosophy of language Moral Politics Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Knots Landing Shaggy dog story National Institutes of Health Psychotherapy Dead Like Me Alcoholics Anonymous Theodicy Russian joke Evil Psychosis Autism Insanity defense Babe Ruth Satanic ritual abuse Political correctness Transactional analysis Mark Latham Scientology beliefs and practices Post-traumatic stress disorder Traumatic incident reduction Germaine Greer Vernon Schillinger Traumatic brain injury Human David Hume Spanking Internet troll Hypoglycemia

very happy and during the time when she went to go get lunch and got back to me my mood had completlel changed i lost all intrest in the day and didn't even care about anything anymore and what confuses me is nothing happened to trigger these feelings i was just sitting there and it just hit me it happens all the time and it's really starting to worry me plus i have nightmares all the time and i think there are people in my head i'm not kidding they told me their names and everything and we just sort of talk some times one yells at me and is really cold hearted and the other one talks to me like a counseler or something and there's like two more but they barely ever speak i get angry really easily for no reason like someone will ask me a question and i'll just go off and so people tend to not want to get close to me which is fine with me because i really don't care for the human race but also i do i have very different feelings and i feel like i am two people but it's all so confusing does anyone know how to fix this problem mood disorders affective disorders depression mania bipolar disorder the fundamental abnormality of an affective disorder is a disturbance of mood either depression or mania depression is by far the commoner most patients who have manic symptoms are also prone to depressive episodes but the reverse does not apply in a few cases depressive and manic symptoms occur simultaneously or in rapid succession mixed affective state bipolar disorder cause of mood disorders affective disorders depression mania bipolar disorder genetic factors have some role in bipolar disorder environmental factors like loss of mother before age or more children under living at home lack of confiding relationship lack of employment etc are known to play a significant role in mood disorders physical illness a physical illness can be followed by depression esp those like cancer aids and heart diseases etc which carry serious implications also mood changes can occur after infectious mononucleosis or influenza and other viral illness depression or mania could be the presenting feature of cerbrovascular disease neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis parkinsonism and endocrine diseases such as cushing's syndrome addison's disease and hypothyroidism mood changes can also be associated with drug therapy for eg corticosteroids beta adrenoceptor antagonists and other anti hypertensive drugs when mood disorder results directly from physical causes they are known as organc affective disorders personality some depressives have personality characteristics which are thought to predispose to the illness this involves a negative attitude to oneself the outside world and the future the term 'cognitive triad' ha been applied to these attitudes signs and symptoms of depression depression of mood is the primary symptom there may be a diurnal variation of mood depression being most distressing early in the morning or at the end of the day loss of pleasure in life anhedonia loss of interest in oneself and others low self esteem self blame hopelessness suicidal thinking feeling of guilt and worthlessness sleep disturbance initial insomnia early morning wakening or hypersomnia poor concentration fatigue headache and other pains anorexia loss of appetite weight changes constipation reduced libido all these symptoms may not be present in any single person and the level of intensity of symptoms vary from person to person mood disorders affective disorders depression mania bipolar disorder how diagnosis is made the diagnosis is usually done clinically based on the signs and symptoms homeopathic treatment for depression homeopathy offers very good treatment possibilities for depression with good results there are large number of medicines which can be used and the selection of medicine depends not just on the symptoms but also on the cause depression is a manifestation of the disorder and to treat the manifestation it is necessary to find the cause the success of treatment in such cases often depends on the ability of a homeopath to find the cause the selection of medicine depends a lot on it like all psychological disorders depressive illness also requires good case study and continuous monitoring by a competent homeopath one should not try any form of self medication in qualified and experienced hands homeopathy offers good prognosis in this condition some of the commonly indicated medicines are anacardium arsenic alb aurum met ignatia acid phos pulsatilla natrum mur sepia antim crud naja nux vom stann psorinum etc the selection of medicine varies from case to case conventional treatment for depression antidepressant drugs cognitive therapy and electro convulsive therapy are used what else can i do accessory management visit a psychotherapist or join a support group where you can talk about your emotions freely be more open with your family and friends do not hide your feelings share them try to remain actively involved in some work job exercise daily it not only is good for your body but also for your mind exercise is known to increase the level of many neuro hormones which bring a feeling of well being and happiness eat a well balanced and nutritious diet with ample fluids learn some meditation yoga or stress relieving exercises these help a lot in regaining your control over your emotions signs and symptoms of mania sense of well being evident as elation or ecstasy confidence and self esteem are high grandiose ideas without any substance thoughtless and risky behavior delusion of being especially gifted or of being well connected thoughts come rapidly speech is fast physical activity is increased appetite is initially increased but may be decreased later sleep hours are reduced but this does not cause fatigue promiscuity may occur homeopathic treatment mania homeopathy offers many medicines which work in such cases in experienced hands the long term prognosis is good some of the medicines commonly used are belladona stramonium varatum alb hyoscamus cuprum met nux vomica tarentula syphilinum lachesis arsenic cocaine coffea platina etc there are many more medicines and the selection of medicine varies from case to case the cause and past history of a person play a significant role in the selection of medicine all such cases require continuous monitoring by an experienced physician conventional treatment for mania neuroleptic drugs like haloperidol or a phenothiazine or lithium carb are some of the drugs that are commonly used electro convulsive therapy is given to resistant cases bipolar disorder it is a mood disorder in which depression and manic symptoms occur simultaneously or in quick succession it was previously known as 'manic depressive psychosis' each phase of mania and depression may lat for many months bipolar disorder signs and symptoms read those of depression and mania above homeopathic treatment for bipolar disorder homeopathy can help cases with bipolar disorder albeit the treatment is more prolonged and difficult than that of unipolar disorder most of the medicines used are similar to those used for depression and mania the treatment usually continues for extended periods as each phase can last for many months also there is a tendency of relapse in such patients but homeopathy does offer a better long term prognosis my best advice is you should go and consult a good homeopathic practitioner take care and god bless you

how do know if you'd had a mood swing or a manic episode i know the clinical description looking for a personal point of view mood swings last from a few minutes to a few hours in a manic episode you stay on a 'high' for days at a time staying up for to days straight unable to go to sleep but full of energy investing yourself in a new hobby and letting it take up all of your time spending rediculous amounts of money that you just dont have resulting in putting yourself in debt signing up for multiple credit cards and maxing out all of them in a short period of time without being able to stop yourself people going through a manic episode sometimes think of themselves as invincible and better than others around them with extremely high self esteem but while in a depressive state they would have low self esteem and have feelings of worthlessness they seem to put themselves into harms way driving recklessly etc without thinking of the possible outcomes  Bipolar disorder Psychosis Borderline personality disorder Mania Manic Street Preachers Inflation Anorexia nervosa Gambling The Amazing Race Sesshomaru Anger management Hypoglycemia Tide Sleep Weight training Carpal tunnel syndrome Cardcaptor Sakura Sonic the Hedgehog Keynesian economics Time Appeasement The Catcher in the Rye Schizoaffective disorder Deflation (economics) Traumatic brain injury Adult attention-deficit disorder DSM-IV Codes EastEnders Monetarism Debt Atkins Nutritional Approach Monty Python Equine conformation Narcolepsy Indian nationality law Narcissism Credit card Knots Landing Daylight saving time Deus Ex: Invisible War Depression (mood) Murder Friends Sleep debt Battle of Jutland Social rule Aerial (dance move) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Golf Social Security (United States) Rodney McKay Neurofeedback Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Economy of the United States Ionizing radiation Consensus decision-making Charmed Alignment (role-playing games) Chlorpromazine Psychiatric hospital Final Fantasy XI Hikikomori Personal finance Antipsychotic Schizophrenia Obesity Charles Dickens The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sexual addiction James Hanratty Capitalism Chronic fatigue syndrome Anxiety Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Stroke Montgomery Burns Haloperidol Rape Big Brother (USA TV series) The Apprentice 2 Euro Marshall Plan Fire fighting Government debt Han twins murder conspiracy Items in the Metroid series Happiness Driver's license Dorama Urinary incontinence Lamotrigine Antidepressant The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Father Ted Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

i'm not sure what i'm experiencing all last fall and winter i was really depressed to the pint where i didn't even want to get out bed anymore all i did was sleep i could sleep until in the afternoon and turn around and take a nap at it was getting too out of hand i didn't want to tell my parents because i was afraid that i would tell them and find out there was nothing wrong with me i didn't want to feel stupid so i just hoped it would go away i was a the point where i needed to get help then around spring my mood started to change i would go to school some days sometimes lasting a week and i'd be crazy happy it was weird then other weeks i'd be depressed and i angered easily now its summer and i feel fine like nothing was wrong in the first place sometimes i get really down but for the most part i'm pretty happy sometimes i get a little crazy and i talk alot which isn't really like me i'm a pretty quiet person i get in these crazy moods i'm just wondering if anyone has any idea what this is at first your symptoms sounded like sad seasonal affective disorder it makes you down in winter and back up in spring then you mentioned the fast talking and crazy moods that sounds more like manic depression which is an illness of mood swings at it's extremes it can actually give hallucinations paranoia speedy talking and super happiness for little reason the depression is like any severe depression only a psychiatrist can diagnose this illness my ideas are just some experience and a few classes i'm surprised your parents haven't noticed are you always awake and alert when they are home you do need to talk to them you should make an appointment with a mental health professional to determine if you do need more treatment and perhaps supportive drug therapy ask for help tell your parents what's been going on with you for the last year i'm sure they will want to help you  Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Psychosis Traumatic brain injury Sleep Schizophrenia Narcolepsy Methamphetamine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychiatric hospital Milton H.

what's your worst antidepressant experience did you lose impulse control have the most fun ever and try to kill yourself like i did or what 'cause i'm really sick of this lie that these medications are safe it's not safe but maybe it's worth it when you're that desperate who knows but stop lying i went into a major depression a few years back and was prescribed a new then it was new anyway medication called cymbalta first of all it did absolutely nothing for my depression in fact it made it even worse i didn't want to get out of bed at all while taking that stuff never mind getting up at noon or pm i was very irritable on it and isolated myself from family and friends i went to my regular medical doctor for a checkup and he noticed that something was wrong as well he took my blood pressure and it was higher than it had ever been in my life i do have hypertension in my family but i never had it myself so i really didn't think much of it at the time and he told me to just keep an eye on it i kept going back to the psych dr to tell him that something wasn't working with this medication and he kept telling me to give it more time to kick in finally after being on it almost three months i got taken off of it and switched to effexor after about a week on the effexor my mood was improved and i was able to start functioning and living again when i went back to my medical doctor for another checkup he was amazed to see my blood pressure had come down significantly and asked me if my meds have changed on the psych end i told him about the cymbalta and he told me that one of the i believe more rare side effects can be high bp the truth not all antidepressants are right for everyone also you do need a doctor that will listen to you going to my doctor who is no longer my doctor now was like going through the drive through at mcdonalds you were in and out in less than five minutes he didn't talk to you but rather just pulled out the prescription pad to refil your prescriptions i was waiting for him to offer me a hamburger and order of fries on my next visit rather than pills however unfortunate it is to find the right one for you is little more than trial and error method therefore do not give up hope and do what you can to help yourself while you are on the meds  Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bipolar disorder Venlafaxine Maprotiline Migraine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Psoriasis Hypertension Medical prescription Doxepin Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Stroke Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.

i despise my job and can't figure out how to make it work anymore i work in a small lawfirm with only one lawyer and other staff members co workers are great but the boss is a tyrant who needs to control every aspect of our lives i call in sick to work once every couple of months because i literally cannot take it i live on a small island and jobs are few and far between but i'm now developing high anxiety about going to work sometimes i leave to cry in the bathroom and have had panic attacks standing outside the office door i'm on the verge of just walking out but that would mean losing my home and possibly my son but i really don't know how to cope its in the morning and the anxiety of facing tomorrow won't allow me to sleep i can't speak to my boss as he tells us we don't know how lucky we are to work for him it will just make him direct more anger towards me i am looking for other jobs on other islands but its been months and no bites i am drowning help may sound stupid but may work pray whatever your belief i think you have someone to pray to pray for you to find a new job pray for strenght to bear with your nazi boss pray for your son i'm sure your condition will improve if you have enough faith its the only thing left to do if you do not want to fall in despair it may sound stupid especially if you do not belive but what do you lose by trying you said yourself you dont want to leave the job because it is difficult to find a new one the only option left is to live with the situation praying may help you do this even if your request is not granted or so you think as god is not the genie in the lamp you'll find strenght to continue fighting the situation so you never give up and fall to taking drugs or alcohol which will greatly make the situation worse life is not a bed of roses everyone has their crosses to bear but the weight of these crosses may lessen if you let god share their weight what can i say more you do your best and let god do the rest  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Social rule Muslim ibn Aqeel Anxiety The Pilgrim's Progress Knots Landing Avenue Q Prayer Shaggy dog story Simone Weil The Shining (film) Panic attack Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Eastern Orthodox Church Boss (video games) Alcoholics Anonymous Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair RuneScape quests Freeters Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Amber Spyglass Chronic fatigue syndrome Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Otello Darwin from Orchids to Variation Aphrodite Clinical depression El (god) Badly Drawn Kitties Dog training Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Rich Mullins Kodocha Friends The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Miss Saigon Blackjack Book of Isaiah Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Priesthood (Mormonism) Faustyna Kowalska Brave New World Columbine High School massacre George Costanza Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Joke Jacob John the Baptist Slow Train Coming Modoc War Ephesian Tale Liam Gallagher Stuttering Jean Grey Phoebe Halliwell Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Out-of-body experience Diazepam Euphemism Random Harvest Breath of Fire III Customs and etiquette of Japan G-Man (Half-Life) Sola fide Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Aladdin (1992 film) Guns N' Roses Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Isa The Fairly OddParents Justification (theology) Jon Secada Bipolar disorder Rule of St Benedict Christian eschatology Oasis (band) The Critic Fiddler on the Roof Forty-seven Ronin Trapped in the Closet Final Fantasy XI Blood (computer game) One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pitaten Characters of Lost The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Aramaic of Jesus Garfield Hypertension

could it be depression my mom is a manic depressive my brother is depressive and everyone in my mom's family is depressed i tend to have a lot of the depression signs by a lot i mean only a few i don't have i am constantly fatigued but also very jittery at the same time like my mind never stops moving and coming up with new ideas but my body feels tired all the time and i am constantly fidgeting the only way to explain this would be the fatigue from depression i am stressed all the time i feel like everything around me is dark and morbid and i am constantly thinking negative thoughts i always demean myself and justify everyone else could i actually have depression or is it just my mind trying to convince me i have depression i have read tons of books about depression and all signs point that i'm depressed but is that because my mind is trying to convince me i am or could i actually be depressed i don't have a song to quote you but i will give you my opinions instead first i think that when we read diagnoses we often then feel like we have the symptoms of whatever it is most people feel depressed at sometime or another for instance if you got fired from your job or your best friend moved away this is situational depression because a specific trigger can be identified however chronic or major depression is ongoing and has to do with the synapses in the brain not connecting i think the fact that you are questioning if you are depressed is reason enough to go to your doctor fact is that depression does run in families as far as feeling jittery and fatiqued at the same time depression often comes with anxiety and irritabiity so my suggestion is to see a doctor or another professional  Clinical depression Psychosis Bipolar disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Anxiety Transsexuality Schizophrenia Adult attention-deficit disorder Hypnosis Fibromyalgia Post-traumatic stress disorder Charles Darwin's illness Kurt Cobain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatry Empathy Procrastination Meditation Anorexia nervosa Multiple chemical sensitivity Autism Parkinson's disease Traumatic brain injury Coeliac disease Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Borderline personality disorder Drug addiction Hypoglycemia Alexander Technique Stomach cancer Methamphetamine Traumatic incident reduction David Hume Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Stress (medicine) Sigmund Freud Homeopathy Panic attack Homophobia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Antidepressant Hypertension Cognitive therapy Intelligence quotient Psychoanalysis Alzheimer's disease Sexual orientation Asperger syndrome Self-harm The Catcher in the Rye Narcissism Milton H.

de ja vu too strong i have really strong episodes of de ja vu to the point i can sometimes recite to myself what is about to happen in the next few seconds before it does e g will think to myself my mom is about to walk in and ask something from my sister and sure enough it happens any ideas you too ever get that feeling like you had a dream about it happening and you swear it actually happened again after that worst cases for me i remember having been in the situation times previously honestly i cant guarentee what causes it no one can whether you have dreams that are premonitions of the future or its an instantaneous reading of a current situation so perfectly that your brain can actually predict what is about to happen science will never know some people have it some don't i think those of us who do are in the minority and those who dont cant understand and think we are full of it i think its very likely just a moment in time where you are able to analyze your surroundings to the point that the next few seconds seem to only have one possible outcome and you actually see it happen before it does  Time travel Dualism (philosophy of mind) Out-of-body experience Randomness Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Milton H.

what effect would amphetamine sulphate have when taken with prescribed diazepam and anti depressants obviously not a recommended combination but as diazepam is meant to mellow you out and amphetamines do just the opposite wouldnt it be wise then to assume that these drugs will clash and battle against each other am trying to make someone close see that though the speed may provide a temporary lift but when that wears off wouldnt the depression deepen somewhat and make everything seem worse than it was before the speed was even taken please serious answers only any input and suggestions welcome amphetamine salts are used to treat people with sleeping disorders such as narcalopsy and adhd depends on how the amphetamine salts are prescribed for example if the person is taking an extended release pill only small amounts of the drug are released at a time which would have very little effect on the diazepam the diazepam can cause drowsiness but in some people it might have the opposite effect the question about the anti depressants is what type of anti depressants is the person taken there are many anti depressants out on the market today that are not stimulant based nor are they in the same drug family as the diazepam so that they would not react with each other examples like zoloft cymbalta and abilify are non stimulant anti depressants and help slow down the neuro transmitters in the brain ativan xanax valium are the ones that are used also as sleep aids for people who suffer from depression insomina bipolar and schizofrenia disorders to name a few the amphetamine is used to help control your dopomine transmitters in the brain it helps the thoughts in the brain come under control instead of being scattered and disconnected was this person prescribed all of these meds by a doctor if so i would check into the doctor's practice to make sure they are not a pill pusher one who prescribes whatever the patient thinks he she needs in the short term effect the speed effect of the amphetamines could cause a crash effect and depending on the mood of the person at the time could cause them to be more depressed than before but again it all depends on what anti depressants are prescribed the dosage amount of the amphetamines and the diazepam if you have more questions on the drugs check out some the websites of the major pharmaceutical companies  Antidepressant Bipolar disorder Amphetamine Drug addiction Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anxiety Sleep Bupropion Methylphenidate Chronic fatigue syndrome Maprotiline Methamphetamine Psychosis Antipsychotic Clomipramine Epilepsy Adderall Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Adult attention-deficit disorder Insomnia Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Benzodiazepine Chemical imbalance theory Psychiatry Lorazepam Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Doxepin Psychopharmacology Drug abuse Controlled Substances Act Sleep apnea Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Neurofeedback Cannabis (drug) Paroxetine Sertraline Medicine Prostate cancer Schizophrenia Stomach cancer Pharmaceutical company Migraine Chlorpromazine Mental illness Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Hypoglycemia Traumatic brain injury Parkinson's disease Lamotrigine Addiction Anticonvulsant Haloperidol Venlafaxine Sildenafil Topiramate Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Dextroamphetamine Primidone Schizoaffective disorder Asthma Psychotherapy Medical prescription Medical cannabis Fluoxetine Cocaine Buprenorphine Kurt Cobain Methcathinone Meditation Transsexuality Growth hormone treatment Osteoarthritis Tardive dyskinesia Post-traumatic stress disorder Oral contraceptive Withdrawal Alprazolam St John's wort Hypnosis Drug test 5-HTP Alcoholism Orgasm Antiretroviral drug Hypertension Folic acid Duesberg hypothesis Dopamine Fibromyalgia

you know your in this part of your body forgive me if this is posted in the wrong section i know this is a really weird thing to ask but i've wondered why we know we are in the 'head brain' area i was lying in bed with my eyes closed thinking of this like say a blind man was lying down and never saw anything in his life he would know he was by his head rather than by his feat is it because the brain is there i apologise for how silly this question may sound u u this is an important question about where our identity comes from even if some can't read it well enough to understand that what you're saying is not magical we do indeed associate ourselves more with our head than our feet it sometimes helps if i get a pain in my foot to think of it as being so distant from the real me that's harder to do with pain around the head that's one reason migraines demand one's attention as much as they do part of this is because so many important parts of us are in our head such as our mouth for eating and speaking and our eyes we recognize others and their emotional states by their faces so we know our own face is just as important the me in my head is much more in the front of my head than the back of my head not only because of my eyes and mouth if we notice a sight or sound off to one side we might turn our whole body toward it but we might also just turn our head somehow all of these sensory and motor experiences add up so that we identify ourselves with our head much more than with our feet despite that some ancient people thought the brain did nothing but cool the blood they saw our presence in our head as more intangible even a spirit that left our mouth with our last breath maybe the reality of how we see ourselves needs some improvement even over how we see ourselves today questions like this help that if you're crazy it's not because you ask this question maybe you're not asking the right people neuroscientists would know what you mean you wouldn't even have to apologize to them they ask much crazier questions than this  Dyslexia Traumatic brain injury Aphasia Cognitive science Brain Neuro-linguistic programming Happy Tree Friends Milton H.

i'm so bored with life nothing excites me anymore what can i do i'm only and nothing is like it used to be nothing entertains me all i do now is sit on the computer i mean there's literally nothing to do and now that its summer break all i do is wake up and turn on the computer and stay on it until i can't go to sleep last year i've been failing most of my classes friends are boring me i can't go outside because there is no one to drive me no sister or brother i used to love eating but now its like blech is this depression or something cause it sucks all i do is watch movies because of netflix thank god i want to go to tokyo aruba sky diving jet skiing but lets be logical i'm never going to atleast recommend me a movie thanks i'm really sorry you feel this way especially since you're only i am and i know how you feel but my advice which is probably stupid is find motivation listen to music find music that relates to you and maybe comforts you that is what has saved my life or call up your friends and maybe ask them to hang out at your house that doesn't involve driving only for your friend and if you don't have friends then i suggest finding different motivation because you always need something to keep you together and you wanting to go to tokyo aruba sky diving etcetc you have the rest of your life dear you have until you die don't rush everything now sure you may want to do it now but think about it do you wanna do all that stuff in one day and then the rest of your life is like blah you have the rest of your life and i feel the same way i want to do so many things in life but i have to wait a little i really suggest music seriously do you have parents that could drive you places and if you do have parents ask them for a day trip or something just to get you out of the house i really hope i helped oh btw a good movie is premonition  Friends Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 2) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Avenue Q Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Rich Mullins One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard Kodocha Charmed EastEnders The Life and Times of Juniper Lee W.I.T.C.H.

ok so i'm going crazy nowadays i am extremely neurotic depressed tired and very pregnant i don t want to blame my hormones but everything seems to bother me and of course sometimes i just want to cry and stay at home instead of here where i m never good enough to my boss obviously i m worried about doing a bad work which i am loosing documents missing meetings etc i ve tried to be calmed to concentrate to make lists but it s just too much work sometimes and it makes me feel like i will not be able to do everything my boss wants me to and then i will not get the raise i m supposed to be getting on september i also feel upset at my friends to the point that i rather have lunch alone than seeing them i m mad at everybody i m so crazy and upset that i barely recognize myself sometimes my husband loves me he is the most patient man in the entire world if it wasn't for him i would have killed someone already what can i do i don't mean to be such a pain in the back i'm weeks pregnant and my job is well paid and i have a lot of benefits my husband has an awful job and bad salary and no benefits so he's been trying to find a new job but with no luck so if i leave this job of mine we will find ourselves with no money and that will be more stressful than the job i have now my boss is not very understanding darlin' is it possible for you to go out on maternity leave early sometimes all that you've described is your body and mind and spirit's cue to you to cut your losses and leave that insane place called the world of work how much longer do you have to go you could even have a chat w your midwife or ob and simply tell them where you're at if the stress is sufficiently awful then it seems quite possible to me that you could indeed be endangering your health and the health of your unborn baby i got the best job of my life whilst i was pregnant i'm a chef amongst other things before i began it i ended up having to tell my new clients that while i was extremely greatful they chose me b c i was pregnant and had morning sickness the entire time i was pregnant that i just didn't have the health or the energy or the well being to be their personal chef it was one of the hardest letters i've ever had to write and one of the hardest conversations i've ever had to have either but it was exactly the right choice and i was glad i made it that desire to be alone is also extremely common and very very natural very soon aloneness will be a thing of the past for about decades store up on it while you can your body knows this and it's protecting you and your needs and best interests it's all a part of going inward and the journey of becoming a mother you need your energy for you and your baby right now listen to your body our bodies are wise the reason pregnant women are all so tired those last one to two months is b c we're storing up on sleep and b c our babies are putting on a pound a week during that last month guess what all that energy's got to come from somewhere and it's coming from you we very soon won't be getting much sleep if any at all and our bodies instinctively know this listen give yourself permission go out on leave and tell your husband it's up to him to support you all now you're doing your share of the work already thank you very much you are not crazy at all you are working in a system that is made for single white men and was made up by them as well it knows and respects nothing of women's needs it doesn't even see women as different from men and doesn't compensate them equally still either you are not crazy you are very very sane do not buy that there's something wrong with you listen to everything your body and mind are trying to tell you listen and then heed  Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Pitaten Social rule Friends Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Kodocha Shaggy dog story Jam (TV series) The Contender (television series) Pregnancy Neighbours One Tree Hill (TV series) Prostate cancer Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.

how many years of sobriety should a recovering alcoholic have before working in a place that sells liquor i think that the temptation is too great why work there at all it is a big step to be a recovering adict but my friend who is a recovering alcoholic says that with discpline it can be done tell me what you think serious answers please perhaps it can be done perhaps and addicts don't fit a particular mold though addiction itself does to me family and friend to several addicts the real question is this is it worth it to even consider jeopardizing all of the work that goes into recovery for many addicts recovery is something they will spend their lives repeating we all stumble and fall the trick is to avoid the things that cause us to stumble and that may take a long time to learn if your friend is involved in a program such as aa or another recovery group suggest that they ask the group for their opinion if your friend is not in a recovery group encourage them to find one your friend also needs to learn that addiction recovery isn't about self control or discipline addiction isn't something that can be beat it's something to be lived with at some point willpower is always weaker than the desire to feel better or return to the familiar it isn't about how strong a person is blessings hope this helps  Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve-step program Narcotics Anonymous Drug addiction Addiction Knots Landing Goodness and value theory Lance Armstrong Bill W.

why are so many people turning up bipolar these days whats up with that i just think its weird that so many people actually are bipolar no it is because psychiatrists and scientists have realized that bipolar is a spectrum of disorders ranging from bipolar to bipolar nos not otherwise specified which is a mild form of a mood disorder truth is that very few people are being diagnosed bipolar which is the traditional manic depressive most people are being diagnosed bipolar or bipolar nos which are people who experience major depressive episodes i have been bipolar for over years when you think of a traditional bipolar i am it i have been on bridges and on buildings yelling things arrested for various manic episodes etc but that is not what is being diagnosed today also many people with borderline personality disorder are given a diagnosis of bipolar why because insurance will cover the cost of treating bipolar but may not cover the cost of treating a borderline  Bipolar disorder Clinical depression DSM-IV Codes Psychosis Borderline personality disorder Mania Lamotrigine Antipsychotic Mental illness Psychiatry Mixed state (psychology) Schizophrenia Asperger syndrome Personality disorder Mood stabilizer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Antidepressant Traumatic brain injury Depression (mood) Emil Kraepelin Psychotherapy Controversies in autism Chemical imbalance theory Post-traumatic stress disorder Anorexia nervosa Mental retardation Neurology Hypomania Narcissistic personality disorder Psychoanalysis Fluoxetine Narcolepsy Gabapentin Obsessive-compulsive disorder Dissociative identity disorder Gender identity disorder Anxiety Hypoglycemia Antisocial personality disorder Autism Anti-psychiatry Lithium salt Medicine Psychopharmacology Delusion Genetic disorder Bupropion Electroconvulsive therapy Patty Duke Sleep Cognitive therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Venlafaxine Mental Health Act 1983 Autism epidemic Seasonal affective disorder Histrionic personality disorder Mental health Combat stress reaction Involuntary commitment Transsexuality Topiramate Medical views of suicide Schizotypy Schizotypal personality disorder Homeopathy Tourette syndrome Cyclothymia Insomnia Borna disease Autism rights movement Maprotiline Sleep apnea Cornelia Rau Affective spectrum Anger management Edvard Munch John Cade Reactive attachment disorder Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone deficiency Refugee Procrastination Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fibromyalgia Diazepam Binge eating disorder Dysthymia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Brain Sertraline Health insurance High-voltage direct current Asthma Ozzy Osbourne

my husband was just recently diagnosed w bi polar before he or i knew he was mentally ill during one of his manias he cheated on me twice once going to dinner w girl and then making out and the other time mnths later and had sex w a different girl we have a child together and have had a rollercoaster marriage now i know the reason why he has been put on meds and is back to his normal self and feels horrible for everything he has done but personally i am battling my emotions part of me wants to understand and excuse him b c he was out of his mind basically but the other part of me thinks i am being one of those stupid girls who is a push over i am wanting to know if anyone has had a cheating bi polar spouse and if they got through it and how or if they left the relationship and are better off please help thanks i've not been in the situation you're describing but i have studied bipolar quite a bit and one of the things that go along with bipolar is that people will sometimes cheat in their relationships a lot of times during mania sex drive increases and since mania causes a person's state of mind to be unclear that leads to the manic person to not use good judgment from what you have described it sounds like his behavior was the result of mania and not because of anything about you or your relationship with him however you do have the right to feel hurt because he did cheat it might have been because of the mania but that doesn't change the hurt you feel i can see how you would feel conflicted in this situation i don't think it would make you a stupid girl or a pushover if you took him back but i can understand why you feel that way i would suggest attending some sort of marital counseling so this issue can be addressed in a professional way hope this helps  Clinical depression Psychosis Psychoanalysis Infantilism Sexual orientation Polyamory Divorce Social rule Social psychology Mania Borderline personality disorder Domestic violence Grief Transsexuality Mental illness Transactional analysis EastEnders Marriage Pedophilia Love Schizophrenia Friends Theory of conduct Sex and the City Psychology Homophobia Milton H.

if someone has been molested what can they do to get help and to try to heal from what has happened hi when someone has be abused they can get counselling and can go to the police an idea would be to write down everything they can remember and keep a diary of any memories that come back to them its not their fault and they are not to blame as a friend you can comfort them and be there for them when they are low if they dont feel up to either there are online support groups that can help this website is for survivors of abuse and is helpful the members have been through similar experiences so will know how you feel they are there to listen support and help hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck  Domestic violence Satanic ritual abuse Alcoholics Anonymous Rape Post-cult trauma Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Dissociative identity disorder LiveJournal Post-traumatic stress disorder Ex-gay Reparative therapy Transsexuality False memory Religious Society of Friends Childlove movement Psychoanalysis Diary Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Sexual abuse Child sexual abuse Cult 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Children of God Infantilism Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Professor X Psychotherapy Sant Mat Out-of-body experience Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ron Weasley Michael Jackson Funeral Grief Kain (Legacy of Kain) Book of Isaiah Borderline personality disorder One Life to Live Sathya Sai Baba Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Death of a Salesman Child pornography Traumatic incident reduction Child sexuality Mat Cauthon Martial Terri Schiavo Adult attention-deficit disorder Tris Speaker Church of Christ, Scientist Charles Darwin's views on religion John Cage Time Out of Mind A Course In Miracles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Vernon Schillinger North American Man/Boy Love Association Socialist Workers Party (United States) Autistic community Kodocha Dream Magical thinking Scientology beliefs and practices Self-harm Pedophilia Robert F.

how can i stop it when i was growing up my dad used to hit me i dont mean the odd slap on the bum i mean proper hit me and i stoped seeing him when i was and always said i would never be like him and now ive started treating my partner like s t he upsets me i want to hurt him i just feel like hitting him and today i did it wasnt like proper hit but he was holding my arms so i couldnt hit him and i dug all my nails in i hate myself for it inever wanted to hurt him but i have and its not fair on him and all i can see is me turning out like my dad and i dont want that i feel like leaving him so i cant hurt him anymore and at the moment i even feel like getting rid of myself because i have hurt him how can i stop this i dont want to be be like my dad i really dont and i love my partner so much but when i get angry its like i cant stop myself and i know its not right and i hate myself i really do i know its not his fault he has just said that its better for me to do it than to bottle it all up and i know this probly sounds really silly but if i go to councilling then i feel like iv failed i should beable to just carry on and be ok i have been strong for everyone else and i feel like if i need councilling then im not being strong like im failing everyone else it takes a lot of guts to actually do what you do reach out for help i didn't want to treat my child as i have been treated by my mother and it took a conscious effort each and every time something happened years to accomplish i turned out not to be a mom like mine was but i still find that a lot of the things i grew up with seem to be embedded in me so it is a lifelong conscious effort to see how sick the behavior is and finding ways to deal with the momentary anger to not fall back into this old pattern what i do is leave i get up and take a nice long walk with my dog when i see that my anger wells up to the point where i would not be able to handle the situation properly where i would act like my mom once i calmed down am i able to sort things out and then approach the situation in a much more mature and healthy way call your local department of mental health and find out if they offer counseling and support groups to help you deal with this and learn how to change that pattern because that's what it is it is a behavior you grew up with unconsciously got comfortable with and therefore you got caught up in the same behavior a pattern passed down most departments of mental health do offer their own counseling services or have referrals and resources to use for those who need and want help good luck  Milton H.

my cousin has recently been diagnosed with anorexia what can i do for her and her mom i know my niece is getting all the help she needs she is seeing several specialists weekly i am really worried about her mom everytime she starts to talk about the problem she breaks down in tears i don't even know what to say to her the husband dad doesn't seem to get it at all and i can tell he is not much support i don't want to put my nose in where it is not wanted but i can tell they are all falling apart and it breaks my heart the family should be receiving counseling as well for this and how to deal with all that is going on in there life including whole family counseling with mom dad and daughter and any siblings involved sounds like mom and dad need couples therapy as well as individual that can be done in one hr session a week min for each and then min together also you need to be very supportive offer to do simple things that may be just adding to the stress like maybe taking any other siblings for the weekend so they can spend the three of them together because your cousin will need that one on one time the most also offer to run simple errands and do simple chores around there house little things to take the pressure off will help a lot also mom and dad need a night alone together to reconnect and should continue to do so if they are both strong people and there marriage is strong there love will persevere and be even stronger because of it  Fathers' rights EastEnders The Adventures of Pete & Pete Grandview, U.S.A.

the verge of madness is madness really defined as the pathological actions of madmen or can madness be shown in other ways like when we take our senses out of our daily actions and replace them with just pure numbness yes because pure numbness can lead to mad reactions for example sociopaths and anti social personality people usually are numb and have very little feelings or carings towards others  Antisocial personality disorder Evil Grief Stroke Psychosis Post-traumatic stress disorder Insanity Mad scientist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Panic attack Objectivist philosophy Self-harm Alexander Technique Modernism Science Scientology beliefs and practices Narcissism Imagination Utilitarianism Pacifism Autism rights movement Comfortably Numb Ethics Rape Child sexual abuse Sociology Coercion Obsessive-compulsive disorder Consensus decision-making Drug abuse Anesthesia Diabetic neuropathy The Wall Aconitum Friedrich Schleiermacher Self-hatred Infantilism Theodicy Growth hormone treatment Motivation Mental health Negligence Prostate cancer Mental illness Derek Parfit Traumatic brain injury Asperger syndrome Substance abuse Theory of conduct Stillbirth Streetlight Manifesto Out-of-body experience Social psychology Diabetic retinopathy Empathy Social relation Rudolf Hermann Lotze Prefrontal cortex Narcissistic personality disorder Goodness and value theory KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 2004 Missy Elliott Multiple sclerosis Conscience Group entity Alignment (role-playing games) Chemistry Poverty Religious Society of Friends S__ren Kierkegaard Woman Stomach cancer Transsexuality Daredevil Serial killer Pathology Immanuel Kant Fruits Basket Incentive Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Carpal tunnel syndrome Rain Man Strap-on dildo Bondage (BDSM) Brain Hydrogen economy Hydrochloric acid Romance copula Folie __ deux Government Aphasia Gay The Dark Knight Returns Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Totally Spies!

why won't some people admit they need psychiatric medicine even if they see things and do crazy things do they do it to get attention or it's for real because psychiatric problems are hard to diagnose as the symptoms are vast and varied most people with psychiatric problems don t realise that they are sick as to them it is as normal as we see it and don t know how to get help it is usually others that notice or report the strange happenings but many of us are worried telling some one in case we are wrong the people that do crazy things for attention are only stupid or show offs but don t have real psychiatric problems there is a fine line between sanity and crazy  Mental illness Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychiatry Milton H.

how do you tell someone that you have panic attacks i need to tell my parents so that i can get help in preventing them and whatnot but i know they'll make fun of me so what is a foolproof way of telling them that it's not something i take lightly and i'm being serious okay well first off is there something that is keeping you from telling them like are you doing drugs or have you recently done something or changed something in your life that's keeping you from telling them more so what's making you anxious and paranoid i ask these questions because i went through the same problem i'm i'm well over that phase but i went through it too the best thing i can recommend is for you to just be straight out with your parents they aren't going to reject you and throw you out onto the streets if they do those are not ideal or understanding parents they should be there for you and understand or atleast try to understand what it is you're going through it's tough man let me tell you panic attacks and anxiety are no walk in the park it takes time and patience above all a positive mind to over come this i hope i was of some assistance  Anxiety Panic attack Clinical depression Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Karen Horney Transsexuality About a Boy Ex-gay Anorexia nervosa Social rule Theory of conduct Hypertension VHF omnidirectional range Datalore (TNG episode) Sinfest Coming of Age (TNG episode) Existentialism Diving Dog training Prostate cancer Narcissism Meaning of life The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Infantilism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Meditation Borderline personality disorder Justification (theology) Avoidant personality disorder Dynamical system Columbine High School massacre Urinary incontinence Education Franz Boas Sigmund Freud Linux kernel Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chucky Pancamo Human sexual behavior Psychoanalysis Mao (game) Critique of Pure Reason Volleyball Vernon Schillinger Knife Socrates Jam (TV series) Kasparov versus The World Frank Furedi The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Joke Paranoia Agent Obi-Wan Kenobi Escape from New York Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Battle of the Bulge Extreme Programming Milton H.

is this self harm i use to cut myself quit badly when i was and i was silly doing it and looking back i realize it only made evey thing worse i know this is a weird thing to ask but lately i've been chewing the inside of my mouth well not really lately but i kind of just noticed and thought something of it i seem to do it when i'm sad or nervous so is this self harm similar to cutting fu ck you i'm not emo i hate emos they make me sick there is a difference between being depressed and being an attention seeking emo ignore the idiot who said emo i don't think it's a real problem chewing the inside of your mouth unless you are biting down on the flesh till the bleeds don't let that be a habit it's not healthy focus on what is going to happen and try to think positive if your nervous just try and think about the good things in life you can always improvise by chewing gum instead and try to be more confident in yourself there are people out there who expect you to do well and being nervous only brings you down just get out there and do it that's how i get over being nervous whenever your sad just think about the good things in life your family and friends if they ever see you sad you wouldn't want them to worry cause it'll make them sad at the fact that they don't know how to help you  Shaggy dog story Mojave people Theory of conduct Tobacco smoking Tobacco Piccolo Junior Saga Anxiety Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophical skepticism Kim Possible Time Out of Mind Tooth One Piece minor characters Jon Secada Theodicy Cocaine Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Utilitarianism Charles Goodyear Babe Ruth Nicomachean Ethics Dead Like Me Vernon Schillinger Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.

attention problems i go to an all girls school and i have bee getting myself into so much trouble just so a male teacher that i am close to can talk to me after class all of the girls in my classes say wow i would never want to do that to a teacher do it again just so i can see him get angry at you again i wagged a class been arguing with him and walking out of the class texting and he has rang my mum so many times but i dont mean to cause so much trouble i just need a new begining and i need to know how to get on with my life and concentrate on achieving the best not getting into trouble that i dont mean to please help then stop stand up for yourself and learn to treat yourself the teachers and others with respect if you want to talk to the male teacher after class then do it but don't get in trouble or interfere with others time there are other girls in there that want to learn as far as your classmates go if they want to see the male teacher get angry again then by all means let them be the one to anger the teacher ever think that maybe this teacher might see something in people who have potential who want to learn ever think that by you taking the focus off of the subject at hand and putting it on you is not a good thing there are people who want to learn who want to do something with their lives stand up for your self teachers don't get paid enough students don't learn enough people don't have respect for themselves or others so if you want to be a leader do you want to do it the wrong way or the right way for a new beginning change your schedule around perhaps it might even be a good idea to stay behind one day when your not in trouble and discuss this all with the teacher maybe you might even want to apologize for the lack of concern and respect he has been due he may even has a few good suggestions to help you with your situation you can start a new beginning at anytime now is good you can achieve the best at anytime now is also a good time to do that you don't have to wait or come up with an excuse if not now when  Social rule Milton H.

how to explain to my years old son divorce his father does not come at all to see the littel boy and he is always asking where is dad i answer he is travelling abroad his father was always spoilling him and giving him gifts and toys for no reason even if my son misbehave i really want to bring up a polit child and desipline my boy but i think he understands everything as now he refuses to sleep in his bed and became more attached to me and just frighten of me leaving him like his father did divorce is so hard on children but with the right supportive care he will get through it i wouldn't tell him his father is traveling abroad because at some point he will figure out that this isn't the truth you have to tell kids the truth but in the right way if he thinks his father is forever travelling abroad eventually he will figure out this isn't true and he'll resent you for having lied so i would sit him down and say something such as honey mommy loves you so much and all i want to do is protect you i haven't told you the truth about something only because i don't want to see you sad but now i think it's best that i tell you your dad is not really travelling he is around but for some reason we don't know about he won't come to see you i hope this changes soon and that he will come see you but for now he's staying away you have to assure him that you will never leave or abandon him he's got to feel secure with you and to really know your love and commitment he needs to start sleeping in his own bed but don't push it right away he will need a little time to adjust each day just assure him that he is safe with you and that you'll never leave tell him he can safely sleep in his own bed but that you'll always be close by if after a few weeks you think he's still insecure and frightened consider taking him to a child psychologist or therapist they can help you both cope with this stressful situation good luck to you  About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Social rule The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Knots Landing Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story Friends Attachment theory Fathers' rights Theory of conduct Theodicy Haven (TNG episode) Ben Johnson (athlete) Avenue Q Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Ex-gay Jon Secada Infantilism Narcissism Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Transactional analysis Clinical depression The Jeffersons (South Park) Kurt Cobain Kibbutz Plame affair Phaedo Angel One (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Justice (TNG episode) Grief The Jazz Singer Divorce Silent Night, Deadly Night One Tree Hill (TV series) Mystique (comics) Game show Incarnations of Immortality The Time Machine Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy 2004 Republican National Convention The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shawn Michaels Hikikomori John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Miss Saigon College Roomies from Hell!!!

how do i ask for help with depression i think that i have depression as i have looked up the symptoms on the net and i seem to have just about all of them but how do i get up the courage to get help my fiancee is threatening to leave me if i don't get help soon write things down that upset you even make a poem out of them this will help you put it all into perspective being creative is brilliant therapy and you should try drawing painting or making stuff in a subject you are interested in it doesn't have to be a masterpiece as it's the doing that matters take big long walks this will clear the mind of cobwebs because your blood flow increasing will get things on the mind moving look at the wild life relax a bit be calm about stuff now focus on the things that are good about your life and you will find things that you think are bad were nothing much in the whole scheme of things i'm sorry you feel blue but you will be fine if you believe in yourself and be strong give yourself a break we all suffer at some time i always focus on happy thoughts nowadays rather than stuff which didn't go very well be yourself and do what makes you happy if something feels wrong don't go there best of luck regards moleski  Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Milton H.

could this be ocd i have several weird habits that i never thought about i was reading an article about eating disorders self mutilation and ocd and how you can have more then one at the same time i'm anorexic and a self mutilator so when i'm driving in the car with someone i'll breath in when we go past drive ways and breath out when we go past grass also i refuse to do anything six times i do it seven times it's illogical but i feel like i'm opening myself up to something evil if i land on six i can't only do it one or two times though i've tried i get a bad feeling if i knock on something i do it seven times i also do patterns with my breathing when i'm just sitting there or doing anything the same with swallowing i find all these things very strange but i never really though about them could i be ocd and if so what do i do about it or am i just overreacting do you mean doctor doctor or therapist i'm my mother doesn't believe i have any problems and won't help me at all with any of it i can't really do a whole lot and i don't want to be commited or anything i know it's to help with my mental pain no one knows i can't talk to anyone because i don't have close friends i don't like letting people close i can talk online and say it because no one knows me i went to a therapist once and i lied about everything because i didn't trust him my father died in and my whole life everyone's ignored eachothers problems and swept it under the rug and has pretended that it's not there i can't talk to anyone and i can't get help because i can't talk to anyone yea this sounds like ocd it would probably take a professional to determine finally if you are and to come to an actual diagnosis there are also groups of average people that come together and help each other through ocd just punch in ocd in yahoo search to find out more i've heard of cases where ocd can be falsely induced one place where i worked there were people that were kinda cruel they would constantly call me for no reason i ended up being in the habit of going to where they were or looking up and it was for no reason at all i never thought this kind of thing would happen to me after these crappy people left it actually took me a while to get out the habit of going to check on people can you believe that i actually thought i was ocd because i always had to double check things and i only did that once after that i would just tell myself that i double checked it and i just needed to have faith that i checked it and for some reason that worked but then someone showed me what real ocd was and i was like wow if you can break your habits and live habit free you may not be ocd just think of all the time you'll be saving by not repeating things all the time maybe that and other advice might help you out but i think that requires testing to determine ocd or not you also have to go back and try to remember the earliest times you started these habits then you can try and make a new path in life for yourself by remembering when it started and then making a healthier way of life for yourself for now you don't have to talk to any doctor or anybody you do not trust just keep doing what you're doing asking for help anonymously online you can get a lot of information that way and maybe some of it will help read up on the subject too maybe you'll find a way yourself and even help others but if none of all this helps try to get professional help from people who see this all the time nurses and other people who have dealt with or who have ocd you'll find the solution that others have also found isn't as bad as you imagine in any case either way good luck i hope you're able to help yourself and find help through this  Obsessive-compulsive disorder Milton H.
