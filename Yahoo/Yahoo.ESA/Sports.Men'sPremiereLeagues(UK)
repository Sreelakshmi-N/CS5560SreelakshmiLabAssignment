do you think jamie carragher should go back to play for england if you are not aware of the situation steve mcclaren england national team coach has recently asked carragher to return to the national team after he retired from the team a few months ago to focus on liverpool he retired because he was the fourth or fifth player in the depth chart and did not feel like he was being used now that woodgate ledley king and john terry are all injured mcclaren needs someone to play alongside rio ferdinand for about a month if jamie does go back he would only play for a month or so then sit the bench again if jamie declines then sol campbell would probably be asked what should carragher do i wouldn't go back its a shame i believe he is the nd best defender england has behind terry and he has never been guaranteed a starting spot and always been played out of position he is unhappy and he would rather commit to liverpool than waste his time with mcclaren look at scholes he has done pretty well since he retired from england  England national football team Jamie Carragher Leeds United F.C.

why does sky sports not show more games of the premierleague in iceland you can choose between games at all times it sounds ridiculous that you can watch more football in iceland than in the uk even though the deal is split that still doesn't explain why there are so few games on tv in the uk in iceland there is only one channel with the rights but they broadcast games this season and that is only from the prem league sky will broadcast around games this season and setanta games or around games in total this shucks sucks not shucks under their contract with the fa sky etc are only allowed to show a set number of games the fa are worried that if there were no restrictions too many fans would stay at home and watch the games on tv there aren't many icelanders who fly to england to watch games every week  NFL on television National Football League Super Bowl Sky Digital Major League Baseball television contracts The Football League Football (soccer) Philadelphia Eagles Monday Night Football 24 (television) MLB on FOX Fox Broadcasting Company David Beckham Newcastle United F.C.

people still think pizarro is a bad option for the chelsea attack the man scored at debut it seems he is not such a loser as some said i heard so many times that he is not going to do anything at chelsea and that he is not going to make the first team he is definitely a great team player he works hard in both attack and defence has great vision great technique and can integrate with the other players easily oh yeah he is great in the air too only reason he is underrated is because we got him on a free transfer if we got him for million then i'm sure he would have arrived with a much enhanced reputation anyway i think malouda is a really great signing can't wait for daniel alves to complete the team as right back is the only problematic position for chelsea now urggh the way johnson allowed kapo pass him is ludicrous  Volleyball Alex Ferguson Frank Lampard Football (soccer) Rugby union positions Claudio Ranieri England national football team Football (soccer) positions Newcastle United F.C. 2004-05 in English football Deco Gianluca Vialli Gordon Banks Leeds United F.C.

should england stop with the recalls and focus on there younger players bringing beckham back was a good idea because he should of never been cut in the first place but i do think that bringing back sol campbell is a stupid idea he is a great expierenced talent but wouldnt it benefit the euro squad and the world cup squad if they brought some youth in the squad perhaps bring reo coker into the squad and put hargreaves into a defensive role the problem with england is the coach pple am i the only one watching i mean they had the absolute dream team in euro but they blew it why the coach i know there is a new coach now but he is even worse than ericsson english pple let go of ur pride and hire a talented foreigner spanish latin would be my pick to coach the team  England national football team Norway national football team Sol Campbell 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Alan Shearer Nottingham Forest F.C.

can you set me straigt i'm a yank still pretty new to the epl and still confused about all the cup competitions this is how i understand it so please correct my errors champions league european club championship epl top six are automatically in the draw with the top two getting a bye or two a few lower clubs have a chance this is what is referred to as getting to europe no carling cup seems like a second chance cup or a lower tier cup or something intertoto for those who couldn't make the other cups what have i missed don't say the world cup i'm not stupid so tell me what the fa cup is how is it different than the epl championship or the carling cup it is hard to keep up with the epl for me a guy with basic tv no sky foxsoccerchannel goltv setanta etc it seems the epl would allow for just some basic highlights like every other major league in the world but i'm finding that basically impossible champions league epl top with first getting a bye uefa cup epl and intertoto epl and only the fifth placed team in the league qualifies for the uefa cup automatically the other two places in the uefa cup are awarded to the teams who win the fa and carling cups if the winner of the fa cup has already qualified for either the champions league or the uefa cup by virtue of the league their place in the uefa cup is awarded to the other finalist if the runner up has also qualified for europe via the league then the uefa cup place reverts to the league in the league cup if the winner has already qualified for europe via the league their place reverts to the league too rather than to the other finalist carling cup cup competition where usually teams play with their youngsters fa cup england's most important cup competition the fa cup is way more important than the carling cup but nothing is more important than the league itself http en wikipedia org wiki premier league  FA Cup Bundesliga (football) UEFA The Football League UEFA Intertoto Cup Football in England West Ham United F.C.

what was the deal with frannie jeffers was he just unlucky with injuries or did he have a bad attitude he has that little bit of talent he can score the occasional good goals too but he is way too over hyped when arsenal bought him over as the most expensive teenager at the time it got to his head jeffers felt he must be real good because arsenal just splashed lots of cash on him from then on he goes down spiralling it's not that he did not perfrom up to his usual standard the fact is his usual standard was just average at best and that people expect too much from him he is perhaps just an everage or above average striker at best his move to sheffield wednesday will do him good he won't feel out of place there and don't be surprised if he starts scoring goals at his new club in the lower divisions  Alex Ferguson Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

who do you think is better andriy shevchenko pavel nedved or thierry henry i like shevchenko because he's a team player but i'd like other people's opinions take away shevchenko's rather inauspicious season at chelsea and his record is par excellence he scored goals galore in serie a in the cl in internationals and for dynamo kiev he didn't become european footballer of the year for nothing nedved was the bedrock of the czech team and an inspirational player for juventus henry had the best success internationally although his general performances for france was muted mainly because of one zinedine zidane but he ranks as one the better players to grace the english game and an arsenal legend in his own right all are great players it boils down to choice i would pick shevchenko for his ability to score with either foot and with his head  Andriy Shevchenko European Footballer of the Year Zin__dine Zidane Pavel Nedv__d FIFA World Player of the Year FC Rostov Juventus F.C.
