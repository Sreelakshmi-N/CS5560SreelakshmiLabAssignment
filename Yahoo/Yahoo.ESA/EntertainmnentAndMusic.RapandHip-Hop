response to jena question from benevolence i find it funny how one day people are like quit blaming the white man for our struggles this is not the 's and 's read this one first http answers yahoo com question index ylt aktxujubdemsao oa v jty ix qid aatzfmc show profile info ast hy aa and then the next day those same people are like it's a shame racism still exists today in this is proof right here this som bull etc etc now read this http answers yahoo com question index ylt arzwowvzdq t leuxqn lsy ix qid aa r nj yes racism has not gone no where it is still here today just cause it's don't mean a damn thing it's just not as blatant as it used to be but black people are struggiing everyday to come up a few years ago they did some study in chicago i believe where resumes with black sounding names were not even considered i can't stand to hear people especially black people try and cover it up and say it doesn't exist duh of course they are separate issues but are they inter related hell yeah no the jena issue is just one of many prime examples and that was my point just because it's don't mean s hit it don't have to be the 's or the 's for there to be racial discrimmination no we should not blame the man for our problems and even if there are some folks in the black community that still blames the man you can rest assure their complaints are not being answered so that's irrelevant altogether and most blacks do not blame whitey for everything there are hardworking blacks who have gone to school who do not have police records and who are good parents but still can't come up due to institutional racism in and less opportunities to advance such as being locked up and put on trial for nonsense while whitey can do the same exact thing and nothing happens to him my point is it doesn't have to be the 's or the 's to still feel the affects i just think it's hypocritical to strug off such questions about racism and automatically generalize a whole group of people by assuming they always blame the white man than the next day have sympathy to those who got a raw deal america is fuked up face it no we can't depend on the white man to save us but we certainly can't lay back an pretend that we all live in utopia and this society is color blind when it comes to hiring practices judicial decisions college acceptance and that everything is separate but equal because it is not i dare you to walk up to any elementary school in east baltimore and tell me that that is an acceptable learning environment for a child you'd get eaten by the roaches before you step foot off of campus oh but it's not the 's and 's anymore we can't continue to blame the white man for our stuggles bulls hit yes i do blame him and i keep it real i'm not afraid to say it crankdatfred it's not about manning up who said anyone wasn't manning up it's about being fair to begin with we shouldn't have to man up and become some bionic force to get treated fairly hnic i'm not on here to gain points i am yrs old this is not a freakin game to me unlike some people i have a life outside of y as i don't need to spend endless hours sitting in front of a computer trying to win you act like you're trying to win a house or something c j you're so young dumb and immature it's pathetic oh and good answer about someone is trying to imitate my avatar yeah right you are pathetic thanks to the last answerers now we have some educated folks who actually know what their talking about wow i see this got a little heated i guess i missed all the fun as wicked as this debate seems to have gotten it does appear that everyone is on the same page but there are probably some personal issues involved causing the separation of ideas ok seriously i actually do understand where you are coming from to a certain extent perhaps out of frusteration your point may not be conveyed in the best way is racism still alive and well in modern america yes it is present in every sector of the american society you are correct it is just not as blatant as far as blaming the man i'm going to have to disagree with most of the other responders for the most again most part i don't think black people walk around saying it's because of him that i can't get a job or it's because of him that i have to sell crack to survive you may get some nutcase or neighborhood gangbanger or even some comedian on bet who might blurt some nonsense out every now and then but i don't believe this is the majority however there are legitimate cases like jena for example where we need to blame him the key to understanding how institutional racism works is through education and research a person that is not from the ghetto couldn't possibly imagine what the mentality is like and how children are forced to live on a daily basis i want to emphasize children because that's really where the cycle starts we children are all products of our environment and unfortunately here in america poverty schools and children are not a top priority and i know this is going to come out very blunt but the darker your community is you will be even lower on the totem pole it's an ugly thought i know but nontheless very true remember katrina yes your description of the baltimore schools are very real and i have to disagree with you c j education is vital and having a proper learning environment should be default the problems with these schools are much bigger than the roaches teachers who have a college education make minimal and can't afford to fix problems like this how do you expect low income families to rectify this i live in the bay area and you should see how the schools look in east oakland then ride accross town to danville white side and those schools look like state of the art museums in comparison that's not by coincidence dear i urge anyone to read a book called amazing grace by jonathan kozol i read it in college in and couldn't put the book down here is just one excerpt from his book and i'll share the link below almost anyone who visits in the schools of east st louis even for a short time comes away profoundly shaken these are innocent children after all they have done nothing wrong they have committed no crime they are too young to have offended us in any way at all one searches for some way to understand why a society as rich and frequently as generous as ours would leave these children in their penury and squalor for so long and with so little public indignation is this just a strange mistake of history is it unusual is it an american anomaly even if the destitution and the racial segregation and the toxic dangers of the air and soil cannot be immediately addressed why is it that we can't at least pour vast amounts of money ingenuity and talent into public education for these children bottom line should we depend on the man for anything that will benefit blacks of course not but i think we do need to hold him accountable for a lot of things that have assisted the black community in it's demise perhaps people who live in inner cities aren't educated enough to properly communicate this except by saying it's because of the white man ever think of that all i ask is that people don't judge and remain compassionate to our struggles people need to do the research and understand that it's not always about

what are your opinions on video girls i was just having a conversation with my friend and she said she felt sorry for the girls because they did it for money and exposure and most of the time they just end up being disrespected do they deserve the disrespect they recieve and also why is there such a double standard in hip hop between men and women when it comes to sex and promiscuity those who are promiscuous should either all be considered hoes or none of them should be i dont like it and im kinda tired of people talking about the it's all because of the rappers and they need to stop callin girl's bitch's and hoesz and what not that's half of the problem im really upset because these girl's they put themselves out there in those video's degrading themselves and there not helping at all they might as well call themselves hoez im so tired of it if i see another booty shakin im gonna go crazy  Hip hop collaborations Aquemini Daz Dillinger True Crime: Streets of LA Hip hop music Hip hop rivalries Hip hop culture TLC Missy Elliott Namie Amuro Eminem Married... with Children Nas (rapper) Ol' Dirty Bastard Disc jockey The Notorious B.I.G.

is it really the man's fault i've been hearing this alot lately that its the mans fault for where some of us are as a people and im sorry but i have to disagree i mean whose fault is it that we have year olds who can recite every line to a rap song yet they have a th grade reading level now i dont like blaming rappers for certain things but cant you place some of the blame on rappers like young jeezy who glorify a life that gets you nowhere except in prison or an early grave the kids who see that image and think its cool cant you blame our black leaders ex al sharpton who care more about what rappers say in their music then he does how many blacks die of aids every year or how many africans were killed as a result of the ongoing genocide in darfur or the fact that some areas of black education are in shambles alot of finger pointing going to the man but when are we gonna take responsibilities for our actions teach the kids right from wrong create a safer environment hnic you are absolutely correct and in that other post about jena everyone was pretty much saying the same thing it is just a matter of making the distinction between true racism and the few people who make a point to play the race card every chance they get i do think the man is partially responsible for some of or perhaps a lot of the things that left the black community in it's current state and while i'm all for taking responsibility i don't want to downplay racism and act as though it doesn't exist not to imply that you do i'd like to think that we're not gullible enough to rely on him to fix our problems but at the same time we are sort of at his mercy because he owns all of america's corporations educational institutions the entertainment industry and makes the decisions that affect us and with that being said i'd like to see more funding in our black schools and yes it would be helpful for sharpton to put focus on more pressing issues and btw one thing that has gotten me really ticked off lately is the naacp wasting time defending michael vick's dog fighting that's ridiculous so again you are right we could also shift some of that blame on our black leaders bottom line it's a shared responsibiltiy the parents our black leaders the rappers and each individual i think hilary clinton put it best when she always says it takes a village to raise a child but you're right it has to start in the home and we all must take personal responsibilities for our actions  Theory of conduct Bill O'Reilly (commentator) American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Economic inequality Ethics Ten Commandments Anti-Defamation League Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action The Marshall Mathers LP Darfur conflict Abortion debate Hillary Rodham Clinton Plame affair Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hip hop collaborations Sponsorship scandal Education in England Original sin Video game controversy Supply and demand Gangsta rap EastEnders Intelligent design movement Microeconomics NAACP U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Hip hop culture Social rule International Criminal Court Sampling (music) Objectivist philosophy Racism Islam as a political movement African American Music genre Free will Criticism of libertarianism Rosa Parks Philosophy of language Anarchism and society Divorce John Howard Yoder Education in the United States Janet Jackson Nation of Islam Philosophical skepticism Libertarianism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 2004 Republican National Convention Time Out of Mind Communitarianism Asperger syndrome Theodicy Scientology beliefs and practices Determinism Aquemini U.S. presidential election, 2008 Autism rights movement The Ashlee Simpson Show Polyamory Rush Limbaugh The Apprentice 2 Alan Keyes 50 Cent Consensus decision-making Extreme Programming Amnesty International Autism Reparations for slavery Democratic Party (United States) Pitaten National Kidney Foundation Singapore Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pledge of Allegiance Cultural Revolution Evil Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nigger Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans No Child Left Behind Act Tripartite System Equal Protection Clause Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Simone Weil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Teach the Controversy Mumia Abu-Jamal Jennifer Lopez Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Whose Line Is It Anyway?
