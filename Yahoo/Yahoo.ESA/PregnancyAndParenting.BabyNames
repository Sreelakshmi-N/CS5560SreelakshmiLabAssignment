why do so many people insist on giving their kids these unusual names that nobody can pronounce studies show that these poor children are automatically at a disadvantage to people with normal names it has been shown that when looking for a job a lot of people with these original names are not called first just because of their name if you have people with the exact same skillset then michael or calvin will be chosen before deandre or gob yeah someone was actually going to name their kid that i understand your idea of being original and unique but should it really be at the expense of your child not to mention spending their entire life having to tell people how to pronounce and spell it at the very least can you give them a normal middlle name so they have something to fall back on when they get older and need a real name weeder sammy understood but i'm not talking about others just us americans of course someone form a different country will have a name m ore geared to their ethnicity dynamic my family is from europe but i'm not going to name my kid gunther for crissake maybe your kids success should be more important than your heritage or you could go back where it's normal i guess most of these parents do not think about what kind of impact the names will have when the children grow up what sounds unique and cute now can really have a downside when the child enters to job force you are absolutely correct in saying that kids with normal names will get the job before the unusual one i see this happening all the time at my place of employment hopefully parents can perhaps use the cute name for a middle name and save their child future  Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Garfield Rich Mullins The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie She Loves You Freeters Hangul Justification (theology) Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Our Gang Original sin Baby Blues Unemployment Intelligence quotient CPU design Crossword Second language acquisition Republic Invader Zim Predestination Law of value Wolof language W.

should i be mad okay so a good friend of mine and i are both pregnant i'm due next month and she still has until december well ive told her what i'm planning to name my son for months now even before she found out she was having a boy too well she called me on saturday and asked if she could use my son's first name i picked out for her kids middle name at first i'm yeah ok i guess but now i'm like whats gives find your own name and im a little ticked off should i be this pissed am i just overreacting oh btw i didn't go off on her or anything i dont know if my question came off like that i havent even talked to her since that day but just thinking about it got me annoyed and thank you to all who are actually answering the question and to the other that just want to talk crap enjoy your two points and i would never end a friendship over something this petty something similar happened to me when i was pregnant with my first son i was just sure he was going to be a girl because we wanted a boy so badly so i had the name alaina faith picked out i told my sister in law as well as anyone else who would listen well i had a boy and months later she and my brother had a little girl named elaina grace and sis in law claimed that she just thought up the name my husband was deployed at the time and i had an infant son so i was extremely emotional then i was mainly hurt but still a little upset as my husband and i were planning for more children and would have still liked to use the name if we have a daughter anyway my point is at least your friend had the decency to ask you about it first plus you have the advantage of your son being born before her's so everyone will know she copied you you also have the advantage of your child starting school year before her's besides that there are still months for her to change her mind maybe you can keep suggesting names to her until something else sticks so to answer your questions no you should not be pissed well okay maybe a little and you're not overreacting because you haven't confronted your friend about it overreacting would be if you knocked her over the head because of it best of luck  EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Friends Pitaten Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alois Hitler She Loves You Little Britain Teen Girl Squad One Tree Hill (TV series) Married... with Children Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy The Lovely Bones Theory of conduct Sharon Tate Eddie Guerrero Milton H.

is this a cool design idea for a baby girl's room i didn't know what category to put this in well i had tripets two boys and one girl three weeks ago and right now they are all in one room in a few weeks we're going to move our girl tallon into her own room and let the boy's merrick and chandler share i thought it would be really cool to do a really girly theme so my mom made a purple comforter i can't remember what it's called i'm a little brain dead thing for her crib and we have pink sheets but i wanted to paint the walls light pink with clouds and little jets going in between clocks with the times from some of the major fashion capitols of the world with the city's name by them and for pictures i have some swatches and patterns and other sewing things framed so a fashion design themed room yay or neigh like actual clocks that tick tick tock tick tock not painted ones the boy's room is panted like under water themed the walls are blue and then there's sand colored with seaweed and shells and things at the bottom and there's fish the ceiling has like the bottom of a boat and then more blue with lighter blue to make it look like the sun is shining on it and some of the fish and things come off the wall they are velcrow ed on what do you think of that their rooms are connected by a door so we can leave it open and they can still heat each other and whatever in tallon's room we are going to put a full length mirror on the door to camoflage no clue how to spell that it and in the boy's room we just painted it blue and it blends in pretty well first of all if you just had triplets and you still have time to design a bedroom congratulations they must be sleeping well how exciting to have new bundles i love the ideas of the different cities with the clocks i am asuming that they will be set to the correct time zone for that city what a cute idea i have also seen people take pictures from a trip say paris and then frame them you could put a big collage of say different black and white pictures from different cities or they could be of a fashion design theme on one wall that would be cute youll have to post a picture when your through ps you better hurry and call all hands on deck to help you finish b c in a few weeks they will start to stay awake more and your design plans may have to be put on hold good luck  The Shining (film) Paul Is Dead Rococo Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friends EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Grace Cossington Smith Garfield AFI 100 Years series Havelock Vetinari Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Fan (implement) Ed, Edd n Eddy Pink Floyd Wilton House World line W.

how can i change dad's mind on what to name our child i am not sure if he is joking but my child's father is insisting on naming our child spryte leigh if it is a girl he does not like any of the names i suggest it is our first child together and the third for both of us am i being selfish because i had full say over my two other childrens' names should i give in because he wasn't given the opportunity to pick his kids' names i had been planning on a name that ended in na because i already have a jena and reyna but he just seems to have his heart set on spryte and no it is not because of the drink but because of the meaning of elf maybe i am not giving it a fair chance because i am headstrong and not used to having an involved man during my pregnancy should i fight it or is spryte really not that bad of a name when i got my cat my mom insisted on naming it johnny cash i got the cat shortly after johnny cash passed away needless to say i wasn't thrilled about naming my girl cat who was grey and white not even black after a male singer nonetheless she got the name and soon became johnny cabbage cuz she got fat thus a cabbage and now she responds only to the name cabbage spryte is a terrible name and i wouldn't ever put it onto a child especially spelled that way but in all honesty if you let him give your possible daughter that name give her a strong middle name that she can fall back on when she becomes her own person and personality good luck  The Fairly OddParents Knots Landing Pitaten Charmed Friends RuneScape quests Recurring South Park characters Joke About a Boy Theory of conduct Vegeta Kyle Broflovski Winning Streak Elvis Presley Marilyn Monroe President (game) Insane Clown Poppy Poker jargon Trailer Park Boys Ranma __ characters Social rule The Contender (television series) Doug The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Johnny Cash Alena One Tree Hill (TV series) Halloween Luck Grandview, U.S.A.

what do you think of the name emilyn its growing on me i think i like it spelled emilen better though because emilyn has emily in it so it looks like a typo with the 'n' just curious your thoughts any other names your crazy about i think it's pretty i prefer the emilyn spelling over emilen only because when i see emilen i can't help but see the name emile like emeel and then an n after it but hey that's just me we had also considered emilyn but ended up even though it's so popular choosing emily because i've always loved the name but emilyn is a very nice variation which lends a bit more uniqueness over emily while still sounding classy if i could name my daughter over i would use the name helen i think it's a beautiful classic name that definitely isn't overused  Negima Thinks ...

my parents are adopting sisters from mexico do you like the names they picked out alivya maria a leev yah adriana sarainya ah dri on ah sa rain yah our last name is varanova btw the names are very pretty i'm wondering how old the girls are though my guess is that they have names that they are already accustomed to since they'll be moving to a new country a new culture a new school and a new family i wonder if it might be comforting to hold on to something important like their first names maybe talking with the girls to discuss whether or not they want to change their names and if so to what would be a great way to show that your family values their past and who they already are congratulations and best of luck to you and your growing family  Cliff Richard Pitaten Milton H.

middle name whats a good middle name that goes with jayla i thought of jiselle and jazleen and julianna i want something a little more classic in case she doesnt like jayla she can use her middle name instead given that jayla is a somewhat exotic name you may want to go for something a little more common for the middle name if your goal is to give her an out julianna sounds fine giselle and jazleen are still pretty uncommon however you might consider how the whole name sounds together jayla julianna is a bit of a toungue twister are there any names you like that are reasonably common and start with something other than j or a j sound i think jayla's a great first name though easy to say and has a pretty ring to it  America's Next Top Model Bass guitar Chess opening Wood Atomic Kitten Milton H.

follow trends or stay traditional i am noticing an interesting trend taking place with the new babies coming into the american world their names especially those born to celebrities names like seven camera moxie crimefighter apple rocket and audio science are filling up the world you don't have to be a celebrity anymore to have a child with a rather untradtional name one couple in new zealand named their son superman after of course the name real was taken they still call him real what has happened to the brandon rachel chris and ashley's of the world are they gone forgotten when you have children how will you decide on whether to stay tradidtional and give a name with a meaning or follow the trend i think there's a middle ground in there somewhere i think names like apple rocket coco etc are not unique they're just plain retarded but i am also not a fan for the purposes of naming my own child of names like jennifer jessica and christopher they're a little too common many ppl are starting to name their children stuff like madison mackenzie aiden and hunter i think in years they're going to be like the jessicas jennifers and michaels of my school generation what i strive for with my children's name is to find something that is not exactly uncommon everyone has heard it and accepts it as a name and not an inanimate object like apple or rock lol but even though everyone has heard of it and it seems from this generation you very rarely find ppl with the name it has that unique pretty appeal without being totally out there and trying too hard to stand out  Friends Remix Days of our Lives Ashlee Simpson The Jim Rome Show AVN Awards Given name Jon Secada History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Chris Benoit Advertising The Bill Neighbours Children of Dune Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show Delta Goodrem Japanese name Skateboarding trick All My Children Jacob Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pitaten Apple Computer Another World (TV series) Unisex name Donovan The Life and Times of Juniper Lee General Hospital The Inside Hollyoaks AFI 100 Years series Alias (TV series) Tenchi Muyo!

i need a pretty baby name out of bible i would like to have one that is not used so offen no matter what the middle name will be mae both of my granma's names reading your question the first thing that came to mind was that you could combine mae and eve to get the name maeve it is beautiful and uncommon eve mary ruth sarah rebecca hannah and delilah are some biblical names that i can immediately think of how about gabrielle a feminine version of gabriel eve does not go well with your middle name but again you could consider combining eve and mae if you like the name maeve mary mae does not sound good together ruth mae does not sound good together sarah mae does not sound bad but sarah is quite common rebecca is not as common and rebecca mae flows quite well together hannah mae sounds good as well but hannah is also quite common and you said you want one that is not used often delilah is definitely not used that often and it sounds okay with mae i hope you find the perfect name and i think it is so sweet for your daughter to be named after both of her great grandmothers  Given name Tina Turner Adam and Eve Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mae West AFI 100 Years series Ryan's Hope Bible Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism EastEnders The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Original sin Everwood Prisoner (TV series) Academy Award for Original Music Score God and gender Tenchi Muyo!

do you think the name ruby sounds too old for a little girl i had a great aunt named ruby and i think it's such a beautiful name what do you think i was thinking ruby lorene ruby varia sounds like maria ruby jean let me know whenever you are picking out a name for your baby you need to keep a few things into consideration the first one is that the baby will not remain a baby so look towards the future to make sure that you feel that the name you are picking out is also good for that child grown up second keep in mind that we live in a 'harsh world' and some people can be 'very cruel' at times so give the child a name that will not deliberately produce any horrible nicknames from the bully's or any negative peer pressure we all eventually get some sort of nickname and some are cute we named our oldest daughter therese but she lost so much weight when she was first born that her clothes were so huge on her we called her big t that soon fazed out once she gained her baby weight back and started growing for awhile we just called her theresee but once she was old enough to eat candy she fell in love with reces pieces when they came out on the market all her friends started calling her that by the time she was in the nd grade and she liked it now she has shortened it as an adult to rese she uses that all the time and most of her friends don't even know her full st name ruby jean is a pretty name so is ruby lorene and ruby varia i would pick one of the ones you like that you think will be a good one for her growing up years with her friends as well as her adult years sometimes it means a whole lot to a child growing up that their name is a good one and not something that their peers laugh at or joke about for example out youngest daughter is named rebekah and we just shortened it to bekah leaving off the re in the beginning of it for her nickname everyone likes it but somewhere along the way in her growing up years she started being kidded with a chicken clucking sound to start her name like bekbekbekbekbekah for a long time she was humiliated by it and we had to help her overcome it now as an adult she can look back at it and laugh but she still doesn't like it used on her oh i also had a great aunt ruby she was a very short foot robust lady that was as big around as she was tall she had a huge bosom as well and when her babies were tiny my mom said she would rock the babies on her bosom rather than in her arms one thing i do know about naming babies you can pick a dozen names you like for them but until you see them in person andhold them the first time there is no definites that first encounter is when you know for sure what you are going to name them  Kodocha Pitaten Baby Blues Ed, Edd n Eddy Characters in the Smurfs Ranma __ characters Jean Grey Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Rugrats Our Gang Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Charmed Garfield Joke Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Spice Girls Rave Master Doug Trailer Park Boys Vegeta My Life as a Teenage Robot Transactional analysis Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing The McGuire Sisters Humphrey Bogart Treehouse of Horror V Shen Gong Wu Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire AFI 100 Years series Mnemonic Love Hina main characters Recurring South Park characters Biff Tannen Situation comedy The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Hall & Oates Buttocks Cardcaptor Sakura Stewie Griffin Marilyn Monroe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Theory of conduct Mario Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Equine conformation Quarashi Little Britain Ron and Fez Care Bears The Amber Spyglass It's Walky!

what do you think of these baby names they all include middle names none are double barrelled girls jasmine arianna scarlet jessie my middle name is jessie so i would really want to use that i do agree with ale though now i think about it scarlet jessie does sound like a stripper i believe jasmine arianna would become more classic over time scarlet jessie sounds too much like a stripper or stage name when naming a child a parent should try to look ahead especially to when the child will be going to school it is okay to be unique and creative but it is best not to go overboad with it  Striptease Once and Again Scarlet Witch Homeschooling Tori Amos Pok__mon Live!

to all those looking for name meanings check this out this is a great website to go to if you're searching for the meaning of a name i thought i'd throw this out there because i love this site and to be sure this is a question check out and the site did you like the site and was it helpful http www kabalarians com index cfm wow powerpuff girl you must have the craziest name in the history of the world although the name xxxxxxxxxx creates an active mind and a restless urge to explore new ideas we emphasize that it limits self expression and friendly congeniality with a moody disposition this name when combined with the last name can frustrate happiness contentment and success as well as cause health weaknesses in the solar plexus heart lungs and bronchial area the name of xxxxxxxxxx creates an overly sensitive nature which causes you to sense and feel far more than you can understand or put into words you have a deep artistic and creative side which shows through a love for music and literature writing is a more natural mode of expression for your deeper thoughts and feelings than the spoken word you have an ability to concentrate and work intently on anything which holds your interest however you prefer to avoid routine monotony and mental tasks  Yoga Sutras of Patanjali A Course In Miracles Meditation Philosophy of language Summa Theologiae Ludwig Wittgenstein Scientology beliefs and practices Rudolf Steiner Past teachings of Prem Rawat Freedom of speech Franz Boas Carl Jung Anthroposophy David Hume Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Rudolf Hermann Lotze Theory of conduct Arthur Schopenhauer New Age The nature of God in Western theology Karen Horney Social psychology Neuro-linguistic programming Yoga Empathy Artificial consciousness World Wide Web Asthma W.

did you pick your childs name based on his her future i have a friend who recently had a baby she and her husband made sure to name their son something that would also look good on paper as well as being masculine what i mean by this is when he applies for a job someone would hire someone named david tyler white over someone named willie bob bubba white does this sound silly or is this something that crossed your mind when naming your baby yes that was very sensible on your friends part for many reasons a child need to learn to feel a certain type of security and having a name they themselves can identify with makes them feel good about themselves the spelling of a long difficult name takes longer to learn just because it sounds good for a baby doesn't mean it will as an adult you can be judged by your name way before you show your face and it can prevent many opportunities in the future  Friends Fight Club Jam (TV series) Infantilism Social rule Charmed Hearing impairment Slow Train Coming Given name Jon Secada Time Out of Mind The Mary Tyler Moore Show I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion debate Baby Blues Fathers' rights Phoebe Halliwell The Fairly OddParents Care Bears Sex and the City Plame affair Breastfeeding All My Children Transsexuality Knots Landing Esperanto as an international language The McGuire Sisters Karl Rove Mama's Family Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Daredevil About a Boy Incarnations of Immortality Rod Stewart Spidey Super Stories Neighbours G-Man (Half-Life) Diving EastEnders Divorce Blonde on Blonde Urinary incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Spice Girls It's Walky!

please explain this naming thing i'm not trying to be snarky but to understand what is the deal with everyone wanting to have 'unique' spellings of names what's wrong with spelling the name marie why does it have to be maree or marrii or mahrhee i can understand an unusual spelling if it comes from another culture to which you or the baby's other parent belongs but not just for the sake of being different honestly i knew a fellow named kaare say it like cory and i just don't get it further i see so many questions here from people who hate their names and i wonder why parents are so keen on this whole 'different' thing baby will be different just because of who he she is all these parents trying to come up with unique names are failing to think of this does it fit a year old does it fit a year old does it fit a year old does it look good on paper ie will it stand out on a job application does it look sound professional to quote an answer from another these parents are dooming thier kids with this whackado names they come up with think of the teasing the looks your child will get the constant needing to pronounce the name give your kid a messed up middle name if you insist on being unique but leave the first name alone let it be something decent understandable normal something that when they get in to school they won't get made fun of something that when they get in to the work force an employer will look at them and say yeah strong name i bet they are a strong person not strange name bet they are a strange person  Social rule Hangul Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Kyle Broflovski Infantilism EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Friends Jon Secada American and British English differences She Loves You Sydney Riot of 1879 Milton H.
