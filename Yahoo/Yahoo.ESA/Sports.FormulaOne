what team orders did hamilton disobey i must admit i missed the race build up while i was having a massive piss now everyone is saying that hamilton disobayed team orders but nobody seems to want to elaborate on this so please help me out what did he do or not do and are team orders not supposed to be issued anyway both dennis and alonso suggested that hamilton had initially been at fault at the start of the final minute qualifying session in which the top grid positions are determined hamilton lined up ahead of alonso in the pit lane and for what the team described as fuel burning reasons he should have allowed the spaniard to pass him on his out lap the critical third phase of qualifying the top shootout takes place over minutes during which time the drivers set up their cars for the race as well as compete for the leading grid positions they must start the session with their race fuel load which is replenished at its end but can burn it off by completing more laps during the session to make the car lighter and consequently improve the chances of setting a fast time at its end dennis claimed that hamilton had broken an agreement by which alonso would have the advantage in this respect yesterday the fuel burn characteristics mean there is a small advantage which we play from driver to driver according to the nature of the circuit said dennis in this instance it was fernando s time to get the advantage of the longer fuel burn the arrangement was that we re down at the end of the pit lane with hamilton ahead of alonso so we reverse positions in the first lap that didn t occur as arranged that was somewhat disappointing and caused some tensions on the pit wall we were from that moment on out of sequence because the cars were in the wrong place on the circuit and that unfolded into the pitstops it complicated the situation into the result which was lewis not getting his final timed lap it was claimed that hamilton had ignored radio orders to let his teammate pass on five separate occasions dennis also said alonso had stayed in the pit box for the extra seconds because his engineer was waiting for traffic to clear on the circuit the stewards noted there were just four cars on track at the time of the instruction and so no need to wait for a gap in traffic this was the reason the team were handed the constructors points penalty  Formula One 2003 United States Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Fernando Alonso 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain 24 Hours of Le Mans 2005 United States Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Formula One season 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix Juan Pablo Montoya Team McLaren Formula One racing Ayrton Senna Jenson Button History of Formula One The Amazing Race Jacques Villeneuve Chris Amon Giancarlo Fisichella A1 Grand Prix 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix Renault F1 Jordan Grand Prix 2005 Monaco Grand Prix NASCAR 2004 Monaco Grand Prix 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Scuderia Ferrari Drag racing Future of Formula One Carlos Reutemann Hendrick Motorsports Traffic light Craftsman Truck Series Mark Webber British Touring Car Championship Jacky Ickx 2005 Chinese Grand Prix Football (soccer) GP2 Series Tony Stewart Mercedes-Benz Carburetor Dog agility CPU design 2005 Japanese Grand Prix Esteban Tuero Danica Patrick Jet engine 1985 Australian Grand Prix Tour de France Ben Johnson (athlete) Toyota Prius Kart racing July 2004 in sports Railway signalling Damon Hill May 2005 in sports July 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports National Football League Lore Rugby union Bowl Championship Series Poker jargon Collapse of the World Trade Center Jarno Trulli Turbocharger David Coulthard Mario Kart 64 Minardi NEXTEL Cup Pit stop Norway national football team Ron Dennis Car handling Penske Racing 2005 San Marino Grand Prix Rail terminology TGV GunBound Tiago Monteiro Swedish Grand Prix Baseball April 2005 in sports

new gearbox regulation for does anyone have any idea why the fia have taken it upon themselves to introduce yet another restriction for they are now saying that a gearbox must last for races this sport is just strangling itself with regulations any views the main reason is to bring some amount of equal footing to for the less funded teams ferrari and toyota have funds to produce and use dozens of gear boxes while the spykers or super aguri dont have such luxuries requiring long life gear boxes means only gearboxes are required for a car per season for any team and that gives some consolation to the low funded teams while f is primarily money oriented it does provide the non racing sector some technological gains now that transmission is state of the art this new rule will force metallurgy to follow suit a gearbox that lasts for four f races can comfortably last the lifespan of three or four road cars personally i'd favor reliability i have no use for a th of a second gear change when driving on road however i'd love to see a gearbox that survives my wife's driving  Formula One 24 Hours of Le Mans Manual transmission Transmission (mechanics) Future of Formula One Formula One cars History of Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Porsche 911 2005 United States Grand Prix GP2 Series 2005 Formula One season John Barnard Kart racing Nigel Mansell Automatic transmission Sport utility vehicle Continuously variable transmission WilliamsF1 Land Rover Discovery Formula One regulations Toyota Land Cruiser Locomotive Toyota Motor Corporation Porsche 993 Touring car racing Toyota Camry Chris Amon Audi R8 Automobile Headlight Mixed martial arts Drag racing Audi Michael Schumacher Mountain bike Group B BMW M5 2006 Formula One season Isetta Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Toyota MR2 Dodge Charger Toyota Prius Jaguar E-type Nissan Skyline Ford Thunderbird Ferrari Enzo Ferrari Ferrari 250 GTO Battery electric vehicle Airsoft Giancarlo Fisichella Ferrari Mondial Formula Three History of the automobile Ayrton Senna Carlos Reutemann British American Racing Honda Front wheel drive Microeconomics Sports car racing Gambling Wind turbine V8 Toyota Corolla DaimlerChrysler smart Hybrid vehicle Volkswagen Golf F__d__ration Internationale de l'Automobile Mazda 2004 Formula One season Ford Motor Company The Amazing Race V12 Halo: Combat Evolved Adventure racing Sauber Honda Civic Car handling Toyota Celica Hybrid Synergy Drive Supercar Sega Top Gear Land Rover Penske Racing BBC Ferrari Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mazda 323 Champ Car Jacques Villeneuve NASCAR Capital accumulation Ford Sierra

hamilton vs alonso all of f fans saw what happened between this two top class drivers the question is which one is the best it's alonso really scared of this young talented rookie what made him act the way he did ok i see that nobody want to answer this so i'll tell you my point of view alonso signed with mclaren until but he didn't know what's going to happen he was supposed to be the no in the team the champion titles recommending him but hamilton was the real surprise he accomplished what no man did before consecutive podiums in his rookie season but than came nurburgring a race that you can't see too often but still hamilton fought till the and what i think is that hamilton should be the 'king' of f this season clearly he is more talented that alonso is he is for the moment much better than alonso as for the second question he has every reason to be scared he isn't anymore the no at mclaren the results say so not to say that he might not even be at mclaren next year why he acted that way i really don't know all i know is that jealousy can determine a man to act very silly and that's what alonso did a silly thing it's shame that two good pilots can't get along at a team like mclaren and i can wait the and of this season although i'm not a fan of hamilton or alonso and my team isn't mclaren i hope that hamilton will finish this season the way he started  Fernando Alonso Team McLaren Ayrton Senna Michael Schumacher Kimi R__ikk__nen 2005 Formula One season History of Formula One Giancarlo Fisichella 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Scuderia Ferrari Juan Pablo Montoya Mercedes-Benz Renault F1 Jacques Villeneuve 24 Hours of Le Mans 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Jenson Button Nick Heidfeld Emerson Fittipaldi Prost (racing team) Jordan Grand Prix Martin Brundle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mika H__kkinen Penske Racing Jarno Trulli Bruce McLaren Mark Blundell Tiago Monteiro Jacky Ickx 2005 French Grand Prix Chris Amon Formula One 2005 United States Grand Prix Ivan Capelli Pittsburgh Steelers 2005 Australian Grand Prix Riccardo Patrese 2003 United States Grand Prix Nigel Mansell Boston Bruins Surtees New York Knicks Minardi New York Giants WilliamsF1 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Detroit Tigers Heinz-Harald Frentzen 2004 Formula One season International League Cleveland Browns Jackie Stewart Tony Stewart Chip Ganassi Racing 2002 Formula One season 2005 British Grand Prix Adrian Newey September 2005 in sports Los Angeles Dodgers 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix Seattle Mariners Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Stefan Johansson Cincinnati Bengals Carolina Panthers 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Mario Lemieux 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix S__bastien Bourdais Mark Webber Jody Scheckter Buffalo Bills Red Bull Racing British American Racing Super Bowl XXVII Wayne Gretzky Oakland Athletics Shaggy dog story Florida Marlins I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Masten Gregory Toronto Blue Jays Playoff New England Patriots Keke Rosberg

should we start thinking about hamilton becoming champ only once of the podium things are looking good for him if ferrari dont win i hope hamilton does well there is a good reason to say yes it is time to consider it the simple fact he's led or shared the championship lead since bahrain then tied with alonso and raikkonen and alone in front since spain i think it really is down to he and alonso now the ferrari drivers while clearly with mathematical chances to make it to the top are unlikely to gain that much with only six races remaining to have a rookie win the title would be quite something it speaks well to the development series that fuel f it says gp is a good place to learn in a near f environment heck in an f environment for many of the races it says f and before that frenault are good levels in the racing ladder of course it also says the only way to get here is with the right connections having ron dennis step in and say things in your favour like when the f seat in was given to hamilton at asm instead of the tester fernando rees who had apparenlty made a deal to get the seat for that year regardless it also speaks of hamilton's enormous talent top team or not no one just steps into f and wins their first year out unless they've got some serious capabilties behind the wheel of the car rp  Kimi R__ikk__nen Fernando Alonso Scuderia Ferrari Team McLaren 2005 Formula One season Juan Pablo Montoya Formula One Jacques Villeneuve Giancarlo Fisichella 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Jenson Button History of Formula One 2003 United States Grand Prix Ayrton Senna Jordan Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Mercedes-Benz 2005 European Grand Prix Chris Amon Jacky Ickx Penske Racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 French Grand Prix Riccardo Patrese Renault F1 Champ Car V8 Supercar Mika H__kkinen Ferrari Tony Stewart Nigel Mansell 2005 Canadian Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix 2004 Formula One season 2005 British Grand Prix Dan Gurney Tiago Monteiro Indianapolis 500 Gerhard Berger Los Angeles Dodgers Ron Dennis 2005 United States Grand Prix Mark Blundell 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Valentino Rossi Carlos Reutemann Jean Alesi Roush Racing S__bastien Bourdais Jarno Trulli Ivan Capelli 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix International League David Coulthard Prost (racing team) Narain Karthikeyan Mazda RX-7 Minardi Alberto Ascari Enzo Ferrari Justin Wilson Eddie Cheever April 2005 in sports 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Kevin Harvick Richard Childress Racing 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Masten Gregory Sauber Martin Brundle Hendrick Motorsports Jody Scheckter Emerson Fittipaldi Rubens Barrichello NEXTEL Cup Nick Heidfeld Andrea de Cesaris Tour de France Formula One regulations Honda John Barnard 2002 Formula One season Niki Lauda British American Racing Adrian Newey WilliamsF1 July 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports Heinz-Harald Frentzen Toranosuke Takagi American Championship Car Racing July 2004 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers

who is more to blame hamilton or alonso it's partly both of them to be blamed lewis seems to be getting the idea of fame to his head making lots of press statements and he seems to have become kind of stuck up alonso is 'whiny' complaining that there are double standards going on in mclaren that they are favoring lewis over him last year when he was winning he couldn't shut up for even one second he was always making headlines passing comments and basically blabbing about 'confidence' and all that but ever since the arrival of lewis hamilton that has taken the f world by a storm alonso's been really quiet lately except when he soon realize what an enormous potential lewis has got and how much his popularity is increasing rapidly after each race and seeing that lewis could beat him to clinching the world championship title then he started the double standards thing but both of them do have some issues this reminds me of the year where kimi raikkonen currently a ferrari driver and juan pablo montoya left for nascar were partnered together at where else mclaren people were excited because kimi and montoya were named fire and ice respectively but they had some ego clashes or personality clashes so they didn't get along in fact in some races apparently montoya wasn't driving his best and crashed out when it seemingly could've been avoided looks like history is repeating itself at mclaren  Team McLaren Kimi R__ikk__nen Fernando Alonso 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Juan Pablo Montoya 2005 Formula One season Formula One Mercedes-Benz History of Formula One 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix 2003 United States Grand Prix WilliamsF1 2005 French Grand Prix 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Indianapolis 500 Giancarlo Fisichella 2005 European Grand Prix Scuderia Ferrari 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix 2004 San Marino Grand Prix David Coulthard Ayrton Senna 24 Hours of Le Mans 2004 Monaco Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix Chris Amon Ron Dennis Mika H__kkinen 2001 Formula One season Renault F1 September 2005 in sports Bruce McLaren July 2005 in sports 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jenson Button Penske Racing Jacky Ickx Emerson Fittipaldi Ben Johnson (athlete) 2005 United States Grand Prix 2005 Japanese Grand Prix Tony Stewart New York Giants Ferrari 2002 Formula One season Tiago Monteiro Ivan Capelli Formula 3000 2005 Chinese Grand Prix Cincinnati Bengals Jackie Stewart Andrea de Cesaris Future of Formula One EastEnders Champ Car Hendrick Motorsports 2005 Monaco Grand Prix Martin Brundle Carlos Reutemann Gordon Banks Jordan Grand Prix Chip Ganassi Racing Roush Racing Jacques Villeneuve United States Grand Prix Major League Baseball television contracts May 2005 in sports Gerhard Berger Plame affair 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix June 2005 in sports Jos Verstappen 2004 Formula One season Detroit Tigers August 2005 in sports World Series Tris Speaker Enzo Ferrari Turkish Grand Prix American Championship Car Racing Franz Boas Drag racing Alexander Wurz Sandy Koufax Cleveland Browns Richard Petty Auto racing NASCAR Shaggy dog story Honda Alex Ferguson N__rburgring Dale Earnhardt The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)

lewis hamilton is he the biggest prick im really pissed off at how alonso was treated at the hands of lewis and his daddy on sunday at hungarian gp lewis should have never entered the pit he knew alonso was there lewis should have been penalised not alonso alonso has had nothing but problems with that smirky wee prick he has a face you want to hit good looking with a brick alonso waited to be told to go he left when he was told to lewis was told alonso was in the pit and to wait well lewis and alonso are both irritating at times in my opinion fame seems to be getting to lewis' head lately acting like he's the f king or something like that making lots of statements and starting to talk too much alonso on the other hand is complaining that there are double standards going on in mclaren this year since lewis' arrival that has taken the f world by storm alonso has been keeping really quiet unlike last year when he was leading the championship and couldn't keep his mouth shut for even one second it is not surprising that lewis and alonso both have some issues with one another it just proves that for a team to succeed they don't necessarily need the best drivers but they also need drivers with good attitude whose egos won't clash for example a few years back at mclaren some similar situation was going on the partnership of kimi raikkonen the ice man and juan pablo montoya the foul mouthed but great overtaker colombian everyone were excited about this because they were considered 'fire and ice' opposites and therefore people expected them to have a healthy competition and to be the fastest drivers on track wrong they both had some issues with each other just like how lewis and alonso have now at mclaren history repeats itself at mclaren once again  Juan Pablo Montoya 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Team McLaren 2005 Formula One season 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Formula One 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Mercedes-Benz 2003 United States Grand Prix Michael Schumacher 2005 European Grand Prix 2004 San Marino Grand Prix 2005 French Grand Prix Ayrton Senna Indianapolis 500 Giancarlo Fisichella 24 Hours of Le Mans 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix Renault F1 Shaggy dog story 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Ben Johnson (athlete) Scuderia Ferrari 2005 Japanese Grand Prix WilliamsF1 July 2005 in sports 1957 World Series Tiago Monteiro Jacky Ickx 2005 United States Grand Prix Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Jackie Stewart Jenson Button 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix Poker jargon Jordan Grand Prix Nigel Mansell World Series September 2005 in sports Emerson Fittipaldi 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Future of Formula One Adrian Newey Drag racing Chris Amon Water polo 2005 Monaco Grand Prix Plame affair October 2004 in sports Piccolo Junior Saga John McEnroe Martin Brundle Professional wrestling throws Penske Racing United States Grand Prix 2005 Chinese Grand Prix New York Giants Detroit Tigers EastEnders Major League Baseball television contracts Roddy Piper 2005 World Series Cincinnati Bengals Formula 3000 Turkish Grand Prix Shawn Michaels Sin City Mika H__kkinen Theory of conduct Los Angeles Dodgers Jos Verstappen 2004 Formula One season Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Formula One racing Hulk Hogan April 2005 in sports Jarno Trulli Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Tris Speaker Friends 2006 Formula One season The Contender (television series) Jacques Villeneuve

can't wait three weeks it's three weeks until the next race and i was just wondering what can we expect from f until then will there be more devepments regarding the whole spy scandal thing and maybe the whole pit lane incident that got so many people pissed at alonso what about the other teams i really can't wait three weeks until the next race at least it is only three weeks what are we going to do when the season is over during this time there is of course a ban on testing on track teams will continue development in the wind tunnel in simulators and with cfd computational fluid dynamics with an aim to arrive at turkey with an improved car the spy scandal may indeed be the main thing in the news but with ron dennis apparently going on vacation there may be a dearth of comments from mclaren there is of course the latest silly season rumour that alonso wants out of mclaren already so there is a good chance we'll see more stories about this i speculate that if it is true if he does indeed want out we'll get some good stories on where he has been seen and with whom i think the alonso story could prove to be the story of the three weeks actually unless of course someone catches lewis hamilton talking to another team despite his saying a few weeks ago he could spend his whole career at mclaren he's surely reconsidering that after hungary lots of off track excitement to come for sure rp  Kimi R__ikk__nen Juan Pablo Montoya Formula One Fernando Alonso 2000 Australian Grand Prix Michael Schumacher Ron Dennis Ayrton Senna 24 Hours of Le Mans 2005 United States Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Adrian Newey 2005 Formula One season Jacky Ickx Chris Amon 2005 European Grand Prix Mercedes-Benz Bruce McLaren Gerhard Berger 2005 French Grand Prix The Amazing Race 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Jenson Button Renault F1 History of Formula One Andrea de Cesaris 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Extreme Programming 2004 San Marino Grand Prix 2002 Formula One season Sex Pistols David Coulthard Social rule Spice Girls Ben Johnson (athlete) Giancarlo Fisichella Barry Bonds Scuderia Ferrari 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix WilliamsF1 Jackie Stewart Valentino Rossi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sim racing Ivan Capelli I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ricardo Zonta Damon Hill 2005 Canadian Grand Prix NASCAR Riccardo Patrese New York Giants Martin Brundle Futurama (TV series - season 2) 2004 Formula One season Jordan Grand Prix Terry Labonte Renault Ravi Shastri 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Norway national football team 2005 British Grand Prix Formula One regulations 2003 United States Grand Prix Computational fluid dynamics Top Gear September 2005 in sports Ernie Irvan Wind tunnel Indianapolis 500 British American Racing Plame affair Queen (band) Surtees Tobacco advertising Ron Weasley Tris Speaker 2006 Formula One season A1 Team New Zealand Jarno Trulli John Barnard 2005 Japanese Grand Prix Aston Villa F.C.

why is it in an f car you can take the steering off and get it replaced with a new one how does it conect to the car if you get a new one so quickly and when drivers have a crash or retire why do they take the steering off to make the most efficient use of space the cockpit is so small that if the steering wheel was not removable the driver would be physically unable to get in or out fia rules state that a driver must be able to get out without the use of a door they also say that a steering wheel must be replaced after the driver exits typically it is not a new steering wheel but the same one used over again a new one costs in the region of it has connectors that click into place so all the electronics plug in and obviously the steering column too  Formula One regulations Formula One cars Airbag Tire Steering Ayrton Senna Formula One Automobile Car handling Rear wheel drive 2005 United States Grand Prix Steering wheel Manual transmission Spark plug Scuderia Ferrari Anti-lock braking system Spy Hunter Motorcycle Driving Dodge Neon Front wheel drive Chevrolet Corvair 24 Hours of Le Mans Kart racing De Lorean DMC-12 Drifting (motorsport) Battery electric vehicle Car safety Group B Rules of the road Rapid transit Tractor Mazda RX-7 Chris Amon BMW M5 Jordan Grand Prix Isetta Dale Earnhardt Solar car USB flash drive Sport utility vehicle Drag racing Universal Serial Bus Honda Prelude Nissan Skyline Headlight Wayne Corporation Michael Schumacher Porsche 993 Citro__n 2CV Mitsubishi Starion Embedded system Airbus A320 Lincoln LS Semi-trailer History of Formula One McLaren F1 Ford Thunderbird Electronic Stability Control Auto racing 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Radio controlled car Ford Mustang Combine (Half-Life 2) Sports car Sim racing Future of Formula One Crash test dummy Roush Racing Toyota MR2 WilliamsF1 Toyota Celica Advanced Technology Attachment Lamborghini Diablo Sports car racing F__d__ration Internationale de l'Automobile Porsche 911 Nigel Mansell Volkswagen Golf Toll road Jack plug Toyota Prius Recumbent bicycle Mitsubishi 3000GT Toyota Camry Personal rapid transit RR layout School bus Honda Civic Touring car racing Spacecraft propulsion Bicycle Carburetor Sega Dreamcast Ford Cortina Volvo 200 series DVD

how is the car ferrari made the f car because i want to the how it is made the parts what they do etc the history of race car manufacture is very interesting and if you went back to the mid 's just years ago you would have found cars fabricated into a monocoque structure from alloy sheet and then riveted together just like an old fighter plane such as a spitifire a monocoque is taken from the idea of an aeroplane in which sheets of metal riveted together to form a series of box sections is both extremely strong and very light if you want to know how this works then superglue about or cardboard matchboxes together to form a square place them end up and all being well you should be able to stand on them also eggs are a kind of light strong monocoque in grand prix racing or any motor sport the most important thing is to make the cars as light and as a strong as possible and so every component uses high strngth materials but as thinly made as possible to save weight by getting the weight down to under half a ton fully laden with fuel a bhp engine is much the same as fitting am litre dragster engine into your ordinary road car this is called the power to weight ratio which in a formula one car is probably i'm not quite sure something like bhp ton whatever the exact figure it makes them quicker off the line than a jet fighter it doesn't matter what car you choose in formula because they are all made much the same these days beneath the outer panels a grand prix car is made from a modern material called carbon fibre which starts life as a mat of material a bit like fibreglass matting but of dark grey or black appearance this material is very carefully cut to shape and built up in a mould using resins to get the desired shape the whole thing is then autoclaved and when the resin hardens the material is at least as strong as steel and yet doesn't bend and crumple like steel instead it can be made to crumple and shatter in such a way that it absorbs enormous amounts of energy on impact did you see lewis hamilton drive into the tye wall at mph years ago he would have been quite badly injured but to day it is just a racing incident i'm not sure what the outer skin of the cars is made from these days but it is very likely to be a material known as kevlar or may be fibreglass whatever it is it doesn't need to be a strong as the carbon fibre monocoque beneath it which is why bits fly off when the cars hit each other weight saving applies to almost everything in a grand prix car so the suspension components are now made of the same carbon fibre the brakes too are carbon fibre because metal brake discs are very heavy things like wheels are made from light but strong magensium alloy as are many of the engine and gearbox components the major differnces between different formula cars are in the design of the suspension and the length of the wheelbase etc but especially in the design of the aerodynamics which play such an important part in making the car handle steer and accelerate better many formula car designers such as ross brawn have worked in the aero space industry and know a lot about wing design and airflow so far i've only touched on the complexities of a modern formula car which really is as advanced technologically as a nasa space craft and at the very pinnacle of engineering and design if i find any suitable web sites or think of anything really important i'll edit them into this reply and let you know but it really is amazing stuff which tests every single component to the limit  History of Formula One Tire Bicycle Car handling Solar car Welding Sport utility vehicle Mazda RX-7 McLaren F1 Chevrolet Corvette Ford Thunderbird Lamborghini Diablo Mazda Miata Drag racing Toyota MR2 2000 Australian Grand Prix Indianapolis 500 Porsche 993 Boat building Model aircraft Steel Radio controlled airplane Scuderia Ferrari Dodge Charger Terminal ballistics Metallurgy Colin Chapman Chevrolet Corvair Seismic retrofit Honda Prelude Explosive material Formula Three Diesel engine Fixed-wing aircraft Recumbent bicycle Ford Mustang Mars Exploration Rover Homebuilt aircraft Mooney M20 Monocoque Mitsubishi 3000GT Screw Airbus A380 Battery electric vehicle Heinkel He 112 Jaguar E-type Grand Prix motor racing Formula One regulations Volkswagen Golf Solar power NASCAR Hydrogen economy Iron Gasoline Wood Aluminium Future of Formula One Wind turbine Land Rover Discovery SR-71 Blackbird Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Arado Ar 80 Tank Carburetor Pagani Zonda Fuel injection Nuclear weapon design Carbon fiber Tier One Chris Amon Michael Schumacher Glass

ferrari president luca montezemolo is confident justice will be served when mclaren face the court of appeal i read this on another website that ferrari president luca montezemolo is quoted as saying we will go on with great determination and profound conviction until the end both as far as the legal proceedings in italy and england are concerned and the sporting proceedings with the hearing at the fia court of appeal for ferrari it is fundamental the whole truth about this ugly story can be seen before everybody's eyes so is he just trying put pressure on the fia to act or do ferrari have more evidence that was not submitted last time and does he really think the bernie will alow anything to happen to mclaren and lewis's championship chance because i don't think anything will happen to mclaren even if ferrari had proof they used the information i think he is trying to go above b eccelstone and try to prove what already is there mclaren was already found guilty what he is trying to get at is they deserve punishment appropriate punishment is the issue i believe he is trying to resolve  2005 United States Grand Prix Scuderia Ferrari Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Ayrton Senna Formula One Kimi R__ikk__nen History of Formula One Team McLaren Michael Schumacher 24 Hours of Le Mans Double jeopardy Judicial functions of the House of Lords Supreme Court of the United States Mika H__kkinen 2000 Australian Grand Prix Capital punishment Future of Formula One Miscarriage of justice Theodicy Jury trial New Hampshire Supreme Court W.
