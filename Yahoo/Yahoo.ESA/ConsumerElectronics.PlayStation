i want to buy a big tv for my husband he wants to watch movies and play ps please help plasmas do not burn in sorry i had to put that in capitals but that was a problem several years ago and is a non issue now many store employees say this and people believe them a little research will prove that false the only real questions that you have are lcd v plasma and the size for gaming i would reccomend plasma as it has better contrast and has faster refresh rates than lcds however plasmas do require more care than lcds lcds also deal with ambient lighting better so they will appear better in brightly lit areas while plasmas will look better than lcds when there is little or no ambient lighting if you and or your husband are willing to put the time into avoiding burn in and you tv is not in a place where is is likely ot be harmed then go with a plasma if you will have kids abusing the tv or would set up the tv where there would be alot of ambient lighting and don't mind the picture being less clear while moving then go with an lcd overall i would reccomend plasma but it will really depend on your situation as for the size it sounds like you will be going a minimun of inches so it would be best to have p support as it starts making a real difference as you go above in but you can't really tell the difference if you go less than in if you decide to go with a plasma it will be harder to find p sets but they exist even if you don't find them in your local store also use an hdmi cable if possible vga works but if you are going to go big hdmi is worth it good luck and enjoy the world of high definition  Liquid crystal display Plasma display Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Plasma (physics) Digital photography Items in the Metroid series Cathode ray tube Spacecraft propulsion Divorce CPU cache High-definition television IBM PC compatible Nuclear fusion Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Criticism of libertarianism TFT LCD C programming language 1080p RISC Langmuir probe Pixel Jet engine Surveillance Gameking Game Boy Advance Windows XP Fusion power Movie projector Password Alcoholics Anonymous Scientology beliefs and practices Estoppel Game Boy Cable television 3dfx Betting (poker) Quark-gluon plasma American individualist anarchism Quake III Arena Sega Dreamcast Poker jargon Domestic violence Directed-energy weapon Infantilism Laptop Redundant array of independent disks Sun Stereoscopy Doom 3 Plasma cosmology IMac Wood Science Light pollution Oscilloscope Sea-Monkey Color MAME Loudspeaker Fusor Explosive material Microeconomics Commodore International Aspartame Cheating in Counter-Strike Psychology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism M16 (rifle) Decompression sickness Hash table Solar power Big Bang Philosophy of space and time Project Orion Money Vacuum Halting problem Black hole Labor theory of value Wealth Social rule Laser MP3 Causality Lebesgue integration Cheating in poker Compiler optimization Child pornography Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004

do i need a chill station for my playstation i just bought a playstation and i never really used it for a very long time i have a lot of things to do can the playstation overheat do i need a cooling system for my playstation do i need a charging station for my controllers as well technically it can overheat but mine never has and i have left it on for a week straight running folding home and tehre are many people who have run f h when they're not playing games when it was availible if your ps overheats then odds are that you got one of the of all ps s that are defective whcih is really unlucky and should not be a problem to return it but odds ar that this is not the case so no you do not need a cooling system for your ps but if you are paranoid then i would reccomend the pelican one as having its own power supply prevents running the risk of chocking the power supply for the ps as was the problem of cooling systems for the as the ps only uses watts from its watt power supply during normal operation this should not be a problem anyways but a little extra protection can't hurt  PlayStation 2 Armored Core Overclocking Nuclear reactor PlayStation 3 Gas metal arc welding Super Nintendo Entertainment System Thermostat Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Poker jargon Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Betting (poker) Engine cooling Transformer Thermal power station Electronic amplifier Sega Saturn Sega R-Type Electric power transmission Star Wars: Battlefront Galileo spacecraft Effective radiated power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gas tungsten arc welding Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hydropower Xbox 360 Pump It Up Ford Ranger EV Wind power USB flash drive Traffic light Newcomen steam engine Laptop Thermal resistance Nuclear power USS Thompson (DD-627) Stroke 2003 North America blackout Norway national football team Digital rights management Psoriasis Xbox Ocean thermal energy conversion Cray-1 CANDU reactor Loudspeaker Spacecraft propulsion Air conditioning Three Mile Island Solar power Regional lockout Atari 8-bit family Water resources Environmental concerns with electricity generation Welding Amateur radio Hard disk Renewable energy Game programming Celtic F.C.

what console is better for the long run ps or xbox like graphics and stuff like that i wouldn't advise anyone to buy the or elite recently every single xbox core premium and elite has been deemed defective which will cost microsoft about to billion source http money cnn com technology microsoft charge reut index htm cnn yes the ps is better overall in terms of hardware and soon software here's some of the great things about the playstation ps can browse online ps comes with built in wifi xbox or elite don't ps has a gb interchangeable hard drive meaning you can change your hard drive with any brand of hard drive or elite don't ps online is free xbox live isn't playstation home is an interactive community of ps users where you can play games or meet up with friends and hang out at your virtual home and hang outs as well as stream live media releasing in october and is free ps can get linux and other os's installed xbox cant ps comes with a next generation disc format blu ray gigs xbox and elite are only compatable with gb dvds for games and if you're willing to pay an extra you can watch only movies on hd dvd which can only hold gb ps has hdmi elite only has hdmi ps has the cell broadband processor which consists of simutaniously working cpu's capable of processing trillion calculations per second tflops ps has the best graphics with the nvidia rsx graphics processor which pools it's ram with the cell and uses the cell processors extra processing power ps is only elite costs and lacks wifi a next gen disc format and still has that huge power brick first off the cell processor is much more powerful than the xbox 's xenon cpu in calculations per secons floating point opperations per seconds the ps maxes out at tflops or trillion calculations per second while that might not sound like allot to you that is allot of processing power the ps is even used in a project called folding home for stanford university to fold and analyze proteins for cancer research and the addition of the ps to their network just made it the most powerful networks of computers to make it also the strongest supercomputer with a max performance of a petaflop or one trillion calculations per second http fah web stanford edu cgi bin main if you're going entirely by the potential of each consoles hard ware the ps by a long shot the ps has a cpu with tons of power cores the has a xenon with cores and is actually being used to process protein folding for cancer research the gpu the rsx was said for a while that it was at a disadvantage from it's ram shortage but the truth is that sony did that on purpose so the rsx could get the extra ram and processing power from the rsx by pooling it directly into the gpu therefore the ps actually has the power to render dx like graphics tons of ps games are being released this year over of them are exclusive for just and only ps and over shared titles oh and by the way blu ray is needed a regular dvd which xbox elite uses can only hold up to gb whereas the ps has blu ray which holds gb which means the ps has much more space to hold graphic games such as resistance fal of man it took gb that's almost twice the space on a regular dvd for resistance which graphics aren't that great compared to games to come also the demo for uncharted drakes fortune doesn't even fit on a dvd games will need more space blu ray is needed full comparison of ps and xbox http www ps forums com showthread php t  Sega Console wars Sega Saturn Personal computer Microsoft PowerPC Nintendo 64-bit Commodore 64 MIPS architecture Amstrad CPC Windows 2000 X86 Amiga CPU design Radeon CPU cache Virtual memory PC Engine Atari 8-bit family Super Nintendo Entertainment System Mac OS X ZX Spectrum Overclocking Mach kernel Perl First-person shooter Embedded system Microprocessor Google Handheld game console GeForce 6 Series Game programmer Nintendo Entertainment System NX bit Mainframe computer Nintendo DS Sony Computer Entertainment Mandriva Linux Warez Sun Microsystems Timeline of computing 1990-forward AMD Thread (computer science) Doom 3 Microsoft Windows H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Laserdisc Redundant array of independent disks PlayStation (original) Counter-Strike Xbox Live Silicon Graphics Wipeout (game) TurboGrafx 16 Electronic Arts History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Game controller History of operating systems High-definition television IPod Halo: Combat Evolved Voice over IP History of Microsoft Windows IA-32

do u need a hd tv to benifit from the ps 's blue ray feture no you do not need an hdtv to benefit from blu ray sorry for putting that in bold but all of the people above me are idiots and hdtv will certainly make it look better but if that was the only advantage to blu ray then it would not be necessary the most important part of blu ray is to give game makers more space to program games are already starting to show compromise because of the limited space of dvds forza had to cut out day night cycles lair is gb rage will be on one disc on the ps while it will be on multiple discs on the pc and recent look it up the tech development tool will be big big deal right so you have discs instead of one for games like rpgs this is fine as there would only be one point in the game where you would need to switch discs for sandbox style games racers shooter sports games etc this creates a huge problem if half of the tracks teams maps etc are on one disc while half is on the other then it just doesn't work an gb game just can't be put on two gb dvds data has to be repeated for character models physics etc blu ray means no compromising on graphics gameplay scope or anything that is why blu ray is beneficial not just because it allows you to play hi def movies although that is a plus  Sega Dreamcast High-definition television DVD Computer and video games Computer role-playing game Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 Computer and video game genres Laserdisc Machinima Blu-ray Disc Game programmer Nintendo GameCube Television Robotech Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega Chrono Trigger MMORPG Extreme Programming Team Fortress Classic Counter-Strike First-person shooter PlayStation Portable SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Gran Turismo (game) Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Modchip Console game GP32 Collision detection Super Nintendo Entertainment System Unreal Tournament 2004 Karaoke Mouse (computing) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory RISC Digital rights management CPU cache Xbox Poker jargon Bicycle Baseball Sega Saturn Hard disk Neverwinter Nights Ren and Stimpy Xbox 360 Double Dragon Floppy disk Blackjack Computer Ra (board game) CPU design Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ultimate (sport) GunZ The Duel Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Visual Basic RollerCoaster Tycoon Quake Chess Cheating in Counter-Strike Amstrad CPC Compact disc Atari 8-bit family Game engine Beast Wars PlayStation 2 Starsiege: Tribes Central processing unit Georgia Institute of Technology Wheel of Fortune Level (computer and video games) Pok__mon Colosseum Final Fantasy VI Mach kernel Zerg Copy protection ATI Technologies Movie projector Technology Paper Mario Wild ARMs 2 Metropolis Street Racer Final Fantasy Betting (poker) MAME Nintendo Pok__mon Chronicles Blockbuster Video Guild Wars Natural Selection (computer game) Table tennis Macromedia Flash Half-Life 2 Jet engine Half-Life

where is the best place to buy a playstation and how much is it there if you go to any major retail store its going to be the same price you may be able to save a little money on ebay but by the time you pay for shipping it will probably be almost the same and as for the free blu ray movie deal you get that no matter where you buy it all you do visit bluraysavings com and print out an order form fill it out cut out the original upc barcode and a copy of your reciept with the total circled and send it in if i were you i would probably buy it at target only because they have cheap service plans you can buy one for the ps for and it will last years  Internet fraud PlayStation 2 Universal Product Code Hyperinflation Electronic commerce Retailer ITunes Music Store Aldi Arbitrage Wal-Mart Best Buy Blockbuster Video Neopets DVD Online shop UK Singles Chart Privatization Tesco MAME Investment bank Inflation Economy of the United States Barcode PlayStation Portable Bulk vending Deflation (economics) Amazon.com Dot-com RFID Video game crash of 1983 Li Ka Shing Philatelic investment Publishing Sales promotion FairTax Gross domestic product Surveillance Publicly funded medicine GamePark Warren Buffett Gmail Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Monopoly (game) Commodore International Great Depression Business process reengineering PostScript ISBN Delta Air Lines CPU cache Advance fee fraud Digimon Sega Saturn PlayStation 3 Garth Brooks Mutual fund Yohoho!

gb ps droped memory to how do you get back memory so i have the gb ps and only saved kb and my memory dropped to gb how can i get my gigs back btw im on my ps right now typing this does the internet take memory well to start with your ps never really had gb of hdd space even when you first pulled it out of the box the ps 's operating system takes a pretty hefty piece of that hdd space to start with then you have the firmware updates updates will take a nice chunk of hdd space as well between the os and the updates you're probably looking at about or gigs of hdd space so the fact that you downloaded kb of content and have about gb of hdd space left sounds about right surfing the web does not take up any hdd space your other option would be to install a bigger hard drive here are some tips on how to upgrade the internal harddrive gb or gb ps s ps factory harddrive specs sata rpm gb or gb capacity basically you will want to get a laptop harddrive that falls in these specs rpm speed sata interface p ata drives will not work be sure to do a system backup if possible remember that a system backup will copy your photos music videos as part of the backup i would recommend deleting all media you've added and have elsewhere off of the ps harddrive prior to a backup this will also let you make a backup to a memory stick or sd card also some game saves can only be saved to memory sticks usb drives via a system backup nfs carbon will not let you copy its game save to a memory stick or usb drive the actual removing and inserting of the new harddrive is easy on the left side is a screw that holds the harddrive cage in the ps remove the screw and pull out the harddrive and its cage take the cage off of the original harddrive and put it on the new harddrive slide it back in screw it back on and voila once you go through the system backup restore you can redownload any games from the ps store you have purchased that weren't backed up hope this helps  PlayStation Portable IPod Floppy disk Universal Serial Bus Redundant array of independent disks Modchip PlayStation 3 Apple Macintosh USB flash drive IBM PC compatible Flash memory PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay ITunes BIOS IBook Knoppix Nintendo Revolution Windows Vista Creative Zen Computer virus IMac Drill bit Digital photography Power Macintosh G3 Secure Digital card Virtual memory Western Digital ZX Spectrum History of Microsoft Windows Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Dreamcast Xbox Sharp Zaurus PlayStation 2 Mac OS X Xbox 360 Laptop Copy protection Windows 2000 Linux PowerBook Computer Timeline of computing 1990-forward Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Game Boy The Sims 2 Atari 8-bit family Serial ATA Enterprise content management Computer hardware File Allocation Table Sound Blaster Bluetooth Mouse (computing) Memory Stick Windows Me Amiga Verizon Wireless Gmail TiVo Apple II family Embedded system Amstrad CPC Backup Computer bus Malware Object Desktop DVD System 7 (Macintosh) MAME Memory card Read-only memory Macintosh Finder Intellivision Mandriva Linux Super Nintendo Entertainment System Atari ST Windows Server 2003 CompactFlash Need for Speed AmigaOS Linked list Microsoft Windows Sega Saturn Mozilla Firefox Nintendo DS SCSI Commodore International Skateboarding trick

how is ghost recon on ps i had read bad reviews for the game is it that bad how wld u rate it i thoroughly disliked it for one thing they don't show your weapon or hand when you play it's just a crosshair at the center of the screen i was really bothered by that i don't see why they dropped it it takes a lot of the realism out of the game i also didn't really like the gameplay they give away enemy positions so you don't need to proceed slowly or carefully it kind of ruins it  Cheating in Counter-Strike Quake III Arena Counter-Strike Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2 Bubble Bobble Sniper First-person shooter America's Army Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Punisher Advance Wars: Dual Strike Resident Evil 4 Halo: Combat Evolved Terran (StarCraft) Fable (video game) Starsiege: Tribes Theory of conduct Guilty Gear Star Wars: Battlefront II Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri Gameplay of StarCraft Super Mario 64 Paul W.

how will the playstation eventually get better graphics will i have to buy upgrades or what im going witht he first persons answer heres the deal game developers dont know how to make full use of the blu ray disks so they create a game and a lot of the room and capabilities on the disk are still not being used gradually they are able to slowly figure out how to utilize the drive and the developers will start making better quality games because they know how to use the extra space just look at how its worked so far the games are already much better looking that they were when it started  Atari ST IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Video game music Windows 2000 Nintendo 64 Nintendo History of computer and video games Floppy disk LucasArts Hard disk Intellivision History of operating systems Sega Dreamcast File system Amiga GamePark Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MS-DOS Sega Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Computer and video games Amstrad CPC Windows XP Commodore International Personal computer Computer Redundant array of independent disks Xbox Final Fantasy (video game) Copy protection Xbox 360 Apple IIGS Stars!

is the playstation worth the money is the playstaion really worth the hundreds it costs plus the bucks for each game at this moment i have to say no the ps is still the most expensive console on the market yet there's almost nothing to justify its price graphics wise the ps has yet to show itself capable of doing anything that the can't worse still the ps actually has a slightly older and slower gpu than the which might mean as developers learn each hardware platform later games might look better than the ps 's however where the ps is really hurting is in the games department there just aren't a lot of good games for the ps that are exclusive to the ps most of the ps 's library is shared with the for instance oblivion is available on both consoles and looks nearly identical however the is cheaper worse still some games that were originally going to be exclusive for the ps have since gone multi platform such as devil may cry metal gear solid katamari damacy and dynasty warriors gundam this is because developers aren't sure there's enough of a market for the ps to insure enough sales to make a ps exclusive title profitable while there are a whole slew of games to be released for the ps this fall and winter the isn't standing still in fact this year's most anticipated title halo is due in just a few months and will be only on the the ps has nothing in its lineup for the next months that even comes close to the hype and excitement halo has generated it could be that will be the ps 's year to shine and i certainly hope that's true otherwise the ps is going to be in real trouble as for games i don't feel any game is worth i'll definitely be waiting for game prices to come down to something reasonable like  PlayStation 2 Computer and video games PlayStation 3 Xbox Radeon Nintendo Nintendo GameCube Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Video game music Sega Sega Dreamcast Console wars TurboGrafx 16 Video game crash of 1983 Katamari Damacy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBM PC compatible PlayStation Portable Nintendo Revolution First-person shooter Handheld game console Halo (video game series) Intellivision Atari ST 3dfx Resident Evil 4 MAME History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Sega Saturn Super Robot Wars MMORPG NVIDIA History of video games (Sixth generation era) Rockstar North Microeconomics Double Dragon Inflation Nintendo Entertainment System Metal Gear Solid Atari Handheld video game Computer role-playing game Resident Evil Microsoft Laserdisc Atari 2600 Rare (video game company) Halo 2 Atari 8-bit family FIFA Series History of computer and video games Killzone Paintball PC Engine Tax Mach kernel Graftgold GeForce 4 Electronic Arts Golden Axe Graphics processing unit Console emulator CPU design Technos Japan Corporation Game development RISC Machinima Gradius GeForce 6 Series Overclocking Computer and video game packaging Game programmer Microsoft Windows Health insurance Dead or Alive (video game) EA Sports Nintendo DS Computer and video game industry Halo: Combat Evolved Video game console Computer and video game genres Amiga Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ra (board game) GamePark Neo-Geo

ps repair the controller port is broken on my ps therefore i really can't play any games does anyone know how to go about getting this repaired if it can be fixed is it expensive thanks for any help you can give me it is possible to get the ps repaired but depending on what's actually wrong with it it might just be cheaper to buy a new unit i'd call sony or go onto their website to find an authorized repair shop near you and call them about an estimate however i'm guessing they'll opt to replace the entire mainboard which will cost you most of what a brand new ps would cost if buying a new unit sounds too expensive you could also buy a used one from game stop or ebgames and save a few bucks they'll give you a warranty too  Warranty Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Digital photography Land Rover Modchip Personal rapid transit MAME Binoculars $ale of the Century Paintball Sound Blaster Loss leader Nintendo Entertainment System Space Shuttle program Videocassette recorder Auto insurance Wheel of Fortune Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Mutual fund Neopets Gross domestic product Sega Pinball Floppy disk Sony Commodore 64 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Poker jargon Best Buy Nintendo FairTax MOS Technology Ericsson Mattress Annuity Motherboard Xbox Arbitrage Regional lockout Atari 8-bit family Planned obsolescence Airbus A380 Computer and video games Pebble bed reactor Sega Dreamcast Capacitor plague Leasing Insurance Inkjet printer TurboGrafx 16 Bulk vending Zerg Computer workstation Atari 2600 Card Sharks Bicycle lighting Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Sweatshop Family Feud Dynamic random access memory Arcade cabinet PlayStation 2 RuneScape weapons Intellivision Intermediate consumption F-16 Fighting Falcon Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Sega Saturn Violin CPU design Parable of the broken window USS Walke (DD-723) IPod CPU cache Disc brake Bicycle brake systems Video game crash of 1983 Windows 2000 1919 World Series Scrabble (game show) Amiga Space elevator Cruising (maritime) Counter-Strike Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis United Artists Bob and George Inflation BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Extreme Programming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Outsourcing UK Singles Chart Social Security (United States) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sears Holdings Corporation R46 (New York City Subway car)

what sould i get a ps x box d s or a game cube help help find what i should get and like on game of the thing you picked from my things it really depends on the kinds of games you enjoy and the amount of money you can spend a gamecube is cheap cheap cheap and has pretty much been totally phased out of the nintendo lineup i'd get a wii before i got a gamecube a ds is fun and obviously portable with games that are not necessarily going to be action packed ie no halo or resistance but if you like strategy games and rpgs then a ds might be a good choice xbox is great good graphics and fun games with major titles coming out for it however i've had friends get one and then have it break on them they had to send it in to microsoft to have it fixed and waited for months for it to get back ps hasn't had those defects at least not to my knowledge the friends of mine who have it are in love with it you can download games on it just like a wii and and you can play online against other players just like just like the other two a ps is backwards compatible allowing you to play both ps and ps games this system has a ton of mature games with lots of blood and killing as does both and ps have great games like elder scrolls iv oblivion and will have other ones like assassin's creed resistance fall of man for ps is great halo should be incredible for for my money one of these two systems is where it's at both are graphical powerhouses both offer internet gaming and both have great games ps has a few more features it seems like for instance the sixaxis controller which is similar to the wii's controller in that it responds to your hand movements but the whole system costs an arm and a leg xbox plays hd dvds while ps plays bluray discs both of which are much crisper and better looking formats than a standard dvd of course you'll need an hdtv in order for these formats to fully reach their potentials and there in lies the problem one thing leads to the next with these systems you buy the system then you need to buy a new expensive tv to get the graphics to look their best and then you need to get a digital surround sound system in order to get the full effect of the sound cards on these systems so you wind up spending something like for these things i mean you can always stick with an older tv and no sound system and the games will still look great they just won't be at their best i don't know i sure wouldn't want a ds or a gamecube good luck with the decision it's an expensive one  Nintendo GameCube Xbox 360 Nintendo PlayStation 3 Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Computer role-playing game PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast Counter-Strike Video game music IBM PC compatible Sega Halo: Combat Evolved Game Boy First-person shooter Console game Console wars Xbox Live Game programming Laserdisc History of computer and video games Game programmer MMORPG Nintendo DS Halo 2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows XP ATI Technologies Atari 8-bit family Karaoke Sega Saturn The Sims Star Trek Customizable Card Game Super Nintendo Entertainment System Poker jargon Floppy disk Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Spider-Man (games) Nine Inch Nails Nintendo Entertainment System RuneScape Game Boy Advance Windows Vista Computer and video game genres Final Fantasy Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Amstrad CPC The Sims 2 TurboGrafx 16 Seventh Sea (collectible card game) History of video games (Sixth generation era) MP3 Modchip Pok__mon (video games) Video game controversy Computer Resident Evil (video game) Gradius Microeconomics Final Fantasy XI Wheel of Fortune Phantasy Star Online Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Animal Crossing Neopets Monopoly (game) Computer and video game packaging $ale of the Century Pretty Good Privacy Universal Serial Bus Microsoft Grand Theft Auto III Commodore 64 Gramophone record Blu-ray Disc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Mortal Kombat Resident Evil Theory of conduct Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Mouse (computing) ZX Spectrum Advanced Squad Leader Baseball Contract bridge VHS Regional lockout Pornography Sony Computer Entertainment Copy protection

psp question i recently bought a psp whlie trying to play final fantasy the console said i had to upgrade from kb to kb what does this mean oh and what do memory cards sticks and usb ports run the game requires an update for the firmware i suggest you update to sony downgrade to using the grand theft auto lcs umd game then upgrade to a custom firmware so you can do more if you hit the 'network update' youll automatically go up to version which doesnt allow you to use homebrew applications and play games stored on the mem stick the mem stick is required for saving games music video pictures and applications the usb port allows you to transfer files from your computer to the psp  Xbox PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 Handheld game console Universal Media Disc Homebrew (video games) Modchip IPod Sony Computer Entertainment Apple Macintosh Nintendo DS Nintendo Game Boy Sony Sega Dreamcast Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Nintendo GameCube USB flash drive Verizon Wireless The Sims 2 Nintendo Revolution ITunes Floppy disk Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Windows XP Windows 2000 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Secure Digital card Memory card FireWire Wipeout (game) Flash memory Knoppix Console game Digital audio player IBM PC compatible Mac OS X Grand Theft Auto III IMac History of computer and video games Bluetooth Linux kernel N-Gage Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Electronic Arts PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Nintendo Entertainment System GamePark Iriver Digital photography Copy protection Timeline of computing 1990-forward Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Final Fantasy VII Super Nintendo Entertainment System Regional lockout ITunes Music Store Console wars MAME PC Engine Need for Speed Steam (content delivery) PowerPC Commodore 64 Final Fantasy (video game) Creative Zen Game Boy Advance Windows Vista Counter-Strike Patch (computing) Atari ST Atari 2600 IBook TI-83 series Video game music Microsoft Computer GBA Movie Player Embedded system MSN Messenger Linux MSX PowerBook Apple II family DVD

tom clancy's rainbow six vegas or resistance fall of man for my first ps game if i get rainbow six then i can still play the resistance demo and if i like it i can buy it but there is no rainbow six vegas demo because whichever one i dont get i may never get unless i find out that resistance is amazing cause my friend gets it cause he wouldnt buy rainbow six and if i dont get it now i probobly never will i love the tactical and sqaud command but i would also play the out of control crazy isane game i cant really make a solid decision but i think im leaning more towards rainbow six vegas cause its awsome and its now or never for it and resistance ill probobly gets pushed to buy when my friend gets it but i wouldnt get it for a while cause im getting the ps this weekend with one game and then when my next paycheck comes a few days later warhawk comes out and im gonna buy it the day it does please help and please notify if you own both games cause then i can trust you better than the guy who only owns resistance and never played rainbow six and sayes its way better please dont say get both im only getting one i preferred rainbow six i'm getting tired of run and gun games there is absolutely no place to find cover in resistance multiplayer the maps are poor and you often find yourself out in the open begging to get shot i dislike all the maps and refuse to pay an extra for a map pack rainbow six offers more stuff for multiplayer you have more weapons better maps night vision heat vision snake cam ranks that unlock new stuff you can use headsets and there are more game modes i play rs all the time but only played resistance a few times before getting sick of it it doesn't make sense that your friend wants you to get resistance because you can't talk to or find him online this is all my opinion of course resistance does have a lot of cool innovative weapons and plays a lot like halo find a person and shoot em i never got into that type of game though  Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Advance Wars: Dual Strike First-person shooter Counter-Strike Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear Xbox Live Battlefield 2 Halo 2 Halo: Combat Evolved Unreal Tournament 2003 Computer and video game genres Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Quake III Arena Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Unreal Tournament 2004 SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Blood (computer game) America's Army Time Out of Mind Nintendo DS GoldenEye 007 Unreal engine Multiplayer GunZ The Duel Half-Life 2 Rainbow Six Battlefield 1942 Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

follow up opinions on the following ps ps games having just got a ps what is your opinion on the following games tekken tag tournament tekken tekken playstation i used to have tekken for the ps but i sold it when i traded my ps games for another system i'm thinking about buying tekken back b c that's one great old school game also the ps doesn't have any problems playing ps games i assume feel free to elaborate on that issue as well thanx again in my opinion the tekken series is just brilliant the best of the series is definately tekken apart from the wonderful graphics tekken also delivers a great storyline in one disc you can also play tekken and this is true i'm not lying so you don't have to buy tekken because it is in the same disc with tekken  Tekken Tekken characters Jin Kazama Dead or Alive (video game) Kazuya Mishima Heihachi Mishima Ling Xiaoyu PlayStation 3 Devil Gene Yoshimitsu (video games) Jun Kazama Computer and video game genres Namco Anna Williams PlayStation (original) Baek Doo San Lee Chaolan Capoeira Asuka Kazama Computer role-playing game Bryan Fury Craig Marduk Marshall Law (Tekken) Twisted Metal Nina Williams Fighting game The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mortal Kombat Regional lockout The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Yu-Gi-Oh!

just bought a ps ps owners your opinion i just got a new redesigned silver thin ps and i've read that it can get warm after playing it a long time have the malfunctions from previous models of the ps been corrected how long can this new model stay on without damaging the harddrive i'm not going to keep it on for a whole day or anything but do you have any input on the system's durability based on its small size and tendency to warm up while playing thanx st of all the ps doesn't have a hard drive so you don't have to worry about that the ps uses of course uses the memory cards to save game data ndly i had a ps ever since they came out in or whatever year that was and the ps doesn't over heat the only problems with ps 's were that if you constantly went from game to dvd to cd a lot you could wear out the laser that reads the discs and disc read error would come up don't worrk about it heating up i had the old boxy version and the slim version and overheating was never an issue take care  Hard disk Floppy disk DVD Compact disc Atari 8-bit family CD-R USB flash drive Commodore 64 Sega Dreamcast Nintendo GameCube IPod Gramophone record Laserdisc Booting Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family Xbox 360 Atari ST Laser PlayStation 3 Nintendo Blu-ray Disc Digital recording AmigaOS Aluminium The Sims 2 Nintendo Revolution Trusted computing DualDisc Surveillance Handheld game console Drill bit PlayStation Portable Password (video games) System/36 MiniDisc Debugging Advanced Squad Leader Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore DOS Animal Crossing Computer Computer hardware Knoppix Modchip Yu-Gi-Oh!

does your ps really damage plasma screen tvs my mom hates it when i play my ps out in the living with the plasma tv she just want us to play it either in my room or the cheep tv in the guest room not even in her room i know i kept asking my mom why and the only reason that i think is unreasonable is that ps or any kind of video games console damages the plasma screen can you please give me a truthful answer but also ones that i can prove her wrong and play in the living room again the plasma is huge its sooo awsome in the old days when you play video games you risk the chance of burn in images this was especially true when you play games on a projection screen the image sticks on the screen and there's no way to remove it games like pac man on the atari usually left images on the screen because the maze never changes with the current technology there is a very slim chance of any burn in images basically the tv should shift the images a little bit at a time to prevent the image from burning as long as you don't leave the screen on pause for a long period of time or leave the game unattended for a long time there's a very slim chance that you'll get burn in images with today's games the game world never really stays the same so it's hard for any image to burn onto the screen  Atari 2600 Handheld game console Video game console Blood (computer game) Computer role-playing game Pac-Man Halo 2 Atari ST Xbox 360 Game show MAME Intellivision Bally Astrocade Cyberspace Cathode ray tube Plasma display The Late Show with David Letterman Floppy disk Nintendo Liquid crystal display television Ms. Pac-Man Nintendo GameCube Bubble Bobble Game controller Tag PlayStation 3 Prostate cancer Ra (board game) Blue screen of death Super Mario Bros.

what's better x box or ps this is a great debate question to ask and depends on any persons interest or fanboyism you'll get alot of bias and great answers you won't go wrong with either choice the is a great system with alot of great games and excellent online service the ps is a monster hardware system with great pontential and great comming titles let me give say the cons and pros for each system so it can be easy for you to decide cons reliability issue it's hard to buy a system knowing that if it will die on you any day online servise the only con about this is that you pay for it the drive and disk compacity even though there have been great games so far on fitting in a dvd there will be a issue for space in the future the entire cost to enjoy hidef the is a great console for its price but if it can call it self next gen you can't pay for add ons like hd drive wifi and rechargable batteries in a controller ps the cost the ps is great console but to expect the mass market to pay around to dollars for a system is kind of arrogant even though you get more for what you expect from a in terms of hi def but again for a family who walks into a store and see two systems in a prices of and the choice is made clear the games for charging around you want games and the games that are out now doesnt justify that cost the development for being that powerful i heard from many game sites that's hard to develop for online ability for having online ability compare to there is no choice there pros online servise even though you pay for it the online service is great the games there are alot of great games for it and comming soon with halo and assasin creed the choice of hi def you can only pay to just enjoy the games without the cost of adding more reliability to be said the reliablity goes to question but to hear that the warranty is made to years can give comfort many of those ps blue ray to pay only for a game system with the future of blue ray is a good price capacity even though dvds are being used to make great next gen titles sooner or later the space will be needed and blue ray will be there choice the games the pontential of games comming out for the ps is awsome killzone and haze is just a couple of games i'm waiting for and more and more are comming as with game programmers are handling the ps more better online service free even thought the service isn't as great as is free and with updated constanly it someday can compare with there competition so for now the is better for my choice but with the ps and it's great games comming i can probably change my mind i'm no fanboy and i do have all three systems but i prefer the a little more than my ps  Xbox 360 Xbox PlayStation 3 Computer and video games IBM PC compatible Redundant array of independent disks Microeconomics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Saturn IPod Bicycle lighting Nintendo GameCube Nintendo PlayStation Portable MAME Embedded system CPU cache Nintendo 64 Inflation Energy development Console wars MMORPG Mainframe computer Atari ST Floppy disk MP3 CPU design Halo: Combat Evolved Windows XP Sega Atari 2600 Poker jargon Commodore International Capitalism Halo (video game series) Virtual memory TiVo Hard disk Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Video game music Microsoft RISC Intellivision Computer Economics ATI Technologies Sega Dreamcast ZX Spectrum Software engineering Linux Nintendo Revolution Computer virus Video game crash of 1983 Expert system Copy protection Game programmer ITunes Music Store Battery electric vehicle Electronic commerce Apple Computer Voice over IP Halo 2 Blu-ray Disc PC Engine Abortion debate Commodore 64 System/36 Enterprise content management Supply and demand Dot-com Counter-Strike Amstrad CPC FairTax Labor theory of value Apple II family The Sims Laptop Laserdisc Cable television Extreme Programming Machinima Electronic Arts Tax Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Central processing unit GamePark Vacuum tube USB flash drive Law of value

harry potter and the chamber of secrets in ps i need a really good guide that helps you beat the game step by step i am stuck on how to get out of aragog's lair please help me once you start small spiders will jump from aragog's web to where you're standing and attack you blast them and proceed down the ramp in front of you if you turn to the right the ramp keeps going down and ends at a treasure chest with a chocolate frog in it take the frog and climb back up then follow the trail around the trees down in a corner of the next large area is a treasure chest with a wizards card get it then burn the webbing on the wall opposite the chest and go through up on a cliff you have to jump to is a chest with another chocolate frog in it get it if you need it then continue on you'll come to a cliff with spitting spiders on the far side of a pit to your left you'll find aragog and his web burn the corner of it and he'll send more small spiders to where you are deal with them and move on past where you just burnt his web climb up the large stairs and burn the next section of his web he'll send more small spiders over move on through and you'll see a split in the trail caused by a pit in the ground take the left hand side killing spitting spiders as you go until you come to the end of the path you now have to jump across the pit onto the other side clear it of spiders first then make the leap a few steps to the left and you'll be at another pit jump to the platform on the left and then walk to the back of it you can climb up back here to find a chest with a wizards card get it then slowly climb back down the cliff you just came up jump across to the next area and burn the web blocking the way in this next room you'll see a bunch of strands of web running from above you to the ground if you touch one a spider will race down it and attack you the music will also stop and you can hear harry's heartbeat also as soon as you kill one of the spiders on the ground one will drop from above to replace it move along the right side of the room and then walk across the branch to the left side when you reach it you can use the zoom buttons to see the strands of webbing in the air so you don't run into them getting off the log is hard because there are webs connected to the far end of it run through them turn right when you hit the wall then turn left and run up the ramp to a treasure chest turn and kill any of the spiders that are following you alternatively if you have steady fingers you can try and sneak through the webs without disturbing them it's possible but hard to do in the chest is a chocolate frog now proceed back to where the large web blocks your path and burn it to proceed in the tunnel you'll come across a chest with another chocolate frog in it burn the web to the left of the chest and keep walking along you're now far below aragog's web and a new type of spider is on the cliffs ahead it's silver and will spit a paralyzing attack at you kill it and the others off quickly then move past where they were you'll come across another web barrier to be burnt out of your way go past it and move up the hill to another chocolate frog in a box get it and continue moving up the hills at the top are a bunch of puffapods and part of aragog's web on your right burn it and kill the small spiders that jump over to you stand were the webbing was and kill the spiders on the cliff to your right then remove the puffapods blocking your progress you'll now have to creep along a narrow ledge on the wall once on the other side kill the spiders in the room and proceed up the ramp on the outside wall burn the piece of aragog's web kill his spiders he sends and move to the next room kill the spiders on the wall and look for the chest to your right hidden in the bushes with a chocolate frog in it hidden in the bushes in front of that chest is another one this time with a wizards card get them and burn the final piece of aragog's web the web will no longer be able to support his weight and aragog will fall into the pit as harry stands there watching the rock ledge he's standing on gives way and he tumbles down as well you're now trapped at the bottom of the pit with aragog who isn't very happy he'll charge at you and stomp on the ground to send out a shockwave that will knock you over he will also spit poison once he's taken enough damage the only spell that will hurt him is incendio and he has to be rearing back on his hind legs exposing his belly to be hit when you hit him there's a chance of a sac of items beans wizard treats etc falling down or a spider might fall from above and attack you cast incendio to break the sac and get the items every other hit aragog will pace along the outside of the room before roaming around it again after eleven hits aragog will charge harry but ron will show up in the flying ford and get harry out after you're back on hogwart's grounds hit x in your rememberall to end the day detailed

damnit i cant decide weather to get resistance fall of man or rainbow six vegas the problem is theyre very different types of games and i want them both but dont say get both cause i dont have enough money cause im buying the ps and i need to decide between rainbow six vegas and resistance its hard cause resistance is insane action s blowin up in awsome and rainbow six is almost just as intense but its all realistic and squad based which is also awsome and rainbow six has like campaign online and ist hunt which is great and resistance only has campaign and online but resistance can be played with a friend i cant decide help rainbow six vegas can also be played with a friend and both games have campaign and in fact both games are similar in every way except for a few small things in both games you can customize a character only for online play of course but vegas has more customization options like armor weapons and scopes resistance is slightly easier since it doesnt require as much teamwork and tactical strategies as vegas resistance online has ranks you can unlock for your character and vegas has but it takes much longer to rank up in vegas than in resistance all in all they are both great games but your choice depends on what type of game you want more at the moment  Counter-Strike Star Wars: Galaxies Computer role-playing game Blackjack Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown First-person shooter Poker jargon Advance Wars: Dual Strike Diablo II: Lord of Destruction SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Battlefield 2 Fuzion Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Tri-Stat dX Guild Wars Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Star Trek Customizable Card Game Advanced Squad Leader MS-06 Zaku II Single Transferable Vote Diablo II Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

playstation i've clicked on a lot of pop ups that said they'd give me a free ps then i had to buy stuff so it wasn't really free is there a website or a place that will give away a ps for free if not where can i get it for a cheap price in bradenton fl i only have about would that be enough ignore those free ps ads they're all pyramid schemes and don't actually have to give you anything even if you supposedly finish all their requirements you can try looking on ebay craigslist or your local newspaper for cheaper ps s however with new ps s running you'll probably be hard pressed to find a ps for even then games are new and there isn't a budget line yet the games aren't old enough yet if you're looking for gaming on a budget i'd recommend getting a ps you can pick one up used for about from gamestop ebgames and they come with a warranty there are plenty of excellent games that are between or less if you buy used games there should be plenty there to keep you busy until the ps drops in price to something more reasonable and there's more games available for it  PlayStation 2 TurboGrafx 16 Internet fraud MapleStory Theory of conduct Craigslist Microeconomics Grand Theft Auto III Regional lockout Poker jargon MAME PlayStation 3 Xbox Bubble Bobble IBM PC compatible RuneScape skills N-Gage RuneScape quests Warranty Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Video game music Resident Evil (video game) Auction RuneScape cheats Food and Drug Administration Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Satchel Paige Sega 32X RuneScape economy Economics Extreme Programming Aerial (dance move) Wal-Mart Bulk vending The Standard Mouse (computing) Handheld game console Airsoft Web traffic Game show Yu-Gi-Oh!

does anybody know where i can pre order the new psp slim daxter core package online or in store please help because i have checked a lot of places if any store is taking preorders for the psp slim it's likely to be gamestop the best bet is to stop by a store and talk to a salesperson if they're taking preorders they'll let you know then if not they may be able to tell you a date when they will start taking preorders keep in mind that gamestop com web site is usually way behind the stores when taking preorders so stop by a store and ask there the web site may begin taking preorders as well but likely much later than when the stores do for online preorders try play asia http www play asia com paos en psp slim o html although play asia currently says the preorders are coming soon  PlayStation Portable Nintendo DS PlayStation 2 Website HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Star Trek Customizable Card Game Specialization (pre)order HTTP cookie Web server Apache HTTP Server Internet fraud Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire HTML element Mozilla Firefox XML Handheld game console Squid cache Binary tree Internet forum Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Electronics Boutique HTML CPAN PlayStation 3 Uniform Resource Identifier Paintball Internet N-Gage Pok__mon (video games) Gopher protocol Field of sets Stopping e-mail abuse Mozilla Application Suite Cross site scripting Digest access authentication E-mail spam Electronic commerce JavaServer Pages Electronic Arts Uniform Resource Locator Jak II Windows XP Google search XHTML Gmail PHP Ebook Preference Web browser Xiangqi Unicode and HTML Guitar Slim REBOL Interior algebra Poker Surreal number Domain Name System Draw poker The Inside Virtual hosting Breath of Fire III WebObjects Computer virus Mydoom Web cache Podcasting JADE programming language Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Best Buy Scalable Vector Graphics The Sims Compilation of Final Fantasy VII Web portal RSS (file format) Wget Internet privacy Tesco Order theory Emacs Enterprise content management Argos (retailer) Genealogy Sony Computer Entertainment Europa (wargame) Streaming media AOL Instant Messenger ITunes Discogs Resource Description Framework Concurrent Versions System Spider-Man 2 Web hosting Web application Jak and Daxter CPU cache Online shop Common Unix Printing System Mega Man Legends

are ps games playable on a ps yes however because the ps uses software emulation to pretend its a ps or ps there are currently some games that may not run perfectly apparently sony decided it wasn't cost effective to include the chipset from a ps slimeline as originally planned hence the software emulation instead the good news is that it's mostly ps titles that are effected rather than ps and sony are constantly releasing firmware updates to gradually rectify this issue  Nintendo Revolution Modchip PlayStation Portable Nintendo PlayStation 2 Apple Macintosh MAME PlayStation 3 Regional lockout Amiga Xbox Sound Blaster Nintendo DS MSX Emulator DVD Resident Evil (video game) IBM PC compatible Nintendo Entertainment System Sega ATI Technologies Sega Saturn History of computer and video games IPod Console emulator Wine (software) Maxis Verizon Wireless Tungsten Handheld Microsoft Linux Action Replay Microprocessor History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Descent (computer game) Commodore 64 Championship Manager Apple II family AmigaOS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Dreamcast MMORPG Resident Evil Adventure game Copy protection Computer and video games Ultima Online Final Fantasy VI MIPS Magnum PlayStation (original) BIOS Game Boy Advance MIPS architecture Rootkit Patch (computing) Debugging Teletext Spider-Man (games) Sony Computer Entertainment Wipeout (game) ZX Spectrum GP2X Xbox 360 Abandonware Atari ST Mac OS X Microsoft Windows Game Boy Apple Intel transition Blu-ray Disc Anti-virus software Platform game Final Fantasy II SAM Coup__ Commodore International Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII CD-i Final Fantasy VII Computer software Nintendo 64 Mega Man Legends Mozilla Firefox Enhanced remake Homebrew (video games) Rambus Colecovision Sensible Soccer Universal Media Disc GBA Movie Player FireWire Doom Rare (video game company) Half-Life Intellivision Game demo TiVo TurboGrafx 16 NVIDIA Berkeley Software Distribution

ps or xbox can you please compare the two well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives around christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword killzone metal gear solid etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series get the ps its better in the long run for the games you like too  Xbox Live PlayStation 2 Computer and video games Halo: Combat Evolved Halo 2 Halo (video game series) Video game music Wipeout (game) Nintendo GameCube Nintendo PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast Machinima ATI Technologies Counter-Strike IBM PC compatible Dead or Alive (video game) Final Fantasy XI Sega Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ninja Gaiden History of video games (Sixth generation era) Microsoft Sega Saturn Gradius History of computer and video games Game controller TurboGrafx 16 Microsoft Windows Modchip Timeline of computing 1990-forward Killzone Atari 8-bit family Console game The Sims MMORPG Apple Macintosh Phantasy Star Online Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Lightsaber DVD Game Critics Awards Game Boy Advance Marathon (computer game) Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus Pump It Up Need for Speed IPod Nintendo 64 Computer and video game genres Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Nintendo Entertainment System Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Sega 32X Metal Gear Radeon FIFA Series Voice over IP Computer role-playing game Intellivision Super Robot Wars Madden NFL Final Fantasy Bungie Studios Windows 2000 Laserdisc Nintendo Power Bicycle lighting Star Wars: Galaxies NVIDIA Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield History of Microsoft Windows Sonic the Hedgehog N-Gage Star Wars: Battlefront Game Boy Ninja MAME Windows Vista GunBound MechAssault Electronic Arts Shen Gong Wu

every is saying get a hd tv but i ain't got a hd tv and i think the graphics on my ps r great wat u reckon the longer you wait to buy hdtv the cheaper it will be when you do get it i say when you do get it because hd is a step up its much better than non hd but enjoy yourself and save up and buy the best hd you can when the prices come down rather than getting a inferior one at the earliest chance p is as much or more of an improvement on p as is over normal tv the following quote mentions that lack of a source makes many uses of hdtv irrelevant this is not the case for watching blueray discs or playing games on a ps the ps is a hd source advantages of hdtv expressed in nonengineering terms high definition television hdtv potentially offers a much better picture quality than standard television hd's greater clarity means the picture on screen can be less blurred and less fuzzy hd also brings other benefits such as smoother motion richer and more natural colors surround sound and the ability to allow a variety of input devices to work together however there are a variety of reasons why the best hd quality is not usually achieved the main problem is a lack of hd input many cable and satellite channels and even some high definition channels are not broadcast in true hd also image quality may be lost if the television is not properly connected to the input device or not properly configured for the input's optimal performance  High-definition television Laserdisc Television Mouse (computing) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital television Atari 8-bit family Cable television Digital photography Ethernet Oscilloscope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Dreamcast SCART Video codec Artificial neural network Audiophile Amstrad CPC IBM PC compatible Karaoke Nintendo Revolution Widescreen Carburetor ATSC Computer Atari ST CPU design TiVo Central processing unit Satellite television Video PlayStation Portable Color Hard disk Gramophone record ATI Technologies Synthesizer British Sky Broadcasting Frame rate Handheld game console Xbox Commodore 64 USB flash drive Nintendo 64 Solar cell Infantilism Game Boy CBS Windows Vista Console game Digital Xbox 360 Sega CD High fidelity Poker jargon PlayStation 2 Dolby Laboratories PNG Publicly funded medicine Super Nintendo Entertainment System NTSC Movie projector Gross domestic product Coaxial cable Sound Blaster Digital cinematography Digital cinema Home cinema Free trade MAME Transistor Operational amplifier Terrestrial television Electrophysiology History of Microsoft Windows Law of value Federal Communications Commission Floppy disk Radeon Advanced Technology Attachment System/36 Second language acquisition Videotape IPod Warez Enterprise content management Liquid crystal display Pixel Jack plug Nintendo GameCube

will there ever be a vibrating controler for the ps i heard that iit is comming out with the new gig ps that's what someone on here said but sony never said it was coming out on the gb version because the gb is already out and there's no mention of the vibration function eventually the sixaxis will have vibration function supposedly immersion already gave a blueprint to sony about how to put the rumble in the sixaxis it's taking so long because sony might have to reconfigure their manufacturing plants because of the rumble or sony knew what it was talking about when sony said that the rumble was going to interfere with the sixaxis the blueprint that immersion gave isn't working so immersion is still working on it  DualShock Sony Resident Evil 2 PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Game controller Floppy disk Rodney Anoai Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast Good Vibrations Resident Evil (video game) Rez Baptism Subwoofer Strap-on dildo Kurt Angle Sony Corp. of America v.

sega is king poor sega it was once king of the playground with its legendary genesis but then came the saturn and failed then the dreamcast fought but but was destroyed by the ps until it eventually became a software company not a hardware a software its a very sad time for sega they're even making a game with nintendo they're old rival before the end of the year with nintendo characters and sega characters just to survive my question is this do you think sega will somehow find the revenue arise from the flames look at microsoft sony and nintendo's face and fight back with a new console or will it survive for a few more years until it eventually dies also would you like to see a new console from sega if they got the revenue sega won't come back technology changes daily sega hasn't done hardware in so long they won't know what the hell happened while they were gone sega is now a software company becoming a hardware company again would be more expensive than they could ever handle what people should question is if one of the big three were to fall what company would replace them i think microsoft might be pushed back out of hardware after their got a failure rate and after ipod shunned zune out of the market microsoft might stop with the hardware  Sega Nintendo Sega Dreamcast NVIDIA Sega Saturn Computer and video games Console wars Sega 32X Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Revolution Nintendo 64 Sega CD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of video games (16-bit era) History of video games (Sixth generation era) Sega Master System TurboGrafx 16 Video game crash of 1983 Spider-Man (games) Resident Evil Code: Veronica Virtua Fighter Super Nintendo Entertainment System Video game music Handheld game console SNK Playmore Mortal Kombat PlayStation 3 History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) PlayStation 2 Rare (video game company) Resident Evil Atari Jaguar Ecco the Dolphin Resident Evil (video game) Microsoft Console emulator Yu Suzuki Video game console Atari N-Gage Console manufacturer Platform game Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone Sega Game Gear Tetris IBM PC compatible Nintendo DS Sonic the Hedgehog series Home computer Sony Computer Entertainment GameFAQs Sonic Adventure King of Fighters Analog stick Sonic the Hedgehog Action Replay Video game publisher 3dfx Console game Sakura Wars Golden Age of Arcade Games FIFA Series Resident Evil 2 Handheld video game Apple Computer Streets of Rage Road Rash Modchip Doom Commodore C64 Games System IPod Atari 8-bit family Game Boy Advance Street Fighter EA Sports Double Dragon Lunar series Bish__jo game Acclaim Entertainment Bubble Bobble Versions and ports of Doom Quake Nintendo Virtual Boy Linux kernel Commodore 64 ROM image Jeopardy!

whats better xbox or ps you see i have a wii already but i'm looking for something different and i'm having some trouble deciding between xbox and a ps so could i get some help well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives by christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword ratchet and clank future tools of destruction the getaway white knight story afrika tekken etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series go for the ps its the way to go if you cant between both yes the is a good console but the ps is more superior and will be better in the long run  Halo: Combat Evolved Xbox Live Computer and video games Halo (video game series) Wipeout (game) Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Dead or Alive (video game) Sega Dreamcast Nintendo Revolution Video game music Machinima PlayStation Portable First-person shooter Counter-Strike Nintendo DS IBM PC compatible Microsoft Ninja Gaiden Sega Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Console wars History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gradius History of computer and video games Game controller TurboGrafx 16 Need for Speed Windows XP DVD Modchip The Sims Microsoft Windows Lightsaber Timeline of computing 1990-forward Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh MMORPG Console game Phantasy Star Online Sonic the Hedgehog Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Computer and video game genres Game Critics Awards Marathon (computer game) Computer role-playing game Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal Game Boy Advance Sega 32X Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Windows 2000 Universal Serial Bus Pump It Up Nintendo 64 Bungie Studios History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo Entertainment System Final Fantasy Mouse (computing) NVIDIA Super Robot Wars IPod MAME PowerPC Intellivision FIFA Series Blue screen of death Resident Evil Voice over IP Madden NFL Radeon Ninja Game Boy Star Wars: Battlefront Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Grand Theft Auto III Nintendo Power History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) MechAssault Electronic Arts Shen Gong Wu Game programming Yu Suzuki DirectX DualShock

does the ps need to be pluged in to an hd tv i want to get a ps but does it have to be pluged in to a hd tv or will any tv or dvd player work the cable that comes with the playstation is your standard composite cable that cannot output in high def this works fine for standard tv though if your tv supports component you should use that as the improvement in picture quality is noticeable having said that the playstation was designed to be a hd device and the quality you get with hdmi or even component and a hd tv is simply amazing and vastly better than what you get on sd tv if you don't plan on getting a hd tv soon i would certainly be getting a component cable for the playstation assuming your tv supports it  DVD SCART PlayStation 3 Television Xbox High-definition television Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable RCA connector Loudspeaker Video codec PlayStation 2 Xbox 360 Audiophile Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis High-Definition Multimedia Interface Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Revolution Composite video MIPS architecture Nintendo Entertainment System High fidelity RGB color model Electronic amplifier USB flash drive Sega Dreamcast H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Karaoke Phonograph Handheld game console Advanced Technology Attachment S-Video S-VHS Dynamic random access memory Optical fiber Ethernet NTSC Final Fantasy IX Anamorphic widescreen Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wind turbine Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting S/PDIF Sony Enterprise content management Video game console Operational amplifier Computer and video games Industrial engineering Camcorder Gramophone record Advanced Audio Coding R-Type Armored Core Home cinema Java programming language Carburetor Atari 8-bit family Sound Blaster IEEE 802.11 RISC Quality control Component video Home Box Office Gross domestic product OpenGL Spider-Man (games) Super Nintendo Entertainment System European Installation Bus Transformer Bluetooth Regional lockout Cable television Surface-mount technology Dolby Laboratories FireWire Electronics Computer-aided design YUV Digital circuit Software architecture Computer Atari ST Synthesizer RS-232 Oscilloscope Inflation MIM-23 Hawk Incandescent light bulb Nintendo DS Amstrad CPC Compact disc MPEG-2 IPod Archos VHS Widescreen Game Boy

how many of you like the legend of zelda twilight princess i'm thinking about buying it for gamecube and i want to know what you thought of it legend of zelda twilight princess is my favorite game ever it's also my first zelda game i played it on the wii but the gc version has the same graphics sounds story etc just that the both versions are mirror images of each other so if you're on wii the desert is on the east side of hyrule but on gc the desert would be on the west same thing with items in the maps even midna's helmet covers her left eye in gc and her right eye in wii i love twilight princess for these reasons awesome storyline the detail is great the characters are great and the twilight realm is an awesome addition to the loz world wolf link is also really cool as is midna great graphics although it's a cube title it shows that a system doesn't need to have a cell chip or some burn a hole in the floor if not properly cooled graphics processor to render nice graphics the texturing is really what does it for tp awesome controls though you won't get the full experience in gc but the wii controls fit a zelda game perfectly from slashing swords to aiming arrows woah i used some literary junk there and i hate english class the wiimote does it all great music and sound effects the music brings back some oot songs though since tp was my first zelda game i didn't recognize it until after when i played oot in an emulator i want to get it for vc though and the sound effects are great overall twilight princess is the best game you'll ever play unless you already have oot set in your mind as the best game ever it might only be second best but in my opinion tp beats oot i'd definitely get it even if you get it for gc  Link (Legend of Zelda) The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda series enemies Ganon The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Legend of Zelda The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Legend of Zelda series songs Koji Kondo Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Super Mario 64 Hyrule BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Nintendo 64 Nintendo Revolution Sacred Realm Fire Emblem Alan Moore Master Sword RuneScape Super Smash Bros.

playstion games can u play all the playstation games on the ps aside from the ps ones like psx and ps and what is psx is that the same thing a ps the ps is supposed to be able to play all psx games but i think a few might have slipped through the crack and it isn't capable of being played on the ps psx is the same as the original playstation or ps the reason psx is used is because when the original playstation got a redesign sony called the new playstation the playstation one so sony and most people labeled it as ps see how this can be confusing so to distinguish between the two the original playstation became psx and the playstation one became ps but it doesn't really make a difference because the psx and ps are just the same but with different designs in japan there is a psx which is really a ps with dvd recording capabilities  Sony Computer Entertainment PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable PlayStation (original) Soul Edge Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete Final Fantasy VI Metal Gear Solid Sega Saturn Final Fantasy VII Gradius Computer and video games Game controller Sega Handheld game console Nintendo Revolution Grandia (video game) Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete Super Nintendo Entertainment System Resident Evil 2 Ken Kutaragi Nintendo GameCube Regional lockout Tales of Eternia Chrono Trigger Sega Dreamcast Final Fantasy (video game) DVD Xbox 360 Final Fantasy IX Final Fantasy V Application programming interface Resident Evil (video game) Blu-ray Disc Nintendo Entertainment System Chrono Cross Copy protection DualShock Sony Sister Princess Final Fantasy Origins Xbox IGN Nintendo Computer role-playing game Video game music Crash Bandicoot Mega Man Legends Final Fantasy Anthology Nintendo 64 MAME Puyo Pop Fever PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Final Fantasy II EyeToy Resident Evil 4 Resident Evil Code: Veronica Snatcher History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Lunar series Legacy of Kain Modchip Final Fantasy IV Compact disc Console wars Mega Man Classic Rockstar North Wipeout (game) AIR (game) Dragon Quest Game programmer Square Co., Ltd.

what is better ps or xbox based on graphics gamplay games and for the long run i need to no before tomorro well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives by christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword ratchet and clank future tools of destruction the getaway white knight story afrika tekken etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series  Halo: Combat Evolved Computer and video games Xbox Live Halo 2 Halo (video game series) Wipeout (game) Nintendo GameCube Dead or Alive (video game) Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast Nintendo Video game music First-person shooter PlayStation Portable Counter-Strike Machinima ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Ninja Gaiden Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Final Fantasy XI Microsoft Sega History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gradius Console wars History of computer and video games Sega Saturn Microsoft Windows TurboGrafx 16 Windows XP Need for Speed Apple Macintosh Game controller Timeline of computing 1990-forward MMORPG Atari 8-bit family Lightsaber Modchip Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Marathon (computer game) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Phantasy Star Online The Sims Game Boy Advance Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) Game Critics Awards Super Robot Wars DVD MAME FIFA Series Radeon Sega 32X Resident Evil Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Sonic the Hedgehog Intellivision History of Microsoft Windows NVIDIA Pump It Up Universal Serial Bus Handheld game console Grand Theft Auto III IPod Game programming Nintendo Entertainment System DirectX Atari ST Voice over IP PowerPC Yu Suzuki Blue screen of death Ninja Mac OS X Madden NFL Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Nintendo Power Star Wars: Galaxies Thunder Force MechAssault Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Electronic Arts History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Laserdisc

ps or xbox please please give me answers on this because i need to choose by tomorrow well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives around christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword killzone metal gear solid etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series get the ps its better in the long run  Halo 2 Xbox Live Halo: Combat Evolved Computer and video games Halo (video game series) Wipeout (game) Video game music Nintendo Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube First-person shooter Sega Dreamcast PlayStation Portable IBM PC compatible Machinima Counter-Strike ATI Technologies Final Fantasy XI Console wars Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Ninja Gaiden History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gradius Microsoft History of computer and video games TurboGrafx 16 Microsoft Windows Modchip Timeline of computing 1990-forward Killzone Atari 8-bit family DVD The Sims Console game Lightsaber MMORPG Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Apple Macintosh Marathon (computer game) Phantasy Star Online Pump It Up Nintendo 64 Computer and video game genres Metal Gear Game Boy Advance Mouse (computing) Radeon Computer role-playing game Universal Serial Bus IPod Need for Speed Super Robot Wars Bungie Studios Windows 2000 Bicycle lighting Intellivision Final Fantasy Metal Gear Solid Nintendo Entertainment System Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Sega 32X Nintendo Power Grand Theft Auto III Star Wars: Galaxies FIFA Series Voice over IP Blue screen of death Shen Gong Wu Laserdisc NVIDIA Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield MAME GunBound MechAssault History of Microsoft Windows Resident Evil Sonic the Hedgehog Yu Suzuki Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Star Wars: Battlefront Airsoft Ninja Game programming Game Boy
