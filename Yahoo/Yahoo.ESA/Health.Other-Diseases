i am so worried can there be something done hi everyone it's me john i am here to complain about my vision problem and i need to know if they're any help available for me i am physically challenged and my vision is becoming worse due to excessive floaters my vision is fine as far as i am concerned just the floaters that are causing complication and annoyance i was told by my eye specialist that the floaters would gradually disapear on their own like fall below my vision i asked how long this will take and they told me approximately one year or two when i first suspected a floater it looked like a tread it was not a problem at first but gradually over time the tiny little tread has become a massive cobweb covering up my beautiful vision my eyes are corrected to with glasses but when the cobweb comes across my vision my vision would be less than very poor this causes problem for me to drive at nights and even to see road signs correctly like the small road signs i have been having floaters in both eyes now for years and they only get worse i have my eyes checked on twice a year and the doctors told there is nothing they can do to remove floaters unless they blast them which will make things worse than it is the floaters were the reason i had a hard time passing my vision test at the dmv department to obtain my driver license at that time i had to wait a few seconds for the floaters to completely move out of my vision in order to read the little letters at dmv which i successfully and luckily passed however the floaters has become worse now and i might be unfortunate this year to pass my dmw vision test to renew my driver license the floaters make driving at nights risky and difficult so that s why i do not drive at nights under no circumstances tell me what help you think i can get thanks john ps the doctors said i have no other vision problems so i won't go blind my mom had problems with large floaters in one of her eyes it turned out that her retina was detached and she had it corrected with an operation i would suggest checking with your doctor but i see from reading your question you have seen your doctor several times i guess the next time you go ask if your problem could be a detatched retina i hope they can find the problem and that your vision will eventually become fixed  Floater Eye Diabetic retinopathy Myopia Color Debugging Poker jargon Driver's license GED M16 (rifle) Glasses Floppy disk Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Retina Eyeglass prescription Driving Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Volleyball Apollo 8 Carburetor Light pollution Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pitaten Big Brother (USA TV series) Love and Theft Drunk driving (United States) Heinkel He 112 Conspiracy (TNG episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Combine (Half-Life 2) Tire The Shining (film) Philosophy of perception Chris Amon Car handling Sin City Collision detection Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Color blindness Kasparov versus The World Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer God Emperor of Dune IBM PC compatible Spacecraft propulsion Bike lane debate Second Battle of the Atlantic Operation Market Garden Web crawler Jam (TV series) Dead Like Me A Canticle for Leibowitz Urinary incontinence File Allocation Table Mach kernel Electrophysiology Heinkel He 100 Bicycle lighting Automatic number plate recognition Phoebe Halliwell Hard disk The Book of Five Rings Hypoglycemia Grand Prix Legends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule National Hockey League All-Star Game Fast bowling Chronic fatigue syndrome Refractive surgery British Free Corps Year 2000 problem Medicine Michael Schumacher Doctor (Doctor Who) Road-rule enforcement camera Traumatic brain injury Traffic light Logopolis Medicare (Canada) Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Spatial disorientation Multiple sclerosis Jumpstart 3rd Grade Health insurance Loudspeaker Speed of light Nuclear power Parallax The Lovely Bones

my sister can keep any food down what is going on with her whenever she eats it all comes back up and it's not like she's throwing it up it just comes up like spit she has acid reflex but the doctor said that it's not it the doctor can't figure out what is wrong with her she is not bulimic she has lost pounds so far and is getting skinnier every day if anyone has any suggestion as to what might be wrong with her please tell me she's been taking medicine but it doesn't work she's had test done on her and nothing has come up and she has seen a stomach specialist when we swallow the food goes down into the esophagus and into the stomach between the stomach and the esophagus there is a muscle that usually helps to keep the contents of the stomach from going back up into the esophagus when it is weaken this causes the acid in the stomach to go into the esophagus and damage the tissues usually the doctor starts patients on mild things like pepto bismol and other over the counter items but when the acid become too severe he starts them on drugs like proton pump inhibitors to prevent the stomach tissues from making so much acid and gives the esophagus time to heal proton pump inhibitors are drugs like prilosec people who have acid reflux for some time that is not treated properly can start to feel like they are gagging or start to throw up usually the most damage is done at night when someone is asleep because they are in a level position the acid can move into the esophagus and up to the throat and even into the lungs i am posting a site here and recommending that you read the part on heartburn and reflux and then also the section on barrett's esophagus this takes a little time to load completely this is an excellant on line site that explains things in plain english it also give tips on what a person can do to help themselves http www gicare com pated ecd htm i had this problem also where i just start to throw up not even trying to do so i would just cough and up it came i hope the tips they give you here will be of some help to her testing usually they start out with an upper gi where they give you barium to drink and you stand behind an xray type machine to see how the contents you drink is going through then they usually move to an endoscopy procedure where they numb the throat with medication and place a tube like structure into your mouth and down to the stomach so the doctor can see what is wrong you are sedated and don't really know much after you are asked to swallow they can view the whole inside area because there is a scope with a camera and light on the end and it send pictures to a computer like monitor screen it is a little uncomfortable but is the best test to have they will usually show you pictures of your insides when they explain what is wrong an added note she needs to keep trying to swallow when she throws up she should try to keep sipping something to try an make her muscles work in the opposite direction try to take a sip every minutes it might help to lessen the chance of throwing up the medication might not help if she isn't able to keep it down when i first had my problem they gave me a clean slate also i was retested about three months later and that is when they saw what was going on  Urinary incontinence Esophageal cancer Gastroparesis Prostate cancer Esophagus Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Cancer of the larynx Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Peptic ulcer Breastfeeding Radiation therapy Stroke Proton pump inhibitor Pneumonia Medicine Hydrochloric acid First aid Achalasia Folic acid Feeding tube Obstetrics Barrett's esophagus Fecal incontinence Drowning Shock Traumatic brain injury Colorectal cancer Paget's disease of bone Vomiting Clinical depression Cocaine Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Myocardial infarction Lung cancer Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Adjustable gastric band Endoscopy Chronic fatigue syndrome Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Professional wrestling throws Common cold Paracetamol Psoriasis HIV test Antiretroviral drug Bipolar disorder Vitamin C Anorexia nervosa Dialysis Professional wrestling holds Weight training Cirrhosis Obesity Sleep apnea Aspartame Spina bifida Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Surveillance Stomach Epilepsy AIDS X-ray Chemotherapy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oral sex Tooth H2-receptor antagonist Caffeine Diabetes mellitus Gout Antidepressant Hiccup Tobacco smoking Alcoholism COX-2 inhibitor Theory of conduct Fugu Social rule Diabetic retinopathy Osteoarthritis Terri Schiavo Enzyme Diving Ionizing radiation Humphrey Bogart

why is it that when someone smokes cannibus their throat hurts im just doing a school project and cant find anything about it see its weird because as a regular cannibus smoker myself i rarely ever get sore throats anymore but last night i made a water bong that was for lack of a better word amazing and it gave me a super sore throat smoke is an irritant that means that some chemicals in the smoke attach themselves to the cells that line the smoker's throat when that happens the epithelial cells of the mucous membranes release chemicals called cytokines which mobilize the immune system to scavenge up and neutralize the irritating chemicals part of the process of mobilizing the immune system is another process known as inflammation the tissues become reddened and more sensitive sometimes exquisitely sensitive to stimuli most of which will be perceived as more or less painful  Cancer Asthma Immune system Inflammation Cannabis (drug) Tobacco smoking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Allergy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Autoimmune diseases Antibody Pain Epithelium Pneumonia Cocaine Radiation therapy Immunosuppressive drug Bong Colorectal cancer Methamphetamine Group A streptococcal infection Common cold Traumatic brain injury Cell (biology) Pharyngitis Wound healing phases Cancer of the larynx Lung cancer Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Cytokine Crohn's disease Hay fever Pulmonary alveolus Multiple sclerosis Signal transduction Mast cell Health issues and the effects of cannabis Hydrochloric acid Glucocorticoid Conjunctivitis Oral cancer Bronchitis Biochemistry Muscle Cell membrane IgA nephropathy Gonorrhoea Medical analysis of circumcision Tocopherol Cytomegalovirus Secretion Formaldehyde Bromine Coeliac disease Bone marrow transplant Macrophage Smoking pipe Protein Kaposi's sarcoma Cyanide Foreskin Eye Chlorine Insulin Alzheimer's disease Capsaicin Body piercing Anthrax Basophil granulocyte AIDS Infectious mononucleosis Retina Addiction Hand grenade Major histocompatibility complex HIV Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Nutrition Kidney Endometriosis Ulcer Fecal incontinence Histamine Childbirth Enzyme Toll-like receptor Medical cannabis Pepper spray Antiviral drug Ulcerative colitis T helper cell Cannabinoids DNA repair Whole proteome analysis Itch Nicotine

fibromyalgia i went to the doctor today and he diagnosed me with fibromyalgia and ran a test for osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are these standard tests with this condition it worried me a little bit and i forgot to ask him does anyone know what to expect with fibromyalgia hi im chris i think what your dr is doing was the most responsible and proper thing to do and he is keeping up with what is going on in research according to the guidlines of the autoimmune asocssiation first he is checking for ostaoarthritis because most adults do at some point end up with it because of childhood early adult injuriers in my case it was found from a fall taken in my early 's and i needed minor surgey to clean up some bone spurs from a broken collarbone i never knew i broke about the fibromyalgia rhuematoid arthritis and lupus ra and lupus are already known autoimmune diseases which means an inside invader our own cells are attacking each other for an unkown reason mainly because they become hypersensitve and go into overdrive fibromyalgia is now on that list as a possible list as a possible autoimmune disease but it may take a few years to know for sure so your doctor seems to know this and just wants to rule out the possibility that you may have either of these lupus being the most likely to him personally i have had fibomyalgia found a way to get rid of it but i still have lupus he just want to rule both of these out with a simple set of blood tests to check your antibodies to both of these autoimmune diseases and if you do have the antibodies one is the ra factor for rhuematoid arthritis the other ana for lupus he can catch it early start treatment this way if you do have one he has caught them before they become serious illnesses i consider this a responsible well ediucated dr who keeps up on current research while most people with fibromyalgia do not have lupus or ra there are a who do i run a yahoo support group many are lupus and fibromyalgia paitents some of the fibromyalgia paitents feel they only have fibromyalgia while others feel that they may have lupus but feel because of the fibromyalgia diagnosis it is possible the lupus is over looked your doctor as i may have said is just looking to see if you have certain antibodies to corralate to either of these diseases when he checked you he may have noticed signs such as swollen hands low grade fevers swollen lymph nodes a rash called a butterfly rash seen in lupus that a fibromyalgia paitent would not have or it may just be his basic policy to test every newly diagnosed fibromyalgia paitent for other autoimmune disorders as a person with lupus all i can say is kudos to your doctor he is on the ball in the off chance you do have another problem he is catching one of these before they get out of control for nither are curable in an autoimmune disease our bodies own cells become overactive beliveing they are being attacked by an outside invader when in fact they are not so they try to kill the invader instead they go after our own healthy organs cells bones and tissue he wants to make sure that is not happening more and more doctors are doing this as a standard procedure so dont worry to much escpecially if you live near a large city or a good teaching hospital fibro as it is nicknamed is exausting can be paniful as it exaust the muscles and causes pain and can cause great discomport even deppression if not treated properlly you i imagine are not the best sleeper not very good at relaxing and are probally used to being on the run the fibro will eventually slow you down if you dont get into a regular sleep pattern change your diet learn to relax and if possible get some type of physical therapy water is the most perfered type i will leave yo a few links for fibro ra and lupus including one to the yahoo support group i co own we have loads of information on fibro as well as many memeber with it or who have had it we have memebers with ra and many with lupus including myslef i hope some of this was of help to you but your dr is absoulutly doing the right this my best chris  Immune system Breast cancer Crohn's disease Lyme disease Hypoglycemia

positive and negative feed back of thyroid gland diseases im writing report right now please help me i checked wiki already anything you know about thyroid gland disease please thanks a lot n n all types of hyperthyroidism are due to an overproduction of thyroid hormones but the condition can occur in several ways in graves' disease the release of excess hormones is triggered by an autoimmune disorder for some unknown reason the body attacks the thyroid causing it to spill out too much hormone at other times nodules called toxic adenomas develop in the thyroid gland and begin to secrete thyroid hormones upsetting the body's chemical balance some goiters may contain several of these nodules in subacute thyroiditis inflammation of the thyroid causes the gland to leak excess hormones resulting in temporary hyperthyroidism that generally lasts a few weeks but may persist for months although rare hyperthyroidism can also develop from pituitary gland malfunctions or from cancerous growths in the thyroid gland hypothyroidism by contrast stems from an underproduction of thyroid hormones since your body's energy production requires certain amounts of thyroid hormones a drop in hormone production leads to lower energy levels a common cause of hypothyroidism is hashimoto's thyroiditis an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks thyroid tissue the tissue eventually dies and stops producing hormones hypothyroidism can also result when the thyroid gland has been surgically removed or chemically destroyed as treatment for hyperthyroidism if you are exposed to excessive amounts of iodide perhaps from a hidden source such as cold and sinus medicines the heart medicine amiodarone or from certain contrast dyes given before some x rays you may be at greater risk for developing hypothyroidism especially if you have had thyroid problems in the past the drug lithium has also been linked as a cause of hypothyroidism untreated for long periods of time hypothyroidism can bring on a myxedema coma a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires immediate hormone injections hypothyroidism poses a special danger to newborns and infants a lack of thyroid hormones in the system at an early age can lead to the development of cretinism mental retardation and dwarfism stunted growth most infants now have their thyroid levels checked routinely soon after birth if they are hypothyroid treatment begins immediately in infants as in adults hypothyroidism can be due to a pituitary disorder a defective thyroid or lack of the gland entirely a hypothyroid infant is unusually inactive and quiet has a poor appetite and sleeps for excessively long periods of time cancer of the thyroid gland is quite rare and occurs in less than of thyroid nodules you might have one or more thyroid nodules for several years before they are determined to be cancerous people who have received radiation treatment to the head and neck earlier in life possibly as a remedy for acne tend to have a higher than normal propensity for thyroid cancer  Folic acid Glucocorticoid Medicine Stroke Cryptorchidism Clinical depression Chernobyl accident Milk Vitamin C Cushing's syndrome Thyroid hormone Amiodarone Human height Fibromyalgia Polycystic ovary syndrome Bone marrow transplant Vitamin D Atrial fibrillation Pneumonia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Crohn's disease Hypopituitarism Gigantism Anemia Prolactinoma Brain tumor Chakra Rheumatoid arthritis Haloperidol Menstrual cycle Radioactive contamination Cytomegalovirus Endometriosis Addison's disease Group A streptococcal infection Multiple sclerosis Cardiac arrhythmia Kidney Herpes simplex virus Edible salt Obesity Delayed puberty Glycogen storage disease type I Homeopathy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Pituitary gland Cirrhosis Protein-energy malnutrition Obstetrics Carpal tunnel syndrome Breast Radiation poisoning Hyperprolactinaemia Anorexia nervosa Erectile dysfunction Abortion Liver Diarrhea Allergy Tuberculosis Asthma Leukemia

hunger pangs and apple cider vinegar i've been having hungar pangs for about a week now i did some research and found that apple cider vingegar does the trick i've never had these uncomfortable feelings before when my stomach goes empty the feeling comes and goes with a second pause in between i will seek medical attention in about days but are there any ideas as to what this could be i feel it most in the early morning as it wakes me up i then just take a couple sips of my diluted vinegar and then i'm fine the acid from the vinegar must be doing the trick but what is causing it im a fairly healthy person as i eat fast food maybe once or twice a month and what i consume at home is not fatty any ideas oh and you can rule out pregnancy a gastric l ulcer would cause extreme pain that feels like severe hunger pains here are the risk factors for this condition risk factors for ulcer from h pylori infection include the following age or older sex male race black and hispanic lower socio economic group a crowded and unsanitary living environment cigarette smoking stress excess coffee drinking family history of ulcer disease type o blood risk factors for ulcer from anti inflammatory drugs include the following age or older sex male history of stomach upset from nsaids prior peptic ulcer disease cigarette smoking alcohol abuse stress and here are some of the symptoms gnawing pain may awaken you from sleep may change when you eat may last for a few minutes or several hours feels like unusually strong hunger pangs nausea vomiting loss of appetite bloating burping if you do not have any of the risk factors and do not have any of the symptoms mentioned above then you are just complaining of simple hunger btw vinegar would not be good for you if you have an ulcer or gastritis since the vinegar suppresses your pain then it is unlikely you have such diseases you should have a wholesome breakfast then eat small amounts of food many times a day that will stop the hunger while making sure you do not eat too much  Cancer Helicobacter pylori Diabetes mellitus Diarrhea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Ulcerative colitis Paracetamol Folic acid Vomiting Adjustable gastric band Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Osteoarthritis Tobacco smoking Migraine Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa Clinical depression Crohn's disease Stroke Dieting Miscarriage Caffeine Common cold Traumatic brain injury Myocardial infarction Gastroparesis Alzheimer's disease Esophageal cancer Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Chronic fatigue syndrome Bipolar disorder Atkins Nutritional Approach Angina Group A streptococcal infection Colorectal cancer Proton pump inhibitor Sulfasalazine Bulimia nervosa Cirrhosis Multiple sclerosis Decompression sickness Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Alcoholism Charles Darwin's illness Cannabis (drug) Lung cancer Stomach Vitamin C Obstetrics Medical cannabis Sleep Nutrition Coffee First aid COX-2 inhibitor Doxepin Gout Herpes simplex virus Childbirth Alcoholic beverage Dehydration Omega-3 fatty acid Cocaine Ovarian cancer Word of Wisdom Acute pancreatitis Lupus erythematosus Hepatitis Methamphetamine Abortion Haloperidol Homeopathy Diazepam Atherosclerosis Food Irritable bowel syndrome Mouth ulcer Endometriosis Psychosis Foodborne illness

a question about insomnia okay i have it set on my mind that i suffer from insomnia because i can't sleep at nighttime and i've tried almost everything but in the mornings the less sleep i get the more awake i feel the next day and the more sleep i get the more tired i am when i wake up does anyone know how to explain this as to the phenomenon you're mentioning i think it has something to do with sleep inertia when your body is used to resting for long periods of time waking up becomes more difficult but don't think you don't need the sleep you're missing long term effects will show up i'd suggest analyzing your lifestyle do you try to sleep at the same time every day you should do you eat healthy and exercise regularly are you stressed worried right now are your bed and bedroom comfortable any medications that could produce this side effect etc etc if there isn't a physiological thing going on i'd say you need to psych yourself for sleep each night with a ritual try to sleep everyday at pm for example read a little and play soothing music or whatever works for you also avoid exercise close to bedtime and make sure to eat a good dinner  Sleep Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Lucid dreaming Chronic fatigue syndrome Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Sleep debt Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Fight Club Psoriasis Milton H.

trichotillomania for people that suffer from it how did your family take it when you told them that you had it how did you explain to them what it was i don't necessarily suffer from it it's just a part of my life my family wanted to know if there was anything i could do about it my mom said what most people say just stop doing it which i find to be just plain ignorant and stupid my sister had known for a long time and she doesn't really have any problem with it or anything i explained it as a type of obsessive compulsive disorder that causes me to pull my hair out and the hair pulling makes me feel relieved or calmed when i do it i told them it's a relatively newly studied disorder and not many doctors or psychiatrists know what to do about it or how to treat it i told them that at this point in my life i'm not too concerned about it or really willing to give it up my mother in law has been extremely understanding and bought me special makeup for my wedding so that i could realistically make my eyebrows look fuller i don't have any bald patches so it doesn't really affect anyone else on a regular basis but it is a part of my life and the hair pulling is usually a part of my daily routine  Trichotillomania Obsessive-compulsive disorder Baldness Kodocha Anxiety Prostate cancer Bipolar disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autism Hair Asperger syndrome Mental illness Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Eating disorder Addiction Transactional analysis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcissism Friends Dilbert Chronic fatigue syndrome Charmed Post-traumatic stress disorder EastEnders Shaggy dog story Procrastination Anti-psychiatry Borderline personality disorder Fathers' rights Little Britain Psychiatry Psychology Serial killer Alopecia areata Psychotherapy Clinical depression Adult attention-deficit disorder Days of our Lives Dissociative identity disorder Psychiatric hospital Psychosis Cognitive therapy Antisocial personality disorder Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mental Health Act 1983 Galactic Civilizations Binge eating disorder Rain Man Medicine Reparative therapy Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Symbiosis (TNG episode) Infantilism Fruits Basket Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stroke Fecal incontinence Narcissistic personality disorder The Ashlee Simpson Show Alcoholics Anonymous Schizophrenia Futurama (TV series - season 5) Charles Darwin's illness Survivor (novel) Urinary incontinence Traumatic incident reduction The Sims 2 Intelligence quotient Sleep apnea A Course In Miracles Recurring South Park characters The Amber Spyglass Self-harm Child sexual abuse Baldness treatments Knots Landing Mobile Suit Gundam Wing Milton H.

do you believe nicotine is the most addictive drug out there and why is nicotine legal but other drugs such as pot aren't i was once told that nasal spray was the most addictive substance known to man no joke i never believed it but a doctor specializing in ear nose throat medicine swore up down that it was because your nose craves the moisture it provides once you start using them on a regular basis but i think its probably a mix between nicotine alcohol  Addiction Drug addiction Tobacco smoking Nicotine Withdrawal Cocaine Drug abuse Prohibition (drugs) Common cold Convention on Psychotropic Substances Recreational drug use Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Ibogaine Breastfeeding Controlled Substances Act Methamphetamine Illegal drug trade Cannabis (drug) Nasal spray Medical cannabis Traditional Chinese medicine Medical prescription Hay fever Arguments for and against drug prohibition Bipolar disorder Hemp Rush Limbaugh Narcotic Drug test Alcoholism Personal lubricant Nasal congestion Mummy Anticholinergic Cigarette Alcoholics Anonymous Fitz Hugh Ludlow Psoriasis Buprenorphine Soft drug Allergy Inhalant LSD Alcohol Opioid Skin Psychiatry Tobacco Substance abuse Harm reduction Drug policy of the Netherlands Physician Tea Hookah Oxytocin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Nose Anxiety Route of administration Regulation of therapeutic goods Stewie Griffin Acetylcholine receptor Opium Snus Psychoactive drug Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cancer of the larynx Health insurance Antidepressant Rat Park Alzheimer's disease Paget's disease of bone Johnny Cash Nicotine gum Methylphenidate Human sexual behavior Pharmacology Daredevil Smoking pipe Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants It's All Gone Pete Tong Vampire New York City Police Department Dextromethorphan Methcathinone Morphine Nosebleed Malaria Kurt Cobain Humphrey Bogart Earwax Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Sleep apnea Eczema The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Alcoholic beverage

keppra has helped my movement disorder but one doctor said the medicine was working because i wanted it to i was on keppra for a few months last year to stop the movements hemiballismus i was told to stop the med when my main neurologist felt the problem was fixed the movement started up again and i went back on keppra i am now free of the movement problem one dr i saw thought i was only stressed and needed counseling and that the med was working only because i wanted it to i was given depakote first and it did nothing for me is there such a thing as the dr said i am fine at home with a loving husband of almost years and loving children and grandchildren a wonderful church family friends etc yet she thinks i am a basketcase sometimes movement disorders can be caused by stress or psychological trauma this is called somatization a physical symptom occurs in the body because of something in the mind and subsequent neurochemistry caused by the stress reaction it does not mean that a person is faking a disorder something is indeed happening in the nervous system to cause the problem although it might not be a purely physical problem in these instances as in the case of certain types of seizures that mimick epilepsy for example medication often does not work psych counseling is recommended but it is very difficult to get pts into such treatment and docs are often reluctant to get into the topic with pts anyway it's easier to give them an antiepileptic or some such drug in your case medication did work it is not unusual for one medication to work when another doesn't it however is not unreasonable for a physician to consider that a movement disorder is caused by a psychiatric problem but if you are functioning well now and think that you are ok and that treatment helped you but your doctor thinks you are a basket case dump that doctor fast and find someone who is more sympathetic to you  Epilepsy Anxiety Medicine Traumatic brain injury Post-traumatic stress disorder Bipolar disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychiatry Hypoglycemia Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Autism Alcoholism Schizophrenia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Multiple sclerosis Mental illness Transsexuality Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lamotrigine Psychosis Psychoanalysis Cephalic disorder Chlorpromazine Cerebral palsy Psoriasis Combat stress reaction Controversies in autism Obsessive-compulsive disorder Cancer Stomach cancer Drug addiction Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Herpes simplex virus Scientology beliefs and practices Stress (medicine) Borderline personality disorder Essential tremor Stuttering Sigmund Freud Migraine Parkinson's disease Hypnosis Dissociative identity disorder Folic acid Coeliac disease Traditional Chinese medicine Diabetes mellitus Fibromyalgia Alzheimer's disease Meditation Charles Darwin's illness Rabies LSD Panic attack Drug abuse Stroke Abortion Osteoarthritis Asthma Psychology Doxepin Palliative care Diazepam Reparative therapy Paracetamol Baldness Electroconvulsive therapy Lupus erythematosus Adult attention-deficit disorder Decompression sickness Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Seizure Prostate cancer Vigabatrin Transactional analysis Primidone Psychopharmacology Narcolepsy Huntington's disease Antidepressant Terri Schiavo Clomipramine Carpal tunnel syndrome Psychosurgery Mental Health Act 1983 Alcoholics Anonymous Pain Osteopathy Chiropractic Balance disorder Haloperidol Narcissism

lymph node okay i've been having this bump on my neck for really long really long it's not so big but you can feel it if you feel carefully and when my head is raised you can feel it but it's not really big i went to the doctors but he said it's not anything serious my mom will take me to the doctors again is it lymph node or is it something else should i be really concerned i'm female my mom says it should be fine because it's small doesn't hurt and quite a few people have those kinda stuff it's actually quite small i'm skinny cm ' and weigh around kg lbs front side quite up i had it ever since i think started my period does this have anything to do with that i also have a lymph node issue on the side of my neck near the clavical i've read up on it quite a bit and apparently as long as it's not growing and is on the softer side and moveable as opposed to fixed and hard it is probably okay as you probably know lymph nodes can raise when your body is fighting off an infection and can take quite a while to go down also sometimes they go up and never go down and people worry but it's probably nothing i saw my doctor recently and asked about the one i had found on the side of my neck that sounds a lot like yours he felt it didn't seem too concerned but said keep an eye on it in case it grows i did have multiple bug bites on my neck several months before so he said that could do it either way if the doctor said it wasn't serious i'd take his word for it but if it changes then go back to the doctor and tell him about the change asap btw if it's really bothering you though you could go back to the doctor and ask more about it it's better you understand than worry about it  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Lymphatic system Lymph node Breast cancer Metastasis Cancer of the larynx Radiation therapy Milton H.

malpractice do i have a solid case after giving birth to our third child i elected to have my tubes tied to make a long story short the doctor who performed the procedure tied and cut my renal artery rather than my falopian tube it was several hours before the problem was discovered he admitted that it was his fault and that he has no idea how he mistakenly cut the wrong thing although he admitted his mistake and corrected the problem can i still sue do i have a solid case i lost over units of blood was in icu for days and the recovery unit for another days i had exploratory surgery to find fix the mistake incision is not healing properly in my opinion this is an excellent example of what malpractice suits are intended to address while i'm sure it was not an intentional mistake the doctor showed gross negligence in cutting a major artery rather than your fallopian tube as with any malpractice suit you have to ask yourself what your goal is are you wanting to stick it to the establishment and get rich or are you mostly concerned about covering your current and future bills and maybe something for your pain and suffering in a case like this i would have no problem with taking the gloves off and going after whatever you can especially since this could have been a fatal mistake if it was me i would mainly be worried about my current and future medical bills rather than trying to get rich but i tend to be of the mind set that just because i can sue doesn't mean i should sue  Medical malpractice Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Aortic dissection Tort reform In vitro fertilisation Childbirth Stroke Spina bifida Medicine Terri Schiavo Adjustable gastric band Church of Christ, Scientist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Kidney Intensive care medicine Endometriosis Apollo 8 Caesarean section Ectopic pregnancy Software testing Kingdom Hospital John Edwards Tourniquet Folic acid Organ transplant Negligence Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Urinary incontinence EastEnders Renal cell carcinoma Theory of conduct Intersex surgery Angioplasty Abortion Syringomyelia Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Intact dilation and extraction Hillary Rodham Clinton Transsexuality Dissociative identity disorder Non-economic damages caps Terri Schiavo timeline Bush v.

advise from chronic sciatica suffers i have had sciatica for years caused from a fall it has been pretty quiet lately i know its there but no full blown episodes the last time i had one the doctor suggested a nerve block i have read good and bad about this so i opted not to he then make the comment well when you start having incontinence you will change your mind now apparent sciatica can cause this or he would not have said it my question is will i just lose bladder control and pee all over myself or will i have slight incontinence i e dribbling i have back issues as well two herniated discs that give me the same symptoms of sciatica i have been also told that at some point that i could have incontinence and it was described to me like just having no control over at all i didn't take it as a scare tactic but as a potential result of the problem i am dealing with over the course of dealing with this for years long term like you i have had many nerve blocks done and they do provide immediate relief but short term for the most part the longest period of time i went pain free was months i have also have two discectomies done where they remove the part of the disc that is touching the nerve which causes the pain the main concern that i would have for you is to not get too many nerve blocks not too many how many is that i don't know i have lost count of the times i have had this done to my back i know it is maybe near times in the last years as they are done in a series of three injections over a week period some doctors do it over a week period depends on their thoughts on it i guess i now suffer from avn avascular necrosis which is a bone disease from having too much cortisone shot into my body please understand that this takes a lot of cortisone to get this disease so don't be afraid of getting a series or two of the shots for the pain relief i would do it all over again to be pain free for those short periods of time as you know back pain is one of the most miserable things to go through sorry so long i just wanted to give you another point of view  Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Sciatica Carpal tunnel syndrome Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chiropractic Traumatic brain injury Addiction Migraine Multiple sclerosis Stomach cancer Clinical depression Penis Milton H.

information about the disease crest i think my mother may be suffering from it and i would like to know the long term outcome of this disease it started off as raynauds and now is starting to affect her esphogus please help crest crest is a type of collagen vascular disease it is believed to be an autoimmune condition crest is a type of scleroderma there are two types localized and systemic and crest is considered the milder form the prognosis for crest is usually very good some people with scleroderma also have other collagen vascular disease or a hybrid of two types an overlap syndrome so some evaluation is always needed there are no treatments proven effective enough to use in most cases but promising experimental treatments are available for some of the more severe cases treatment with minocycline oral trental and calcium channel blockers are sometimes used a recent advance is the use of diovan valsartan which is helpful for the symptoms caused by raynaud's phenomenon if an ulcer develops it can be healed by topical nitroglycerin ointment applied to the borders of the ulcer twice daily the term crest is an acronym derived from the five most prominent features c calcinosis calcium deposits in the subcutaneous layer of the skin r raynaud's phenomenon extreme sensitivity to cold or stress e esophageal dysfunction swallowing problems caused by scarring s sclerodactyly tightening of the skin confined to fingers and toes t telangiectasia red spots on the hands palms forearms face and lips calcinosis the accumulation of calcium below the outer layer of the skin many parts of the body can be affected such as fingers arms feet knees pressure on the skin from these deposits can cause severe pain ulcerations and infection if the calcium protrudes infection is treated with antibiotics administered orally or intravenously in some cases hospitalization is required when surgery is the only way to stop the infection raynaud's phenomenon a vascular disturbance affecting the extremities primarily the hands spasms of the small blood vessels capillaries cause color changes varying from white to blue to red exposure to cold or emotional stress can intensify the problem and there may be pain tingling numbness or a burning sensation care of the hands is most important as ulcerations and infections may occur if they are bruised or cut extreme cleanliness is essential when there are ulcerations mittens should be worn to protect the hands from cold even when using the refrigerator or freezer patients are advised to protect the entire body from cold there are many drugs and treatments used with varying success to alleviate symptoms including methyldopa aldomet prazosin minipress nifedipine procardia verapamil calan pentoxifylline trental nitroglycerine paste occlusive dressings such as duoderm paraffin baths and biofeedback therapy esophageal dysfunction the loss of normal motility of the lower esophagus this causes difficulty swallowing a common complaint is acid reflux with resulting heartburn should the esophagus become too restricted dilation is usually the treatment to aid in overcoming reflux action several small meals a day should be taken combined with small amounts of liquids do not eat at bedtime it is advised to sit upright one to two hours after eating blocks may be used to raise the head of the bed six inches and antacids may be prescribed for use an hour after meals and at bedtime tagamet cimetidine and zantac ranitidine have also been prescribed for this condition they are anti ulcer drugs that help to protect the stomach and intestine linings from stomach acids by reducing the amount of acid released into the stomach sclerodactyly a condition in which the skin of the fingers becomes taut thin and shiny fingers and toes may not bend or may become fixed in a flexed or less functional position for this problem physical or occupational therapy may be a valuable aid prescription vitamin d pills and ointment have recently been found to be mildly helpful telangiectasia the appearance of capillaries near the surface of the skin they will blanch on pressure these capillaries become dilated and visible appearing chiefly on the face lips tongue fingers and palms special cosmetics may be used to lessen visibility dermablend and covermark others

pancreatitis what's the cure for pancreatitis i am so glad you asked that question there is no cure for pancreatitis i suffered with this disease for years there are many treatments and procedures that can be done but an actual cure doesn't exist ercp is an endoscopic examination that is done you are put to sleep but able to breath on your own and a scope is inserted into your mouth and moved around to give a picture of your pancreas some times they will do mamometry pressure readings this should give the endoscopist an idea about what is going on they can insert stents if needed during this procedure or open blocked ducts during also some people receive no relief from these procedures and opt for surgery such as myself total pancreatectomy with autologous islet cell transplantation the pancreas is removed and the small bowel is rerouted the insulin making cells are extracted from the removed pancreas cleansed and placed into the liver at the time of surgery this surgery isn't perfect and doesn't always remove all pain at this time it is however all we have most have mistaken belief that alcohol is the major contributing factor and most people i have met with this disease have never been drinkers i have met a few but the majority don't know why they have pancreatitis  Insulin Acute pancreatitis Diabetes mellitus Cancer Hypoglycemia Organ transplant Liver Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pancreatic cancer Gallstone Prostate cancer Alcoholism Endoscopy Insulinoma Stomach cancer Cystic fibrosis Cirrhosis Stroke Congenital hyperinsulinism Colorectal cancer Fecal incontinence Needle aspiration biopsy Urinary incontinence Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Esophageal cancer Primary sclerosing cholangitis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Bone marrow transplant Glucokinase Growth hormone treatment Pneumonia Diarrhea Kidney Psychosurgery Growth hormone Folic acid Hyperglycemia Ferret Acromegaly Gallbladder Gastroparesis Obesity Medicine Oncology Acne Traumatic brain injury Radiation therapy Fistula Multiple sclerosis Lupus erythematosus Intersex surgery Gene therapy Cancer of the larynx Dialysis Clinical depression Endometriosis Malignant melanoma Primary biliary cirrhosis Penis Diabetic retinopathy Ulcerative colitis Surgery Terri Schiavo Frederick Banting Chronic fatigue syndrome Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Serine protease Haemochromatosis Endocrinology Hemorrhoid Cholecystitis Dentistry Angioplasty Theory of conduct Sleep apnea Atherosclerosis Glycogen storage disease type I Carpal tunnel syndrome Common cold Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Acupuncture Cocaine Cholecystectomy History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Abortion Multiple myeloma Obstetrics Glaucoma Diabetes mellitus type 1 Chlorpromazine

runner's diaherria question two days ago i was running six miles on a treadmill i had plenty of water beforehand and a small breakfast as my running progressed i felt that i needed to go to the bathroom bowel movement i decided that i would go after i was finished with my run when i finished running i hopped off an went everythig seemed alright but then it felt like i had to go again i tried to go but couldn't then i began to lift weights and the feeling stayed with me i went home and then tried again again nothing came out for about thirty minutes after that the cramps got worse i sat on the toilet for five minutes in pain then i got up and got so light headed that i thought i was going to pass out my dad who was in the other room drove me to the hospital when we got there i released alot of diaherria the pain was gone my question is what could have possibly caused this i stopped running for two days including today and i have not crapped since the day at the hospital please help if this happened only this once it is probably not a big deal if it becomes a regular happening see a gastrointestinal motility specialist to decide whether you have an underlying dysmotility when you exercise you activate your sympathetic nervous system the fight or flight one and deactivate your parasympathetic nervous system the one in control of gut motility among other things when you relax the inverse happens so while you may have felt the urge your continued exercise did not allow you to relax sufficiently to have a bowel movement once you relaxed a bit not stress wise but activity wise your motility kicked into high gear listen to your body if you have to go you have to go to better plan for your next workout relax beforehand and see if you can eliminate before you lock things up for a while  Autonomic nervous system Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Vomiting Gastrointestinal tract Meditation Equine conformation Chronic fatigue syndrome Irritable bowel syndrome Aikido Weight training EastEnders Nervous system Muscle Milton H.

i have a question regarding ativan i take ativan only when needed and the next day i feel so tired and out of it is that normal my dr only told me to take it when i feel an anxiety attack coming on sometimes i just take it to help me sleep i have taken it the last few days and this will be the first day without taking it will i have withdrawals feeling tired and out of it after taking any sleep aid is normal you probably should use the ativan only for the anxiety attacks it can be habit forming if overused the reason that you feel worn out even after sleeping all night after taking it has to do with the mechanism of normal sleep have you heard of rem sleep rapid eye movement this is the stage of sleep that is when your eyes move rapidly back and forth and if i remember correctly it occurs when you are dreaming i do know that the amount of rem cycles that a person has varies night to night to reset yourself so that you feel rested you need to be able to experience rem sleep unfortunately when you take a sleep aid such as ativan it acts by tranquilizing your brain in effect keeping you from getting to those rem cycles that you need what you are experiencing with the tiredness etc is a drug hangover a safer alternative to something as strong as ativan would be benadryl diphenhydramine some of the newer sleep drugs state that they don't make you tired the next day but i have no idea if this is true as far as withdrawals after using the med for a few days to get to sleep unlikely however you may find it harder to get to sleep when you try to go without the med all this is from a purely medical standpoint there are many non med ways to promote sleep without relying on pills to get there ie exercise reading a book etc hope this helps  Sleep Narcolepsy Dream Rapid eye movement Sedative Chronic fatigue syndrome Chlorpromazine Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Urinary incontinence Lorazepam Hypnosis Clinical depression Panic attack Insomnia Psychosis Anxiety Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Epilepsy Migraine Stuttering Alcoholism Polyphasic sleep Electroencephalography Diazepam Bipolar disorder Antidepressant Hypoglycemia Drowning Psoriasis Fibromyalgia Avenue Q Caffeine Drug addiction Infantilism Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Weight training Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antipsychotic Traumatic brain injury Common cold Stomach cancer Daylight saving time Clomipramine Benzodiazepine Malaria R.E.M.

what is best way to prepare for bad news news of terminal illness wow that's a big one a person goes through stages of 'processing' such news that is much like the grieving process i would say that you should get some help therapist support group or such from others in understanding what you are going through and that you are not alone even in something that is as incredibly personal as dealing with that level of bad news if you find articles books or information that help you or speak to you have your close family or friends read it too them reading something that they know said something important or worthwhile to you might help them to understand where you are and what you need know you'll have bad days and better days find something o rthings that grounds you whether it is faith family friends a hobby studying a subject etc find something or things that you find solace in there is a lot on this subject start reading talk to a therapist find a support group find out what helped others and maybe you can work out what is best for you god bless  Open access Religious Society of Friends Theory of conduct Milton H.

if a native american is suffering from end state live disease due to chronic alcohol intake is a liver transplant a option it is my step daughter and she is on public assistance and her doctors have not ofter her that option should it be because she is a public charge or could it be because she has not taken the step to stop drinking a person has to be evaluated and go through a series of tests to be placed on the transplant list to be placed on the list a patient has to be without any alcohol for a period of months and willing to give it up completely the shortage of organs for transplant makes it harder to be placed on the list unless the person themselves prove to others that they do want to live and will be compliant with following the rules to have an donor organ which includes stopping bad habits so there is little chance that once transplanted the organ won't go into rejection and the alcohol won't react with the medication they need to take for the rest of their life when you said is a liver transplant an option that is exactly what it is the cost of a liver transplant is well beyond what anyone could afford it can range from to or even higher a person needs to have insurance that covers transplant or find a way to raise the money or they could be on disability and may receive help from the government or organizations the system for the transplant is fair people are placed on the transplant list according to how long they may live without having a transplant in other words if they are fairly well and may recover and not need a transplant according to what their blood work shows they will be placed lower on the list and may even go off the list and lead a normal life as you go higher on the list you are less well and if you are very near the top you will either receive a transplant or you may die before an organ becomes available this has nothing to do with sex race or any other similar thing blood type may be a factor cause some blood types are rare and it is hard to find someone else who had the same blood type the links below will give you alot more information about the process of liver transplant organ donation living organ donors pre evaluation for transplant and many other things http www surgery usc edu divisions hep patientguide index html http www transplantliving org http www unos org so many people are trying to be placed on the list when they have developed the disease because of alcohol alcohol is only one of the reasons for this disease of about others some people have no problem stopping their alcohol but most need help and that help is there the doctors can give them medication to help with the symptoms that may develop from stopping the alcohol this is usually done in a hospital setting it helps the patient cope alot better it may be very scary for a person with alcohol cause they know what it feels like if they don't take a drink and how much that can multiply if going cold turkey they don't just have one hurdle to cross they now have two overcoming the addiction and then having a transplant it has been shown that when people stop drinking alcohol that their liver may heal if it has not progressed to the point where the liver cells have died which is known as cirrhosis to help you understand cirrhosis here is another link http digestive niddk nih gov ddiseases pubs cirrhosis the best doctor that she could be with right now is a hepatologist which is a liver specialist another thing that may help is for her not to use any medications except those prescribed by the doctor this included herbal teas herbs or any over the counter medication especially pain nsaid i hope that this information is of some help to you  Hepatitis C Stomach cancer Paracetamol Health insurance Hypoglycemia

my huband was diagnosed with diverticulitis at this is the third time that he has been hospitalized in the two years since he has been diagnosed they are saying that he has an abcess and that they have to do surgery once the infection is gone from his system my question is how bad is this and what can i expect in the future with both the surgery and the disease thanks in advance for your answers diverticulitis is usually said to effect older age groups but i've seen this diagnosis being made in ppl in their s so he's not alone it is basically a disease of the western world and reflects on our bad eating habits without a lot of fibre and bulk from vegetables and fruit the intestines have to use more force to push stools along this causes increased pressures in the intestines and can cause little pouches of intestine to bulge between the muscle coat these pouches can become infected relatively easily since they're dead ends in the intestine and they can also become blocked the abscess your husband has if probably due to an infection in one of the diverticuli which got blocked and developed a collection of pus there is always the probability of further hospitalizations with diverticulosis diverticulitis is the name for infected diverticuli diverticulosis is the name for the presence of diverticuli since the diverticuli will still be there what can be done however is change your diet to make hospitalization less likely it is vital that your husband eats a large amount of vegetables and fruit a high fibre cereal in the morning is also of great help try to avoid products with a lot of small seeds which are not digested and can get stuck in the diverticuli reduce your meat and fast food intake and replace it with more veggies if your husband is still constipated he might need help wtih fibre supplements such as ispaghula husk sachets which you mix with water make sure he drinks plenty of water best of luck to you and your husband with dietary modifications i've seen patients go from regular hospitalizations to asymptomatic in a matter of weeks hope it works fine for you too  Diverticulosis Diverticulitis Stomach cancer Diarrhea Colorectal cancer Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease Ulcerative colitis Dieting Nutrition Prostate cancer Constipation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Tocopherol Escherichia coli O157:H7 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Adjustable gastric band Irritable bowel syndrome Folic acid Hypoglycemia Cirrhosis Hamster Laxative Glycogen storage disease type I Cancer Pneumonia Coronary heart disease Gout Hemorrhoid Cystic fibrosis Breastfeeding Fancy rat Hypertension Atkins Nutritional Approach Anemia Brewery Guinea pig Atherosclerosis Obesity Abscess Clinical depression Low-carbohydrate diet Abdominal pain Botulism Omega-3 fatty acid Diabetes mellitus Kidney stone Livestock Traumatic brain injury Insulin Ileostomy Hirschsprung's disease Gastric bypass surgery Clostridium difficile Protein-energy malnutrition Chicken Gastroparesis Trichinosis Medicine Tofu Dialysis AIDS Mesothelioma Small intestine Cholesterol Paget's disease of bone Breast cancer Anorexia nervosa Tooth Aortic dissection Multiple sclerosis Herpes simplex virus Vegetarian nutrition Esophageal cancer Soybean Veganism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Fasting Lumbar puncture Common cold Hypomagnesemia Chagas disease Traditional Chinese medicine Entamoeba histolytica Milk Babe Ruth

eating after food poisoning i don't know if it was food poisoning or what but i felt nauseous all last night from pmish til this morning then slept a couple of hours and don't feel nauseous do you think it would be okay to eat or is it still in my system usually it is wise to begin feeding your belly with liquids when you are overcoming a stomach ordeal try small sips of water gatorade soda for a half an hour and see how they sit don't try milk or juice right away because the clear liquids are easier to digest once you are fine with liquids you can have try crackers toast soup and gradually build up from there if you only felt nauseous and never threw up then you'll be fine today but if you were throwing up start slowly with the liquids as described i'd still suggest small amounts of food for today just to baby your belly back to health hope you're better  Breakfast Chocolate Stomach cancer Soft drink Milk Fugu Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Tofu Food Nutrition Tooth Cat Russian cuisine Fecal incontinence Drink Egg (food) Jewish cuisine Honey The Amber Spyglass Adjustable gastric band Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheese Hamster Pancake Tea Snake Botulism Gastroparesis Foodborne illness Polychlorinated biphenyl Chicken soup Gastrointestinal tract Cuisine of Denmark Insomnia Guinea pig Sewage treatment Peanut Capercaillie Omega-3 fatty acid Coeliac disease Bread Raw food diet Vitamin C Soy milk Shaggy dog story Gastroesophageal reflux disease Soup Coffee Chernobyl accident Sugar beet Ice cream Fancy rat Aerial (dance move) Koala Binge eating disorder Suplex Vomiting Night (book) The Shining (film) Porridge Sauerkraut Spider Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rocko's Modern Life Stomach Termite Sugar Flatulence Ramen Cuisine of Brazil Tomato Bottlenose Dolphin Word of Wisdom Wine Comanche Rebreather Biscuit Milton H.

blood in stool and other digestive problems ive recently been having to go to the bathroom more frequently lately like times a day sometimes usually the stool is either soft or kinda hardish soft lol i know it sounds nasty but just being honest anyways ive also been farting alot and then this morning when i took a crap there was blood on the poop and a lil bit after i wiped what could this be you must go to the doctor immediately you may be allergic to something which is not dangerous but and this is important blood in stool is always a signal to see a doctor it may just be a warning but pay attention you should get a colonoscopy this is a procedure where you are mildly sedated and the gastro enterologist inserts a thin really thin tube with a tiny camera into the colon via the rectum do not be embarrassed this is a relatively painless procedure less than a headache but it is incredibly important there have been cases where young people say years old have had colonoscopies and it was discovered that they had polyps small to medium sized little bumps on the colon walls the doctor just snips them off no pain but if these polyps do not get removed they may eventually break through the colon wall and then you are in real and serious trouble many people's lives have been saved by this simple procedure many people don't get a colonoscopy because they are too embarrassed to do it this you must get over if it is the case with you not getting this treated could kill you look at tony snow the white house press officer he has had colon cancer twice you do not want to risk this happening to you go now please save your life the physician might also try to find out why you are having so much gas in your body do you use aspartame or other artificial sweeteners the ingredients in these sweeteners sometimes cause trouble in the bowel as the ingredient sorbitol causes water to be drawn from the body quickly resulting in loose stool and gas other possibilities are allergies to gluten a wheat or maybe lactose a milk ingredient these are all controllable with changes in the diet the blood though is the most important symptom do not ignore this situation colon cancer is a terrible nightmare and death from such a disease is a horror show get to a doctor and very good luck to you  Crohn's disease Hemorrhoid Coeliac disease Colonoscopy Cancer Urinary incontinence Diarrhea Prostate cancer Sugar substitute Irritable bowel syndrome Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Stomach cancer Flatulence Dietary fiber Chronic fatigue syndrome Food allergy Virtual colonoscopy Ebola Endometrial cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Constipation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Stroke Adjustable gastric band Mouth ulcer Milk Hirschsprung's disease Medicine Eczema Tocopherol Vegetarianism Pneumonia Lactose intolerance Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Familial adenomatous polyposis Acting President of the United States Traumatic brain injury Sento Toilet humour Hamster Malaria Acne Bread Multiple chemical sensitivity Soft drink Food Hay fever Clomipramine Colony in Space Mesothelioma Schistosomiasis Decompression sickness Doxepin Japanese toilet Hypoglycemia Ileostomy Barium enema Laxative Childbirth Saccharin Jam (TV series) Pitaten Soft tissue sarcoma Allergy Migraine Enema Healthy eating Multiple sclerosis Coffee Radiation therapy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Menstrual cup Aortic dissection Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Caves of Androzani AIDS Ovarian cancer Diabetic retinopathy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Endometriosis Abortion Group A streptococcal infection Gastroparesis Sugar Glycogen storage disease type I Hypertension

digestive problems im for about a year now i've been having problems with my digestive tract well i'm not even sure if it has to do with my digestive tract i've been to the hospital about times within the year of this problem for the same problem and they keep writing it off as a peptic ulcer but things just dont add up when they prescribed antacids pepcid zantac it would make me feel better for about weeks and then it would make me feel even sicker than before so i'd stop taking them i would then get better and it would stop for i'd say about maybe weeks and then the symptoms would come back my symptoms are about minutes into eating something my stomach would feel like it was on fire as though i'd had eaten glass i'd have to drink something to dull the pain then around the time i'd be going to bed my stomach would start hurting as though someone had stabbed me then i'd feel severly nauseause as though ready to vomit i'd then break out into a cold sweat sorry they only allowed me a certain amount of space so i will continue after the cold sweat i'd start burping as though i'd have drank a glass of soda i'd still feel very nauseouse sorry i always have trouble spelling that i would be up all night and then when morning came i couldnt stay awake any longer and i'd fall asleep and then when i'd wake up i think that i'm better but as soon as i would eat something the process repeated itself all over again when i'd go to the hospital they did an ultrasound and said nothing was there that they could see did blood work so the first time they said gastroentiris gave me some zantac and sent me home second time they did blood work took a pregnancy test see what use that'll do i'm not sexually active and told me peptic ulcer deisease i believe it has something to do with my stress but yet when i'm calm and happy i still get sick ive missed school so much that i've been held back also i forgot to mention that i become very constipated when this happens and the hospital has never checked me for h pylori they would always tell me when i went to the hospital to keep on a bland diet ive been on a bland diet for over a year now the one thing thats really gets me is i havent losed large amounts of weight maybe pounds at the most i dont eat spicy foods anymore i havent drank soda in over years i drink water green tea and fruit juices but mostly water ive tried so many things with my diet but nothing works ive even tried just saltines for a whole day to see if the way i was eating was the matter but id still get sick also my uncle who doesnt live with me is showing the same symptoms and signs as me and it seem we both start feeling better get worse comes back both at the same time wow so young to be experiencing such pains ailments things your doctor won't tell you is the fact that down in your stomach there supposed to be millions of benefitial bacteria that exist live there soley fro the purpose of breaking down helping you to properly digest your food for some reason these bacteria are probably dead in your stomach no longer performing thier natural function the doctor may give you a little something to treat the syptoms that your experiencing but he will do nothing in the way of leading you to actually heal the problem he makes his fortune in life by showing you how to live with your ailment by the use of the pharmacudical drugs that he wants to sell you now you may begin to resupply your body very slowy by eating digesting fermented foods such as greens sour kraut things like this your health food store provider will be able to help make the right choses for you you will not be able to simply grab a pill filled with these living bacteria ingest them most of them would simply be washed directly through your system the process must be done naturally just as your food would be digested if you don't get this situation took care of soon you'll be a miserable wretch in just a few years it'll take just that much longer to get things right again  Urinary incontinence Medicine Peptic ulcer Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Foodborne illness Crohn's disease Pneumonia Breastfeeding Vitamin C Veganism Adjustable gastric band Insomnia Cancer Cirrhosis Helicobacter pylori Stomach Fugu Insulin Coeliac disease Mouth ulcer Gastroparesis Coffee Gastrointestinal tract Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Psoriasis Tocopherol Medical prescription Chocolate Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nutrition Alcoholic beverage The Amber Spyglass Pregnancy Cheese Ulcerative colitis Diarrhea Food Milk Anorexia nervosa Babe Ruth Alcoholism Bread Common cold Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Sewage treatment Gastric acid Dietary fiber Dieting Caffeine Osteoarthritis Botulism Kodocha Hamster Tea Childbirth Heartburn Paracetamol Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anxiety Migraine Myocardial infarction Milton H.

can you sell your organs when you pass and your organs are used for transplant in someone else how come everyone make's lot's of money but you or your family it doesn't seem real fair to me the argument isn't really that everyone is making a lot of money but that everyone is getting paid the surgeons who take the organs do get paid for their time and work it's not a reward it's a reimbursement so why can't the donor family also be reimbursed this has been a subject of some debate in the united states economists have suggested that one way to increase the donor supply would be to offer families a financial incentive for donating others have countered that this could really hurt because people would feel that the system was cheapened instead of organ donation being a wonderful gift a way for the deceased to live on it just becomes a transaction some have suggested more tolerable alternatives several state legislatures have considered bills that would pay for the funeral expenses of an organ donor but so far it remains the ultimate gift it's not a totally self less gift donor families can register to allow contact with the people who receive the organs there are donor quilts and donor medals and donor recognition ceremonies small thanks perhaps but the law still prohibits anything more lucrative  Organ donation Campaign finance reform Gift economy Tom DeLay American Red Cross Microeconomics Credit card FairTax Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Insurance Supply and demand National Kidney Foundation Singapore Value added tax Taxation in the United States Campaign finance in the United States Charitable trust Economics Tax Elections in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ralph Nader Capitalism Islamic banking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Non-profit organization Divorce Inheritance tax Marcel Mauss Minimum wage Third party (United States) Supply-side economics Intellectual property Human cloning Blood transfusion Utilitarianism Financial endowment Law of value Kidney transplantation United Kingdom corporation tax Corporation Health insurance Money supply Public policy Money Principal-agent problem Social Security debate (United States) Theory of conduct Kidney Food and Drug Administration Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Copyright Efficiency wages Arbitrage Free trade Medal of Honor Say's law Inflation Capital accumulation Privatization Wealth Robert P.

i dont know anymore ok i know what kind of answers i will get for this one but oh well i am and am addicted to painkillers vicodin percocet anything codene i started taking them when i was my first time taking them i took and i did that everyday for a long time after a while i could not feel it so i just kept upping it untill it was at my worst which was one of my friends made me go to see someone and i have been off of it for months but when i quit painkillers i started using ephedrine quite heavily to give myself a boost and that has gotten bad i dont kno what i am really asking i dont want to go to rehab b c i start college soon and if i quit cold turkey with ephedrine like i did with painkillers i will have nothing to replace it with anyone had a situation like this or have any advice i know i need to quit my father died of painkiller overdose and im not stupid and i know im heading down the same path so helpful advice and yes i also smoke i know someone suggested that and it helps a little but i also get bronchitis a lot and i dont wanna start smoking a lot more you really should quit your drug habit replacing one bad habit with another is ineffective to replace ephedrine to painkillers is not a better choice you should have learn your lesson from seeing your dad dying from drug overdose you are going thru the same path of self destruction you should go for psychological counselling find out the real reason for your addiction how do you gain access to these painkillers vicodin percocet and codeine since they are controlled substances as well as prescribed drugs something here is really wrong you're only and if you consider yourself not stupid then you should be able to comprehend the fact that the only person you're harming is yourself drug addiction is considered a brain disease you should make up your mind to quit the habit probably going into drug rehab wouldn't be such a bad idea maybe you could do this in the summer or spring break before college starts but in order for you to be successful is to set a date of completion you need all the help you can to combat this drug addiction in addition you should quit smoking you'll find that you will have less episodes of bronchitis my asthma was very bad when i used to smoke now i can breathe and smell better my hair and clothes smell better too  Drug addiction Methamphetamine Tobacco smoking Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Asthma Analgesic Drug abuse Ephedrine Arguments for and against drug prohibition Good Times Clinical depression Red Hot Chili Peppers Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Bradley Nowell Hydrocodone Withdrawal Obsessive-compulsive disorder Oxycodone Drug test Opium Alcoholics Anonymous One Tree Hill (TV series) Prohibition (drugs) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Rush Limbaugh Bipolar disorder Cannabis (drug) Cancer Alexander Technique Cocaine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Paracetamol Medicine Neuro-linguistic programming Sigmund Freud Daredevil Methcathinone LSD Migraine Transsexuality Motivation Social rule Controlled Substances Act Avenue Q Narcotic Theory of conduct Kodocha Saved by the Bell Paroxetine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fitz Hugh Ludlow The Marshall Mathers LP Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Ashlee Simpson Show Harm reduction Urinary incontinence Bronchitis Goodness and value theory Traditional Chinese medicine Consensual crime The O.C.

healthcare professionals what physical reaction does a person have when they receive a blood transfusion do the patient feel relief nausea nothing are there any delayed reactions not talking about disease here just anything a person who receives blood might experience that the average person isn't aware of do they feel stronger or lethargic is there any acclimation period when you take in a stranger's blood someone in the religion and spirituality board mentioned their spouse was sick for over a week each time they took a blood transfusion in your experience is this statement an exaggeration about the effects of having a blood transfusion or could it be he was sick to begin with and recovering better than he would've without a transfusion i'm honestly curious i've never had a blood transfusion and for most of my life having one was religiously taboo any information you have to share would be appreciated i so appreciate all this information the religion i was in demonized blood transfusions to a point where people are literally scared to death to get one and not just because it doesn't please their religion they really fear transfusions and have all kinds of misconceptions about them i plan to share this information so thank you again silenced who knows maybe a person in a situation that required a transfusion would not really feel anything physically providing the blood was typed and cross matched correctly most folks don't get whole blood they get either packed cells or plasma as a rule they tend to get better since a lot of the healing that goes on depends on a good blood supply to get the materials to the site they certainly need the blood to get oxygen to the rest of the system when people feel odd after recieving blood it's more an emotional reaction than a physical one there are some problems that require transfusions and in those cases the person is already not is such good shape and is stressing over their other problems a hemophiliac may want to live a normal life and having to have the transfusion may feel like a slap in their face reminding them of their problem when you treat somebody a good bit of the treatment isn't just attending to the physical side of things people are not just an injured part they come with a brain attached and are full of emotions that you also have to attend to so although the blood product itself won't physically cause a problem you still have to deal with the person's feeling of having a foreign substance floating around inside them when you start talking about somebody's insides it doesn't get much more personal than that i've had patients that didn't give it much thought and others that it bugged i've even been asked if we could tell what the donor was if it was an oriental or whatever truth is blood is blood and as long as it's human and a match your body doesn't really care that doesn't mean the person won't physically you should show some improvement after gettting blood but of course it's no guarentee you will because you were obviously in bad shape to start with or you wouldn't have needed blood all the blood does is give you a fighting chance it's a fair bet without it things might not turn out so well but medicine is an art with a lot of science behind it you don't just treat a disease or injury you have to deal with the rest of the person as well and as mind goes body tends to follow the art comes in how you treat the whole person not the part  Blood transfusion American Red Cross Stroke Blood Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Hypoglycemia Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ, Scientist Clinical depression Urinary incontinence Cancer Post-traumatic stress disorder Hepatitis C Blood type A Course In Miracles Social rule Traumatic brain injury Diabetes mellitus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Traditional Chinese medicine Pneumonia Insulin Francis Crick Immortality HIV test Bone marrow transplant Vitamin C Abortion debate Health insurance Blood donation Chemotherapy Love Radiation therapy Human sexual behavior Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The nature of God in Western theology Soul Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stem cell Stuttering Traumatic incident reduction YuYu Hakusho Equine conformation Childbirth Decompression sickness Anxiety Leukemia Alcoholism Publicly funded medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Cryonics Chlorpromazine Sickle-cell disease Death Multiple sclerosis Dualism (philosophy of mind) Religion Myocardial infarction Sigmund Freud Folic acid Cannabis (drug) Homeopathy HIV Jehovah's Witnesses Characters of Naruto Drug addiction AIDS Reiki Palliative care Reflexology Ethics Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Anemia Organ transplant Simone Weil Malaria Asperger syndrome Carbon dioxide Dog Anorexia nervosa Blood (computer game) Growth hormone treatment Self-harm Pain Pitaten Triage

what is the best treatment for injured herniated bulging or degenerative discs help i'm a college student who has tried everything from pain management to chiropractic to orthopedic to physical therapy no treatment has been deemed superior physical therapy chiropratic care and pain management have all been determined to have equal long term outcomes however i think part of the problem with reseach on treatments of low back pain is that most back pain is never properly diagnosed your mri may display bulging or herniated discs but they might be completely irrelevant to your symptoms a thorough mechanical assessment to see what happens to your pain during certain movements is necessary to classify your pain once your pain has been classified into mechanical or non mechanical and subsequently one of the further subcategories can you seek the appropriate treatment for instance for someone whose pain is due to a bulging disc and confirmed by mechanical assessment massage and stablization exercises will usually not help conversely someones whose pain is due to another reason will not be helped by the same methods used to treat the bulging disc to say the very least most back pain is poorly classified even if mri has been done a thorough classification is needed to do this this is a procedure that only a handful of pts dcs and mds are credentialed to perfrom if you have not done so already i suggest you have a mechanical evaluation by finding a credentialed provider at http www mckenziemdt org another option you might hear about is spinal decompression this is typically performed at a chiroprators office many are being lured to this with the statement that it has over a effectiveness rate however what they do not tell people is that this is at the day mark only short term results and only for people who have a one level problem without degenerative changes as more levels and degeneration is involved the numbers drop to etc similar to physical therapy no large long term outcome studies have been done and i suspect it has similar results as pt and pain mangement i'm not against it i just think it is not being fully honest with its marketing i have had patients who've gone through it and i was seeing them for another reason and they state they find themselves going back times a year for further treatment i would highly recommend the mdt website and also exploring different pratcitioners within the same fields you've tried there are always different treatment approaches among practicioners  Prostate cancer Medicine Cancer Physical therapy Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Aortic dissection Migraine Pneumonia Syringomyelia Addiction Traditional Chinese medicine Massage Paracetamol Asthma Intracranial pressure Stroke Bipolar disorder Autism Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion Controversies in autism Malignant melanoma Hypoglycemia Childbirth Psychoanalysis Breast cancer COX-2 inhibitor Diabetes mellitus Intelligence quotient Androgen insensitivity syndrome Brain tumor Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alternative medicine Fibromyalgia Growth hormone treatment Carpal tunnel syndrome Sciatica Transsexuality Reparative therapy Homeopathy Medical analysis of circumcision Hypnosis Antidepressant Scientific method Stomach cancer Aphasia Osteopathy Oncology Endometriosis Magnetic resonance imaging Nurse Crohn's disease Myocardial infarction Epidural Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Stuttering Weight training Hypertension Mental Health Act 1983 Chlorpromazine Urinary incontinence Antiretroviral drug Mesothelioma Radiation therapy Psychosis Iliotibial band syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Colorectal cancer Acupuncture Electroconvulsive therapy Anorexia nervosa First aid Battle of the Bulge Parkinson's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Prolactinoma Psoriasis Cardiac stress test Neurofeedback Atrial fibrillation Adult attention-deficit disorder Psychiatry Post-traumatic stress disorder Lung cancer Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Palliative care

can someone who is on blood thinner still have a blood clot that causes a tia although anticoagulants are often called blood thinners they do not really thin blood warfarin prevents the production of certain proteins that are necessary for blood to clot heparin and newer low molecular weight heparins interfere with the complex process of blood clot formation heparin and warfarin prevent new clots from forming and may prevent existing clots from getting larger they do not break up clots anticoagulants should only be used when a blood clot is suspected of causing the stroke or transient ischemic attack tia because anticoagulants increase your chance of bleeding you need to have regular blood tests to monitor blood clotting time while taking these medications some safety tips when taking anticoagulants may be helpful such as taking your medications at the same time each day and watching for signs of bleeding so the answer is yes esp if a person on blood thinner such as coumadin eats iron rich foods e g spinach making the blood thinner ineffective  Stroke Pulmonary embolism Coagulation Warfarin Myocardial infarction Atrial fibrillation Deep vein thrombosis Blood plasma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antiphospholipid syndrome Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Aspirin Low molecular weight heparin Subdural hematoma Tocopherol Hemorrhagic stroke Thrombocytopenia Folic acid Cardiovascular disease Blood pressure Transient ischemic attack Apoplexy Blood Blood transfusion Menstrual cycle Atrial septal defect Malaria Stomach cancer Coronary heart disease Dieting Vacutainer Intracranial pressure Cirrhosis Prothrombin time Urinary incontinence Mesothelioma Cancer Oral contraceptive Nutrition Prostate cancer Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Ximelagatran Anemia Intravenous therapy Dialysis Haemophilia Natt__ Aphasia Thrombolytic drug Knife Crohn's disease Wound healing phases Thrombophlebitis Insulin Needle aspiration biopsy Psoriasis Cryonics Multiple sclerosis Veganism Enzyme Complete blood count Paracetamol Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Glycogen storage disease type I Ischaemic heart disease Vitamin C Platelet Atheroma Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Von Willebrand disease Pharmacology Origin of life Angioplasty Hip fracture Migraine First aid Cephalexin Hematophagy Disseminated intravascular coagulation Hemoglobin D-dimer Lung cancer Amiodarone Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aortic dissection Automated analyser Drowning

im a year old girl and i just found of about fibromyalgia although im not sure if i have it during march break i went to the doctor because for a few days i'd been having frequent sharp chest pains and a few months earlier i went because i'd experiencing chronic fatigue for the past few weeks i've been getting daily pains most noticably in my abdomen stomach area but generally eveywher im tired even after getting hours of sleep and am stressed generally about university which i take very seriously the stress tiredness and pain all seem to be symptoms of fibromyalgia although im not sure and would like some help on seeing if thats what it is or maybe something else any help is welcome and appreciated symptoms the primary symptoms of fibromyalgia include widespread musculoskeletal pain severe fatigue and disturbed sleep fibromyalgia means pain in the muscles ligaments and tendons the soft fibrous tissues in the body most patients with fibromyalgia say that they ache all over their muscles may feel like they were pulled or overworked sometimes fibromyalgia symptoms include muscle twitches and burning sensations more women than men are afflicted with fibromyalgia and it shows up in people of all ages a conservative estimate of its prevalence is of the general population but it may be as high as to help your family and friends relate to your fibromyalgia symptoms have them think back to the last time they had a bad flu every muscle in their body shouted out in pain in addition they felt devoid of energy as though someone had unplugged their power supply while the severity of symptoms fluctuates from person to person fibromyalgia may resemble a post viral state this similarity is the reason experts believe that fibromyalgia syndrome fms and chronic fatigue syndrome cfs may actually be the same condition gulf war syndrome also overlaps with fms cfs common symptoms of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome pain the pain of fibromyalgia has no boundaries people describe the pain as deep muscular aching throbbing shooting and stabbing intense burning may also be present quite often the pain and stiffness are worse in the morning and you may hurt more in muscle groups that are used repetitively fatigue this symptom can be mild in some fibromyalgia patients and yet incapacitating in others the fatigue has been described as brain fatigue in which patients feel totally drained of energy many patients depict this situation by saying that they feel as though their arms and legs are tied to concrete blocks and they have difficulty concentrating e g brain fog sleep disorder most fibromyalgia patients have an associated sleep disorder called the alpha eeg anomaly this condition was uncovered in a sleep lab with the aid of a machine that recorded the brain waves of patients during sleep researchers found that the majority of fibromyalgia patients could fall asleep without much trouble but their deep level or stage sleep was constantly interrupted by bursts of awake like brain activity patients appeared to spend the night with one foot in sleep and the other one out of it sleep lab tests may not be necessary to determine if you have disturbed sleep if you wake up feeling as though you've just been run over by a mack truck what doctors refer to as unrefreshing sleep it is reasonable for your physician to assume that you have a sleep disorder many fibromyalgia patients have been found to have other sleep disorders in addition to the alpha eeg such as sleep apnea as well as the newly discovered form of interrupted breathing called upper airway resistance syndrome or uars bruxism teeth grinding periodic limb movement during sleep jerking of arms and legs and restless legs syndrome difficulty sitting still in the evenings irritable bowel syndrome constipation diarrhea frequent abdominal pain abdominal gas and nausea represent symptoms frequently found in roughly to of fibromyalgia patients acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd also occurs with the same high frequency chronic headaches recurrent migraine or tension type headaches are seen in about of fibromyalgia patients and can pose a major problem in coping for this patient group joint dysfunction syndrome this syndrome sometimes referred to as tmj or tmd causes tremendous jaw related face and head pain in one quarter of fibromyalgia patients however a published report indicated that close to of fibromyalgia patients have a varying degree of jaw discomfort typically the problems are related to the muscles and ligaments surrounding the jaw joint and not necessarily the joint itself other common symptoms premenstrual syndrome and painful periods chest pain morning stiffness cognitive or memory impairment numbness and tingling sensations muscle twitching irritable bladder the feeling of swollen extremities skin sensitivities dry eyes and mouth dizziness and impaired coordination can occur fibromyalgia patients are often sensitive to odors loud noises bright lights and sometimes even the medications they are prescribed aggravating factors changes in weather cold or drafty environments infections allergies hormonal fluctuations premenstrual and menopausal states stress depression anxiety and over exertion may all contribute to fibromyalgia symptom flare ups here is an entire list i have put here for you in hopes that it helps better explain fibromyalgia to you did the doctor put you on any medications or did he run any blood work i would be interested in knowing if he ran an ana a sed rate and a c reactive protein if you are up to it and feel like it you can let me know through email hope this helps you

have you had carpal tunnel release surgery im awaiting cts open release surgery on both hands i've been told that i absolutely need the surgery by several doctors and neurologists i've been told by the doctors that it is a simple procedure with a very good outcome i on the other hand have a hard time believing them is there a lot of pain associated with it and is it really worth it i have had carpal tunnel proceedures on both wrists and it was quite successful and well worth it there is one point i would like to make whatever you do do not repeat do not have both wrists done at the same time my doctor wanted to do both at once and something made me sense this wasn't the best idea i am right handed so i had the right wrist proceedure done first the left wrist months later recovery from the first surgery took a long time and i had to teach myself to use my left hand for common every day things like brushing my teeth combing or washing my hair using the toilet and subsequent clean up needless to say it was hard tying shoes and using zippers on clothes were big hassles the left wrist took less time to heal and i had an easier time of it i don't regret the surgery now but after that first one i had my doubts that this was a good idea anyway i made a complete recovery on both and don't look back anymore it was worth it in the long run i also learned that pain killing drugs are good good luck  Carpal tunnel syndrome Repetitive strain injury Milton H.

different causes for headaches i got the headaches when i was have had them constantly for years the only thing that varies is the level of pain when they started my legs went numb i couldn't breath my vision went black i was constantly dizzy and walked with a cane to keep my balance dizziness subsided but headaches remain over the past month they have been increasing in pain have been to doctors had tests performed and they gave up other symptons are i get what i call black outs i loose my vision and get increasing pain it lasts minutes pain medications don't help the only thing that dulls the pain a bit are percocets have tried antidepressents migraine meds have been to neurologist heart specialist and chiropractor doctors gave up but headaches are getting worse does anyone have any idea what could cause this i'm looking into any illness that it could possibly be hopefully i can find some new ideas to go to the doctor with constant headache for years and wouldn't i be dead now if it were a tumor it's been years i got my first migraine at it took countless tests mri's ct scans xrays etc and went to every concievable type of doctor i went through nerve blocks epidural steroid injections trigger point injections spinal adjustments cranial sacral therapy and many more treatments as well as some major meds all of which were just 'band aids' but then i found a doctor brain and spinal surgeon who persisted and did a disc o gram they found two ruptured discs and it requires a disc fusion with titanium hardware to correct however another option offered to me was botox i get injections in the neck and shoulder area every to months to keep the muscles from 'locking' up and triggering migraines of course the explanation of how and why the botox works is much more lenthy but it worked something else worth mentioning is that when i moved from a big city to a small coastal area my migraines went from times a month to times a year whether it was pollution stress or the humid salt air i'm not sure but it made a huge difference the bottom line is to find a doctor that will do whatever it takes to find the real cause even if you have to sit in the hospital for a week everything else is just a guess on their part  Urinary incontinence Childbirth Stroke Chiropractic Syringomyelia Epidural Cluster headache Local anesthesia Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Paget's disease of bone Clinical depression Epilepsy Carpal tunnel syndrome Pneumonia Lumbar puncture Stem cell Hypoglycemia Fibromyalgia LSD Diabetes mellitus Brain tumor Back pain Asthma Bipolar disorder Aortic dissection Prolactinoma Psoriasis Myocardial infarction Diabetic neuropathy Sciatica Aspartame Cephalic disorder M__ni__re___s disease Tension headache Diazepam Antidepressant Animal testing Stuttering Cancer Multiple chemical sensitivity Lamotrigine Insulin Spina bifida Propranolol Hyperthermia Clomipramine Medicine Dyslexia Neurology Botulism Radiation therapy Magnetic resonance imaging Growth hormone treatment Autonomic nervous system Osteoarthritis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pain Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Brain Myasthenia gravis Neurofibromatosis type II Malignant melanoma Post-traumatic stress disorder Folic acid Hip fracture Medical cannabis Spinal cord injury Obesity Headache Autism Cannabis (drug) Chlorpromazine Oscilloscope Spinal stenosis Neuropathy Benign intracranial hypertension Drowning Neurosurgery Fecal incontinence Subdural hematoma Colorectal cancer Hypertension Anxiety Adult attention-deficit disorder

has anyone recently had a lumbar spinal fusion surgery if so how are you dealing with recovery i just had one on and wonder if i will 'ever' be the same any feedback would be great thanks i had this surgery for scholiosis when i was now i'm almost it took me about a month before i was doing well enough to go back to school after about months to a year i was feeling fine and now i barely ever think about it honestly most of the time i forget i ever had the surgery the first months are going to be the hardest though and you should use vitamin e capsules on the scar you can get them at any drug store you just bust open the capsules and rub them on the scar every night for at least months i did this for about a year and my scar is barely visible now hope this helps  Breast implant Acne Stomach cancer Scoliosis Multiple sclerosis Spina bifida Scar Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Vitamin D Endometriosis Neurosurgery Breastfeeding Tattoo Fecal incontinence Babe Ruth Benign intracranial hypertension Local anesthesia Paget's disease of bone Isotretinoin Tocopherol Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cirrhosis Osteopathy Back pain Keratoconus Osteoporosis Osteoarthritis Stem cell Cocaine Vitamin Vertebral column Red Hot Chili Peppers Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stone Cold Steve Austin Time capsule Intersex surgery Days of our Lives Breast reconstruction Vertebra Minimally invasive Equine conformation Lumbar puncture Traumatic brain injury Epidural __scar Romero Spinal cord Transsexuality Myxobolus cerebralis Folic acid Darryl Strawberry Hulk Hogan Kidney Coronary heart disease Medical cannabis Mercury 4 Cancer Cat John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Angioplasty Cerebellum Penis Myocardial infarction Action potential Autonomic nervous system Gastroesophageal reflux disease Stroke Meningitis Negima Laser applications Bulk vending Alzheimer's disease Barry Bonds Radiation therapy Anorexia nervosa Farthing (coin) Amy Dumas Ketamine Mattress Reagan Administration Ulcerative colitis Peter Senerca Troy Glaus Mnemonic Adverse effect (medicine) Gout Chemotherapy Epilepsy Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Spinal cord injury John Dillinger USS Vogelgesang (DD-862) MegaMan Battle Network 5 Organ transplant

could appendicitis be the cause of my stomach pain it's happened times in the past month i get extreme pain in my stomach that comes on slowly and escalates pretty badly it's happened at night each time and i eventually just have to go to bed because the pain is so bad the next morning the pain is gone this past time last night was the worst i was in tears and about to go to the hospital until i realized that curling up in a ball hurt worse than spreading out so i spread out and laid down and tried to press on my stomach to see if it hurt in certain spots more than others it was hard to tell this morning my stomach feels weird and a little sore like i did sit ups all night but the pain nausea is gone if you have appendicitis i was under the impression that the pain came and then it would eventually burst i didn't think that you could have been that would eventually subside and then may come back is this true any other explanations for my pain can't find any dietary factors that seem to be the link thanks also there is nausea almost to the point where i feel like i want to vomit but never actually vomiting my boyfriend suggested i might have to use the bathroom but it didn't feel like that i also didn't have gas or anything the next morning my poop was green and soft i don't know if that has anything to do with it or if it was just something i ate that did that also each time this has happened times over past couple of weeks it has gotten worse first time not so bad last night was very bad taking tums also does not seem to help please help there is a chance it could be your gall bladder i had gall stones didn't know it the attacks were horribly painful i thought it was in intestinal issue i have i would sometimes throw up and have diarrhea the next day the frequency varied but it actually went on for years before it got bad enough for me to go to the er you should see your doctor and discuss the symptoms if you have another one you could just go to the er and they could do the tests needed to diagnose you there good luck  Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Babe Ruth Cancer EastEnders The Shining (film) Group A streptococcal infection Ebola Diarrhea Shaggy dog story Coeliac disease Myocardial infarction Migraine Milton H.

what is avascular necrosis last year i had to have a total hip replacement due to avn but my surgeon was not giving me much info on the following questions can it spread i am now having pain in my lower back other hip and knee what treatment can be given less evasive the better as i have also got dilated cardiomyopathy and other illnesses will this affect me for the rest of my life finally what can i do myself to help my own body because of the avn serious answers only please many thanks ok i'm going to give you the run down on avn to help answer your question first as far as the spreading goes the pain you are suffering in your lower back hip and knee are most likely tied to the cartilidge in those areas not getting the blood it needs to keep it healthy i would recommend taking glucosimine chondroitine to help with lubricating said cartilidge as for the avn hopefully this will answer all of your treatment questions avascular necrosis avascular necrosis is a disease resulting from the temporary or permanent loss of the blood supply to the bones without blood the bone tissue dies and causes the bone to collapse if the process involves the bones near a joint it often leads to collapse of the joint surface this disease also is known as osteonecrosis aseptic necrosis and ischemic bone necrosis although it can happen in any bone avascular necrosis most commonly affects the ends epiphyses of long bones such as the femur the bone extending from the knee joint to the hip joint other common sites include the upper arm bone knees shoulders and ankles the disease may affect just one bone more than one bone at the same time or more than one bone at different times avascular necrosis usually affects people between and years of age about to people develop avascular necrosis each year orthopaedic doctors most often diagnose the disease the amount of disability that results from avascular necrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected how large an area is involved and how effectively the bone rebuilds itself the process of bone rebuilding takes place after an injury as well as during normal growth normally bone continuously breaks down and rebuilds old bone is reabsorbed and replaced with new bone the process keeps the skeleton strong and helps it to maintain a balance of minerals in the course of avascular necrosis however the healing process is usually ineffective and the bone tissues break down faster than the body can repair them if left untreated the disease progresses the bone collapses and the joint surface breaks down leading to pain and arthritis avascular necrosis affects both men and women and affects people of all ages it is most common among people in their thirties and forties depending on a person's risk factors and whether the underlying cause is trauma it also can affect younger or older people causes avascular necrosis has several causes loss of blood supply to the bone can be caused by an injury trauma related avascular necrosis or joint dislocation or by certain risk factors nontraumatic avascular necrosis such as some medications steroids blood coagulation disorders or excessive alcohol use increased pressure within the bone also is associated with avascular necrosis the pressure within the bone causes the blood vessels to narrow making it hard for the vessels to deliver enough blood to the bone cells injury when a joint is injured as in a fracture or dislocation the blood vessels may be damaged this can interfere with the blood circulation to the bone and lead to trauma related avascular necrosis studies suggest that this type of avascular necrosis may develop in more than of people who dislocate their hip joint steroid medications corticosteroids such as prednisone are commonly used to treat diseases in which there is inflammation such as systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease and vasculitis studies suggest that long term systemic oral or intravenous corticosteroid use is associated with of all cases of nontraumatic avascular necrosis however there is no known risk of avascular necrosis associated with the limited use of steroids patients should discuss concerns about steroid use with their doctor doctors aren't sure exactly why the use of corticosteroids sometimes leads to avascular necrosis they may interfere with the body's ability to break down fatty substances these substances then build up in and clog the blood vessels causing them to narrow this reduces the amount of blood that gets to the bone some studies suggest that corticosteroid related avascular necrosis is more severe and more likely to affect both hips when occurring in the hip than avascular necrosis resulting from other causes alcohol use excessive alcohol use and corticosteroid use are two of the most common causes of nontraumatic avascular necrosis in people who drink an excessive amount of alcohol fatty substances may block blood vessels causing a decreased blood supply to the bones that results in avascular necrosis other risk factors other risk factors or conditions associated with nontraumatic avascular necrosis include gaucher's disease pancreatitis radiation treatments and chemotherapy decompression disease and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis patients may not have any symptoms as the disease progresses however most patients experience joint pain at first only when putting weight on the affected joint and then even when resting pain usually develops gradually and may be mild or severe if avascular necrosis progresses and the bone and surrounding joint surface collapse pain may develop or increase dramatically pain may be severe enough to limit the patient's range of motion in the affected joint in some cases particularly those involving the hip disabling osteoarthritis may develop the period of time between the first symptoms and loss of joint function is different for each patient ranging from several months to more than a year diagnosis after performing a complete physical examination and asking about the patient's medical history for example what health problems the patient has had and for how long the doctor may use one or more imaging techniques to diagnose avascular necrosis as with many other diseases early diagnosis increases the chances of treatment success x ray an x ray is a common tool that the doctor may use to help diagnose the cause of joint pain it is a simple way to produce pictures of bones the x ray of a person with early avascular necrosis is likely to be normal because x rays are not sensitive enough to detect the bone changes in the early stages of the disease x rays can show bone damage in the later stages and once the diagnosis is made they are often used to monitor the course of the condition magnetic resonance imaging mri mri is quickly becoming a common method for diagnosing avascular necrosis unlike x rays bone scans and ct computed computerized tomography scans mri detects chemical changes in the bone marrow and can show avascular necrosis in its earliest stages mri provides the doctor with a picture of the area affected and the bone rebuilding process in addition mri may show diseased areas that are not yet causing any symptoms bone scan also known as bone scintigraphy bone scans are used most commonly in patients who have normal x rays a harmless radioactive dye is injected into the affected bone and a picture of the bone is taken with a special camera the picture shows how the dye travels through the bone and where normal bone formation is occurring a single bone scan finds all areas in the body that are affected thus reducing the need to expose the patient to more radiation bone scans do not detect avascular necrosis at the earliest stages computed computerized tomography ct scan a ct scan is an imaging technique that provides the doctor with a three dimensional picture of the bone it also shows slices of the bone making the picture much clearer than x rays and bone scans some doctors disagree about the usefulness of this test to diagnose avascular necrosis although a diagnosis usually can be made without a ct scan the technique may be useful in determining the extent of bone damage biopsy a biopsy is a surgical procedure in which tissue from the affected bone is removed and studied although a biopsy is a conclusive way to diagnose avascular necrosis it is rarely used because it requires surgery functional evaluation of bone tests to measure the pressure inside a bone may be used when the doctor strongly suspects that a patient has avascular necrosis despite normal results of x rays bone scans and mris these tests are very sensitive for detecting increased pressure within the bone but they require surgery treatments appropriate treatment for avascular necrosis is necessary to keep joints from breaking down if untreated most patients will experience severe pain and limitation in movement within years several treatments are available that can help prevent further bone and joint damage and reduce pain to determine the most appropriate treatment the doctor considers the following aspects of a patient's disease the age of the patient the stage of the disease early or late the location and amount of bone affected a small or large area the underlying cause of avascular necrosis with an ongoing cause such as corticosteroid or alcohol use treatment may not work unless use of the substance is stopped the goal in treating avascular necrosis is to improve the patient's use of the affected joint stop further damage to the bone and ensure bone and joint survival to reach these goals the doctor may use one or more of the following treatments conservative treatment medicines to reduce fatty substances lipids that increase with corticosteroid treatment or to reduce blood clotting in the presence of clotting disorders nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs may also be prescribed to reduce pain reduced weight bearing if avascular necrosis is diagnosed early the doctor may begin treatment by having the patient remove weight from the affected joint the doctor may recommend limiting activities or using crutches in some cases reduced weight bearing can slow the damage caused by avascular necrosis and permit natural healing when combined with medication to reduce pain reduced weight bearing can be an effective way to avoid or delay surgery for some patients range of motion exercises may be prescribed to maintain or improve joint range of motion electrical stimulation to induce bone growth conservative treatments have been used experimentally alone or in combination however these treatments rarely provide lasting improvement therefore most patients will eventually need surgery to repair the joint permanently surgical treatment core decompression this surgical procedure removes the inner layer of bone which reduces pressure within the bone increases blood flow to the bone and allows more blood vessels to form core decompression works best in people who are in the earliest stages of avascular necrosis often before the collapse of the joint this procedure sometimes can reduce pain and slow the progression of bone and joint destruction in these patients osteotomy this surgical procedure reshapes the bone to reduce stress on the affected area there is a lengthy recovery period and the patient's activities are very limited for to months after an osteotomy this procedure is most effective for patients with advanced avascular necrosis and those with a large area of affected bone bone graft a bone graft may be used to support a joint after core decompression bone grafting is surgery that transplants healthy bone from one part of the patient such as the leg to the diseased area commonly grafts called vascular grafts that include an artery and veins are used to increase the blood supply to the affected area there is a lengthy recovery period after a bone graft usually from to months this procedure is complex and its effectiveness is not yet proven clinical studies are underway to determine its effectiveness arthroplasty total joint replacement total joint replacement is the treatment of choice in late stage avascular necrosis and when the joint is destroyed in this surgery the diseased joint is replaced with artificial parts it may be recommended for people who are not good candidates for other treatments such as patients who do not do well with repeated attempts to preserve the joint various types of replacements are available and people should discuss specific needs with their doctor for most people with avascular necrosis treatment is an ongoing process doctors may first recommend the least complex and invasive procedure such as protecting the joint by limiting movement and watch the effect on the patient's condition other treatments then may be used to prevent further bone destruction and reduce pain it is important that patients carefully follow instructions about activity limitations and work closely with their doctor to ensure that appropriate treatments are used as for the dilated cardiomyopathy cardiomyopathy dilated definition dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently the decreased heart function can affect the lungs liver and other body systems there are several different types of cardiomyopathy dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form there are many causes of dilated cardiomyopathy they may include nutritional deficiencies valvular heart disease anemia stress viral infections rare alcoholism alcoholic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in an estimated out of people it can affect anyone of any age although it is most common in adult men risk factors include obesity cocaine use a personal or family history of cardiac disorders such as myocarditis and alcoholism symptoms swelling of feet and ankles swelling of the abdomen pronounced neck veins loss of appetite shortness of breath especially with activity shortness of breath which occurs after lying down for a while fatigue weakness faintness sensation of feeling the heart beat palpitations pulse may feel irregular or rapid decreased alertness or concentration cough low urine production need to urinate at night note symptoms of heart failure often develop gradually some chest pain may also be associated with this disease signs and tests cardiomyopathy is usually discovered on examination and testing for the cause of heart failure tapping the area with the fingers and feeling the area may indicate enlargement of the heart listening to the chest with a stethoscope reveals lung crackles heart murmur or other abnormal sounds the liver may be enlarged neck veins may be distended heart enlargement congestion of the lungs decreased movement functioning of the heart or heart failure may show on echocardiogram chest x ray chest ct scan cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography nuclear heart scan muga rnv an ecg may show conduction disturbances or arrhythmias and may indicate enlargement of the ventricles heart biopsy may be helpful to distinguish dilated cardiomyopathy from other diseases lab tests vary depending on the suspected cause treatment the patient may need to stay in the hospital until acute symptoms start to go away treatment is focused on relief of symptoms digitalis vasodilators drugs that dilate blood vessels ace inhibitors diuretics water pills nutritional supplements and other medications may be prescribed to reduce symptoms the underlying cause should be treated some patients may require a biventricular pacemaker an implantable defibrillator may also be needed to correct any severe arrhythmias abnormal heart rhythms a biventricular pacemaker with defibrillation capabilities is available a low salt diet may be prescribed and fluid may be restricted in some cases the patient can usually continue their regular activities if tolerated daily monitoring of body weight may be advised weight gain of or pounds or more over or days may indicate fluid accumulation smoking and drinking alcohol may worsen the symptoms if the heart function remains poor a heart transplant may be considered expectations prognosis the outcome varies some patients remain in a stable condition for long periods some continue to get gradually sicker and others quickly get worse cardiomyopathy can only be corrected if the underlying disease can be cured complications congestive heart failure arrhythmias pulmonary edema side effects of medications including low blood pressure lightheadedness and fainting lupus reaction a group of symptoms including a skin rash and arthritis headache gastrointestinal upset calling your health care provider call your health care provider if you have symptoms of cardiomyopathy if chest pain palpitations or faintness develop seek emergency medical treatment immediately prevention eat a well balanced and nutritious diet exercise to improve heart fitness stop smoking and minimize alcohol consumption i hope this information can shed some light on your questions best of luck and you will be in my prayers

any one know what the form of epilepsy that does not cause fits is called i believe it just causes changes to the mood that last for short periods of time but no fits anyone got this form or know about it i would be grateful for info thanks introduction epilepsy is a disorder that disrupts the transmission of electrical signals inside the brain although you may assume that epilepsy always causes episodes of uncontrolled movements and loss of consciousness the condition is actually quite variable symptom episodes known as seizures are often subtle causing strange sensations emotions and behavior some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds when having a seizure while others have full fledged convulsions about one in people in the united states has experienced an unprovoked seizure at some point in life however a solitary seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy many people for example children with high fevers experience one seizure and then never have another one but after you've had two seizures the chance that you'll have additional seizures increases dramatically at least two unprovoked seizures are required for a diagnosis of epilepsy the onset of epilepsy is most common during childhood and after age but the condition can occur at any age treatments may leave you free of seizures or at least reduce their frequency and intensity many children with epilepsy even outgrow the condition with age signs and symptoms because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in brain cells seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates a seizure can produce temporary confusion complete loss of consciousness a staring spell or uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure in most cases a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time so the symptoms will be very similar from episode to episode but some people have many different types of seizures with different symptoms each time doctors classify seizures as either partial or generalized based on how the abnormal brain activity begins when seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one part of the brain they're called partial or focal seizures seizures that seem to involve all of the brain are called generalized seizures in some cases seizures can begin in one part of the brain and then spread throughout the rest of the brain partial seizures simple partial seizures these seizures don't result in loss of consciousness they may alter emotions or change the way things look smell feel taste or sound complex partial seizures these seizures alter consciousness causing you to lose awareness for a period of time complex partial seizures often result in staring and nonpurposeful movements such as hand rubbing lip smacking arm positioning vocalization or swallowing generalized seizures absence seizures petit mal these seizures are characterized by staring subtle body movement and brief lapses of awareness myoclonic seizures these seizures usually appear as sudden jerks of your arms and legs atonic seizures also known as drop attacks these seizures cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down tonic clonic seizures grand mal the most intense of all types of seizures these are characterized by a loss of consciousness body stiffening and shaking and sometimes tongue biting or loss of bladder control  Clinical depression Electroconvulsive therapy Diabetes mellitus Stroke Cancer Brain tumor Neurofeedback Schizophrenia Multiple sclerosis Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sleep Parkinson's disease Addiction Absence seizure Cerebral palsy Consciousness Autism Alcoholism Panic attack Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Migraine Asperger syndrome Action potential Syringomyelia Chlorpromazine Asthma Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Menstrual cycle Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Hypnosis Apoplexy Milton H.

post mortem autopsy question a friend of mine just died after years of degenerative brain disease while i am saddened by this news i am also relieved that her suffering is over countless tests while she was alive failed to establish a cause and now that she has died her parents have refused a post mortem saying she has suffered enough i personally am quite angered by this surely they must want to know what caused this what of other people who may be suffering from the same illness i feel that her life and struggle are meaningless without knowing if a cure can be found to save other people i can't believe her parents would be so selfish she lived in a vegetative state for nearly twenty years i lost a friend suddenly last year to menengitis everyone was devastated his family donated his organs and another eight peoples lives were improved as a result of this somehow it meant that his life and death weren't in vain i do respect the family and understand how hard it's been for them but not knowing what caused a beautiful and lively eighteen year old to debilitate in front our eyes seems harder somehow they are next of kin and their wishes are paramount i understand where you are coming from though they must feel her death very deeply and can't put her through anything else  Death Rabies Sant Thakar Singh Autism Wolfrider Embalming Chronic fatigue syndrome Hide and Q (TNG episode) Mortification of the flesh Love Abortion debate Osteoarthritis Clinical depression The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Pitaten The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Alcoholics Anonymous Transsexuality Alzheimer's disease Tenshinhan Multiple sclerosis Dementia Hollyoaks Kodocha Year of the Spider Jiddu Krishnamurti Polyamory Empress Wang Zhengjun Borderline personality disorder Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Boston Public Stomach cancer Mahatma Gandhi Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Bipolar disorder The Marshall Mathers LP Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pneumonia Eastern Orthodox Church Theory of conduct Blood (computer game) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mental illness Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rei Ayanami Simone Weil Characters of Naruto Socrates Spinocerebellar ataxia The Brothers Karamazov Sheikh Abdullah Traumatic brain injury Darwin from Orchids to Variation Narcolepsy Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Glen Jacobs John Howard Yoder Immortality Luke and Laura Spencer Milton H.

do kidney transplant patients always have to take predinsone if they do not have an exact match donor i received a new kidney about months ago i am very happy i am just curious if patients are ever taken off prednisone afterward if they did not receive the kidney from an exact match donor i am just wondering if i will have to take this drug my entire life i have already gained pounds in months i am worried how much i would gain if i remain on this drug for many years i only take mg once a day my kidney did not come from anyone related to me and was not a perfect genetic match i was told i will have to take anti rejection medications for the rest of my life i guess i am just hoping maybe i might be lucky enough not to have to take this one medication predinsone due to the weight gain issue prednisone is a corticosteroid that helps prevent and treat rejection of transplanted organs it may be used for long term perhaps lifetime immunosuppression or in higher doses for treatment of rejection the dosage however differs from patient to patient your nephrologists will determine when and if you may stop prednisone if you are on other immunosuppressants like prograf and myfortic cellcept as commonly is the case your doctor might taper off the prednisone over a period of time taking a patient off prednisone results in severe withdrawal symptoms and hence the patient needs to be taken off gently over a couple of months weight gain is a common problem this is because the drug changes the way fat is spread around the body in my case i was on mg of prednisone for a couple of months had a living related donor and then was taken off it by reducing the dosage mg over a couple of months while i was on prednisone i developed the classic moon face it took months after stopped dosage for my face to shrink back i would suggest that you speak to your nephrologist about your concern he is really the best person on advising you the head of the transplant clinic where i am treated once told me that the best results for sustaining a graft is received by a combination of drugs one being prednisone it is very important that you control your weight gain so please try please follow a low fat food regimen and exercise walking walks wonders i am on such a diet exercise plan ever since my transplant i did not lose any weight but did not gain any either good luck  Folic acid Chemotherapy Crohn's disease Prostate cancer Asthma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clinical depression Hypertension National Kidney Foundation Singapore Stomach cancer Rabies Radiation therapy Urinary incontinence Dialysis Lupus erythematosus Diabetes mellitus Migraine Psoriasis Bipolar disorder Cancer Antiretroviral drug Tocopherol Immunosuppressive drug Growth hormone treatment Glucocorticoid Aspergillosis Chlorpromazine Kidney Obesity Antidepressant Paget's disease of bone Cytomegalovirus Atkins Nutritional Approach Paracetamol Hypoglycemia Dieting Osteoarthritis Addiction Ulcerative colitis Nephrology Opioid Anorexia nervosa Health insurance Weight training Multiple myeloma Turner syndrome COX-2 inhibitor Doxepin Organ donation Multiple sclerosis Breast cancer Tuberculosis Antipsychotic Sildenafil IgA nephropathy Hepatitis C Kidney transplantation Colorectal cancer Alcoholism Parkinson's disease Malaria Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Stem cell Pneumonia Drug abuse Osteoporosis Alternative medicine Vitamin C HIV test Buprenorphine Stroke Leukemia Shock Trimipramine Diabetic nephropathy Cirrhosis Human cloning Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Epilepsy Duesberg hypothesis Clomipramine Polycystic ovary syndrome Radiation poisoning Lung cancer Alzheimer's disease Kaposi's sarcoma Cystic fibrosis Adjustable gastric band Diazepam Myasthenia gravis Emergency contraception

i just had tests the doctor told me i may have a terminal disease i had some tests done yesturday but i don't know how to tell my family or even if i should should i wait for the results i'm not sleeping and if i tell them i could be worring them for nothing what should i do i'm really scared at this point it is may have if you have a sibling or someone you are close to who you could talk to them about your fears around this it might help you to sleep at night often just discussing our fears with someone can really help put things in perspective also even if you are told you do have a terminal illness don't let that deprive you of hope there are many people who are alive who have had terminal illnesses who miraculously recovered their health i agree it would be wise to wait to tell anyone who might become hysterical or interfering with your choices you don't want the added burden right now of having to take care of someone else's feelings and worries  Prostate cancer Abortion debate Milton H.

i've had a warm sensation on the inside of my left foot for the past few days it started off happening only about twice a day now it's multiple times in an hour there's no pain no swelling nothing when i have the warm sensation i touch the skin on the inside of my foot and it still feels cool even though the warmth is felt internally does anyone have an educated suggestion as to what this could be hmmm that's a tough one i'm thinking something neurological maybe an irritated nerve in your lower spine or maybe just the nerve in that particular spot in your foot i wouldn't worry about it unless it persists for longer than a couple weeks in the meantime pamper that part of the foot maybe there is an minor injury one that isn't severe enough to hurt but the heat sensation is there nonetheless but i'm not really qualified you know i'm not a pediatrist or anything just giving my thoughts that's all  Traumatic brain injury Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Pain Penis First aid Massage Carpal tunnel syndrome Fecal incontinence Local anesthesia Alexander Technique Urinary incontinence Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Multiple sclerosis Milton H.

about familial spherocytosis i was always told by physicians that my frequent and easy bruising was a result of this genetic condition i was advised to increase my folic acid intake which i did as i now take of the rda every day it is a bit better but at times i still bruise pretty easily of what i have looked at online i cannot find any other recommended ways to help deal with the small effects this can cause bruising is small just leads to awkward questions at times if you have this or any familiarity with this is there anything else mineral vitatmin etc that would also help dude this is like best answer ever i swear i didn't cut and paste it from wikipedia hereditary spherocytosis is a genetically transmitted form of spherocytosis an auto hemolytic anemia characterized by the production of red blood cells that are sphere shaped rather than donut shaped and therefore more prone to hemolysis as in non hereditary spherocytosis the spleen's hemolysis results in observational symptoms of fatigue pallor and jaundice in a peripheral blood smear the abnormally small red blood cells lacking the central pallor as seen in non hereditary spherocytosis is typically more marked in hereditary spherocytosis other protein deficiencies cause hereditary elliptocytosis pyropoikilocytosis or stomatocytosis in longstanding cases and in patients who have taken iron supplementation or received numerous blood transfusions iron overload may be a significant problem being a potential cause of cardiomyopathy and liver disease measuring iron stores is therefore considered part of the diagnostic approach to hereditary spherocytosis hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant trait most commonly though not exclusively found in northern european and japanese families although an estimated of cases are due to spontaneous mutations a patient has a chance of passing the disorder onto his her offspring presuming that his her partner does not also carry the mutation hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in the genes that code for spectrin ankyrin protein and other erythrocyte membrane proteins these proteins are necessary to maintain the normal shape of an erythrocyte which is a biconcave disk the protein that is most commonly defective is ankyrin as the spleen normally targets abnormally shaped red cells which are typically older it also destroys spherocytes as in non hereditary spherocytosis acute symptoms of anemia and hyperbilirubinemia indicate treatment with blood transfusions or exchanges and chronic symptoms of anemia and splenomegaly indicate dietary supplementation of iron and splenectomy the surgical removal of the spleen experimental gene therapy exists to treat hereditary spherocytosis in lab mice however this treatment has not yet been tried on humans and because of the risks involved in human gene therapy it may never be just call me doctor ludd  AIDS Von Willebrand disease Bone marrow transplant Mesothelioma Growth hormone Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Duchenne muscular dystrophy Cytomegalovirus Pneumonia Long QT syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Obstetrics Rheumatoid arthritis Spleen Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Genetic engineering Glycogen storage disease type I Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Stem cell Gout Traumatic brain injury Herpes simplex virus Lung cancer Growth hormone deficiency Immunosuppressive drug Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Kidney Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Protein Blood transfusion Senescence Protein-energy malnutrition Pulmonary embolism

xanax for medical procedure can anyone give me any feed back on using xanax for a medical procedure my doc prescribed it because i am very anxious over a painful medical test i have to have i was under the impression that xanax is usually for generalised anxiety disorder i don't have generalised anxiety problems its just over this one test i had this test once before without a sedative and had a panic attack i am supposed to take one mg pill minutes prior and can repeat with a second dose if necessary any feedback on the meds would be appreciated geeze people i have only pills and will only take it for this one test i do not have a anxiety disorder anyone can get anxious over a painful medical test to the pharmacist that responded thank you so much i feel better about it now my husband will be driving me home it is very common for xanax to be prescribed for a medical procedure especially if you are known to be anxious the dose that you wrote is also the most common way to take it for a medical procedure it is perfectly acceptable to take this medication if you are nervous for a procedure it works in your brain to decrease this anxiety take the first dose as directed take the second dose if you still feel very anxious about your procedure while xanax can be used for generalized anxiety disorder it is more commonly used for acute anxiety as needed antidepressants such as paxil are more commonly used for generalized anxiety disorder the most common side effect of xanax is drowsiness so make sure somebody can drive you to the doctor's office hospital for your procedure while xanax can be addictive when taken for long periods of time it is highly unlikely that you would become addicted to this medication after taking pills for a procedure valium is also a benzodiazepine and works in exactly the same way as xanax it just stays in the body for a longer period of time it also has the same risk of addiction very unlikely when taking it for one procedure there is no reason to take valium over xanax as they are in the same class and work the same way  Clinical depression Alprazolam Panic attack Antidepressant Clomipramine Maprotiline Addiction Drug addiction Opioid Doxepin Paroxetine Benzodiazepine Sedative Multiple sclerosis Bipolar disorder Anxiolytic Medicine Obsessive-compulsive disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chlorpromazine Trimipramine Methamphetamine Venlafaxine LSD Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Chronic fatigue syndrome Alcoholism Traumatic brain injury Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Paracetamol Anorexia nervosa Antipsychotic Prostate cancer Tianeptine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Haloperidol Cannabis (drug) Transsexuality Drug abuse Flunitrazepam Caffeine Pneumonia Epilepsy Folic acid Bupropion Electroconvulsive therapy Sleep Hypoglycemia St John's wort Hypnosis Psychopharmacology Buspirone Stuttering Medical prescription Propranolol Tobacco smoking Stroke Lorazepam Topiramate Diabetes mellitus Fluoxetine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Parkinson's disease Post-traumatic stress disorder Menstrual cycle Rabies Psychosis Narcolepsy Aspirin Controversies in autism Methylphenidate Controlled Substances Act Chlorprothixene Anticonvulsant Cocaine Withdrawal Lamotrigine Meditation Analgesic Chemical imbalance theory Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Buprenorphine Traditional Chinese medicine 5-HTP Tricyclic antidepressant Atherosclerosis Childbirth

poison question for a book i'm writing any nurses doctors pharmacists out there writing is my hobby i've got a howdunit book on poisons but i'm still having trouble coming up with the right method of poisoning i need for a murder mystery i'm writing nothing i have read about has fit my needs perfectly yet so any suggestions would be appreciated here are the specifics the poison would need to conform to an older person with health problems might have a perscription with enough of the drug to kill someone it has to be something you could mix in alcohol without the victim detecting it too soon it would be nice if it were also available on the street so a character who is a local druggie would make a good suspect the death should be fairly quick an hour or less because my murderer won't have enough access to the victim to engage in systematic poisoning any ideas thanks thanks holyguacamole and yes i'm totally harmless but my characters aren't digitalis sounds promising would a teenage druggie have it as a recreational drug though or i guess i could choose to direct suspicion towards a girl whose trying to lose weight wikipedia mentions that as an abuse although that would require me to rethink a sideplot i've got going hmmm thanks i agree digitalis is good but it would be hard to get it's never used for recreational purposes so it's not likely you would get it on the street there is the plant but it would take a lot and i'm not sure how that would work if it were ingested you typically get side effects from touching the plant i would say arsenic rat poison it's readilly available anywhere you would purchase pest deterrents it works very quickly if a person were to take enough at once although you often hear about slow poisoning to avoid detection and it's virtually undetectable when mixed in food or drink a prescription med that could be used any type of narcotic pain reliever or sedative oxycodone morphine xanax all meds that someone could have a prescription for as well as are often found on the street by abusers  Drug addiction Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Controlled Substances Act Medical prescription Sedative Prohibition (drugs) Paracetamol Migraine Diazepam Hypoglycemia Analgesic Addiction Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Arguments for and against drug prohibition Oxycodone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Illegal drug trade Opioid Cocaine Convention on Psychotropic Substances Medicine Poison Pope John Paul I Anorexia nervosa Clinical depression Drug test Drug abuse Narcotic Emergency contraception Alcoholism Assassination Medical cannabis Osteoarthritis Cannabis (drug) Rape Alprazolam Prostate cancer Anxiety Cancer Clomipramine Alcoholics Anonymous Bipolar disorder Serial killer AIDS reappraisal First aid Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) CPU cache Traditional Chinese medicine Biodiversity Stomach cancer Stroke Aspartame Breastfeeding Alcoholic beverage Methamphetamine Asthma Maprotiline EastEnders Flunitrazepam Nitrous oxide Harold Shipman Morphine Haloperidol Dog Common cold Humphrey Bogart Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Antidepressant Rush Limbaugh Clandestine chemistry Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sin City Publicly funded medicine Homeopathy Cat American Psycho Vegetarianism Folic acid Hamster Food Marsh test E-mail spam Rat Park Ricin Platoon (film) Contract Pneumonia Domestic violence Doxepin Human sexual behavior Cyanide Codeine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

what is stereotypic movement disorder a repetitive abnormal movement that is unvoluntary for example a patient would suddenly lift his arm and turn his head to the left and kick with his leg then go back to do whatever he was doing he would not know why he did that particular movement after some time the same pattern movement would occur again and so on it is common in diseases affecting the basal ganglia it is sometimes painful for the patient because such movements frequently cause people to laugh sometimes they are mistaken for 'tantrums in children it might also be acquired from drug abuse  Traumatic brain injury Autism Muscle Parkinson's disease Clinical depression Asperger syndrome Urinary incontinence Cerebral palsy Epilepsy Rheumatoid arthritis Narcolepsy Autoimmune diseases Carpal tunnel syndrome Alcoholism Hypoglycemia Huntington's disease Nystagmus Myasthenia gravis Basal ganglia Mental illness Prostate cancer Herpes zoster Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psychosis Cerebellum Bipolar disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Cephalic disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stuttering Thoracic outlet syndrome Chlorpromazine Multiple sclerosis Essential tremor Herpes simplex virus Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Dystonia Borderline personality disorder Stroke Melanin Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cancer Aphasia Panic attack Sickle-cell disease Hearing impairment Health issues and the effects of cannabis Lupus erythematosus Hirschsprung's disease Tardive dyskinesia Pneumonia Coma Backstroke Leukemia Drug abuse Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Sexual dysfunction Paget's disease of bone Fibromyalgia Aerial (dance move) Duchenne muscular dystrophy Hyperhidrosis Inclusion body myositis Professional wrestling holds Polycystic kidney disease Irritable bowel syndrome Niemann-Pick disease Butterfly stroke Gout Restless legs syndrome Syringomyelia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Schizophrenia Addiction Breaststroke Repetitive strain injury Diazepam Telencephalon Swingout Migraine Dopamine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Human papillomavirus Gastroesophageal reflux disease Asthma Fecal incontinence Suplex Familial Mediterranean fever Traumatic incident reduction Stomach cancer Osteoarthritis Weight training M__ni__re___s disease Allergy Anorexia nervosa Group A streptococcal infection Balance disorder Equine conformation Eye

i know someone who was recently diagnosed with bipolar illness does anyone have any helpful tips that could benefit the person with the illness and also help family and friends to cope bipolar is not a sickness per say but rather a condition that is caused because the brain simply does not create certain chemicals that it needs or creates them in too small amounts there is no reasons or clues yet by scientists yet as to why this happens or exactly which of those chemicals are missing and in which amounts therefore each bipolar person is going to have a little bit different situation therefore it is crucial that they see a psychiatrist regularly to diagnose the ups and downs of their feelings and regulate their medications accordingly some bipolar people like my husband may take several years to get their medications balanced other people like my daughter can get balanced almost immediately and stay that way as long as they stay on their medications that is because everyone's body reacts differently to bipolar and the chemicals they are using to replace the ones their brains are not creating bipolar is not a mental disorder where the person can go crazy but it can cause deep depression and severe anxiety the reason for this is because the chemicals that always seem to be the ones that are missing in the bipolar people are the good endorphins without those you cannot get happy so you will never be happy all your happiness is just a surface reaction to things the most uplifted point in a bipolar's feelings is still a low they cannot help that if they do not get good psychiatric help from a psychiatrist that has dealt with bipolar patients and know what the symptoms are they will never get better they also must determine inside themselves to 'want' to get on top of the situation and therefore determine to stay on their chemical medications and stay in counseling a good way to help them understand this is to use diabetees as an example when a person has type diabetees their body is not creating inculin if they do not take inculin to replace what it dose not create they will get very sick and die bipolar have a similar situation because their brain isn't functioning properly no one is at fault they don't even know if it is a birth defect at this point all they know is that it happens and they can only tell that by certain pattern symptoms that are specific to bipolar people as much preservatives and junk that they put into foods these days it could even be caused by that no one knows yet so there isn't any cure for it except to get their brain's chemicals balanced as best as possible a normal doctor cannot do that properly they may perscribe anti depressants but for bipolar they usually do not work for some reason bipolar people do run in the same family but it has only been diagnosed as that in the last few decades my husband's aunt and cousin we are certain had bipolar and we think that his dad had it too but no one diagnosed him he just acted so much like my husband in his down moods i have learned from years of living with my husband and daughter who is also now married that you must have patience when dealing with bipolar people until their medications really have them adjusted they simply cannot find a way out of their depression they cannot see positive things in fact all negative things can actually become positive things to them for example they will deliberately overdraw checkbooks because they want something and their thinking can be that they will just figure it out later my daugher got in trouble with creditors and banks lots of times for that other times they will just go on a spending spree and rank up several charge cards without batting an eye it is the worst thing they can do but they don't feel like it is because their negative emotions are all they know they have never really felt any positive ones my husband's and my daughter's psychiatrists both told them that they are not to make any decisions and not to spend or buy without someone else's decision making input until their chemicals were balanced and that they were out of their depressions bipolar is treatable the problem is in convincing the bipolar person to stick with the treatment and stay with the counceling eventually the counceling will get less and less and after awhile like with my husband and daughter now you will no longer need counceling and only need to go to the psychiatrist every to months for chemical updates and checks to make sure you have the proper doses and nothing needs to be adjusted usually that is just a minute appointment and is free by that time or totally covered by your insurance they call the appointment a med check bipolar people have been known to get so depressed before they get treatment or if they stop their treatments that they can actually attempt suiside a friend's sister attempted suidide that times because she wouldn't stay on her medications so whom ever is close to this person you know they need someone to help them remember that their medication is their ticket out of their situation and help them remember to keep taking it and keep their counseling appointments lots of people are awkward about going to a psychiatrist's office they shouldn't be if they are psychiatrists are brain doctors that is all and this conditions definitely needs a brain

red green colorblind toddler my son is nearly and he is above average in most things like numbers letters etc however he knows all his colors but can not seem to tell the difference between red and green at all everything red is green to him i should add that my own grandfather had red green color blindness and it was only detected when he tried to join the navy in wwii when he was the other thing i wonder about is if he is when he sees grass how does that appear to him if color blind any thoughts opinions etc much appreciated thanks he's going to the eye doctor on tuesday he loves purple and talks about purple a lot but if you line colors up he names every one correctly except red which he says is green without fail i didn't know i was red green color blind until i joined the army the way it works is when the colors are close together they blend for example if a traffic light was lit up at the same time green and red i would not be able to tell which color was which but since they are occuring at seperate times they are distinct then the grass should look green  Color blindness Color Traffic light Georges-Pierre Seurat Dragon Booster Rayleigh scattering Synaesthesia Camouflage Beret Light-emitting diode Color theory Purple Eye Colours, standards and guidons Eye color Color vision Rainbow Traffic sign Wassily Kandinsky New York City Subway nomenclature RGB color model BZFlag Logo CIE 1931 color space Link (Legend of Zelda) Lightsaber Unreal Stereoscopy Primary color Color space Shaggy dog story Billiards Green Teletubbies The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Peafowl Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Mnemonic Pixel Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Heterochromia Red state vs. blue state divide Negima Red Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion MBTA nomenclature PNG Tag Timeline of alternative rock The Red Green Show Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Cube (film) Wallpaper group Bicycle lighting Railway signalling Liturgical year W.I.T.C.H.

lupus rash or allergic reaction last night i began to have a burning sensation around my lips and lower cheek i figured i was getting a cold sore and would deal with it in the morning so i went to bed i awoke at midnight and to my surprise my whole face was hurting in painful burning sensation and a feeling of numb i couldn't open or close my eyelids completely so i decided to wake up and talk to my parents about it they tweaked i guess i looked either dead or like an alien my eyelids were swollen beyond belief and as they have before had slits in them which pour blood my eyes were and still are so swollen i can barely see and you can't see the white part of my eye just the color part and pupil barely my face was completely swollen cheeks chin lips nose and eyes all but my forehead and ears i was taken to the er and they diagnosed it as an allergic reaction but couldn't tell what i was allergic to i've had my allergy tests nothing showed up they prescribed me steriods predisone zyrtec and benadryll they gave me my first dosage in the hospital and i stayed there for three hours they said it would start working by then it hadn't nothing changed they sent me home and i continued with the medicine and it's been over hours and nothing has changed my face is the same except now i have a redish pink purplish idk rash on my inner cheeks and over my nose by the way my face doesn't itch but they said it was probably posion ivy oak or sumac but i don't have any of that in my yard and i was my hands like times a day important i have been dealing with an unknown condition for over years and haven't found a diagnosis i have seen myany doctors and now i'm going to see a rheumatologist because all my doctors think it's autoimmune and found autoimmune traces in biopsies all my symptoms are mostly autoimmune and most likely point to lupus which runs in my family usually every other or generations of the females both sides er information my hometown hospital doesn't bring me good luck i've been there a few times and all my diagnosis were wrong even after scopes x rays etc the doctors have mistaken a broken foot with a sprained ankle yeah ouch they have mistaken my benign brain tumor with brain cancer and wanted to operate asap but thank god my neurologist stopped it because i didn't need it and there was a fifty percent chance i'd live they mistook my gastritis with pud i didn't even had any ulcers and i've had over scopes and colonoscopies i had appendicitis and they confirmed and i needed immediate surgery but the surgeon decided he didn't want to come in so after hours of the docs and him fighting i was sent home sorry to blab on so much but my question is do you think this is just an allergic reaction possibly to sun because i get rashes and sick in the sun do you think it has anything to do with my immune system or some sort of disease especially because after so long nothing has gotten better on the medicine as far as i know i haven't been bitten by anything but two praying mantis did jump on me the other day when i was outside awkward but i don't think they're harmful i will say that we have a bat problem in our beautiful house yesterday my parents were up all night getting them out but as far as i know i wasn't bit because the burning started before i went to bed i've already seen a gi doctor and got all the tests available even camera pill they found what they needed to find and its autoimmune as i said before which is why i'm seeing a rheuma i'm not going into any other symptoms though not enough time p but i don't have celiac or any gi diseases except gastritis erosion and ulcers hi im chris im so sorry what is happening to you but i know exactly what you are going through from first hand experience i have lupus and severe allergies just this week i was exsposed to some ladies very cheap very flowery perfume i got the swollen eyes itchiness swollen lips blotchiness and on top of that spent days in bed because of the lupus my body could not fight the allergy my eyes took several days to go down its friday im still itchy and i still have a headache at times my lips however went down after days of massive doses of benydryl and allegra d it has happened to me so much i rarely bother with the er anymore ive kind of figured out what they do the dosage etc and do it at home just without the steroids im allergic to those ironically it sounds like the hospital you go to is very imcompetent and i very much hope you dont live in an area too rual you need another hospital also growing up i lived in an area with fruit bats which i suspect is what is in and around your house to my knowledge they are rather harmless though not very nice to look at are they ive never in my life heard of them biting or harming someone they used to live in one of my trees in the summer my suspision is that your allergic reaction came from somthing you have contact with pretty much on a daily basis it happens to me often as someone with an autoimmne disease i can be fine with somthing one day say strawberries then out of the blue have a severe allergic reaction to it another time then i dont touch them for awhile and ill be fine again so it could have been somthing in your diet a shampoo you use daily or a soap anything in the household that you developed some kind of temporary or even permenent allergy to it happens to me often just about any autoimmune disease can cause this to happen our own cells in our bodies become hyperactive thinking they are under attack so anything at anytime can happen we can form allergies overnight or get the flu when not even exposed etc about your hometown hospital i hope you live in an area that is not so rual that your parents can easily drive a half hour to an hour to get you to a better hospital that place sounds more dangerous than any illness anybody can have they are a lawsuit waiting to happen about the lupus your young i know dr's dont like labeling teens with things like lupus at such a young age unless your life is in immeadiate danger i know i waited until my 's though i clearly had it im now almost i know others in the same position i know girls that were both diagnosed around because they needed medications for their lupus right away they had organ threatining lupus also labeling someone that young can hurt your chances for going to college in case you have a remisson or the dr's happen to be wrong because once your diagnosed it cant be taken back here is the lupus critera you must meet of also your blood test can be showing any number of possible autoimmune disorders diagnostic criteria for lupus the following criteria are used to distinguish lupus systemic lupus erythematosus or sle from other autoimmune and rheumatic diseases a person with of these conditions can be diagnosed with lupus symptoms suggest that lupus is probably present and raise the possibility of lupus symptoms may be present all at once or appear in succession over a period of time butterfly malar rash on cheeks rash on face arms neck torso discoid rash skin rashes that result from exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light photosensitivity mouth or nasal ulcers usually painless joint swelling stiffness pain involving two or more joints arthritis inflammation of the membranes surrounding the lungs pleuritis or heart pericarditis this inflammation is called serositis abnormalities in urine such as increased protein or clumps of red blood cells or kidney cells called cell casts in the urine nervous system problems such as seizures or psychosis without known cause problems with the blood such as reduced numbers of red blood cells anemia platelets or white blood cells positive antinuclear antibody ana test signs of increased autoimmunity antibodies against normal tissue as shown by laboratory tests i also co own a lupus autoimmune yahoo support group we do have several teens and there

a question about lupus i've been dealing with severe joint pain in my legs for the last several months so i decided to see a doctor evidently the problems i've been having are classis lupus symptoms she took just about half my blood for a bunch of tests and gave me some pain medication and steroids to take while i'm waiting i started taking the meds and i'm feeling a lot better already so i'm guessing that's a sign it's either lupus or some other auto immune disease i've done a lot of reading already and the more i read the more it seems like this really is what i've got so what should i expect this may sound silly but my major concern is taking steriods for extended periods my mother my uncle and cousin all have crohn's disease took steroids for long periods and they've never been able to lose the weight i'm just curious about what to expect as far as steroids and weight gain goes any insight in general i've already been to tons of websites i'm looking more for personal info hi im chris i have had lupus a long time and have been on steroids off and on for a good years at this point i wont take them at this point not so much for weight but other side effects i was on them once for i think years straight i did gain about pounds i hated it but they did take me off for me they just didnt work and they eventually changed my medications to imuran and then methotrexate once off the medications i lost all the weight within months it melted of like water today i wont take them because they make me an insulan dependant diabetic give me migranes and a host of other things like you autoimmunes tend to run high in my family my mother has somthing called polymalgia rhuematica a cousin has crorhn's and another autoimune thyroid disease those i know little about but lupus i sure can help you with if your just now noticing signs of it which it sounds like with the joint pain you may also begin to notice that you may start having some skin issues like photosensitivity you cant go in the sun or be in ultraviolet lighting most stores use that and being in it a long time is like sunlight you may get a butterfly rash which bridges across your nose and your cheecks you may get different types of rashes anywhere else on your body sun exposed or not you may get low grade fevers muscle pain fatigue sometimes you may experience mild to moderate cognitive problems like what is called brain fog ability to think clearly sometimes get your words into sentances the way you would like you may find your self stumbling when you walk a bit etc those were a lot of my early problems also i noticed my hands feet and ankles would swell and go down usually when hot outside then i would be ok after putting them up drinking a lot of water or the next day you may have some months where you may show that your a bit anemic or your blood counts show some kind of non specific infection which they will give you antibiotics for some lupus paitents have major organ involvment some do not it stays contained mainly to the symptoms and issues i mentioned above in my case i am considered to have mainly liver involvment and central nervous system involvment my brain at times can be very bad to where i need chemo to get swelling down others have heart lung kidney lupus nerphritis involvment lupus dosnt discriminate it can go after any body organ or part for the most part i co own a lupus support group i have noticed most seem to dodge major organ involvment but a lot become anemic have minor to severe im the most severe that i know of with central nervous system issues some occasionally may get like kidney stone which clear up or tend towards brhoncitis and minor things that can be taken care of from all my years of doing research moderating and owning online message boards support groups its the ones that keep the most poitive attitudes that tend to keep the most normal lives no matter how ill they are they tend to look on the bright side and not see the what if's they are well informed have better support either from family friends support groups in their community or online or all they listen to their bodies and know when to rest they dont worry about every little ache and pain they comply with doctors orders they know how to continue laughing that my dear is a must we still live our lives though we have some glitches lupus isnt a life sentance we just have to modify a bit also since i wont do the prednison train i must add there are all kinds of classes of medications to help those with lupus once confirmed the first thing they will put you on is plaquinil it is an antimalarial and for somereason it helps to slow down a lupus paitents overactive immune systems a bit and protect our skin reason unkown there are other classes of medicaton mainly immunosuppresent and immunosupressent chemotherapy agents but your a long way from that my friend you said youve been doing some research but i will leave you with several links ill also leave you with the support group link we have many vetren diagnosed like me we constantly do reserach we have newly diagnosed and some waiting to be diagnosed my best chris oh here are the lupus critera you need to have lupus diagnostic criteria for lupus the following criteria are used to distinguish lupus systemic lupus erythematosus or sle from other autoimmune and rheumatic diseases a person with of these conditions can be diagnosed with lupus symptoms suggest that lupus is probably present and raise the possibility of lupus symptoms may be present all at once or appear in

speculate what's wrong with me i have had a varying degree of diarrhea over the last months around about the same time i started swimming every day maybe around the same time i stopped drinking tea coffee so i went to the doctors they note that i appear to be a healthy year old cm stones medium built i do not appear to be loosing weight from my problem had blood tests and the book me in for an appointment with a member of gastroenterology service they have also called me back for further blood tests because they think i am lacking vitamin b and i may need injections of it i wonder if these are related or maybe it's just that my body isn't absorbing the b because of a problem in my intenstines o i eat meat with most meals i have cereal with milk every morning except weekends i usually have bacon and egg any guesses don't worry i'll take your ideas with a pinch of salt stephen p i'm not a nervous person i get stressed though curleeyq i've only been to see the gp for intial diagnosis and further diagnosis with blood test and stool samples i've got the appointment at the hostpital st october miles away but on monday i'll go have another blood test in regards to the b defficiency rvrmldnd i'm glad that you agree with the swimming pool theory though i wouldn't like to give it up i'm in the uk and i don't have to pay for appointments as they're covered under the nhs i only have to pay a fixed amount of or something for prescriptions i've had the same problem i started swimming and started to get a case of daily diarhea not losing weight from it this stopped happening after months or so so the daily problem could very well be related to the swimming even the most careful swimmer will end up with an occasional sip of the pool water and i sincerely believe that this is where the diarrhea comes from i noticed back then that the problem went away after the pool was deep cleaned i stopped swimming due to an accident and do not know when i will resume so i do not know if the problem will occur again i'll have to wait and see as far as your lack of b goes and the appointments to me this is nothing but money making on the part of the health professionals you can buy supplements with b at any store and add that to your diet without having to have injections if you didn't have any other problems with your digestive system other than the temporary diarrhea i would check that my liver profile came back normal and then wait and see if the problem persists before i go back to the doctor  Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Folic acid Vitamin C Insulin Chronic fatigue syndrome Tocopherol Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Urinary incontinence Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Veganism Medicine Anorexia nervosa Milk Domestic rabbit Anemia Escherichia coli O157:H7 Guinea pig Dieting Dietary fiber Drowning Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Nutrition Healthy eating Crohn's disease Publicly funded medicine Breakfast Clinical depression Cirrhosis Schistosomiasis Swimming Protein-energy malnutrition Anxiety Irritable bowel syndrome First aid Atkins Nutritional Approach HIV test Vegetarianism Insomnia Paget's disease of bone Ulcerative colitis Growth hormone treatment Medicare (Canada) Radiation therapy Food allergy Drug test Gastroesophageal reflux disease Colorectal cancer Terri Schiavo Theory of conduct Acne Fugu Pneumonia Marathon (sport) National Health Service Super Size Me Glycogen storage disease type I Dairy Obesity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Coffee Cytomegalovirus Gastroparesis Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Fancy rat 613 mitzvot Hyperglycemia Vitamin D Controversies in autism Ebola Hepatitis C Cystic fibrosis Adjustable gastric band Sento Autism Tofu Halitosis Hemorrhoid Foodborne illness Social rule Osteoporosis Kosher foods AIDS reappraisal

hypoglycemia i thought chromium would be beneficial but taking chromium picolinate tablet a day seems to make it worse is that possible or am i imagining things chromium picolinate is a potentiator of insulin which means that it helps insulin move sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body's cells this can increase any hypoglycemic tendencies that you may have talk to your doctor about this by the way many chromium supplements have somewhere on the label a warning that they may reduce blood sugar hope this helps  Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Insulin resistance Nutrition Polycystic ovary syndrome Blood sugar Hyperglycemia Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Anti-diabetic drug Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sulfonylurea Glucokinase Atherosclerosis Clinical depression Diabetic ketoacidosis Stroke Panic attack Dietary fiber Glycogen Prostate cancer Alzheimer's disease Bodybuilding Fructose Intensive insulinotherapy Glucose meter Tocopherol Gastroparesis Epinephrine Congenital hyperinsulinism Knife Stomach cancer Paracetamol Diabetic nephropathy Cancer Iron Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Antiretroviral drug Insulinoma Alcoholism Blood Aspirin Crohn's disease Post-traumatic stress disorder Milk Low-carbohydrate diet Hyperkalemia Growth hormone treatment Senescence Growth hormone deficiency LSD Psoriasis Metastasis Endocrinology Experimental cancer treatment Diabetic hypoglycemia Chlorophyta Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone Protein-energy malnutrition First aid Cannabis (drug) Chronic fatigue syndrome Whipple's triad Garlic Chromium Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Glycemia Protein Altruism Signal transduction Multiple sclerosis Calorie restriction Red blood cell Corrosion Dieting Breastfeeding Sleep Dehydroepiandrosterone Migraine Homeostasis Glucagon Glucose tolerance test Cortisol Exercise Psychosis Biotin Colorectal cancer Adiponectin Hormone Memento (film) Bipolar disorder Glycation Herpes simplex virus Gene therapy Functional magnetic resonance imaging Eye Anxiety

are the increases in diseases like autism and alzheimer's due to pollution or chemicals in everyday life or is it food preservative based i don't think they have a definitive cause or do they u have an excellent answer taylor ur point of degenerative diseases which i assume are cancer r well taken but keep in mind alzheimer's is strking ppl in their s even never before was there such a disease in my humble opinion they are more related to western lifestyle and advanced healthcare excessive scrutiny of children leads to an increased detection of so called psychiatric illness compred to thirdworld countries and the rest of the world exceedingly long life expectations in the west due to advanced healthcare leads to an apparent increase in degenerative diseases caused by nothing else than old age edit good point i did not know that alzheimer's disease affected people of young age groups of course other aspects of industrialization could very well be the culprit but do not underestimate the sort of interruption of natural selection that is a byproduct of advanced healthcare ie people with diseases who in the past would not have survived to procreate are now given an almost normal quality and quantity of life so that they do in fact have children and thus propagate their genes leading to even more bizarre anomalies to appear in the community  Autism epidemic Life expectancy Alzheimer's disease Autism Nutrition Health insurance Tobacco smoking Medicine DNA repair Parkinson's disease Mental illness Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Publicly funded medicine Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Autism rights movement Prostate cancer Asperger syndrome Infantilism Dementia Overpopulation Cephalic disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extinction Duesberg hypothesis Sickle-cell disease Hearing impairment Stroke Coeliac disease Brain Abortion debate Race in biomedicine Mental health Reproduction Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Air pollution Allergy Ecology Evolution Alcoholism Anorexia nervosa Organic farming Thimerosal Migraine Emil Kraepelin Dairy Luminiferous aether Mutation Chronic fatigue syndrome Inflation Diarrhea Altruism Externality Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Mitochondrial genetics Breast cancer Crohn's disease Senescence Pollution Human Lifestyle diseases (alternative medicine) The nature of God in Western theology Raw food diet Pharmaceutical company Mental retardation Health care Peer review Global warming and agriculture Ozone depletion Microeconomics Shrimp farm Agriculture Stomach cancer Vitamin C Melanin Carcinogenesis Global warming Sexual orientation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Ethical challenges to autism treatment Mesothelioma Apple Second language acquisition Biodiversity Demographics of Japan Hypertension Supernatural Motor neurone disease Demographic transition Bipolar disorder Faster-than-light Long QT syndrome Traumatic brain injury

how can i tell if i have acid reflux disease when i eat spicy foods i pay in a big way is there a way to tell if i have acid reflux disease do symtoms increase when you lie down like do you wake up at night with heartburn or even vomiting gerd can be compared to a valve failure between the stomach and the food pipe this valve due to many causes will leak and allow fluid from the stomach which contains hydrochloric acid and powerful digestive juices to pass to the food pipe and even up to the mouth causing a burning sensation in the chest and throat and sometimes even severe pain as the stomach juice burns through the inner walls of the food pipe definite diagnosis requires endoscopy hour ph monitoring of the esophagus food pipe also a barium meal contrast study to show how stomach contents return back into the food pipe hey i will tell you a cheap practical way to definitely tell if your indigestion is caused by gerd or something else simply take an antacid syrup or tablets when you feel the discomfort if it gets better right away then you most likely have gerd  Peptic ulcer Stomach cancer Esophagus Esophageal cancer Achalasia Coeliac disease Vomiting Helicobacter pylori Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach Colorectal cancer Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Crohn's disease Gastric acid Fecal incontinence Adjustable gastric band Urinary incontinence Hydrochloric acid Nutrition Pneumonia Diarrhea Aortic dissection Aspartame Obesity Digestion Botulism Paracetamol Myocardial infarction Asthma H2-receptor antagonist Cancer Proton pump inhibitor Obstetrics Cancer of the larynx Tobacco smoking Raw food diet Foodborne illness Mouth ulcer Migraine Gastrointestinal tract Cirrhosis Angina Acute pancreatitis Carburetor Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sickle-cell disease Halitosis Anemia Parietal cell Multiple chemical sensitivity Anorexia nervosa Drowning Paget's disease of bone Dehydration Tooth Rebreather Diabetes mellitus Dialysis Fugu Shock Osteoarthritis Reflux Coffee Cheese Gout Date Palm Dietary fiber Conjunctivitis Hiatus hernia Cat Chronic fatigue syndrome Insulin Coronary heart disease Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Acupuncture Fasting Barrett's esophagus Endoscopy Flatulence Sulfasalazine Hydraulic machinery Traumatic brain injury Barbecue Chest pain Burping Stroke Antiretroviral drug Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Omega-3 fatty acid

i pooped green once how come why jesus why did i poop green there are generally two causes for a green bowel movement something you have ingested such as large amounts of green leafy vegetables green or purple artificial colouring or iron supplements a variation in the gut transit time particularly fast transit caused by diarrhea and ibs the colour of a bowel movement generally depends on the colour of the food eaten and the state of the bile that is produced by the liver bile is green in color and is only changed to brown through a proper digestive process which takes time so if the food is travelling too fast through the intestines there is no time for the bile to be chemically changed and so it will remain green until it is expelled from the body  Irritable bowel syndrome Diarrhea Gastrointestinal tract Dietary fiber Liver Feces Nutrition Coeliac disease Vomiting Crohn's disease Vitamin C Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Ulcerative colitis Cirrhosis Foodborne illness Cholesterol Guinea pig Colorectal cancer Iron Inflammatory bowel disease Flatulence Ascariasis Blood Cuisine of the Southern United States Small intestine Earthworm Healthy eating Color Food allergy Gallbladder Taurine Cancer Toilet humour Bilirubin Gallstone Hypoglycemia Laxative Tofu Japanese tea ceremony Jaundice Folic acid Food Aspartame Traditional Chinese medicine Organic food Coffee The Wack Pack Antioxidant Fasting Bowel obstruction Anemia Raw food diet Insulin Horse colic Defecation Chronic fatigue syndrome Chocolate Hydrogen sulfide Vegetarian nutrition Pancreas Organic farming Garlic Technetium Lactobacillus acidophilus Cholecystokinin Coprophagia Digenea Action potential Autoimmune diseases Copper Constipation Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Escherichia coli O157:H7 Multiple chemical sensitivity Tocopherol Fugu Pharmacology Primary sclerosing cholangitis Egg (food) Molybdenum Biochemistry Hirschsprung's disease Bloating Opium Botulism Glycogen storage disease type I Golden rice Protein Muscle Food coloring Paracetamol Hamster

cannot figure out why i have a fever and abdominal bloating when test prove all organs are ok i ate a piece of fried chicken and not even a half hour later i had servere abdominal pain in the upper part but in the center of my abdomin i went to the doctor and he ran tests the tests ruled out gal bladder liver and infection my white blood count was normal as everything else was abdominal pain stoped and had soreness still have a low grade fever and bloating in my abdominal area the doctor is unsure what is wrong he thinks maybe an ulcer fried chicken contains a fair amount of fat from the frying oil does this happen to you when you eat creamy soups milkshakes etc if so the problem may be considerably simpler you may have fat intolerance in this setting you consume an oily or fatty meal and develop symptoms like you speak of following the meal the symptoms are more pronounced with liquid fats this can be assessed with a gastric emptying study but the test meal composition is essential to teasing this out it should be liquid fat alternatively you might have a problem with bacterial overgrowth this happens when your intestines don't move food through just right and things sit around too long and allow bacteria to inhabit normally clean parts of the intestine when you eat especially sugars or starches as in the coating of the fried chicken the meal may be fermented by bacteria instead of being digested and absorbed by you this leads to production of gas sometimes enormous amounts bloating pain and often diarrhea you can tease this out in the least invasive manner with a breath hydrogen test you swallow some non digestible non absorbable carbohydrate and then blow into a bag at regular intervals if you have high bacterial counts you will generate a lot of hydrogen among other gases which is absorbed into your bloodstream and then expired via the lungs if your doctor goes ahead with an endoscopy to look at your stomach lining to rule out ulcer he she can also go a bit farther down and aspirate some of the intestinal contents to check for bacteria however this may not be conclusive since the 'scope won't go down far enough to be able to get the bacteria  Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Insulin Milk Coeliac disease Crohn's disease Food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Ulcerative colitis Bloating Cirrhosis Aspartame Peptic ulcer Fecal incontinence Irritable bowel syndrome Cancer Tofu Dietary fiber Chronic fatigue syndrome Bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hydrogen sulfide Diabetes mellitus Stomach Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Lung Sewage treatment Tocopherol Adjustable gastric band Glucose Obesity Diabetic neuropathy Veganism Domestic rabbit Flatulence Colorectal cancer Chocolate Abdominal pain Cheese Dialysis Carbon dioxide Cantonese cuisine Anthrax Vomiting Cystic fibrosis Helicobacter pylori Acute pancreatitis Hydrochloric acid Bread Egg (food) Abdomen Halitosis Biochemistry Traumatic brain injury Vitamin C Ovarian cancer Common cold Coffee Urinary incontinence Cuisine of Denmark Stroke Botulism Paracetamol Decompression sickness Group A streptococcal infection Hyperglycemia Fugu Trans fat Intravenous therapy Caffeine Japanese cuisine Gastric acid First aid Tooth Atkins Nutritional Approach Aspirin Small intestine Alcohol fuel Breakfast Fancy rat Food allergy Esophageal cancer Folic acid Chlorophyta

what are your migraine triggers the things that trigger migraines for me are paint fumes bright light i wear sunglasses most of the summer strongly flavoured cheese dark chocolate and stress i wish i knew i have woken up in the early hours of the morning with my flashing lights my migraines normally come in groups of three and i have over a large number of years tried to find what triggers them i had been going to a research centre where we logged everything we ate drink i did this for two years and could find no appreciable triggers from food many people blame foods as triggers however foods are not thought to be common triggers suspect a food as a trigger if a migraine occurs within six hours of eating it if a migraine often occurs after eating the suspected food and cutting out the food reduces the number of migraines some people need a combination of triggers to trigger a migraine for example some women may only get a migraine if they drink red wine and are having a period another example is that a food trigger may only trigger a migraine if you are also over tired or stressed  Migraine Chronic fatigue syndrome Chocolate Urinary incontinence Meal Tyramine Fecal incontinence Roman eating and drinking French cuisine Multiple chemical sensitivity Breakfast Cluster headache Cuisine of Denmark Tooth Japanese tea ceremony Wine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Monosodium glutamate Sun Wood Customs and etiquette of Japan Welding Soft drink Korean cuisine Coffee Elephant Food Lamotrigine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Asthma Menstrual cycle Caffeine Neuralgia Hypoglycemia Healthy eating Chrono Trigger Cannabis (drug) Color blindness USS Trigger (SS-237) Coeliac disease Dairy German cuisine Food preservation Herpes simplex virus Plastic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Lightning Cuisine of Argentina Veganism Dream Theater Word of Wisdom Stone Age Vomiting Aliens of London Psychosis Humphrey Bogart Lucid dreaming Multiple sclerosis Sin City Rosacea Acne Cuisine of the Philippines Propranolol Cheese Pasteurization Daylight saving time In-N-Out Burger Mouth ulcer Mid-Autumn Festival Trailer Park Boys Diabetes mellitus Lupus erythematosus Tsunami Open cluster Brown Bear Carnivorous plant Kosher foods Internal ballistics Giraffe Foodborne illness Baldness Emergency contraception Spider Traffic light Tooth enamel Sunglasses Sonic the Hedgehog Cat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Conker's Bad Fur Day Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Brazil Vulcan (Star Trek) Chicken Peanut

acid reflux maybe i haven't been able to eat much more than a few bites for the past two weeks as well as not able to drink more than half a cup of water each day everytime i do i feel like soemthing is in my throat it feels like it's gagging me or my stomach gets upset like im going to throw up my mom thinks it's h pylori i went to the dr they scheduled me an endoscopy sp sept i can't go a whole month barely eating i hardly have any energy left just walking upstairs make my heart pound for about min does anyone know what this is or similiar or have any advice i havent taken any meds because i dont know what i have dont want to mess up my stomach throat even more should i try to find another dr that does endoscopy i was even thinking of going to the hospital for iv feeding but i dont think i'd be allowed to do that any advice or anything thanks for all the anwsers so far i talked with my mom and we're going to try to get them to schedule faster or find someone else she says i may have to go to my dr but i know that she won't be able to do anything about it as she's not a specialist she's my regualr dr and so far ive been eating ice cubes as it's not too much water and it's in small amounts ive also frozen gatorade and am eating those it seems a little strange to me that your doctor would let your endoscopy appointment be so far away when he she knows you have barely been eating or drinking i would've thought that he she would have tried to get you in as a priority if you want to you could try a second doctor and see what they say if your symptoms become severe you could go to the emergency room for treatment in which case if they fear you are becoming dehydrated they will give you an iv before you go run to another doctor or the emergency room why don't you pick up some tums or rolaids from the drugstore use those a little bit before you eat and see if it helps your symptoms i'm also quite surprised that your doctor didn't put you on a day trial of prevacid my mom had symptoms like this and her doctor put her on a day trial of prevacid she's been pretty much fine ever since and now her doctor writes a prescription for it anyways definitely try the tums rolaids before eating if this doesn't help see if you can find another doctor if you become severely ill and desperate pay a visit to your local emergency room also try drinking easier said than done i know more than of water if you become dehydrated you'll become very ill feeling and it could become potentially life threatening if not treated hope this helps feel better  Stomach cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gastroparesis Diarrhea Coeliac disease Dehydration Breastfeeding RuneScape quests First aid Kodocha Theory of conduct Clinical depression Hyperthermia Fecal incontinence Pneumonia Bipolar disorder Milton H.

what medical problems can result from exposure to a laptop explosion i'll try not to be vague here i'm not talking about the effects that result when the person is directly in front of the explosion i e burns wounds etc i was wondering if breathing in the smoke could result in health problems would it contain toxins and carcinogens that would be harmful even during brief exposure would it be expected to result in things like sinus pressure headaches fatigue nasal discharge etc i don't know if this makes any difference but the laptop battery which caused the explosion was a lithium battery hi i cant imagine that very short exposure could cause lasting effects a healthy person should be quite equiped to detoxify and process harmful things that are breathed in or absorbed through the skin of course if you live in the west you probably get a lot of non organic chemicals from detergents clothes soaps hygeine items etc so that can cause a bit of an overload over time so the short exposure to the laptop would just add to this collection of chemicals that your body cant get rid of some chemicals collect in the liver for example no one is entirely sure how to prevent toxic build up and some dont even think we are affected by the chemicals in our environment to play it on the safe side just eat a good diet with anti oxidants and maybe think about an alternative de tox program  Cancer Explosive material Decompression sickness Sewage treatment Pneumonia Multiple chemical sensitivity Ionizing radiation Hypoglycemia Hydrogen peroxide Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Benzene Methamphetamine Clinical depression Vitamin C Pollution Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Polychlorinated biphenyl Beryllium Battery (electricity) Air pollution Fire fighting Hay fever Rebreather Ammonia Fire extinguisher Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Depleted uranium Hygiene Multiple sclerosis Carbon dioxide Hydrogen sulfide Uranium Plutonium Healthy eating Dioxin Nutrition Aspartame Welding Asthma Silver First aid Kryptonite DNA repair Diabetes mellitus DDT Cocaine Haloalkane Mercury (element) Animal testing Methanol Toxicity Anthrax Lung cancer Edible salt Eczema Common cold Theory of conduct Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Coeliac disease Nuclear power Folic acid Raw food diet Alcohol fuel Use of poison gas in World War I Organic food Lithium ion battery Hydrogen economy Styrene Paracetamol Eutrophication Sunscreen Chloroform Tocopherol Polyvinyl chloride Allergy Epilepsy Hyperthermia 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Asbestos Insulin Omega-3 fatty acid Lithium Aflatoxin Nitroglycerin Technetium Thimerosal Cresol Plastic

my unborn baby has a multicystic kidney anyone have any more info i'm weeks now and the doctors say he'll be fine i was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this god forbid or if you know anything about it i have not experienced it but can tell you a little about it multicystic dysplastic kidney mcdk is due to the kidney not forming properly during fetal development the kidney usually resembles a bunch of grapes fortunately this usually only happens to one kidney the reason i say fortunately is because the affected kidney will never function and nothing can be done to change that the good news is that our wonderful bodies provide us with two kidneys and one kidney is fully capable of handling the functions of two kidneys this is why the doctor told you that your precious baby will be fine the normal healthy kidney will compensate for the cystic kidney for more good news the prognosis for your baby is good it is extremely rare for there to be any problems later in life due to mcdk please be aware though that your baby will probably be given ultrasounds every to months just to keep an eye on the cystic kidney in time the mcdk will disappear completely  Kidney Cephalic disorder Turner syndrome Renal cell carcinoma Pregnancy Cystic fibrosis Abortion debate Insulin Cryptorchidism Miscarriage Infantilism Childbirth Pneumonia Glycogen storage disease type I Toxoplasmosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cirrhosis Prostate cancer Obstetrics Breech birth Cerebral palsy Diabetes mellitus Weight training Fetal development Prenatal diagnosis Fetus Spina bifida Nephrology Epilepsy Multiple sclerosis IgA nephropathy Tuberous sclerosis Dieting Malignant melanoma Intact dilation and extraction Paracetamol Cancer Puberty Abortion in the United States Polycystic kidney disease Tocopherol Alcoholism Liver Water Dialysis National Kidney Foundation Singapore Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Senescence Atkins Nutritional Approach Autism Nephrotic syndrome Goodpasture's syndrome Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antiretroviral drug Genetic disorder Psoriasis Stomach cancer Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Medicine Birth weight Diabetes insipidus Prolactinoma Congenital disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sickle-cell disease Person Hypertension Stroke Abortion Brain tumor Testicular cancer Homeostasis Partial-birth abortion Extreme Programming Folic acid Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Diabetic nephropathy Human cloning Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Ovarian cancer Acupuncture Dog Mental retardation Lupus erythematosus Theory of conduct Wegener's granulomatosis Multiple myeloma Joke Ferret Leukemia Acne Heterozygote advantage Urinary system Stuttering Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Coma

i have a multinodule goiter why do i have this and why does it continue to grow i have had biospy done it is benien my tsh was and my t and t were in the high end of the normal range i am a fifth generation woman to have a goiter in my family i am a years old female i am trying to figure out why this runs so heavily in my family and by the way my family has a history of autoimmune disease such as r a and reiter's syndrome i am the first to have reiter's syndrome in my family and so on i am trying to make since of all of this since my goiter continues to grow i am having another ultrasound next tuesday i live in the us so iodine is not the issue there has to be a reason even a hidden one because this goiter issue just runs to hard on the family to be just simple gentics except maybe a certain thyroid or pitutary disease from what you wrote i guess you've already read extensively regarding multinodular goitre mng and other autoimmune diseases all i can tell you is this the more it runs in the family the more likely that this is due to genetics autoimmune diseases have a tendency to occur together ie if you have grave's disease there's a higher likelihood that you'll have other autoimmune problems like reiter's and ra my advice is for you not to search too hard for some other cause of the hereditary mng it may be difficult for you to blame it all on genetics but that's the way it is besides iodine you should ask your doctor about other alternatives many centres in the world will offer a total thyroidectomy for mngs that continue increasing in size as there is a possibility that one of the nodules may turn malignant in the future the downside of surgery is that you'll have to be on thyroid replacement medication for life on the other hand radioactive iodine can sometimes make one more prone to cancer and will also eventually lead to hypothyroidism and need for thyroid replacement  Thyroid cancer Graves-Basedow disease Thyroid Autoimmune diseases Hyperthyroidism Cancer Hypothyroidism Turner syndrome Coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cirrhosis Hearing impairment Congenital hypothyroidism Colorectal cancer Ionizing radiation Chernobyl accident Prostate cancer Endocrinology Anemia Radiation therapy Hepatitis Chronic fatigue syndrome Aortic dissection Ovarian cancer Breast cancer Stomach cancer Endometriosis Reiter's syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Thyroid hormone Multiple sclerosis Cephalic disorder Hypoglycemia Medicine Down syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis Cryptorchidism Edible salt Addison's disease Malignant melanoma Hypertension Chemotherapy Liver Obesity Esophageal cancer Abortion Fibromyalgia Infertility Growth hormone deficiency Human cloning AIDS Myasthenia gravis Nutrition Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome PNG Growth hormone treatment Intersex surgery Bipolar disorder Stroke Traumatic brain injury Potassium iodide Mesothelioma Autism DNA repair Angioedema Arthritis Acne Soft tissue sarcoma Radioactive contamination Bone marrow transplant Amiodarone Pulmonary embolism Von Willebrand disease Prenatal diagnosis Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hypopituitarism Obstetrics Psoriasis CPU cache Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shetland Sheepdog Epilepsy Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Oncology Autism epidemic Sickle-cell disease Osteoporosis Iodine

muscle skin hangs out after bowel movement i've had long term case of constipation recently i feel every time after i have bowel movement there's a piece of skin muscle that droops out of the anus sorry if it sounds gross i'm really worried about it it wasnt very severe before as it automatically goes back in by itself after awhile but lately i feel i have to push it back in when i wipe does anyone have any ideas of what it could be i'd like some opinions before i go see a doctor so i'll have some idea of what im talking about if they were to tell me the usual its nothing major i'm female and never had anal sex in my life hemorrhoids hemorrhoids are enlarged veins that develop in the anal canal although uncomfortable at times this common condition rarely poses a serious problem normally tissue surrounding the inside of the anus sometimes called anal cushions fills with blood to help control bowel movements hemorrhoids develop when excessive pressure or other factors cause the veins within these cushions to swell and stretch nearly everyone has hemorrhoids at some time they can develop at any age but the incidence increases after age about of people older than have had hemorrhoids at some time in their life what causes hemorrhoids excessive pressure on the veins in the pelvic and rectal area causes hemorrhoids as pressure increases blood pools in veins and causes them to swell stretching the surrounding tissue and forming hemorrhoids increased pressure can come from rushing to complete a bowel movement or from constipation or persistent diarrhea if either causes too much straining during bowel movements being overweight also can contribute to developing hemorrhoids pregnant women frequently develop hemorrhoids during the last months of pregnancy because of increased pressure on the blood vessels in the pelvic area straining to push the baby out during labor can also cause hemorrhoids what are the types of hemorrhoids hemorrhoids can develop inside the anal canal internal hemorrhoids or near the anal opening external hemorrhoids both types can occur at the same time the symptoms progression and treatment differ depending on where hemorrhoids develop internal hemorrhoids have four degrees of severity bleeding may occur with any of these first degree the hemorrhoid does not protrude from the anus second degree the hemorrhoid protrudes from the anus during a bowel movement but returns to the anal canal afterward third degree the hemorrhoid protrudes from the anus during a bowel movement but you can push it inside the anus with your finger fourth degree the hemorrhoid is always outside the anus and cannot be pushed into the anal canal what are the symptoms external hemorrhoids external hemorrhoids can cause itching burning and irritation you might notice streaks of bright red blood on toilet paper after straining to have a bowel movement and it may be difficult to clean the anal area internal hemorrhoids rectal bleeding is the most common symptom of internal hemorrhoids you may notice bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after having a normal bowel movement you may see blood on the surface of the stool internal hemorrhoids can range from small swollen veins in the wall of the anal canal to large sagging veins and tissue that bulge out of the anus all the time internal hemorrhoids can be painful if they protrude all the time and are squeezed by the anal muscles or if they are clotted thrombosed you also may see mucus on stool or toilet tissue from hemorrhoids that protrude how are hemorrhoids diagnosed the diagnosis of hemorrhoids is based on a medical history and physical exam which help a health professional identify the type of hemorrhoid external or internal and determine the appropriate treatment if a health professional thinks that hemorrhoids are the obvious cause of rectal bleeding in a person younger than age an examination with a gloved finger digital rectal exam or a short lighted scope anoscopy are the only tests needed for an initial evaluation if you are older than or if anoscopy does not provide a clear diagnosis your health professional may use a flexible sigmoidoscope to look at the lower third of the colon or a colonoscope to examine the entire colon to check for other possible causes of bleeding how are hemorrhoids treated home treatment is recommended for most external hemorrhoids treatment includes sitting in a warm bath sitz bath several times daily gradually increasing fiber and water in your diet and occasional use of stool softeners most internal hemorrhoids can be treated at home with the same measures used for external hemorrhoids generally more severe hemorrhoids can be treated with nonsurgical procedures such as tying off hemorrhoids with rubber bands rubber band ligation scarring the tissue around them coagulation therapy injecting them with chemicals injection sclerotherapy or surgical removal hemorrhoidectomy you can often prevent hemorrhoids or keep them from becoming worse by maintaining a healthy lifestyle eat a fiber rich diet of fruits vegetables and whole grains drink plenty of water and exercise regularly

rainwater run off from an asbestos roof used to water vegetables is the produce safe to eat my elderly father in law has just realised that the rainwater he'd collected to water his runner beans ran from his asbestos roof on his old garage any information is gratefully received safe asbestos is a mineral obtained from the ground it's perfectly safe there the danger arises when fibres from the purified product float in the air and are inhaled one of the measures used to make asbestos safer while it is removed is to spray water over the material and into the air around it wet fibres can't float around so easily and will stick to the wet ground they land on asbestos tiles will deteriorate and fibres will be released when this happens but on a roof the fibres will be washed off regularly by rain if these get into the soil they are harmless except when the ground is so dry that the soil blows around in fine clouds soil used for growing plants won't normally get so dry so he shouldn't be at risk from the fibres that have collected there plants select what they absorb from the soil very carefully the veg won't have any asbestos in them and if you ate any it would be unlikely to do you any harm your gut is also very selective about what it absorbs the common idea that you just soak up whatever you eat like a sponge would is a myth there is a possibility that fibres from the soil would be on the outside of the vegetable and could become airborne and be breathed in this is almost impossible because it would be unusual for any veg to become this dry exceptions might be the earth that is stuck to potatoes when they are stored for a long time and the outer skins of onions beans grow well away from the soil and are covered by a thick pod in order for there to be a significant risk the roof would have to have been severely eroded by the water flowing over it if it is still working reasonably well as a roof there is absolutely nothing to worry about earth normally contains a lot of toxic stuff including poisonous organisms and dangerous minerals washing your hands and the produce is a good safeguard against most of these hazards  Asbestos Mesothelioma Jute Hemp Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Hydroponics Dietary fiber Coffee Wildfire Nuclear fallout Opportunity rover Fire fighting Potato Solar power Water Tofu Drainage Nuclear power Uranium Erosion Common bean Desert Dry cleaning Sewage treatment Flax Rain Soil Escherichia coli O157:H7 Weed control Rice Rebreather National Weather Service Irrigation Coir Carnivorous plant Soil pH Onion Soils retrogression and degradation Sulfuric acid Ammonia Menstrual cup Chernobyl accident Comfrey Energy development Compost Death Valley National Park Environmental concerns with electricity generation Ricin Mount Pinatubo Cannabis cultivation Deforestation Chocolate Air-raid shelter Charcoal Haloalkane Foodborne illness Vermicompost Bong Iron Combine (Half-Life 2) Fancy rat Bean Glossary of firefighting equipment Soap Vegetarian nutrition Acetic acid Fallout shelter Breastfeeding Air conditioning Veganism Drowning Urinary incontinence Pikmin Swimming pool Wood Ionizing radiation Organic farming Laboratory Plastic Hair Cave diving Date Palm Glass Ultraviolet Tank Chemical warfare Beryllium Green Revolution Hiking Firefighter

what do you think is the worst illness i think mental illness or insanity is the worst illness when i accompanied my sister who is a doctor for a medical mission at a provincial center in the philippines my heart went out for the mental patients there imagine how it is for them its like you are there but you're not really there physically you are there but the people around you cant talk to you your surrounding is in chaos but you're acting as if its quite and peaceful there are important and life changing events that unfold around you but for you its a boring day they can be in a party where everyone's singing the same happy song except you you're humming a funeral hymn then everybody's laughing but you're crying everyone around you is watching tv but you're watching movie in your mind its like you're dead but you cant be buried when you're insane you're like a zombie except that you really haven't died i would rather be paraplegic than an insane person i would even rather have a malignant cancer than be crazy at least in cancer you and your loved ones know that you will die soon you'll get buried once you died but if you're insane its like you're just pretending that you're still alive  Mental illness Psychiatric hospital Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Medicine Insanity defense Insanity Psychosis Days of our Lives Death Milton H.

what are bone bleeds my aunt has bone bleeds in her skull never heard of it bone is a living vascular organ containing channels for blood and bone marrow when a bone is cut during surgery bleeding can be a difficult problem to control especially in the highly vascular bones of the spine and sternum bleeding from soft tissue is normally stopped using a cautery that creates heat causing blood vessels to collapse and become sealed since the blood in living bone flows through channels in the bone that do not collapse a cautery is not effective in preventing bone bleeding blocking the holes in the bone typically stops bone bleeding this can be done by mechanically blocking the holes tamponade effect or by inducing a blood clot to form in the past the easiest and most common way to stop bone bleeding was to apply bone wax which is made from beeswax the bone wax is smeared across the bleeding edge of the bone blocking the holes and causing immediate hemostasis because of the complications associated with the use of bone wax newer water soluble hemostatic agents such as those made from alkylene oxide copolymers have been developed hope this helps all the best to you and your aunt  Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Stroke Leukemia Stomach cancer Blood Bone marrow transplant Platelet Bleeding Chemotherapy Knife Coagulation Anemia Terminal ballistics Tourniquet Medicine Intracranial pressure Casting Bone fracture Atherosclerosis Blood vessel Shock Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Paget's disease of bone Aortic dissection Cephalic disorder Blood pressure Bone Childbirth First aid Wound healing phases Circulatory system Cirrhosis Bong Drill bit Crohn's disease Biomechanics Autopsy Hip fracture Paracetamol Subdural hematoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometriosis Human physiology Atheroma Atrial septal defect Hemorrhagic stroke Puberty Acne Apoplexy Intravenous therapy Thermostat Carburetor Turner syndrome Head Tyrannosaurus rex Myelodysplastic syndrome Myocardial infarction Black hole Decompression sickness Penis Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Menstrual cycle Prostate cancer Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Glass Corrosion Lung Diabetes mellitus Pressure point Wisdom teeth Gramophone record Cardiovascular disease Insulin Tuberculosis Orthopedic surgery Nitrous oxide Mesothelioma Equine conformation Bruise Sternum Plastic Thrombocytopenia Acute respiratory distress syndrome Sickle-cell disease Human skeleton Bloodletting Ceramics
