did you study for the act or was studying for the sat enough to do well on the act also putting into consideration that the act is graded diffrently and that there is a scienceportion does everyone typically do better on that will i do okay on the science part if im taking ap bio and chem also would ucs gladly accept only the act also please tell me what you got on both and what you thought of each of them thanks i guess ill just stick with the sat because of satii subject tests i know where you're coming from because i did essentially what you're asking about i prepared heavily for the sat tutors and the whole nine yards and took it once i got a and decided to get out while i was ahead i reluctantly signed up for the act after much persuasion and took it cold i got a composite which is good but in retrospect i could have prepared better for the act on the act i got a on reading and a on math which shows where the preparation for the sat came in handy but i got a on science and a on writing both of which were different from anything on the sat i should have and could have prepared for these sections which would have improved my score in the end they are different tests which require different skills so if you plan on taking both i recommend you prepare for both even if your primary focus is the sat  SAT GED Graduate school College admissions Advanced Placement Program No Child Left Behind Act Graduate Record Examination Education in the People's Republic of China Test (student assessment) Law School Admissions Test Homeschooling The Princeton Review Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the United States A-level Extreme Programming Education in Romania Sex and intelligence Grade (education) Master's degree Psychology Education in Taiwan Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Royal Assent Scientific method Contract College Board Education in Singapore IBM PC compatible Charles Darwin's education Education in England Education Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination High school Welding Education in Hong Kong Education reform Intelligence quotient Publication of Darwin's theory Japanese tea ceremony Baseball Deconstruction Secondary education in France Baccalaur__at John Cage Durham University Act of Parliament Heinkel He 100 Tripartite System Apollo 8 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Computer and video game genres Milton H.

what would be better for me see details the sat or act i am an incoming junior and highschool and it's time for me to decide if i want to take the sat the act or both i'm very strong in reading and writing english especially spelling and grammar etc i'm decent at science but i'm pretty bad at math the only math i'm good at is geometry and even then i'm not that good other than that i have a good knowledge of history and i can usually ace any history test without studying also any reccomendations for prep classes in the houston area first off if you are taking the sat i reasoning than history and science would not matter at all if you are taking the act then you will need science on top of english and math the reason why the act was establish was because the sat is a bit bias towards guys since guys normallly score better on math than girls on the act it is more comprehensive and more about what you have learned while the sat is an predictive test the act would probably be better for you since you are better at the english component the science component of the act has a very big reading comprehension component in terms of the english component i would have to say that the act is more focused on reading comprehension while the sat is more focused on the grammar part nevertheless i suggest you take both the act and the sat because people tend to score higher on one test than the other it never hurts to give yourself extra chances and if cost is a problem you can always apply for fee waviers good luck  SAT Education in the United States Mathematics Education in Romania Graduate school Sex and intelligence GED Education in Taiwan Education in England Test (student assessment) American and British English differences Junior Certificate Intelligence quotient Homeschooling Independent school (UK) Tripartite System Theory of conduct Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Industrial engineering Academia Graduate Record Examination Dyslexia Quizbowl Grade (education) Avenue Q Advanced Placement Program Noam Chomsky Physics Second language acquisition English grammar Secondary education Caulfield Grammar School Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Inflation Education in Australia College admissions Regents (Examinations) Philosophy of mathematics Psychology Poker jargon Cognitive bias Logic Charter school Standardized testing Science The Princeton Review Science fiction Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Lynbrook High School Appeal Extreme Programming No Child Left Behind Act Doomsday argument IBM PC compatible Education reform Productive and unproductive labour Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Aerial (dance move) Hunter College High School Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Numerology Grammar schools in the United Kingdom Grammar Scientific method Linguistics Education in Germany George Lakoff Model (economics) Product Lifecycle Management Central processing unit Causality Teen Girl Squad Martial art Stuyvesant High School Medicine Ra (board game) Esperanto as an international language Chinese character Randomness ELO rating system Education in Singapore University of Waterloo Dictionary Natural deduction String theory Race and intelligence Pittsburgh Steelers CPU cache Great Teacher Onizuka Troy High School Social rule North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Spanish language Hardware random number generator Sociology Where Mathematics Comes From Programme for International Student Assessment

is it going to be a problem that i haven't taken my sat yet i'm going to be a senior this fall and i still haven't taken the sat but i'm signed up to take it october most of the schools i'm applying to also require sat ii subject tests which i won't be able to take until november since i can't take them the same day as the sat reasoning i'm thinking of applying early to my top school which is yale but the deadline is november hopefully i should have my scores for the reasoning test by then i believe i can get them online about weeks after the testing date but i won't have even taken any of the subject tests and two are required for yale is this going to be a problem i know i can somehow send them my subject test scores as soon as i receive them but they won't have them with my application and i know that they decide pretty quickly on early action applicants by december i think it will be too late for you to send your sat ii scores to yale because you're applying for an early decision you'll be taking your sat ii tests in november which is when the application is due the scores come out around two and a half weeks to three weeks after you take the exam never ever rush your scores to a school because it's really a waste of money when you list the colleges that you want to send your scores to they get sent your scores electronically rushing only rushes the paper copy of your scores to the colleges they get the scores electronically and can access them through a secure database provided by college board or the maker of the act course i would recommend applying to the normal pool i believe it's by january i'm applying to yale too but i already have taken the sat i twice and have taken three sat iis i'm taking three more sat iis in october so i can send them to yale and whatnot by november i'm just going to pick my best three out of the six i would have taken by then good luck  SAT GED Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Advanced Placement Program Education in Romania E-mail Test (student assessment) Law School Admissions Test Grade (education) Affirmative action Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus UK Singles Chart Juris Doctor Cleveland Browns American and British English differences Internet fraud National Certificate of Educational Achievement American football Numerus clausus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Lynbrook High School Computer virus Jeopardy!

do the proctors check your calculator before the sat i took the sat times and the act times i think there were maybe of those times total that the proctor actually looked up after reading the calculator instructions and peered around to see if we had appropriate calculators there was only one time that i remember them actually going around and looking at everyone's calculators and even then it was little more than a cursory glance then again they might be likely to take note if you were using a calculator you weren't supposed to have the ones with say printing capacities are noticeable as are the ones with qwerty keyboards other than that any calculator unlike the ones most everyone else had would stand out and really it's best to not risk it and just use an acceptable one and i'm sure there are testing sites where the check more closely that was just my experience it would also depend on the individual proctor different proctors approach the test and the instructions differently if that's what you meant by check there was one girl on here saying that they actually cleared the memory of her calculator before she took the test while i do think they're well within their rights to do that i'd never heard even the suggestion that they would before and the theory is that the questions ask for reasoning so even a better calculator or anything you have on it won't change your score too much if you have something on your calculator you don't want erased just in case you can archive it so that the standard ram cleared won't get rid of it  SAT Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache TI-92 series Typewriter Inflation The nature of God in Western theology Atari 8-bit family GED Contract Scientific method Reliability engineering Supply and demand Transformation problem Sersi Apollo Guidance Computer Philosophical skepticism System/34 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bayesian inference Second language acquisition Explosive material System/36 Education in the United States Theory of conduct Big Bang TI-89 series Intelligent design Normal distribution Extreme Programming Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Supreme Court of the United States Logo programming language Mutual fund Postmodernism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Appeal Compiler optimization ELO rating system Coercion Collision detection Race and intelligence Entropy Milton H.

how many times can you take the sat i what i've always heard is that you can only take the sat i three times then this uc riverside professor told me you can take the sat i infinite times and then my friend told me you can take infinite times but colleges take the average after the third time could you guys please give me a definite answer it is possible for you to take it as many times as you want or rather as many times as you have time to take it and as many times as it is offered while you're in high school and sometimes before then i took it once a year in high school so times so it's a fact that you can take it more than times but that misconception comes from the idea that you shouldn't take it more than times but how colleges look at it does depend on the college i don't think any place really takes an average but they can see all of your scores on the score report you send them and it's sometimes frowned upon for students to take it more than about three times on the theory that the sat is in part as test of how well you know the sat so if you take it many many times you will eventually get so used to the test that your score will be higher than your actual aptitude that is the theory although they in general also hold that your score will stay in the same range over time if nothing changes i e if you don't study more but the best study you can get for the sat is the sat itself in any case some colleges will superscore your sat scores by taking the highest score from each section rather than just your highest total score in one sitting and they are less likely to do this or they will think less favorably of you while doing this if you've taken it many many times in theory it is more circumstantial than that though for example taking it once a year is different than taking it times in one year i really don't think from what i've heard that it's that bad to take it more than times especially if you continue to increase your scores and if you eventually get the score you want that at least is what i understand of the matter what i've been told and what i've heard so you definitely can take it many times but you don't want to take it too many times good luck  SAT Test (student assessment) Juris Doctor Grade (education) GED Theory of conduct Batting average National Certificate of Educational Achievement Graduate school Law school Intelligence quotient American and British English differences Sex and intelligence Advanced Placement Program Victorian Certificate of Education Causality Plame affair Academia Epistemology Quizbowl Doomsday argument Appeal Lebesgue integration Logic Education in Hong Kong The Princeton Review PSAT/NMSQT Law School Admissions Test Infinity The nature of God in Western theology Music The Amber Spyglass College admissions Series (mathematics) Avenue Q Ra (board game) Philosophy of language Economics Affirmative action Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Education in Germany Scientific method Dynamical system Social rule Gravity Sydney Riot of 1879 Martial art Friedrich Schleiermacher ELO rating system Supply and demand College Craps Normal distribution Race and intelligence Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) IQ and the Wealth of Nations Factor analysis Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Taiwan Distribution (mathematics) Community college Graduate Record Examination Marshall McLuhan Mathematics Randomness Lawyer Scientology beliefs and practices The Shining (film) Medical school John Cage University of California, Riverside Education in Romania English grammar Stuyvesant High School Fibonacci number Student loan Hearsay Species Gliding Democracy Bernard Williams Special relativity God Go ranks and ratings Islamic philosophy Standardized testing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transactional analysis Court system of Canada Black hole U.S. Electoral College Philosophy of science Trigonometric function Autism rights movement Education in Australia Hearts (game) Meme

what time does the lsat start in the morning and what time does it end i want to practice the test under realistic time constraints environment they tell you to be there at but the actual testing doesn't start for about a half hour after that because they make you fill out all these forms and statements so to re create the start you have to get up at about get ready just like you would on test day then read the paper or something until literally it is kind of a hurry up and wait situation once you are at the test site once the test starts at you take sections in a row with the shortest of breaks between them they tell you to stop and then turn the page and start again after the first sections take a minute break and then do the final sections in the real test they then collect the exams and then you take the writing sample but i never did that when practicing overall the test took a good hours to get through if you are taking it at home and start at am it will be shorter because the lsat preptests have only sections and taking them all in a row takes only hours and minutes the best way to get around that is to grab another preptest and use one of the sections on that exam for the experimental take the extra section somewhere in the first three sections since the lsat puts the experimental in the first three sections you can then use the sections in the extra test as the experimental for different practice tests you take that is the closest way to get a realistic experience if you want to make the environment realistic try taking it at a library instead of at home  Law School Admissions Test GED SAT Medical College Admission Test Test (student assessment) The Price Is Right Education in Romania Tour de France Indianapolis 500 Extreme Programming Law school Bell test experiments Apollo 15 Driver's license Morse Code Scientific method 24 Hours of Le Mans Drawing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) 1957 World Series Software testing Prostate cancer Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Graduate school Ben Johnson (athlete) STS-62 Mahjong Apollo 8 CPU cache Shaggy dog story Medical prescription Sudoku English cricket team Randomness Aerial (dance move) The Amazing Race 2000 Australian Grand Prix Reliability engineering Daylight saving time Milton H.

national merit scholarship i'm going to be a sophomore in the fall and in october i will take the psat i know that it's out of but what are the chances of qualifying for the scholarship what is the minimum score you would need to get on the test to be qualified does your gpa factor into the result are my results going to be matched up to my school or my district or my county my school is kind of different everybody takes the psat in sophomore year i don't even know if we take it again in junior year by then everybody is too busy studying for the sat anyway so i really think this year's results really count how can i find out my state cutoff i live in california so maybe it's lower also sophomore results from the psat don't count toward the national merit qualifying test first you can only qualify for national merit your junior year the psat was actually made for juniors but a lot of school districts have started having the sophomores take it for extra practice without actually explaining to them that its function as the nmsqt only applies to juniors my school did this second the psat only qualifies you as a semifinalist after that you have to fill out a packet of paperwork to qualify for finalist standing the information you give includes gpa high school transcript one recommendation and a student written essay you also have to submit scores from the real sat but of semifinalists become finalists those who don t are usually i think only those who fill out the paperwork wrong or perhaps if you absolutely bombed the sat or a few other things from finalist standing it becomes a bit iffy only about of the about finalist become national merit scholars to go from finalist standing to being a scholar they do look at gpa what you took in high school your recommendations your essay and so on but i think one of the most important parts is your sat score nmsc s website http www nationalmerit org nmsp php that site will tell you your chances of the million entrants some with the highest psat nmsqt selection index scores critical reading mathematics writing skills scores qualify for recognition in the national merit scholarship program then in early september about students or approximately one third of the high scorers are notified that they have qualified as semifinalists third the cutoffs for semifinalist change from year to year and are different in each state because it s the highest x i don t remember in each state you can see some of the recent years cutoffs in different states here http talk collegeconfidential com showthread php t and here http talk collegeconfidential com showpost php p postcount those used to be posted and were copied and pasted from here http hseagle sas edu sg hscounseling tests nationalmeritselectionindices htm but they no longer post them there because of copyright issues you might find other years cutoffs on talk collegeconfidential com since they try to compile them each year but those were the ones i found first and they ll give you an idea of what you need to aim for semifinalist designation from psat score cutoffs are determined on a state to state basis i m pretty sure after that it s a national thing so all the finalists are in the same pool i can t remember and i can t tell it s a pain in the rear to find any definitive useful information on nmscs website and i have tried good luck if you have any more questions about national merit i d be happy to try to answer them i spent my whole senior year a bit confused about all of it lol  GED Scholarship Grade (education) College admissions Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Affirmative action Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Quizbowl Theory of conduct Economics PHP Education in Germany Montgomery Blair High School CPU cache New Trier High School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy United States Academic Decathlon Intelligence quotient New York Knicks Norway national football team Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Standardized testing United States of America Mathematical Olympiad Test (student assessment) Normal distribution Jeopardy!

biology sat ii i am studying for the biology sat ii subject test i took honors biology as a freshman and i am planning to take the subject test in october as a sophomore i have the barron's book and will have about months of prepping time is it okay to take the test by studying the book alone haven taken biology last year and i probably forgot stuff what other prep books are recommended is two months enough prep time to get a high score if you've already taken the class two months is more than enough my only concern for you is that the material may no longer be fresh when you take the exam in october but if you use a test prep book you'll probably be fine it'll keep the important stuff fresh enough check out http www amazon com s ref nb ss gw initialsearch url search alias daps field keywords sat ii biology for user reviews on different bio books for the sat one of my favorite test prep companies is princeton review but there's a ton of other books out there that may be more suited towards your needs in my experience with sat subject tests a few weeks' worth of review suffices starting too far ahead of time doesn't help because by the time october comes around you'll have forgotten stuff you studied in august i've never studied for an sat subject test more than two weeks in advance  Advanced Placement Program Education in the United States Web crawler Lynbrook High School Biology Stuyvesant High School Medical College Admission Test Test (student assessment) Gmail Education in Germany The Princeton Review Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Mozilla Firefox Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Romania Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Prostate cancer Education in the People's Republic of China On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Stevens Institute of Technology University of Central Florida Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Luther Head The Citadel (Military College) Princeton University World Wide Web Physics St. John's College, U.

can i mix and match my best sat scores lets say i score on section a on section b on section c on the first sat it doesn't matter which categories just an example let's say i am upset with my section c score of so i choose to retake the sat now what if i get a on section a on section b and on section c my second time great my c score is up but my b score is down can i mix and match from the two tests to give me the highest scores possible also can i avoid this by taking only section c when i go to retake the sat well to answer your first question yes and no the colleges to which you apply will probably use only the highest scores from each section however you don't have the right to report your total sat score as a sum of the highest section scores from multiple test dates on your resume or on your college application to answer your second question no you have to take the whole test each time  SAT Test (student assessment) GED Jeopardy!

would you rather take ap classes or 'normal' classes where your grades will be higher ap so i can transfer the credits to college and not have to take the classes in college it's cheaper to take an ap class than a college class also if you are thinking of going to college it would look better on your transcript if you challenged yourself and got an as a grade as opposed to a in a non ap normal level class  Education in the United States Grade (education) High school Graduate school Education in Singapore Education in Taiwan Community college College ELO rating system Appeal GED Education in Australia Education in Malaysia Western Kentucky University Affirmative action Education in the People's Republic of China Citigroup Beatmania IIDX National Certificate of Educational Achievement Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Omega-3 fatty acid Kwantlen University College Education Brown University Scottish Qualifications Authority Secondary education Advanced Placement Program Ontario Academic Credit Franklin W.

i q tests how legitimate are they are they flawed are they subjective are the online ones legitimate is the entire concept of measuring intelligence flawed exactly how unbiased is the iq test does it depend on different stages of one's life after you've graduated college it might measure after the very same person joins a cult they might test lower so what exactly is being measured iq tests have one major flaw above all caclutated it is mental age chronological age this in inherently flawed your test is going to be somewhat standard mattering on the exact test you take where the flaw comes in is the chronological age technically speaking if you take an iq test twice once when you are and again while you are and you test the same on it lets say for a mental age score when you take the test your iq is which isn't possible but bear with me when you take the test your iq is so basically what that is saying is you are technically getting dumber as you age if you saw not too long ago there was an infant inducted into mensa a society for high iq people to that i said no shit if you think about it if the kid is and he gets an iq of and gets inducted if you reverse the fomula x x thus he scored enough points to score as a old old okay he must be smart but if you think about it these are standardized tests questions with multiple choice answers i could take random guesses and i would be able to get a score of a year old but my iq would be in that case thus the system is inherently flawed to benefit youth if you are tested at and you have an iq of lets say that means you have a mental age of does this mean when you hit your mental age will match your chronogical age so your iq will drop to then or is your iq constant thus you would have a mental age of is that a good thing i mean at dementia can start to set in there i would think the brain of a year old would not be as good as the brain of a year old all in all you can't take a test to figure out how smart you are which is what an iq test is i am a very intelligent person i have taken the mensa test and was denied membership personally i am the suckiest test taker you will ever see i have tutored people to as in classes that i got cs in it is just how i am having an actaul test in front of me isn't going to measure anything other than how well i take a test also my experience on the mensa tests you need some inherent knowledge of how things work and how things are if you do not have them then you are handicapped there was one picture question where it showed a marlin a goldfish a dolphin and a trout and the question was which doesn't belong right there you are at a disadvantage if you have never seen what a marlin goldfish dolphin or trout looks like also there are more than one answer to this question the correct one is a dolphin it is a mammal and breathes air while the others are fish i chose the goldfish because none of the others can be a realistic domesitacted pet was my answer wrong no in fact it was correct and if i could explain my logic i would have gotten full credit for it one a side note i was in meteorology class taking a test and a quesiton came up that was phrased do you know the difference between cloud x and cloud y i was the only one in the class to get full credit on it because i asnwered no logically i was right and the teacher saw that but what if i lived in some tibetten monistery and my life was all in there if i would look at those pictures i might never have seen any of them before nor would i know that a dolphin is a mammal it doesn't mean i am any less intelligent it just means i am lacking a piece of knowledge that should not effect the score of a test that is supposed to measure my intelligence and logic sticking oddly shaped pegs into equally oddly shaped holes is a better measurement of intelligence and logic than showing me pictures of fish overall it is a very flawed system that does not benefit anyone at all other than being able to stick their nose into a conversation and say i am a genius newsflash i am a genius too i just don't test well and because you want to look at the score of a standardized test you will never know  SAT Intelligence quotient Normal distribution Scientific method Philosophy of language GED Extreme Programming Password Intelligent design Expert system Capitalism Logic Predestination

where do i get good practice for lsat i was thinking about getting the help books at princeton review and kaplan but i wanted to know if there are better ways to practice i plan on taking the test in september of next year and plan on spending this year planning for it any additional advice would be helpful thanks i actually think taking a prep course is the most efficient way to prepare the main benefits of a class are that a they lay out the strategies for you so you don't have to figure them out on your own you also have a source to go to when you have questions or need help b they provide plenty of study material and that material is directed in a particular way c they structure your preparation in a way that self studying cannot d you meet other people in the same position you are in and it helps to have friends who can motivate you to study the best known classes are probably kaplan princeton review and powerscore do the classes help like a lot of things part of it hinges on whether you put the time in i took powerscore and i ended up scoring well i do know that i worked pretty hard though i also feel that i would have spent a lot more time trying to self study because the course organized things in a way that made sense had i been studying on my own it would have taken longer to arrive at some of the insights i needed to do well if you decide to study on your own which you should definitely do over the next year and before possibly taking the course next year then these were the best books i used and all three use real questions powerscore logic games bible powerscore logical reasoning bible kaplan lsat you will need to practice what you are learning so get actual tests from law services the people who make the test the next actual official lsat preptests more actual official lsat preptests actual official lsat preptests lsat prep tests individually numbered if you work through the first three books you would be in pretty good shape in terms of strategies and then do a ton of the tests from the second group of books after that the following books give explanations for test questions lsat superprep get prepped lsat explained powerscore games setup guide the decision to take a course after self studying probably will rest on how well you are scoring if you are doing well then skip the course if not then maybe a course can get you over that final hurdle i'd play it by ear and see how the self study goes first good luck  Law School Admissions Test SAT The Princeton Review Kaplan Logic Game theory Causality Theory of conduct Strategic management Science Extreme Programming A Course In Miracles GED Medical College Admission Test Legal research Religious Society of Friends Economics Biblical inerrancy Summa Theologiae Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in the United States Dog agility Second language acquisition Philosophy of language Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The nature of God in Western theology Avenue Q Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theodicy Infinity Expert system Scientific method Social rule Cognitive science ELO rating system Intelligent design Pseudoscience Capitalism Creationism Altruism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Education in Romania Social psychology Law of value Theology Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Many-worlds interpretation Information Services Procurement Library Unidentified flying object Consensus decision-making Intelligent design movement Law school Strap-on dildo Current teachings of Prem Rawat Phillip E.

can anyone tell me how to calculate gre score how many points for each question the gre is usually given as a computer adapted test so there really aren't points given for each question the computer chooses the questions that you will get based on how you preformed on earlier questions so if you get a question right the computer will give you a harder question if you get a question wrong the computer will give you an easier question this way the computer can determine where your ability really is this is more accurate than the paper format that gives you questions of all difficulties because the computer adapted tests tries to focus in on the boarder line of what you can and cannot do for information about the grading of the essays check out ets's website they'll give you their grading criteria  Graduate Record Examination The Princeton Review SAT TOEFL GED Quizbowl Advanced Placement Program Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Intelligence quotient ELO rating system Expert system IB Diploma Programme On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences GURPS Geographic information system National Certificate of Educational Achievement Standardized testing Martial art Education in Romania Grade (education) Race and intelligence Collision detection Education in the United States Turing test Multiple choice Chess problem Prostate cancer Autism DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Quantitative marketing research Education in Sweden DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution CPU cache Scientific method Normal distribution Artificial consciousness College Board Theory of conduct Graduate school PSAT/NMSQT Voting system Digital circuit Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Pi Computer numbering formats Computer security No Child Left Behind Act Computational complexity theory Doomsday argument Model (economics) Drawing Probation officer Dance Dance Revolution Enterprise content management MP3 Graphology Science Bowl Asperger syndrome Screenplay Classified information Redundant array of independent disks Numerical integration Law School Admissions Test Philosophy of science Password Translation DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Computer graphics Cryptanalysis Mathematics G__del's incompleteness theorem Mental retardation International Mathematical Olympiad SAS System Science Numerus clausus Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 College admissions Stereoscopy Debugging Bayesian inference Aliasing Photography Interpretation of quantum mechanics DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Jeopardy!

sat act comparison i got a on the sat's in reading in math and in writing for the multiple choice for the essay and a on the act's according to the charts on wikipedia a on the act's is better than a on the sat's but i've heard many schools still do not consider or at least weigh less the writing section of the sat's and again according to wikipedia my combined math and reading score of is better than my on the act's i'm planning on taking the sat's again in the fall but if i do not raise my writing grade should i send my sat's or act's to colleges i d say send both colleges will like to see that you ve done well on both tests which you have true your writing score is significantly below your other scores but it is true that colleges aren t yet looking at the writing scores as seriously some schools more likely the state schools don t even ask for the writing scores at all and did you take the optional writing portion of the act any school that will seriously look at the writing section on the sat will require you to take that as well so you might look into it and see if the places you re applying look at the writing portion at all it should say somewhere in their applicant material but generally both of your scores are good so you can send them both a high score on either one will secure that portion of the admission requirements of anywhere you re applying but generally good scores on both tests might put you above someone else who only sent scores for one or the other and your lower writing score except perhaps at the most prestigious schools shouldn t negatively affect your chances what will look even better is if you manage to raise your writing score even by just a little when you take it again when you send scores they can see all of your sat scores and places generally like to see that you ve improved keep in mind that the multiple choice is of your writing score http www collegeboard com student testing sat scores understanding howscored html and that s way easier to study for than the essay but totally send both you ve got good scores on both tests good luck  SAT GED College admissions Graduate Record Examination Test (student assessment) Education in the United States Advanced Placement Program Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Affirmative action Law School Admissions Test Graduate school Education in Romania The Princeton Review Central processing unit Juris Doctor A-level High school Numerus clausus Education in Taiwan Single Transferable Vote Homeschooling Standardized testing Appeal IB Diploma Programme Uniform Resource Locator United States Academic Decathlon No Child Left Behind Act Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Prostate cancer Stuyvesant High School Intelligence quotient Quizbowl Trinity College, Dublin Junior Certificate Redundant array of independent disks Exponentiation Extreme Programming HTML Act of Parliament World Wide Web Hunter College High School Charter school HyperText Transfer Protocol Sex and intelligence Medical school Baccalaur__at American and British English differences Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Normal distribution Education in Australia College Board Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Education in England ELO rating system HTTP cookie Education in Germany Z-test Theory of conduct Education in Malaysia TOEFL Ra (board game) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Hong Kong UCAS Theodicy Mozilla Application Suite Lawyer Medical College Admission Test Model (economics) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Lynbrook High School Welding Debugging Reliability engineering Cross site scripting Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Doomsday argument Public education Gmail Gramophone record Education in Portugal Quicksort Plame affair Sheepshead Education in Finland Beatmania IIDX Magnet school CPU cache XML Item response theory Compiler optimization MP3 Fair use Martial art Explosive material Transmission Control Protocol Ice core

what is the average amount of studying on a regular school week for a student with ap classes and honors i plan to take spanish language ap calculus ab ap chemistry ap united states history ap english honors physics honors you'd be surprised what you can get away with i m going to ramble here for a bit but i m feeling nostalgic about high school being over i think i m going to miss my ap classes it s nearly impossible to give an average amount a lot of it depends on you how much do you usually have to study do you always do your math homework or do you feel like you understand it without doing the work a lot of the rest of it depends on your teachers some give more homework than others and some just teach better than others but that is quite a lot you ve got going there especially in the math department ap chemistry is by far one of the hardest ap classes and tests it s the only one i took that i felt like i had a ton to do and i can t imagine taking it with physics and calculus going at the same time anyway chemistry is just constant new information things to memorize vocabulary formulas ideas chemists chemicals ions reactions on and on and on it ll be the class you have the most and the hardest homework from don t get me wrong i loved every minute of it and i m actually good at it but it was hard it s impossible to give a nightly or weekly amount of work there will be weeks that you have very little homework and weeks that you re spending every moment from the time you get home from school until class the next day working frantically contacting friends for help figuring and refiguring problems yelling at your calculator and generally trying to figure something out but oh the joy of finally getting it ap calculus is actually not bad i did bc not ab but same difference and it s one that you get a pretty set schedule for you ll find out in the first few weeks whether you ll have a half hour of homework or a full hour a night or whatever and you ll have about the same amount every day all year i doubt it ll be any more than that it s basically math as you ve had it in the past you get a new concept a lecture and are given problems from the book you ll occasionally want to study for a test once you get closer to the ap test in may you may have more work each night with review material but for most of the year it s not bad apush is a lot of reading but cough only if you want to do it it depends on how your teacher does it if you have a few pages you need to read a night go ahead and do it you shouldn t have any more than a half hour to an hour a night really how my ap history teachers have always done it though is to give you a chapter and expect you to have it read by a given date everyone puts it off until the weekend before and reads the whole chapter or more precisely most everyone puts it off until the night before then skims the chapter copies someone else s notes and calls it a day lol you can make it a nightly thing though and i suggest you never read apush material for more than an hour at a time it s too easy to zone out and waste your time skimming the words without taking in what you re looking at but reading and listening to lectures and taking notes over both is about all you ll have to do for apush do not ever let yourself get too behind in the reading this is the type of reading that very quickly adds up to an impossible task if you let it there are huge chunks of us history i totally don t know because i let it pile up put it off and never got around to reading it lol physics in my experience ap physics c is mostly class work rather than homework it s a matter of taking the math you ve learned in other classes and reapplying to physics it s not much different than a math class really new concept problems bookwork a lot of busywork and again it ll depend on your teacher but i never did much studying outside of class for physics i have no idea about ap spanish a lot of my friends were in it and they seemed to stress a lot about the tests but not worry about it much except when they had a test i did take both years of latin and years of french though so i can say that language classes are mostly as you ll already know having gotten to ap vocabulary new words refining grammar concepts not a lot of real homework for the class but a lot of studying if you want to memorize the vocabulary well and to really get the language honors english is more of the same english as usual you ll have vocabulary to study but the only time you should have real homework is when you re reading a book for class or having to write an essay when you do have a book or an essay it can be a lot of work but there s no real studying as such involved unless you actually study the vocabulary a lot but back to my original statement you d be surprised what you can get away with i took ap tests my senior year but my day went something like this homework for ap calc was done after i got to school and before class started or not at all the teacher figured it was our business whether we did it or not so i rarely did french homework was done during the last few minutes of calculus ap government homework and reading done during french ap physics homework done during government ap literature during physics get the idea it s all about the short term memory and you can trade homework studying hours at night for units of stress during the day it works nicely well up until it doesn t it can be very taxing actively putting things off can be stressful in itself and well i suppose if you wanted to you could spend every waking hour studying and perhaps have less stress but i did very little homework actually at home ap chem my junior year was an exception granted most of my work during other classes studied the bare minimum and had a very high gpa passed all my ap exams never had too much of a mental breakdown and am starting college in the fall with credit hours to my name it can be done really average amount of studying as little as you can get away with or as much as you need with all of that going at once you probably will have at least an hour of homework and or studying a night spilled over from what you can get done during the day but it s not as much as you would think if you really want to or find that you need to study more you can up it to an hour or two a night good luck sorry for the ramble and i do hope some of that information was useful  Education in the People's Republic of China GED Grade (education) Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story Philosophy of language Social

what is a good iq score i got a on an online test but i dont know if thats good oh and if you could tell me a more reliable iq test that would be great esp you nikki k it's my opinion that iq tests are very inaccurate tellings of intelligence in fact what it really measures if anything is how advanced your mind is relative to the average the way one computes an iq score is this mental age actual age x the test is based on a standardized scale for levels of brain development that makes the average score for example a year old's mental age is so is and x additional note iq isn't supposed to change with age it doesn't matter if you score a when you're or when you're it means the same that's the point iq tests measure age ratios trust me that's how it works i think if one surpasses they are considered geniuses but like i said i think that iq tests are inaccurate because it's standardized not personalized personally i scored a on some online iq test but i highly doubt that's true  Intelligence quotient ELO rating system Psychometrics SAT Item response theory Theory of conduct Race and intelligence Normal distribution Intelligence (trait) Grade (education) Mental retardation Philosophical skepticism Batting average General intelligence factor Marilyn vos Savant Person IQ and the Wealth of Nations Bayesian inference Transsexuality Classical test theory Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Debugging Cheating in Counter-Strike Reliability (statistics) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Supply and demand Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Lie Autism MP3 Artificial consciousness Blood alcohol content Contract Psychology Special relativity Sex and intelligence String theory Dualism (philosophy of mind) Gross domestic product Graduate Record Examination Yao Ming Parallax Turing test Factor analysis Capitalism Brain Goodness and value theory Donald Davidson (philosopher) Cognitive science Beatmania IIDX Standardized testing Big Bang Standard deviation Extreme Programming Expert system Rasch model Inflation Plame affair Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Gravity Computer role-playing game Scientific skepticism Philosophy of mathematics Belief revision Neuro-linguistic programming Causality Advanced Placement Program Affirmative action Mind Creationist cosmologies Social psychology Intelligent design Quantitative marketing research Scale (social sciences) Scientific method Mass Regression toward the mean Theory of multiple intelligences Left-handed Sydney Riot of 1879 Victorian Certificate of Education The Mismeasure of Man Classified information Real number Password Unemployment Test (student assessment) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Working memory Cognition GED Quicksort Labor theory of value Scientology beliefs and practices Parapsychology Ontological argument Zener card Reliability engineering Internet troll Brian Lara

studying for the act what if u don't complete a section ok i'm only studying for the act i didn't complete the science reasoning part so are the questions that i didn't get to wrong what exactly happens with them i'm confused and so stressed right now the act is not like the sat in that it does not deduct points for incorrect answers for this reason you are encouraged to answer every question even if you must guess that said the questions you didn't answer are considered wrong it's like any other test you would take at school the science part has questions your raw score is the number of questions you got right so it's not counting any of the ones you did not do or the ones that are wrong the raw score will be scaled which accounts for different test versions and then they round all of the parts together english math etc i'd say that if you did well on the other parts of the test you have a chance at a good composite score if you finished less than half the section it will probably detract from the composite score  SAT Quizbowl Advanced Placement Program GED Science Bowl The Princeton Review Test (student assessment) Graduate Record Examination $ale of the Century SmartAsk Marilyn vos Savant Scientific method Split Second Family Feud The Joker's Wild Chain Reaction (game show) Normal distribution Standardized testing Education in the United States Mathematics Match Game Education in Romania Twenty One (game show) Fallacy Ken Jennings Fifteen to One Password (game) Theory of conduct Reach for the Top Intelligence quotient Extreme Programming Jeopardy!

would an ap passing score over ride that same subject previously taken at a local college example i got a b when i took u s history at our local college but it is mandatory for me to take u s history in high school right now so i choose to take the ap u s history course to keep up my ranking when i pass the ap u s history test will the ap score over ride the previous b i had for that course when i took it in college thanks personally i think you should go talk to your guidance counselor about the fact that you have taken us history in community college you might not have to take ap us history or any us history course which would really be a waste of time and i think when you go to a year college you will just end up receiving transfer credit for a b in both of the college courses you took in the us history survey luckily transfer credit is not used in calculating your college gpa  Grade (education) Education in the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement College admissions Education in Germany Advanced Placement Program Law school SAT Affirmative action Community college Education in Sweden Graduate school University of Michigan College Board GED High school Hunter College High School Medical school Education in Romania Torquay United F.C.

is ap calculus worth it let's say that i wanted to major in something math and science related and i take ap calculus my senior year would it be worth it because i've heard from some people that even if you pass the ap test you won't get credited as much because the basic calculus is required in college for all math related majors it depends on the college but generally you will be given some credit for taking ap calculus and getting a or a on the test i'm majoring in math and i got hours of credit the first two semesters of calculus for my score of on the ap calc bc exam i don't have to retake any of the courses so i am jumping right into multivariate calculus as a freshman this fall sometimes people decide to relinquish the credit they receive through the ap calc exams and retake the course so that they can get a better knowledge of the subject maybe that's what you heard people talking about also even if you did have to retake your calculus in your college ap calculus would give you an edge over all your other peers you'll be prepared enough to earn the highest grades your college calculus course would be a gpa booster if you took ap calc seriously in high school if you are worried about having to do a ton of work ap calculus ab is the way to go there is still a lot of work but it's not nearly as hard as bc is  Advanced Placement Program Grade (education) Education in Romania Education in the United States Graduate school Jaime Escalante A-level Calculus Stuyvesant High School GED SAT Education in Germany Test (student assessment) Physician Hunter College High School Education in Taiwan Mathematics Clements High School High school National Certificate of Educational Achievement College admissions Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Law School Admissions Test Junior Certificate Franklin W.

rate my min essay in an act rubric please and tips to how to improve it prompt in your opinion should high schools ban students' commuting to reduce traffic and tardiness problems well i know that i got lots of work to do on this essay i wrote hr essay but not min one's so here are some of the issue im concerned taken a position long enough how to create step by step body paragraph in shorten way here's the essay in united states there are different regulations and laws depending on each state for instance in the state of california teenagers are allowed to drive once they are sixteen years old and have acquired driving education from the stand point i believe that every high school should allow student s to drive because of their intelligence to make the right decision i would further argue that driving education has kept high school students out of traffic problems first students have the right to drive once they have reached certain age usually traffic problems are caused by someone who is careless to know the rules and regulation about driving i believe students should first have the opportunity to drive to school instead of preventing students to drive in the first place we should ban the students after they have proven to cause traffic problems next we should note that someone who drives the car aberrantly doesn t denote the fact that they are less likely to cause accidents for example external disturbance can trigger problems to drivers some of the examples are cell phones eating and losing concentration because of their drowsiness thirdly each student must have driving education and pass certain test to acquire a permit in addition in the state of california provisional permit enables the students to be aware of traffic problems because if he or she happens to cause an accident their license will be taken away in fact i believe students have a better driving education than adults because after the age of eighteen he or should would not be required to take certain driving education that students take therefore students should have their privilege to drive to their high school in and out instead of not having an opportunity to drive in conclusion i think that appearance and age shouldn t be taken as the most important issue but their knowledge and maturity to drive a vehicle furthermore high school students are not far away to become an adult maybe this is a very basic essay first and most important you have no introduction or thesis statement your introductory paragraph sounds like it was a body paragraph cut and pasted first your three points are good and valid but try and use less boring transitions these are very bad transitions first next thirdly for example for the transition for example there is nothing wrong with it but you use it too much try different transitions such as furthermore becasue of this etc tie your conclusion back to your introduction and in your intro make sure to mention all three points of course this is the worst possible format for writing an essay but this is a test after all good luck ps if you had captured my attention and put in a thesis statement this would have been a solid

how many hours a day should you revise for it to be effective dnt wana over revise and end up learning nothin cos ive overdone it hour wise do it like a job so no more than effective hours a day and plenty of time to recuperate effective means deep learning you should know and understand your topic thoroughly on an intellectual level and try to plot out the connections between different topics understand the exam itself and how you need to answer questions and have practiced them then actual revision of key topics should be intense and focussed additional revision notes should be vivid and evocative use pictures colour and few words for memorisation for example i lucked out and had a paper by gerrard so i had my picture of the god of football then i had to know what the basics were got that understood and found a picture to go with it picture and then a picture of the subject and very short text phrase in red to go with gerrard cut and pasted it and there was the connection made and cemented of those and i had all the sources for one paper and the connections ready there is really no excuse for people saying they are revising when they are simply re reading classnotes or books you already understand the time taken to actually revise was then just a matter of writing practice questions and reviewing the picture sheets then get plenty of sleep between periods of checking yourself i only got a even so but then i'm pretty thick  GED Singlish Philosophy A Course In Miracles Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Legal research Theology Dyslexia Second language acquisition Test (student assessment) Cognitive science Jacob Neusner Philosophy of language The Hobbit Creation according to Genesis Expository preaching Ubykh language Consciousness History of the English Bible Hangul Theory of conduct Western philosophy Mathematics Human Photography Academia Scientology beliefs and practices Infant baptism Socrates The Origin of Species Literacy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Lincoln-Douglas Debate Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Psychosis Originalism Enterprise content management IB Diploma Programme Milton H.

act test how can i do better in the reading and science sections of the act what type of shortcuts are there for being able to be faster at gathering the inforamtion they give you in the charts graphs and passages and answering the questions should i read the questions first thanks for answering i probably should mention that i got a the first time i took it i haven't taken it since then though but i am planning to take it in september i am aiming for a total score i had trouble with the reading and science sections as well mostly it is because they are towards the end that you encounter your problems a simple solution would be to start off doing a lot of reading and then analyzing pick up a copy of bill bryson's a brief history of nearly everything his excerpts will be very similar to the passages you might read on the reading and even on the science too after reading anything take time to analyze what it means and the main point of the passage of course you will not have time to do that on the actual act exam but preparing in this manner will definitely heighten your analysis skills and improve your understanding of passages when you get to them on the actual exam read the questions first for the reading part so that you know what information you need and what you can neglect then skim through the passage and take what you need from the passage just remember that there will be certain questions that will ask you to make inferences about the passage in its entirety or just a certain point that the author was trying to make make sure you pay special attention to that when you are reading as far as the science goes don't let the time and the questions intimidate you just use the charts as a reference don't spend more than seconds looking at the charts taking time to actually memorize the information on the chart will get you nowhere and it is highly time consuming as long as you get the general idea of what the charts graphs are talking about you are set to answer the questions you can always refer back to the chart when the question asks for the science passages i'm afraid there is no easy shortcut but to actually sit there and try to comprehend what the passage is talking about if you get the brief idea then you should be set just remember that the majority of the questions will ask you to refer back to the passage rather than make predictions and infer for this section take an educated guess when it comes to inferences that are especially hard to make just don't let the terminology scare you that's their tactic just read through the science questions quickly if you run into a passage and then skim through the passage to get the main idea refer back to the passage occasionally to help answer questions but conserve time hope that helped and good luck  The Princeton Review Expert system CPU cache Test (student assessment) Quizbowl Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Social rule SAT Speed reading Economics Logic Education in Romania Dyslexia Mathematics American and British English differences Supply and demand English grammar Reading (activity) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Compiler optimization Philosophy of language Plame affair Natural deduction The nature of God in Western theology Wheel of Fortune Scientific method I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Modem Graph theory Password She Loves You Keynesian economics Causality New York Giants Royal Assent Science Fast bowling Law School Admissions Test Web crawler Time travel $ale of the Century Cognitive science The Apprentice 2 Ra (board game) Tennessee State Constitution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Requirements analysis Science Bowl Scientology beliefs and practices NP-complete Tropical cyclone Many-worlds interpretation Volleyball Geographic information system Sudoku Intelligence (trait) Quantum computer G__del's incompleteness theorem Stomach cancer Autism CPU design Random walk Education in Portugal Randomness Same-sex marriage in Canada Standardized testing Singlish Second language acquisition Lebesgue integration Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bogdanov Affair Case study Unix time Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education reform Meaning of life Bayesian inference RISC Item response theory Legal research Doomsday argument TOEFL Software engineering Cheating in Counter-Strike Function (mathematics) Welfare economics Chess problem Game theory Microeconomics

how long are praxis i scores valid for i was thinking of taking the test soon for future grad schools but was also thinking of taking a year or two off to live and work overseas before i apply to grad schools would the scores still be valid in a year or two or is there an expiration date should i just take them now or when i get back thanks that's a good question different states have different guidelines for the praxis test the best advice i can give you is to check with the ed department at the university or college that you are looking to attend and ask them they should be able to steer you in the right direction hope this helps  Graduate school GED Advanced Placement Program Extreme Programming Education in Romania Driver's license SAT Standardized testing Education in the People's Republic of China Jak II Quizbowl Notary public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal College admissions Article Five of the United States Constitution Affirmative action Pretty Good Privacy Test (student assessment) Walt Disney World College Program Graphology New York State Department of Education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in the United States British National (Overseas) - Hong Kong Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Logic Karl Rove Teacher Traditional Chinese medicine Article One of the United States Constitution Quantitative marketing research Doomsday argument Public education Charmed Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Parapsychology Jaime Escalante Visa (document) German car number plates President of Ireland Model (economics) History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Student loan Year 2000 problem Grade (education) Education in Germany Model (abstract) Condom American football Dynamic Systems Development Method Ice hockey RFID Sydney Riot of 1879 History of Test cricket (to 1883) USA PATRIOT Act Rice University Charter school Law School Admissions Test Florida State University Scientific method Plame affair Coming of Age (TNG episode) Debugging United States Constitution Three Laws of Robotics Neuro-linguistic programming Psychometrics Juris Doctor Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Jeopardy!

how do you increase memory effectiveness as a learning and test taking strategy how can you increase your memory effectiveness in preparation for college some people have good memory as an inner ability others have normal memory however you can train your mind to remember better i have long found that human memory works best when you have many connections between memories of things what i mean is that if you can connect one particular memory of something with memories of many other things the overal ability to remember it will increase tremendously there will be so many paths leading to the same peice of memory that's why when you learn something you should try to learn it from more than angle the more angles you look at one problem the better chance you will understand deeper and will remember the problem better and recall it quicker and it's best done with having some practical application of what you have just learn to reinforce the memory on test taking strategy it's a different thing it's an art in itself you need to develop the ability to do preliminary investigation of a question problem within a few seconds if the question is outside your comfort zone which means you can solve it very rapidly you will have to defer it and move on only come back to it at the end when you have free time this ability to read capture the essentials and analyse it within a few seconds is not easy to acquire you need the mental sharpness of a swordman facing the enemy to do it well you will have to train your mind by doing many practice tests under limited time constraint assign a difficulty level score between to each question when you first read and skip it come back later if the difficulty is over  Second language acquisition Cognitive science GED Explosive material Scientific method Education in the People's Republic of China Dyslexia Expert system Education Psychology Autism Animal cognition Lucid dreaming Test (student assessment) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Milton H.

how can improve on my math section of my sats is there any way i can improve on my own as i look for a tutor anything will be helpful thanks please don't just tell me practice i obviously am if i asked this question as i teach my own child mathematics i start to understand a lot more about teaching being good at maths when i was young has little to do with my ability to teach my own child i find out that the ability for a child to understand mathematics well is the ability to think relate and handle abstract ideas and if the child is gifted with this ability it will be very easy to teach otherwise it's a very difficult thing therefore you would need to assess yourself or ask some one who knows to help you to assess your inner mathematical ability then some ideas can be drawn about how you should learn mathematics you can also look at all your school reports and past tests to see how you score in different sections of mathematics you will find that you won't be good on all of them you should do this with help from a teacher or experienced adult it depends on your endowment of mathematical ability to choose how you study if you not gifted then the only way is fall back to mastering the basics well it's quite surprising that mastering the basics well can eventually lead you to wake up the hidden abilities in your mind if you feel that you are not good at maths you can embark on a journey back to the past you pick up your maths text for year and rapidly relearn the concepts from year all the way to your current year while you do this you might like to pretend that you are a teacher just put a doll in front of you and pretend that you teach a child and find different ways to teach same idea to the child the broadening of approaches to the understanding of the same problem will help your nerves to connect many hidden abilities together it's like having abroad foundation will allow you to build a very tall building i also heard that now you can get a tutor via the internet from india and pay quite little that's one option to explore too but the first step is to self assess your mathematical ability good luck  Mathematics SAT GED Education in Romania Education in the United States Extreme Programming Second language acquisition No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Homeschooling Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Swami Vivekananda Education in Germany Alexander Technique Western philosophy Scientific method Charter school Infantilism Theory of multiple intelligences Dyslexia Autism Craps Literacy Standardized testing Incarnations of Immortality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in Hong Kong About a Boy Cognitive science Reiki Psychoanalysis Richard Feynman Graduate school Gifted Jiddu Krishnamurti Theory of conduct Science A Course In Miracles Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economics Socrates Arthur Cayley George Lakoff Randomness W.

how would you feel if how would you feel if you failed the dmv signs test two times in a row to add to it both times you miss passing by one question i'm going to be a senior in high school and this is me don't get me wrong i'm not stupid my gpa is like but i have no clue why i'm not passing i studied for the test school starts next week and i have to have my mom drive me to school how pathetic anyway can anyone give me advice on this see if your dmv has practice questions for the test on the website practicing will help you also consult your driver's manual if you took a driver's ed class and still have notes consult any handouts you had on signs if it makes you feel any better of people fail the knowledge test on their first try even though i have never earned lower than a b in school i still barely passed the knowledge exam on my first shot even though i studied i can relate to your concerns about not being able to drive but for another reason mom thinking that driving with any kid is dangerous wouldn't let me actually start driving until i had had some driver's ed and i couldn't work that into my schedule until the summer after my senior year which is this year she thought i was too irresponsible to learn how to drive when i was since all people are too irresponsible to drive when they are in her opinion i actually had time to learn how to drive then so basically mom had to cart me around to all my activities during my senior year which is lame and i had to ride the bus to school which is embarrassing when you are a senior since nobody rides the bus when they are seniors now i'm going off to college in a couple of weeks and i still don't have a license i'm probably the only one other than the physically disabled so i can relate to your feelings of being pathetic for not being licensed at this point but you will eventually be licensed and you probably will have your licence before you go off to college if that's what you do or soon thereafter after all this embarassment i finally have the ability to be licensed all i have to do is turn in a log of hours of driving and i get my license i passed the road skills test and all just keep studying and i am sure you will pass i cannot say that not being licensed at this point isn't going to irk the heck out of you though  Driver's license GED Grade (education) Education in the United States Education in Romania Shaggy dog story Philosophical skepticism Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school SAT Driving Drunk driving (United States) Quizbowl Indianapolis 500 Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Physician Vehicular cycling Test (student assessment) Affirmative action Scuderia Ferrari Theory of conduct School bus God Emperor of Dune Education in Germany Speed limit Extreme Programming Paul Is Dead Hendrick Motorsports Windows 2000 Jeopardy!

is an iq score of good for a year old girl i took an online test and was wondering if that was good the score is good but the test itself is suspect iq tests are adjusted so that the average score for a person in that group is that means that half score over half score under means you scored well above most of the people in your group but the online test is not very accurate it can give you an indication of what your score is but it may vary by points either way for a really good accurate iq score you need to take a test given by a trained tester in a controlled situation that would most likely be given by a psychologist or counselor  Intelligence quotient ELO rating system Grade (education) SAT Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Normal distribution Blood alcohol content Factor analysis Education in Romania Sex and intelligence Graphology IQ and the Wealth of Nations Polygraph Race and intelligence Zener card Sports betting Yao Ming Terminal ballistics Education in the United States Gifted Autism Prostate cancer Standardized testing Reliability engineering Australian cricket team Quizbowl Psychometrics Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Dog agility W.

standardized exams i say that standardized exams are given for reasons to make money because each test taker has to pay a lot of money for a test s that he or she may not pass before or tries to control the amount of applicants for a job if there are too many people applying for a job only a chosen few can be hired this is very true especially in big cities like ny or chicago to discriminate against people who do not have a solid educational background in other words not everyone can get a private school education your view um no first sometimes private school education is often worse than public school education that's particularly true of the parochial schools they aren't made to discriminate the tests are supposed to measure your skills or knowledge in certain areas i don't think it is good to judge a college applicants based off of their sat or act scores alone but the tests can give good guidelines obviously if a student only makes a on one section on the test and the school normally accepts most students that are in the low six hundreds or above in that section the student who got the probably wouldn't be prepared to do the work at that college also test are the only way to compare students fairly how can you compare two students' grades when you can't take into account factors like one kid had a harder teacher if you have no way of knowing that information you cannot so you need the tests to level the playing field and the same goes with work tests for instance would you want to send your taxes to be worked on by an accountant who didn't pass the cpa exam no because you wouldn't be able to trust that the person working on your taxes actually knows what he she is doing if he she didn't pass the cpa exam and i'll agree the tests are expensive but we need them  Education in the United States SAT College admissions Graduate school Affirmative action GED Education in the People's Republic of China Test (student assessment) Grade (education) Education in Romania Education in Portugal Theory of conduct Education in Germany Juris Doctor No Child Left Behind Act Microeconomics Numerus clausus Gross domestic product Law school School choice Tripartite System Public education A-level Homeschooling Standardized testing Philosophical skepticism Item response theory Economic inequality Inflation Education in Taiwan American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Education Certified Public Accountant ELO rating system Coalition Provisional Authority Plame affair Charter school Education in Hong Kong National Certificate of Educational Achievement Notary public Education in Australia Taxation in the United States Intelligence quotient Supply and demand Boston Public IB Diploma Programme Life insurance Professor Medical College Admission Test Establishment Clause of the First Amendment James Randi Independent school (UK) Unemployment Secondary education in France Accountancy Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) The Princeton Review Student loan Fair use Tax Education in Singapore Medical school Higher education in Japan Lawyer Credit card Computer Education in Austria Equal Protection Clause Psychometrics Prostate cancer Software engineering Paralegal Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination 401(k) Flat tax Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Insurance Private school High school Race and intelligence Poker jargon Social Security (United States) Physician Doomsday argument Public good Education in Finland Stuyvesant High School Education in Sweden Martin J.

i failed my ap exam but got a good grade in the course how does that work out i took ap spanish junior year and i just got my ap exam results back i got a my teacher gave me a for both semesters how will this affect my application to colleges i also took ap chemistry as a junior and got a on the exam and an in the class also is there a way to hide my ap spanish score but not my ap chemistry score colleges don't usually consider ap scores when you apply to college if you want to send an ap report to any of the colleges i first suggest you cancel your ap spanish score if for some reason they don't let you do that at this point since you have seen your scores you can pay a fee for the score to be withheld on any college board report you send to an university it's per report to hide one score whether you withhold or cancel the spanish grade you can send an ap report to all the colleges you wish it is per report of course with the withholding fee if that ends up applying to you you'll have to spend an extra per report to hide the spanish score sadly i think the colleges will care more about your grades in the ap classes rather than your scores when it comes to admissions purposes so your spanish results will probably look better than your chemistry results if the colleges you are applying to don't consider ap scores in the admissions process  Education in the United States Grade (education) SAT Graduate school Education in Taiwan College admissions Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Advanced Placement Program Juris Doctor Education in Portugal A-level Education in Singapore High school Education in Australia Education in Hong Kong Physician IB Diploma Programme Numerus clausus Trinity College, Dublin National Certificate of Educational Achievement Queen's University Test (student assessment) Education in Malaysia Affirmative action Stuyvesant High School Hunter College High School GED College Independent school (UK) Law school Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Victorian Certificate of Education Junior Certificate Appeal Law School Admissions Test UCAS Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Medical College Admission Test Brown University Leaving Certificate Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Prostate cancer Lynbrook High School Matura University of Bristol Secondary education in France __cole Polytechnique Secondary education in the United States DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Middle Tennessee State University Professor DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Princeton University Medical school Regents of the University of California v.

sending ap scores hi i was wondering if i should send my ap score report to all the colleges i am applying to i will be a senior this coming school year and i did fairly well passed all of them ap scores are generally used more for placement and credit than for admission they'll look more at what classes you've taken and the grades you've gotten in them that's the general theory anyway the fact that you've taken ap classes shows your commitment to your education regardless of what you get on the tests they'll look at your test grades when you go to enroll to see what classes you place in for college i personally did go ahead and send my scores to the schools i applied to it does reflect well on you if you've scored high on them from what i ve heard some colleges will look at ap scores in the admissions process and others won t it would mainly matter if you get a high grade in the class but failed the ap test because that would reflect badly on you likewise if you got a lower grade in the class but a high grade on the exam it might mitigate the negative of a lower gpa to a certain extent since you did well it can t hurt anything so i d say go ahead and send them http www collegeboard com student testing ap exgrd html there is a fee to send them though so if you re going to take more tests your senior year you might want to just wait and have the scores sent for free when you fill out the paperwork for ap tests next spring or just send them to your top choices  Grade (education) College admissions Education in the United States SAT Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement Law school Affirmative action GED Education in Romania Hunter College High School High school Education in Hong Kong Education in Taiwan A-level Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Germany Education in Malaysia Standardized testing Numerus clausus New Trier High School Lynbrook High School Secondary education in the United States IB Diploma Programme Jeopardy!

how do i prepare for sat how do i get myself started any advice is great vocab tips verbal tips talk to yourself it may sound crazy but it helps you to remember things another way is to write improtant things down as you see them over and over until u know it do not use note cards after u get used to their format u get to a point when u think u know it but it is only because u are associating it with another notecard which can screw you up during the test writing tips i also find it helpful to be able to explain the lesson to someone else because that means u know enough to be the teacher especially for the enlgish grammar section write a practice essay or two every week have a friend or adult read it to get general feedback math tips learn the basics algerba geometry arithmetic etc and always double check answers if you have time skip hard ones and come back and plug in answer and use educated guesses if you ahve no other choices overall tips work fast check your answer don't stress out get a good nights sleep the night before do practice tests in the morning when you are alert eat well buy the collegebaord sat prep book blue book and the princeton review practice tests most importantly take a break every hour or so good luck  The Princeton Review SAT Extreme Programming A Course In Miracles Dyslexia Avenue Q Mnemonic Graduate Record Examination Mathematics English grammar Ron and Fez Test (student assessment) Legal research Game show Social rule Education in Romania Education in the United States The Amazing Race Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Education Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alexander Technique Have I Got News For You Stomach cancer Numerology Spanish verbs Medical College Admission Test Electrophysiology Richard Feynman Python programming language Scientology beliefs and practices Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Great Teacher Onizuka Friends Noam Chomsky Computer numbering formats Craps Augustus De Morgan Crossword Snooker Password Ocean's Twelve Education in Hong Kong Pitaten Second language acquisition Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide The Adventures of Pete & Pete Good Morning, Vietnam Scientific method $ale of the Century Mad Money The Amber Spyglass Homeschooling Aesthetic Realism Charles Darwin's education Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Little Britain Aerial (dance move) Modem Basque language Beltway sniper attacks Diving Contract Violin Theory of conduct Academia Slow Train Coming Prostate cancer Insomnia Floppy disk STS-59 Big Brother (USA TV series) Literacy Match Game Deconstruction Kodocha Knife Phoebe Buffay's songs Weezer African American Vernacular English Ojibwe language Piccolo Junior Saga Control flow Scrabble (game show) Double bass Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Germany PLATO FoxTrot JavaScript Boston Public Neuro-linguistic programming Philosophy of mathematics

is this unethical of princeton review i'm currently taking the princeton review sat course they give you a refund if you don't increase your score by pts however for the first diagnostic sat test that they gave me they took the lowest number of my sat score range on the second test they took the highest number i did worse on critical reading the second time but my scaled score increased from to there isn't much difference in difficulty between the first and second tests what do you guys think about this yea i kinda figured that too on first test verbal wrong and they changed my answer for the math grid in and writing wrong essay rd time wrong in reading wrong in grammar grammar and essay i think they do that to keep un enlightened students in the dark and use it as leverage to say that you are improving and encourage the student also the pt guarantee is for the real sat the problem is that they say they will work with you untill u reach your pt increase but who has the time and effort to do something that didnt work for them the first time those few details i just mentioned are unethical in my opinion but then again they are a business and need to make money  SAT GED Test (student assessment) Medical College Admission Test Graduate Record Examination Graduate school Education in the United States Jeopardy!

as a junior i'm in ap calculus what math course could i take next year i took ap calc ab as a junior and then did ap calc bc as a senior that's the path i would suggest you to take if your school doesn't offer any higher level math courses my school offered a differential equations class and a linear algebra class one of these or a multivariable multivariate vector calculus class would be the next class to take preferably you'd do the diffeqs or the multivariable vector calc option if you don't have any options to take a higher level math class in high school and only one level ap calc ab or ap calc bc is offered at your high school see if there is anything else you can take at a local university as a community college may not offer everything you need but if you take ap calc ab you should be able to get the next course the calculus course there whether you can take the college level math classes might depend on your ap exam score though if you never intend to take any more college level math after you finish ap calculus during the junior year and if you pass your ap exam you could do ap statistics during the senior year and not be harmed by it  Advanced Placement Program Education in Taiwan Education in the United States Calculus Grade (education) High school Mathematics Education in Romania SAT Jaime Escalante Polynomial Junior Certificate Stuyvesant High School Physician Secondary education in the United States Graduate school Clements High School Community college Ordinary differential equation Education in Australia Hunter College High School Tangent space Derivative (generalizations) Tensor field Linear algebra Education in the People's Republic of China Stochastic process Tensor GED Multivariate normal distribution William Rowan Hamilton Hopkins School General relativity Differential geometry and topology Education in Singapore Juris Doctor Function (mathematics) A-level General Certificate of Secondary Education Education in Hong Kong Derivative Education in Germany Determinant Lynbrook High School Victoria University of Manchester Troy High School College Distribution (mathematics) Princeton University Kernel (algebra) Student National Certificate of Educational Achievement Test (student assessment) Finite element method Differential form Professor Operator Mathematics education Dynamical system Microeconomics Clifford algebra Albany High School, Georgia Quizbowl Smith College TI-89 series Differential geometry of curves Vector (spatial) Education in Portugal Education in Austria Cooper Union University of Houston Law school Matrix (mathematics) Product rule Vector field Philosophy, Politics and Economics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Associate's degree Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in France Numerical analysis Del Self-adjoint operator Regents (Examinations) Exterior algebra Turkish education system Covariance and contravariance Integral Oliver Heaviside Education in the Republic of Ireland Electromagnetic radiation Algebra XSL attack NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Student loan North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics

where exactly thesis statement should be located prefer you taken act test okay here's the problem throughout what i learn from high school and while i was studying for the act writing test i knew that thesis statement should be at the last sentence of introduction however sparknote guide for the act said first sentence of introduction with general supporting details behind it does it even matter to the writing standards for act test usually it is the last sentence however with the act writing test as well as the sat writing test if you ever take that you won't want to spend your time writing a fluffy introduction they don't tell you much anyhow so keep it short i only gave my introduction two sentences a thesis statement as the first one and a little bit to elaborate on the thesis in the second sentence when i did the sat writing test you'll want to spend more time writing about the examples in the body paragraphs  GED Graduate school TeX Essay Bogdanov Affair Logic Ludwig Wittgenstein Plame affair English grammar Epistemology G__del's incompleteness theorem Ethics Donald Davidson (philosopher) SAT Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Juris Doctor IBM PC compatible Causality American and British English differences Visual Basic Law School Admissions Test First Amendment to the United States Constitution Written Cantonese Taiwanese (linguistics) Philosophy of language C plus plus Markup language Guy Davenport Turing test Perl Python programming language Democracy Germaine Greer Socrates Education in the United States Greek language Guide for the Perplexed Appeal Whose Line Is It Anyway?

tutorfox sat guide has anyone had success with it it seems like the people who claim that it helped are the ones affiliated with the site thank you for noticing that i personally haven't heard anyone say good things about it but the people person affiliated with the site if you do a google search for tutorfox it brings up a scant thousand results almost all of which are from yahoo answers or similar sites where one or two people all the same guy in my opinion with different accounts have been flogging the book there was just the one guy on yahoo answers who was copying and pasting the exact same thing basically an advertisement for the book into every question about the sat when someone called him on it by asking a question similar to yours two or three other accounts on here popped up to defend it but you can see that they were just created after the questions were posted now that his first account has i think been deleted since using yahoo answers for advertising purposes is against the community guidelines he's got a new female version of himself giving the same copy and pasted answer you ve probably seen it when i first took the sat my score was low in the mid s but then i got the sat guide from tutorfox http www tutorfox com satguide html and my score went up to math writing reading i highly recommend this guide for anyone wishing to get a higher sat score when it was the old version of him it was the exact same thing only with if i recall a overall score or somewhere thereabouts it seems all of the answers he gave were deleted with his name though because i can t find them anymore even where i know he posted them he has gotten cleverer with it though and he ll actually give you a question specific answer on one account but it s easy to see that the very first answer he gave i dare say the reason that account was created was this question http malaysia answers yahoo com question index ylt apm zm elzyyuygawcjnxls qax qid aapm nj show profile info uvis unaa i m talking about benrosenstien but richard gomez is the same and it s easy to get best answer when you ve got multiple accounts to vote for yourself and almost all of his are chosen by voters not by the asker it s all about name recognition i suppose maybe it s a good book maybe it has some good tips in it but it s still very annoying to me the way he flogs it and i still recommend that people get something with credibility  Theory of conduct Gmail HTTP cookie SAT Neopets Slashdot subculture HyperText Transfer Protocol GED Website Internet troll Search engine optimization Plame affair Google E-mail spam Cross site scripting Legal research H2G2 Plurality electoral system World Wide Web CPU cache Web traffic Open Directory Project The nature of God in Western theology English grammar Nicomachean Ethics Game show Google bomb The Apprentice 2 Karl Rove Google search Wikipedia Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act John Titor Expert system Ajax (programming) Representational State Transfer Slashdot trolling phenomena A Course In Miracles Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Match Game BitTorrent Scientology beliefs and practices Normal distribution Kasparov versus The World Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Spyware Bayesian inference Whose Line Is It Anyway?

do you have to be a genius to get a perfect sat score not at all i imagine you just have to be really good at taking tests for example i got on the critical reading and on the writing not quite perfect because i've been reading avidly since th grade and took years of latin in high school latin does wonders for your grammar and vocabulary both doesn't mean i'm a genius when it comes to english just that i know a lot about english and grammar i clearly don't know as much about math though since i only got a on it but oh if i had studied more well and studying does help i'm convinced that i could have gotten a much higher math score if i'd actually taken the time to study for it but i imagine that studying can only make a so so score into a good score though it might make a great score into a perfect score a lot of it is about just being naturally good at tests but genius isn't a requirement you just have to be really good at what the sat is about  SAT Advanced Placement Program Education in the United States Graduate Record Examination Esperanto as an international language English grammar Interlingua Education in Romania Junior Certificate Grade (education) Great Teacher Onizuka Ontological argument Intelligence quotient Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination GED Education in Finland Latin Test (student assessment) Finnish language Hiberno-English Education in Taiwan Sex and intelligence Mathematics National Certificate of Educational Achievement German language Theory of conduct Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy College admissions Jumpstart 3rd Grade Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dutch language Vietnamese language Sanskrit Greek language TOEFL Vocabulary Stuyvesant High School Bulgarian language History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Indian English Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) Theodicy A-level Hungarian language Ra (board game) Education in Singapore Baccalaur__at Bristol Grammar School Esperanto grammar Hopkins School DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Law school Affirmative action Hunter College High School United States of America Mathematical Olympiad High school Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Romanian language Education Extreme Programming Law School Admissions Test Victorian Certificate of Education American Sign Language Juris Doctor Charter school Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX The Tale of Genji Theory of multiple intelligences American and British English differences Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Lynbrook High School Pump It Up Education in England Quizbowl Charles Darwin's education Homeschooling Spanish verbs Second language acquisition DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Spanish language No Child Left Behind Act Logan, Utah United States Academic Decathlon Constructed language Philosophical skepticism Adjective Troy High School Perl Auslan Grammar General Certificate of Secondary Education Pitaten Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test Computer numbering formats Theodore Kaczynski Secondary education in the United States DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Doomsday argument

i just don't understand the sat writing section every practice test i take i just keep getting low scores in the high low range i'm worried about this because i really want to make it into a good uc but don't think i can i studied the pointer's that barron's and the princeton review printed out but they weren't much help am i doing something wrong or am i supposed to do it differently how are you scoring your practice tests it s sometimes hard to get an accurate score on a practice for the writing section because you can t always give a score to your own essay very easily or accurately have you taken the actual sat that s really the only way to see how you ll do i suggest that you just keep taking practice tests and take the sat in october if you don t like your score you can take it again in november even if you re a senior that s not too late remember that the essay is worth of your raw score and the multiple choice is worth college board has information online that may help you http www collegeboard com student testing sat prep one writing approaches html and information about solving each type of multiple choice question as well as practice questions http www collegeboard com student testing sat prep one sent errors pracstart html in addition to practice tests and questions try to review grammar concepts either in a review book or online there s a lot of good information in identifying sentence errors and improving sentences pay particular attention to subject verb agreement they like to test that a lot because it s something that s going by the wayside in spoken english grammar on improving sentences the correct answer is never in the passive voice and will almost never have a preposition at the end read the sentences in your head with your chosen answer make sure it sounds right the less complicated the answer the better the wrong answers usually weirdly complicate the sentences that sort of thing but you don't just need pointers you need to actually improve your understanding of grammar if you can read a few fiction books with more complex grammatical structure throughout the scarlet letter crime and punishment something like that to improve your grammar skills and get you used to how more complicated grammar sounds and even if you don t do as well as you d like on the writing section that doesn t put you out of the running for ucs even at uc berkeley for example the middle range of students admitted scored on the writing portion a score in the low s would put you in that range and if your scores on the other sections were sufficiently high a lower writing score would not completely kill your chances especially if you ve got a good gpa and some good extracurricular activities on your r sum use college board s college search to find information for other colleges too http apps collegeboard com search collegedetail jsp collegeid profileid to see what you re up against and what scores you need to aim for good luck  GED Extreme Programming The Princeton Review Education in the United States Second language acquisition Bulgarian language Theory of conduct Singlish ELO rating system Chinese language Password Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Greek language Standardized testing Scientific method Arabic grammar Intelligence quotient German grammar Test (student assessment) Linked list Economics Slashdot subculture German language Noam Chomsky A Course In Miracles American and British English differences Cognitive science Grade (education) TOEFL Finnish grammar Chinese character Wheel of Fortune African American Vernacular English Hiberno-English Debugging Non-native pronunciations of English Slovak language Affirmative action Dutch language Translation CPU cache Normal distribution National Certificate of Educational Achievement Vietnamese language Bernard Williams John Lott Swedish language Deconstruction Preposition Sapir-Whorf hypothesis World Wide Web Perl Poker jargon Bayesian inference Plame affair Esperanto as an international language Kasparov versus The World Logo programming language Advanced Placement Program Philosophical Investigations Physics Hong Kong English Welsh language Neuro-linguistic programming Spanish grammar Arabic alphabet Polish language Prostate cancer Appeal Spanish language Gender-neutral language Literacy Expert system Education in Romania Hebrew language Marshall McLuhan C programming language Sesotho language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Many-worlds interpretation The nature of God in Western theology Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in the People's Republic of China

do sat classes really help i'm planning on taking the princeton review and i was wondering if its worth it and on average how much do classes raise your sat scores thnx well it kind of depends on a few things whether the courses are helpful first if you are really advanced and would have scores that are fairly high like in the s or higher without any preparation then it is not likely that the course would help you unless you have an individual tutor or someone who is going to cater to the needs of the more advanced students then the class will be aimed at the students who are not quite as good they'll be learning techniques that you already know but if you think you would only earn a low score or a mediocre score or maybe even a slightly better than average score the course could work for you second you will actually need to study and practice doing the techniques that you learn in class between different class sessions and after you finish the class if you want to do well on the sat  The Princeton Review GED Grade (education) SAT Education in the United States Graduate school Juris Doctor Dog agility Education in the People's Republic of China Affirmative action Education in Hong Kong Kaplan Stevens Institute of Technology IB Diploma Programme Community college College admissions Advanced Placement Program Japanese tea ceremony Master's degree Education in Germany Massachusetts Institute of Technology Volleyball Intelligence quotient Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Australia Education in Romania Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Stuyvesant High School Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) College Martial art Nurse Test (student assessment) Alexander Technique Belmont Abbey College Tai Chi Chuan Professor Tripartite System Lawyer Law school Contract bridge Factor analysis Judo Secondary education in France Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fast bowling Race and intelligence Blended learning Prostate cancer National Certificate of Educational Achievement Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Boy Scouts of America Appeal Education in Taiwan Model minority Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Education in Singapore High school Lynbrook High School Strategic management Menstrual cup Gliding Charles Darwin's education Marshall McLuhan Aikido Education in Portugal Steve Nash Extreme Programming Physical therapy Student loan Victorian Certificate of Education Efficiency wages Secondary education in the United States Tax Secondary education in Japan Ra (board game) Economic inequality London Metropolitan University Johns Hopkins University Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Doomsday argument Music Homeschooling Psychotherapy Junior Certificate Batting average Quake III Arena No Child Left Behind Act Unemployment Parachuting Australian Qualifications Framework Danish Folkeskole Education Anti-intellectualism Batting (cricket) Microeconomics Gwinnett University Center Scottish Qualifications Authority College and university rankings

what's the difference and which is more difficult what's the difference between the act test and the sat test and which is more difficult thanks well to find out which one you should take you should do a practice test for the sat and the act for the one you score higher on you should prepare for and take that test you can compare your scores on the practice tests by looking up the act on wikipedia they have a score conversion between the sat and the act but to tell you the differences act has a science reasoning section act math is a little more advanced since it tests all the way through trigonometry but don't worry it will only have a couple of really advanced questions act writing section is optional but you should do it anyway act questions aren't built to trick you so the test is more straightforward than the sat is there is no guessing penalty on the act but mind you if you did guess everything you'd still only end up in the st percentile according to odds  SAT Intelligence quotient GED Education in the United States CPU cache Sex and intelligence Graduate Record Examination The Princeton Review Scientific method Turing test Normal distribution Quizbowl Homeschooling Standardized testing Philosophical skepticism Advanced Placement Program College admissions Theory of conduct Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Password Medical College Admission Test Law School Admissions Test Freedom of speech Speed limit Augustus De Morgan Minesweeper (computer game) Social rule Grade (education) Hat-trick C programming language Bombe Mathematics Regents (Examinations) Species Psychometrics Charter school Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) College Board Perl Game show American football Doomsday argument Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Science Bowl Affirmative action Item response theory Graduate school Education in Taiwan Juris Doctor Overclocking Lynbrook High School Appeal TOEFL Jaime Escalante Marilyn vos Savant Test plan Volleyball Race and intelligence Gifted Pseudoscience No Child Left Behind Act Psychology Stuyvesant High School Have I Got News For You Theodore Kaczynski American and British English differences Halting problem Factor analysis Geometry Quantum harmonic oscillator Computer numbering formats Martial art Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Contract Sarbanes-Oxley Act Big five personality traits Expert system Homeopathy 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Science Meditation The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex United States Academic Decathlon Mediation Equal Protection Clause Hearts (game) Crash test dummy TGV ELO rating system Experiment Physics 401(k) Sudoku Tripartite System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Software testing Cognitive science

for sure i'm screw but now what did you think there any chance for me getting to uc school i had gpa and i think i'm done for it what should i do to build up again because i'm going to be a senior and i don't know what to do with my life i know i could i always go to cc and transfer but my parent doesn't like that idea and i felt lower than everyone else is there any chance i can still be something big for my future any alternate for going to uc with maybe a very high sat score if by uc u mean university of california and not connecticut colorado some other random state that begins with a c ur not as screwed as u might think ok sure ur gpa sucks lets be honest here but thats like what a c b average or something lemme just say our valedictorian with a gpa of didn't get into uc berkeley while other ppl with much lower gpas did and lemme tell u why later sure ur gpa is a factor that ucs look at to admit students but there are so many other factors that can outweigh ur low gpa and potentially get u into a uc oh yeah before i continue if youre stressing over u not getting into a uc b c of ur parents then f that u cant always make em happy u gotta do what u can and if u feel like youre disappointing them dont they'll still love u and youre right u can always transfer from community colleges its not as bad as everyone says it is who cares if its frowned upon f them too okay anyway when its time to apply later this fall don't slack off and finish ur application personal statements like days or heaven forbid the day before the deadline like the many idiots i knew who did ur personal statements are absolutely crucial i mean crucial i think u guys have to only write two this year but im not sure go check which depending on how u look at it is either lucky or quite unlucky sure u get to write less but u lose a prompt to respond to which could let u make urself look better heh but anywho the prompts are up already and u should be starting yea so i just checked u do only have to write two essays uc admit ppl are getting lazy be thoughtful and reflective and let all ur teachers and ur parents other adults if they know english read ur personal statements for advice revision and again dont wait till the last minute because theyll just skim it and give u crappy advice make them read it over and over again until its perfect another factor community service and extra curricular activities dont exaggerate ur community service hours and if u have none ur high school sucks for not having a requirement but anyway start now ur summer's about to end list all of ur extra curricular activities as well cause they'll ask u to list em and write like a lil sentence or two about what the club activity is what positions u hold if ur in a sports team college prep class asb etc those are good too if youre not in any clubs sign up for them once school starts just dont rely too heavily on ur gpa sat scores i mean dont f them off completely but dont be so discouraged for sure im screwed not for sure stay positive honestly i think the personal statements were the most critical thing for me i just graduated this year u still have time oh yeah another thing the acts are sooo much easier than the sats do both of them and report both of ur scores if u have to bc ur not satisfied with ur score take the december sats and report ur score later u can do that after u submit ur application once the deadline arrives if u check the lil box thing that tells them youre taking the december one oh yeah u also need two sat ii subject tests for ucs heres what i had that got me into berkeley gpa sat total act composite sat ii math ii i dunno why i even bothered to take this lol us history again these factors were very modest and quite low to be admitted into cal but i think my personal statements put me over the top and no if u think im a rich white kid whose parents paid their way for me to get into berkeley then u are wrong i am neither white nor rich okay theres my advice for u dont be discouraged also do some research on what u want to do with ur life b c again different ucs are good depending on what u want to with ur life also csus arent as bad as well have u looked into those as an alternative apply to ucs and csus for backup and dont do what ur parents want do what you want ps financial aid scholarships search and apply for them if u need it or not just apply dont be lazy  Education in the United States College admissions Graduate school GED Grade (education) Poker jargon Law school Education in the People's Republic of China

what's the difference between ap and ib i'm attending an ib based school and some of my friends switch to different schools just so they can take ap courses which one of those two is better and what is ib it seems like ap is more well known than ib actually ap and ib are equally well respected in terms of getting admission to college here's my advice if you want to go to college in some country other than the united states take ib courses the ib diploma is respected internationally if you want to go to college in the united states do the ap program take as many courses as you like from what i hear i think you can get more college credit through ap of course that is not an official statement but i have done enough research by looking at ap credit tables and ib credit tables for colleges in my states it seems like you can rack up a lot more credit through ap courses if you take a good number of them like or more depending on the courses you take i suggest you mix hard ones with easy ones you won't be completly overwhelmed if you are taking like per year also ap courses are easier i can tell that from all the hard work my friends in ib had to go through but they are not any less respected at many institutions you will not be able to get credit for ib standard level courses rather you have to take higher level courses to get the credit and you will have to take at least and probably of your courses standard level so that may mean that you can only earn college credit for of your ib courses at many us colleges and universities this is just my very biased opinion but again i think ap is a lot better  Juris Doctor Education in the United States Education in Australia High school Education in Portugal IB Diploma Programme Advanced Placement Program Community college Physician Graduate school Education in Germany Student loan Institute of technology Grade (education) Education in Hong Kong Education in Singapore College Master's degree College admissions Dog agility Ontario Academic Credit Education in Malaysia Medical school Distance education Open University Affirmative action Secondary education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Australian Qualifications Framework UCAS Law school Johns Hopkins University Education in Sweden Secondary education Education in the Republic of Ireland Bologna process University of Cambridge London Metropolitan University Scottish Qualifications Authority Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in France Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology National Certificate of Educational Achievement SAT Middle Tennessee State University Associate's degree University of Bristol University of Toronto Appeal A-level Trinity College, Dublin Education in Canada College and university rankings Education in Austria City and Guilds of London Institute Academic degree Capitalism Bachelor of Arts Barrister Education in New Zealand Credit card Athabasca University Pennsylvania State University Kwantlen University College Cour de cassation Higher education in Japan Dublin City University Education in Finland Education in Romania University of California, San Diego University of Michigan Art school Professor Doctorate Culture of the United States Secondary education in France Pump It Up Lawyer Higher School Certificate University of Maryland, College Park Inflation GED American and British English differences Charles William Eliot School accreditation University Elections in the United States Divorce Ivy League Alcoholics Anonymous Statistical survey Institute for Christian Studies Brown University Darmstadt University of Technology Homeschooling Table tennis Air Education and Training Command Coeducation Margin of error Secondary education in Japan
