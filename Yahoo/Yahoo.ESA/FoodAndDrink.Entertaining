i need ideas for my annual halloween party please help this will be my third annual halloween party i started when my daughter was in rd grade this year she is in th i need a super cool spooktacular idea i was thinking i would make it a monster dance do you think that is ok for that age and do you have any other ideas to add i know its a bit early to think about halloween but i have to start now by the way the whole class is invited and they are allowed to bring friends and family so it is really big thank you i am putting this question in many different catagories so i can get more answers and from lots of different people thankyou pica thank you very much also thanks to my other answer too party ideas monster footprints with a magic marker draw a footprint in a big sponge cut out the footprint pour washable paint in an inch aluminum pan press the sponge in the paint and sponge footsteps up your sidewalk to your front door for trick or treaters to follow or around the side of your dark spooky house flip the sponge upside down to stamp the other foot green pumpkins great idea carve green peppers as jack o lanterns you can have a whole row of them and there are yellow and red peppers to try as well have a whole army of scary faces to greet goblins at your door they will never recover from the fright ghosties crumple up a piece of tissue paper into a ball place it into the center of a flat piece of tissue paper pick up the corners of the flat tissue and twist it around the ball tie a twist tie or a piece of string around the ghosts's neck draw a face with a felt pen you can hang them up all over the house you can also glue on yarn and make a black hat and cape from colored paper to make a witch wicked wicked witch cut the top off of a cardboard milk carton and discard cover the carton with black construction paper and tape at the back cut a strip of white paper inches wide and tape around the top over the black paper draw a scary witch's face on the white paper glue on some yarn for the hair make a cone shaped witch's hat with black paper and glue to the top cut out arms and hands from white paper cut out feet from black paper tape them to the witch glue a popsickle stick to one of the witch's hands cut out two small pieces of yellow paper and cut a fringe on the bottom glue one on each side of the end of the popsickle stick for the broom you can give these to your friends if you are having a halloween party bobbing ghosts start with a piece of cheesecloth yards long and yard wide place a helium filled balloon white is best in the middle of the fabric and gather loosely around balloon draw a horrid mask on the cloth with a felt pen you can put some ghosts in a box and when people open the box the ghosts will float up and scare everyone or you can place them on string in front of an open window or a fan and watch them gently move in the breeze icky cobwebs cut some string into foot lengths and tape them to the ceiling you should have a very dim room for this just before the victim arrives you can hold a bowl of water up to the string and get it wet when people walk in the wet slimy string will brush across their foreheads and scare them body parts this is a good decoration for a dimly lit room at party time have several bowls of body parts displayed to horrify your friends cut up a bunch of hot dogs lenghwise for severed fingers cook some spaghetti noodles and add some red and blue food coloring for veins a bunch of cocktail onions rolling around in a bowl looks like eyeballs fill a red balloon with warm water and spread it with strawberry jam invite your guests to touch your brain crunching bones underfoot spread some dried bread and pretzels under a rug when your guests walk across the rug it will sound like crunching bones underfoot sound effects you can record several scary sounds and play it back during the festivities a very large sheet of poster board or sheet metal makes great thunder uncooked rice poured onto a cookie sheet sounds like rain crinkle a handful of cellophane for a roaring fire to get a good scream you can well scream snap carrots in half for the sound of breaking bones flap a plastic bag in front of the microphone for the sound of bats slowly blow bubbles with a straw into a bowl for that bog sound hunt around your house and the garden to find a squeaky hinge somewhere and tape it before someone gets to it with a can of oil lighting when you have everything so dimly lit it's a good idea to have some reflective tape over the exits a black light bulb is always a good effect especially if you are dressed as a skeleton http www familymanagement com holidays halloween party ideas html here is a site with lots of ideas http familyfun go com parties holiday

how come menthos react with diet coke according to hyneman he's the mustachioed mythbuster it's a process called nucleation in which the particular chemistry of the mentos candy interacts with the chemistry of the carbonated diet coke causing the carbon dioxide gas or co to suddenly come out of suspension in the liquid and make a break for freedom but you have to have the right mentos the non mint type hyneman says have a glaze on them and they don't work at all it only works with the mint ones because they have a matte finish that surface serves as these little portals for the gas to escape through but the story doesn't end there hyneman says there's a cascade that happens with it's a little esoteric an ion exchange basically the mentos start to dissolve and it's like tripping a switch it's not what you would call a chain reaction because that's something else in chemistry terms but it's a cascade whereon all of a sudden all of the co that was contained in the liquid is suddenly not as attracted to the liquid as it was before because of this slight change in the chemistry that occurs that's not surprising since we all know how a change in chemistry can cause attraction to wane but as in many things a little sweetness can slow the process so regular sugared soda doesn't produce the same reaction sugar molecules are very large hyneman says and that doesn't allow this to happen as quickly that's the key sugar is gooey and sticky even though it doesn't seem that way when it's in a soda but there's a lot in there and it helps hold onto the co a lot better on the other hand hyneman says sweetness of no kind natural or artificial results in a disappointing fizzle  Carbon dioxide Glass Biochemistry Water (molecule) Explosive material Corrosion Brewery Hydrogen Soft drink Enzyme Sugar Hydrochloric acid Chemistry Acetic acid Alkane Iron Rebreather Tooth Coca-Cola Methane Photosynthesis Phase (matter) Ammonia Coal Fire extinguisher Sulfuric acid Bread Haloalkane Ecology Alternative biochemistry Gum arabic Hydrogen sulfide Plastic Lake Ozone depletion Sulfur Town gas Sewage treatment Carbon Water Abiogenic petroleum origin Volcano Ester Redox Origin of life Alcohol Nitrogen Formic acid Methanol Champagne (beverage) Sugar beet Titanium New Coke Ozone hole Aspartame Gas metal arc welding Coulometry Mass spectrometry Scuba set Chemical reaction Tea Paint Temperature Nuclear reactor Chocolate Uranium Benzene Polymer Greenhouse gas Petroleum Water purification Polyethylene terephthalate Greenhouse effect Stroke Aluminium Alcohol fuel Soil Alum Sugar substitute Hydrogen chloride Carbon dioxide sink Nuclear power Motor oil Sodium Action potential Liquid crystal Base (chemistry) Flue gas desulfurization Cellular respiration Miller-Urey experiment Wine

we're going on a trip with our favorite rocket ship to celebrate 's birthday then add the party details little einsteins party decorations for the time being little einstein's merchandise is unavailable however you can achieve your theme with solid colored party items streamers plates balloons etc and some imagination visit your local educational supply store to find instrument posters and cut outs posters of classic artists and places around the world you may want to try a travel agency for posters and a used bookstore for old art books that you wouldn't mind using for cutouts the playhouse disney website has print and color sheets to use for placements and or a quiet activity during the party to make a fun table centerpiece cut the top off of a clean gallon cardboard milk box and cover it with construction paper use construction paper glue stick and markers to make the little einsteins characters just faces will do attach a face on each side of the carton place a weighted bouquet of balloons into the or candy into the bottom of the container and tip not feeling creative hire an artistic teen to make the faces or cut four works of art from a magazine book use them on the sides of the carton instead van gogh degas monet solid colored party items personalized stickers and fun party favors little einsteins party games and activities play some fun birthday party games with your child's favorite little einstein characters orchestra ocean treasure hunt you'll need plastic or paper cut outs of various instruments you can find the cut outs at your local teaching supply store if you can find a recording of sample instrument sounds that would be ideal otherwise trace the outline shapes of the various instruments onto large pieces of paper place the instruments toy or paper around the party area and give the children a wagon or basket for collecting the instrument clues that they will find they can take turns pulling the wagon or holding the basket when you play the instrument sound or show the outline shape the children will locate that instrument and place it in the wagon when all of the clues have been found each child will receive a special treasure dance dance dance like june play some classical music making a combination cd before the party is best make sure the cd has a variety of composers tempos rhythmic patterns etc encourage the children to

with their very own pretend rockets don't let big jet win the race before the party cut the tops and bottoms from cardboard boxes paint the boxes with spray paint or latex brush paint on the sides of the boxes cut two kid size holes so that the children can step into the boxes and hold the sides add headlights by covering two cardboard circles with aluminum foil attach with a stapler or strong

batons with pieces of wood dowel wooden beads or styrofoam balls and non toxic paint give each child a baton play your classical music again and have the children conduct the orchestra learn the terms you'll need to know before the party adagio slow allegro fast largo very slowly crescendo gradually get louder diminuendo gradually quiet down more fun with little einsteins add a few more activities appropriate for your party space have a circle time with singing clapping and instruments stick to songs your comfortable with or use a cd and sing along pat your laps for power gather the kids into a

what are some nice finger foods for an engagement party we have all the sweet foods covered but need some ideas on quick finger foods any help would be great chips with several different types of dip to choose among from french onion cheese dip spinch dip or salsa crackers with a cheese ball is a good idea there is more cheese to go around and the guests get as much or as little as they like another good idea is to get some lunch meat spread cream cheese on it and and then roll it up and place toothpicks through it to hold it together i know sounds werid but my mom did it for a halloween party and they where the favorite food of the night i recommend shelling out the cash and going with a small variety of meats from the delli but if you're on a budget a good quality packaged lunch meat works too also the cream cheese is a good idea for crackers too turkey and ham taste the best in my opinion but i know my mom had roast beef in there too and believe it or not bisquits work well too lay some out with butter and jam and people will enjoy it as does making sandwhiches and cutting them up into small triangles and placing toothpicks through them or you can get a block of cheese cub it fold some lunch meat on the top of it and hold them together with with a toothpick and last but certainly never least fruit and veggie trays are perfect for any occassion you can buy them or make them yourself  Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast MRE Hamburger Sandwich Hot dog French cuisine Barbecue Street food German cuisine D__ner kebab Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Vegetarian cuisine McDonald's Dim sum Pizza Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Peruvian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Dairy Bengali cuisine Cajun cuisine Dumpling Ramen Chili con carne Polish cuisine Pie Taco Cheese Vegetarianism Fondue French fries Tamale British cuisine Biscuit Meat analogue Roman eating and drinking Sauce Soul food Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Austria Potato Ice cream Sushi Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Brazil Cha chaan teng Tea Cuisine of Turkey Cuisine of Singapore Korean cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Bread Milk Fish and chips Snack food Burger Cuisine of Africa Potato chips Persian cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Cheesesteak Mexican cuisine Yoghurt Yum cha Pringles Nachos Soup Domesticated turkey Brunch Fast-food restaurant American Chinese cuisine Cincinnati chili Chicken Organic food Culture of Argentina Genericized trademark Cuisine of Norway Meal Coffee Cantonese cuisine Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Mochi Veganism Cuisine of Canada Refrigerator car Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II French toast Salad Gyros

th b day partyyyyyyyyyyyyy what should i do for my th birthday party give me ideas please a 's party can be so much fun for all ages but planning is the key to a swingin' good time for the party my mom made me a light pink felt poodle skirt with a white poodle i wore a plain white long sleeve shirt i tied a light pink sash around my neck and around my ponytail my dad wore jeans a white short sleeve shirt and his leather jacket he also gelled his hair and kept a comb in his back pocket my mom dressed as a car hop apron name tag and everything it was really neat invitations i got black constrution paper and a few metallic markers i folded the paper in half and cut it in a circle leaving a few inches at the top uncut so they could open it like a card in silver on the front i filled in a circle in the middle so that it would look like a record then i wrote you're invited to caitlin's th birthday party inside i wrote the date time etc but instead of saying place my house i put place caitlin's fun time diner i also asked them to be dressed for a 's themed good ol' time inside the record invites i wrote on a note card information about being dressed in theme if they didn't have a poodle skirt i told them to wear their long flowing skirts that i knew they had and i would make felt poodle cutouts to pin to their skirt i was surprised at how mcuh fun they had getting all dressed up for my party for decorations i hung streamers in my p party colors that i picked out black white light pink nad a little bit of aqua i also had balloons in the same colors all over the place for the tables my mom and i put the colored streamers running down the tables for centerpieces i got one for each table trash cans in white then i stuffed them with old newspapers on the top i covered all the newspaper with light pink constrution paper then i took white stuffing the kind for stuffing pillows and such when sewing and placed some in the middle but not completely covering the pink i purchased two small styrafome balls and painted them red and stuck then right on top of the stuffing then with paper towel rolls that i painted white with red stripes i stuck it in the side wall la an ice cream float centerpiece i had some balons next to these too all my friends loved the floats it was worth the time and energy also the floats can be easily put together with hot glue i also used a large box laying around at my house and painted it to look like a juke box once again woth the time and energy i used a picture from the computer to paint my juke box i placed in my basement where most of the party was taking place where there was a spot behind it to place my cd player slelf table etc which was playing 's music the enitre time also my mom and i cut out black paper records and music notes and placed them all the place i also had a mini gum ball machine that i put out and filled with gum my friends really liked it small plastic gum ball machines can be purchased usually for a cheap price i also had a poster board that looked like a menu and listed all the foods we were going to have food and the cake for the main foods we had pizza nad fries both simple foods that almost all people will enjoy i also had bowls with chips and candy out around the party area when i was searching the internet for a real neat cake idea we came across this one my mom made a rectangular chocolate cake with chocholate icing my faveorite then we got a piece of cardboard adn glued a picture of a grease scene that my dad found on the internet we stuck this in one end of the cake then we cleaned some of my brother's old matchbox cars and placed all around facing the screen it looked just like a drive in it was a real hit activities my parents and i made a schedule of what we were going to do at what times from the start of the party for about a half hour or until everyone arrived we danced to 's music it was lots of fun we have lots of pictures from this then we played a few games we played the classics such as limbo hula hoop contests and pin the ponytail on sandy we also had a bag of papers with 's themed things to act out in our game of charades these were made before the party then we ate our meal and our sundeas then we did the cake we were prepared with cling wrap so the guests could take their cake home because they were full by then then i opened my presents and we played a few more games then we all settled down and watched grease until they had to go home we made basic goodie bags but feel free to get really creative with them the guests will love them we had older types of candy like bazooka gum pop rocks etc we also had pencils with music notes this was one of my best birthday arties ever and my friends really enjoyed it too  Billiards Poker jargon Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Mattress Spidey Super Stories Garfield Mario RuneScape quests The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tag Homer Simpson Skirt and

help w a hannah montana party at the pool my daughter is turning and wants to invite all of her girlfriends over for a hannah montana party at the pool does anyone have any ideas for invitations decorations games and treat bags that tie in with hannah or and swimming thanks well hannah montana is a performer so maybe you could set up some kind of stage and have the girls perform karaoke claire's has a lot of hannah montana things including notepads pens and paper maybe the party could be set up like the show first the party could be kind of average just hanging out at the pool like a normal teenager with drinks snacks and friends and then surprise your daughter with a limo ride to a nice dinner or small shopping spree in the show hannah montana is a normal teen named miley then she is also a super star named hannah montana on the way to the pool you can listen to the new miley cyrus cd and while in the limo you can listen to the hannah montana cd one of her songs is called best of both worlds the one from the tv intro i think so that could be the overall theme of the party invitations could be divided in half or two sided one side could invite the girls to a normal teenage pool party then the other side could be glitzy and glamorous and tell the girls that they will receive a surprise star treatment for decorations the pool area could be decorated like the beach with big umbrellas beach blankets etc then the second half of the party could have more elaborate decorations like balloons and glittery stars for games you could play hannah montana triva and have the karoke contest have fun  Charmed Little Britain Teen Girl Squad Birthday Wheel of Fortune The Emancipation of Mimi ABBA Scooby-Doo Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jeopardy!

how to throw a cookout ok so i'm planning this huge cookout i need a list of things to get do buy prepare etc like find a location get a dj rent tables and chairs so on and so on i don't want to forget anything basically i need the steps to planning a huge cookout thanks my family and i do this all the time at least times per summer we have this down and can do it on a great budget without it looking like it first of all find a location depending on where you live you should check out some state parks i live in ny and most of the state parks are nice clean and have plenty of activities swimming boating volleyball sports diamond etc and you can rent a pavillion for less than if you are willing to take the chance you could just show up really early in the morning and hope for the best we went to one weeks ago and had a huge pavillion in saratoga state park with picnic tables a double sided grill a volley ball court and garbage it was really nice and the kids had a blast when i say kids i am including husband uncles father in law etc they actually were more amusing than the children for a dj i would do some thinking into this djs can be quite expensive and depending on your venue they might require permits insurance etc also it's a huge expense and you have to think of all those that are saved generally what i do is ask everyone i know if they have a boom box stereo or i pod with speakers i tell everyone to bring them then you can have music in each area of your event for example where my mother in law is sitting with the elders of our family we do old school music she gets offended by the blasphemy of modern music where the guys are grilling i do old school rap they love it and feel young again i put one near the volley ball court with a decent radio station and then one near the spades table with a good mix cd for the food i highly suggest that you try to delegate your side dishes out to others for example my mother in law makes a great potato salad my father in law makes great fried rice my aunt makes a great taco salad when i ask them to make and bring it i make sure to say that he she makes the best so they almost feel flattered to bring a dish also don't be afraid to use some store bought items there are two dishes that i am asked to bring to every event one is a spinach dip the recipe is on the back of the knorr's vegetable soup mix box the second is baked beans i always bring a tray of baked beans it's an odd thing but everyone loves them especially the kids i just dress them up with a little sauteed onion ketchup mustard and brown sugar i actually like to add bacon to the top but considering all the non pork eaters i have finally stopped doing this cook them in the oven for hour before you are about to leave and then just warm them up before the meal is served just let people bring what they make well another good cheap option is corn on the cob buy a ton of it everyone loves it especially the kids and it's really cheap for meat i tend to go pretty cheap it can get very expensive first things first while planning i buy whatever i find on sale i don't think that i need to provide piece for each individual for example the last bbq we had a weeks ago i only had one rack of ribs and we cooked them up first come first serve there were only about of us at this one so it wasn't a big deal but keep things in perspective also buy frozen meat i always buy bags of frozen chicken legs and thighs for bbqs generally you can get about pieces for i just season them with seasoning salt the night before and put them in the fridge the night before i also buy boxes of burgers and franks the main thing is to make sure you have enough buns to match the amount of burgers and hot dogs you have for something special you may want to add some more special food i hate them but many people do but i always buy two bushles of clams just put them on the grill when they are done toss them in an foil pan with butter you have melted on the grill you can do the same with a few pounds of shrimp before hand just mix some salt pepper and fresh garlic with some butter then mix some peeled deviened shrimp then just pop on the grill don't forget all the condiments bbq sauce ketchup mustard relish butter hot sauce salt pepper etc whatever your family likes and lots of snacks chips fruit snacks crackers and cheese veggies and dip etc we generally skip any type of dessert other than watermelon sometimes my mother will bring a pineapple upside down cake but i think that fruit is good for a bbq as for paper products buy at least four for each person if you are having people make sure you have at least plates cups forks napkins etc at least for example you can get a pack of paper plates but people generally take more than one at a time keep that in mind also depending on there you are you may want table cloths citronella candles for bugs clorox clean up wipes baby wipes bug spray sunscreen etc i almost forgot the most important thing plenty of aluminum pans to transfer your grilled food onto as for chairs and tables everyone you know should bring their own lawn chairs on their own but you might want to remind them actually remind everyone so that the word gets around also many people have folding card tables ask them to bring them the same with coolers you will need a ton of them for drinks alone a few things that i also don't forget are a few decks of cards baseball and bat volley ball badmitton stuff water balloons board games etc lots of things to do if things are really big i will also throw a few extra pair of old sneakers t shirts and socks in the car you know there is always someone who gets wet dirty or comes in heels i think i have included all that i plan but this is just the basics often people bring their own stuff extras never hurt just sale shop from the minute you find your venue  Volleyball Australian words Coffee Kosher foods Vegetarianism Meal Russian cuisine Dairy Burger Food

do golf course bartenders earn good hi i'm a five year experienced bartender i'm not doing it as a living for the past couple years but still do it at parties and stuff like that i'm thinking making it my career choice i love doing it and i'm very good at it but i want to know if golf course bartenders make good i'm taking home about month w benefits and everything but i'm not happy that depends on whether you are talking about private clubs or public ones the average money i made tending in country clubs was good but not what you are making currently municipal courses are a nightmare most of the people can't afford the golf they are playing let alone leaving a decent tip it sounds like you have a decent job taking something part time to check it out for yourself would be my best suggestion the country clubs i worked at were a blast a real sense of family with the staff and the members still if you have something good in your pocket already the part time route is probably your best bet every job has it times when you just want to say screw it the grass always seems greener on the other side most country clubs hire alot of people for seasonal gigs when the business is peak so if you have an offer in hand make sure its a permanent position and not just one of the many short term fill the gap jobs that come up its important to be happy at what you are doing but a little caution here would be prudent  Unemployment Golf Gross domestic product The Shining (film) Economic inequality Poker jargon PGA European Tour Betting (poker) Shaggy dog story Cricket The Amazing Race Bruce Johnson U.S. Open (golf) Microeconomics Fancy Crane Friends Flat tax Who Shot Mr. Burns?

experts on hookah shisha hi those of you who know their shisha hookah stuff im new to it and my husband really wants one his birthday is coming i want to get him soemthing good price is not an issue it should be of good quality please advice what specs ishould look for or if you know where i can find one oh thank you for the answers no one seems to wanna help i am from uk there are plenty of websites to get hookahs from i am actually starting my own hookah business soon but i dont have my website established yet my supplier is hookah shisha com and i have never been disappointed hookahs are highly variable depending on what you are looking for number of hoses is one thing to look for they range from to or for a first timer i would suggest a hookah that has hose and rotates it will be a more intimate experience for you and your husband to enjoy together also get as long a hose as possible so you can lay back and relax while smoking and aren't huddled around the hookah ive seen hookahs range from inches to inches so think about how large you want it to be i recommend something between and as the large chamber created in the base makes for a very smooth smoke there are many styles of hookahs such as egyptian syrian mya indian rotator etc so i would just peruse about online and find the style that you think your husband would like the most as far as coals go i would recommend quick lighting golden coals you only need a lighter to light them instead of a gas stove romman is the best brand of shisha on the market in my circle of friends' opinion i would not recommend buying one from some small arab store or ebay as you don't know if what you are ordering is of high quality or even if its been used before when ordering from hookah shisha com you get everything you need to start smoking right away with every hookah purchase free coals tongs all hoses and grommets a bowl a wind cover and of course boxes of romman shisha with every purchase good luck and have fun  Hookah Bong Mattress Coffeehouse Cigar Ioannina M16 (rifle) Advertising Vacuum Kitchen Lionel Corporation Illegal drug trade Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Coffee Gramophone record Economics Tobacco smoking Irrigation Tobacco Electronic commerce Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Portable stove Theory of conduct Smoking pipe Petroleum Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hashish Shaggy dog story Inflation Glossary of firefighting terms Hybrid vehicle Airsoft Neopets Carburetor Japanese tea ceremony Radio controlled airplane Management information system Hydraulic machinery Parachuting 1973 oil crisis Digital photography Microeconomics Stove Shotgun F-16 Fighting Falcon O scale Hydrogen economy Cable television Windsurfing Gas metal arc welding William Murdoch Slide rule Energy development RuneScape quests Drill bit Turbocharger Supply and demand Philatelic investment IPod Floppy disk RuneScape skills Commodity markets Diesel engine Cigarette Binoculars Network effect Hamster Plastic Nuclear power Electrophysiology Town gas Strap-on dildo Air gun Concrete Arbitrage Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Topps Causality Commodore International EverQuest Charles Ives Wood Publicly funded medicine Solar power Eyepiece Siphon BMW RuneScape economy Glossary of firefighting equipment String theory Use of poison gas in World War I Internal ballistics

is it appropriate to have a money tree at a bon voyage party instead of guests bringing gifts way tacky it's tacky to even expect gifts they aren't traditional for a bon voyage party it is traditional however for the host of the party to provide a small gift favor for all his her guests perhaps a small framed photo of the honoree s or himself if he is the one leaving it's also nice to have everyone bring photos of themselves to make up an album for the person who is leaving seriously setting up a money tree is like you are asking your friends to finance your vacation trip here is a website that gives you theme suggestions for a bon voyage party http www shindigz com partytipz cfm caid aid pid  Wedding reception Uniform Resource Locator Customs and etiquette of Japan Bon Jovi Disneyland The End of the World (Doctor Who) Birthday Simon Le Bon Henry H.

sleepover birthday party for a year old girl my bff is having her party soon and is clueless money is tight and she can only use the living room or her bed room and we must be q u i e t her dad s a meanie we want to stay up all night too well if this was my sleepover i would choose the living room see if her parents will let her move the furniture out of the way and then get mattresses or airbeds or something for you all to sleep on then get sleeping bags duvets blankets sheets throws anything to keep you warm add loads of pillows and cushions and you have the perfect sleeping area then get snacks that means stuff like pringles chocolate dips popcorn and drinks like fizzy pop or whatever you like if money really is an issue you could just buy a few bags of potato chips and fizzy pop for cheap prices a really cool snack would be to buy a few boxes of strawberries wash and cut them into a big bowl then melt a huge bar of chocolate into another bowl all sat round and eat them tasty and cheap if you have to be quite get a film and put it on low and vow to stay quiet throughout the film make sure it is a really good film so that you won't want to stop watching then when the film ends you could read fashion magazines or paint each others nails or go on a dance mat if you have one or anything that doesn't make a lot of noise do face masks make buns do each others hair take loads of photos also if you can't make noise in the house go play twister on the back garden or sit around and tell ghost stories under the stars a great idea to waste time would be to go out until as late as you can beforehand so that you are in the house for the least possible time because you might run out of things to do if you don't have much money you could go see a show or gig or something in the local area thats free or you could hang out at the park  Teen Girl Squad Mattress Upholstery Professional wrestling match types Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon Blood Simple Cuisine of Denmark Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Comanche Great Teacher Onizuka The Amber Spyglass The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Coffee Customs and etiquette of Japan Plastic Bed (furniture) Professional wrestling slang Aerial (dance move) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sin City Ocean's Twelve Meat Loaf EastEnders Soft drink The Fairly OddParents Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Happy Tree Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban In-N-Out Burger Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Microeconomics Potato chips Snack food Textile manufacturing Animal Crossing Big Brother UK series 6 The Time Machine Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Calvin and Hobbes Characters in the Smurfs Hamster The Ashlee Simpson Show Homer Simpson Breakfast RuneScape quests Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Jeffersons (South Park) Movie theater Ben Johnson (athlete) Little Britain The Shining (film) Sandwich Miss Saigon Queen (band) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Spidey Super Stories Dairy The Contender (television series) Bong The Amazing Race My Parents are Aliens Empire Burlesque The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Satchel Paige Squidward Tentacles What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

i'm thinking about having a party and i need free party supplies any ideas i'm having a dinner party for girls plus me it's like a birthday party for all of us everyone is bring a present to pass and i have for food but i don't have any money left for party supplies we have a pool so we'll be going swimming the theme is kind of an english tea party does anybody know of a website that has free party supplies well it's a tea party but a teen version tea parties usually have small snacks finger sandwiches small tea cookies scones tiny pastries etc for inexpensive sandwiches make some egg salad sandwich triangles or tuna salad or both doz eggs loaf bread mayo in your moms fridge add a spoonful of relish for some zip and a little salt and pepper serve them on a nice tray cut into triangles if you don't have a pretty tray take a plate cover it with a smooth sheet of tinfoil and pick a few wildflowers to place around the edges for garnish make some sugar cookies make them petite about quarter size on the cookie sheet be careful not to burn them they won't take as long to cook if your friends are vegetarian you can easily make cucumber tea sandwiches with mint mayo lg egg yolks ts dijon mustard tb fresh lemon juice c fresh mint leaves loosely packed c vegetable oil salt and pepper thin slices homemade white bread crusts removed cucumber peeled and thinly sliced mint mayonnaise in a blender or food processor combine the egg yolks mustard lemon juice and mint with motor running add the oil in a slow stream and blend until emulsified season to taste with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl spread each slice of bread generously on one side with the mayonnaise on half the slices arrange an even layer of cucumber slices top with remaining bread slices cut each sandwich into triangles before serving makes tea sandwiches since the theme is a tea party serve iced tea with lemon wedges as your main beverage as far as free supplies you're likely not going to find them unless you use your imagination and use what you have around you if you have wild roses around you very common here in wi you can design your own rose centerpiece just set the table nicely with a nice tablecloth if you have one and some fresh picked wildflowers you can add a few tealight candles found a dollar store for tea party fun try reading tea leaves with your friends you can take out a book from the library all you need to do is pour a teaspoon of tea into a light colored teacup fill the cup with boiling water and let the leaves settle drink the tea while focusing on a question you have or a wish you d like fulfilled when there s only a teaspoon of tea left swirl the contents and pour out the remaining liquid look for patterns in the remaining leaves according to one source a sun signifies happiness while an arrow indicates bad news if you really want tea party decor print up a tea party banner on your computer and hang it up or print some large colorful teapots cut them out and hang them up create personalized tea party invitations in the shape of a tea cup decorate the room with pink and white streamers available at the dollar store for per roll best wishes and have a wonderful party  Sushi Ice cream Russian cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Chili con carne In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Greece Cantonese cuisine D__ner kebab Pizza Cuisine of Argentina Tea (meal) Rice pudding Plastic Fish and chips Bengali cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Chocolate Rum French cuisine Roman eating and drinking Brewery Idli Ketchup Bagel Egg (food) Yerba mate Cuisine of Turkey Haggis Chicken soup Knife Sugar Cuisine of Brazil Hamster French fries Pancake Potato chips Teapot Ramen Potato Oreo Soup Yoghurt Lemonade Cookware and bakeware American Chinese cuisine Sauce Cajun cuisine Polish cuisine Martini cocktail MRE Dumpling Pysanka Tomato Sauerkraut Domesticated turkey Soul food Gazpacho Puff pastry Beer Mango CPU cache Recipe Pottery Champagne (beverage) Chinese tea culture Yum cha Microeconomics Textile manufacturing

how should i celebrate a milestone birthday need some suggestions this is a biggie and i want to make it special i'm drawing a blank because i rarely do any formal celebrations etc give me some ideas how to make it special please nothing involving booze i don't drink so partying til i pass out isn't on the list try something different like an interactive show like a murder mystery dinner party or just a big party at your house or somewhere nice with your favorite people and foods no alcohol no problem in fact i think that's really better that way myself safer for those having to drive or those having to be on the road with someone who's been drinking happy birthday  Birthday Theory of conduct Alcoholic beverage The Notorious B.I.G.
