how can i get rid of background noise caused by the power cord on my laptop i use my laptop like a big i pod playing music on it through a simple mixer amp when the laptop is unplugged the sound is unaltered but when plugged in an intermittant buzz hum can be heard simply leaving it unplugged is not an option what you should do is plug the laptops power cord into a surge protector that has an emi rfi noise filter the noise you are hearing is probably coming through the electrical lines into the notebook and then translated via interference to the audio signal there are quite a few surge protectors with noise filters on the market so i'm sure you'll be able to find one that fits your needs well i didn't include a link to an example one only because i am not sure of what else you are going to plug into it but again i believe you will find one easily i hope that helps  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Laptop Radio frequency interference Audiophile Power strip Universal Serial Bus Bass guitar IPod Hearing aid Jack plug Mixing console BS 1363 Sound effect Loudspeaker Microphone Gramophone record Mouse (computing) Electric guitar Modem Decibel X10 (industry standard) Low-pass filter Electronic amplifier Stereoscopy Hard disk Synthesizer Disc jockey Headphones Transformer Effects unit Television TRS-80 Software-defined radio Spark plug Laserdisc Oscilloscope Nirvana (band) Signal-to-noise ratio FM broadcasting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Personal computer Radar Analog-to-digital converter Sound recording Commodore 64 Roxette Digital-to-analog converter Wi-Fi Compact audio cassette Fuse (electrical) Weighting filter Bluetooth Electronics Federal Standard 1037C PowerBook Electronic filter RCA connector Diode Static inverter plant Sonar Morse Code Dolby Laboratories NTSC Power cord Telecommunication Karaoke Atari 8-bit family Ground (electricity) Apple Macintosh FL Studio IBM PC compatible Electric motor Balanced audio DIN connector Dolby noise reduction system Vocoder Operational amplifier The Church Hearing impairment Kraftwerk SCART Buddy Guy Kenwood Electronics Dither Circuit design Sound Compact disc Super Audio CD Subtractive synthesis Effects pedal Sound card Phase-locked loop Desknote Stereophonic sound Phonograph Protoss B-47 Stratojet

how effective are air ionic breezers i know they work but the air which passes through them is not much so how much of a positive effect are they are they worth the money based on my experience and research the ionic breeze models of so called air purifiers are overpriced underperformers they do remove a small percentage of particulates mostly dust from the air and can give the air a smell that some people consider a clean smell however they move so little air through them that they're not very effective at all to really clean the air you have to move the air through the cleaner hepa air cleaners high efficiency particulate arresting are considered an industry standard they will remove particles as fine as of an inch with efficiency a hepa cleaner with an ozonator will kill bacteria and mold and hepa filters can also be impregnated with chemicals which will clear the air of noxious fumes like ammonia hepa is an air cleaning technology used by among other things hospitals semiconductor manufacturing nasa and atomic plants that to me is a sharper image than the ionic breeze purifiers which do nothing but generate static electricity  Air purifier Electrostatic precipitator Air ioniser Ozone Ammonia Vacuum cleaner Air pollution Particulate Air filter Cleanroom Vacuum Dry cleaning Air conditioning Welding Earth's atmosphere Water purification Fossil fuel power plant Natural gas Solar cell Water (molecule) Hydrogen economy Nuclear fallout High-voltage direct current Energy development Drill bit Ozone hole Atom Ceramics Wind power Gas metal arc welding Catalytic converter Nuclear power Carburetor Biodiesel Hard disk Haloalkane Bong Helium Explosive material Gas mask Hydride Solar power Spacecraft propulsion Semiconductor fabrication Laser Plutonium Sun Ricin Coal Water Light-emitting diode Isotope separation Diesel engine Ozone layer Microscopy Arc welding Hydrogen sulfide Beryllium Copper Ion Electrolysis Carbon dioxide Acetic acid Fuel cell Chlorine Cathode ray tube Electric motor Refrigerator Environmental concerns with electricity generation Anthrax Town gas Industrial wastewater treatment X-ray Thermal power station Lionel Corporation Plastic Pebble bed reactor Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Electron Ice core Battery (electricity) Chemical warfare Quantum mechanics Fan (implement) Internal ballistics Atomism Brewery STS-50 Tank Sodium hypochlorite Dairy Emission standard Vacuum tube Ultraviolet

i have bought a new telly and fitted an outside ariel but when a persons speaking the sound isnt in sync the problem may not be with your antenna but i can't be sure how to advise you as you are not very specific when you say out of sync what do you mean you see actors lips move before hearing their voices or you have a crackling sound or what i am assuming that you are in the uk if your tv is new it could be that it is set up for european pal instead of uk pal where you could tune in the sound or the picture but not at the same time go into your settings menu and find tuning and make sure it is set for uk pal which i believe is pal b bad memory haven't lived in the uk for a number of years just set it to one of the other choices and see if that helps otherwise try asking again being a bit more specific  Television Super Nintendo Entertainment System S__CAM NTSC DV PAL Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IS-95 Laserdisc Whose Line Is It Anyway?

wat is a satellite transponder i am in a technical class and we need to find wat a satellite transponder is i will be happy if u would help thnx a satellite transponder is according to wiki communications satellite s channels are called transponders because each is a separate transceiver or repeater with digital video data compression and multiplexing several video and audio channels may travel through a single transponder on a single wideband carrier original analog video only has one channel per transponder with subcarriers for audio and automatic transmission identification service atis non multiplexed radio stations can also travel in single channel per carrier scpc mode with multiple carriers analog or digital per transponder this allows each station to transmit directly to the satellite rather than paying for a whole transponder or using landlines to send it to an earth station for multiplexing with other stations  Subcarrier Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Federal Standard 1037C Radio Digital audio broadcasting Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing FM broadcasting Telephone Communications satellite Modem Digital television Bluetooth Satellite television HD Radio ITU-T Error correction and detection Global Maritime Distress Safety System Freeview Code division multiple access Emergency position-indicating rescue beacon Broadcast television system Cellular network NTSC Compact disc Broadband Voice over IP Air traffic control Avionics Asynchronous Transfer Mode Radiotelephone Broadcasting In-band on-channel Digital Subscriber Line High-definition television Ethernet Wavelength-division multiplexing XM Satellite Radio RFID T-carrier Serial communications ATN-7 Amateur radio Integrated Services Digital Network GSM services British Sky Broadcasting Movie projector History of radio Multiplexer Station identification TV-FM DX Music radio IS-95 Time-division multiplexing Direct broadcast satellite Television Subsidiary Communications Authority NEC Corporation Satellite radio NICAM IEEE 802.11 Television channel Digital British Satellite Broadcasting Gramophone record Frequency modulation Sonar Telephone tapping Telegraphy Musical Instrument Digital Interface Universal Serial Bus Digital Visual Interface Public Switched Telephone Network Automatic number plate recognition Video General Packet Radio Service Bell ExpressVu Inmarsat SCIP AM broadcasting SCART FM broadcast band Audio data compression Sky Digital DV DVD Streaming media Australian Broadcasting Corporation Broadband Internet access Pulse-code modulation Secure Digital card

what is a good heater for a bedroom apartment i know i know it's like degrees outside and i am asking about heaters anyway i live in an apartment where the heat is not controlled by the tenent can anyone recommend one that they have tried or heard good things about i really don't want to use a kerosene heater i'm no expert but i've heard the ones that are oil based non flammable i believe and am quite sure of are the safest and most efficient the idea is electricity heats the oil to the temperature you set the thermostat at and then the electricity turns off when it hits the temperature you set the thermostat at the oil is still the same temperature and radiates this heat out till it drops below the setting then the electricity turns back on and the process repeats itself again this keeps the heater from going on and off all the time which is annoying and uses a lot more electricity i would go to a store and ask an expert about this form of heater i hope i'm close to being right or i just wasted a whole bunch of cartridge ink your time and mine  Thermostat Furnace HVAC Refrigerator Carburetor Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Diesel engine Process control Nuclear power Portable stove Vacuum tube Temperature Energy development Alcohol fuel Thermal power station Heat Explosive material Transformer Torpedo Renewable energy Slow cooker Kerosene Spark plug Fire Water Nuclear reactor Soldering iron Ocean thermal energy conversion Town gas Alternative fuel Phase change heat pump Turbocharger Kitchen Air conditioning Fuel cell Gas turbine Hysteresis Washing machine Internal combustion engine Heating element Motor oil Petroleum Coal Nuclear weapon design Future energy development Pebble bed reactor Nuclear fusion Chevrolet Corvair Internal ballistics Ceramics Power station Water heater Solar cell Waterbed Ironing Incandescent light bulb High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Vacuum Negative feedback Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Steam engine Hydrogen Thermocouple Radiator Sodium Gas absorption refrigerator Wood fuel Carbon Electrical wiring Dry cleaning Deep lake water cooling Solar panel Sewage treatment Water (molecule) Sun Peltier-Seebeck effect Oxygen sensor Aquarium Spacecraft propulsion Optical fiber Hydropower Nuclear power phase-out Space manufacturing Plastic Ammonia Combined cycle Tank Cogeneration Ford Ranger EV Control system Natural gas Fan death

is vac like volts im going on a trip and taking xbox should vac be enough to power it sense it runs at volts and the invertor is watts so it should work in theory it should work but how well it works will be another question first of all you can plug the xbox into it but most liekly the xbox will pull more then watts and you can garuantee it wont be enough if you are talkign about an xbox also most inverters are can not produce true sine wave output meaning the ac current is slightly distorted some devices don't take well to this that is why inverters are most commonly used for simple devices like power drills and lamps and sometimes the occasional tv only way to see if it works is to try it first and see if it pops your fuse if it doesn't then enjoy the gaming also hard drives are very prone to damage from small shock such as holes in the road this is something you may want to consider  Volt Transformer Three-phase electric power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Inverter (electrical) Switched-mode power supply Xbox Fluorescent lamp Diode Electric motor Relay Circuit design Fuse (electrical) Electronic amplifier Operational amplifier Vacuum cleaner Xbox 360 Decibel Power (physics) Electrical wiring Game controller Alternating current Vacuum tube Residual-current device Modchip Light-emitting diode Tesla coil BS 1363 Battery (electricity) SCART Mouse (computing) Impedance matching USB flash drive CMOS Solar cell Bubble Bobble Nintendo GameCube Oscilloscope Drill bit Transistor Carburetor Spark plug X10 (industry standard) Trigonometric function Electronic Arts Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Capacitor Professional wrestling throws High-voltage direct current Super Nintendo Entertainment System Horsepower Variable Frequency Drive Professional wrestling holds Synthesizer Pump It Up Directed-energy weapon Laser Headlight Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Piezoelectricity Seismometer Nintendo Entertainment System Dimmer Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tire Floppy disk Logic gate Electrical generator Strap-on dildo Analog-to-digital converter Phase-locked loop Solar panel Computer forensics Ford Crown Victoria Audiophile Current source Hall effect Optical fiber Neon lamp Goatse.cx Spark gap Resistor Armored Core Energy development Power strip Lightning Tractor Powerbomb Audio power Bethesda Softworks Hand grenade Power supply Computer and video games Screw Circuit breaker PlayStation 2

can u use the tapping method on any electric guitar if not what kind of guitar do i need tapping can be done on almost any electric but there are some things that can make it easier such as the quality of your overdrive and the amount of sustain sometimes cheap guitars have a very high action high high the string sit off of the fretboard and this can make it very hard but a little adjusting can even make a cheap guitar fairly easy to pull of tapping you can do this by adjusting the truss rod slightly and lowering the saddle if it has adjustment screws tapping can sound cool but if your really wanting to make a cool arpegiotic sound try learning sweeping it is a lot more rewarding if i had to choose a best setup i would choose a guitar with a quality low action with gibson ultra lights and a concert reverb  Guitar Bass guitar Fender Telecaster Electric guitar Violin Carburetor Welding Eddie Van Halen Piano Harp Harmonica Transformer Internal ballistics Solar cell Blood on the Tracks Trey Anastasio Drill bit Equine conformation Electric motor Twelve string guitar Taps and dies Guilty Gear Screw Gas metal arc welding Pinball Classical guitar Turbofan Spacecraft propulsion Clarinet Oscilloscope Lighting Nuclear power Saxophone Naval mine Buddy Guy Loudspeaker MP3 Slide guitar Chapman Stick Professional wrestling throws Wind turbine John Myung Synthesizer String instrument Nuclear reactor Strap-on dildo Brian May Propeller Les Paul Ibanez Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Thermostat Seismic retrofit Overclocking Hydrogen economy Stanley Jordan Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Electrophysiology Vacuum Anchor Energy development Pat Metheny Gross domestic product Mattress Electric violin Time Out of Mind Titanium Multitrack recording Four square Effects pedal Optical fiber Seismometer Inflation Operational amplifier Wood Green Day Van Halen Sitar Jet engine Autonomous building Gas tungsten arc welding Diamond simulant Transposing instrument Tapping Power chord Tap (valve) Unemployment Theory of conduct Explosive material Brewery Suspension bridge Marching band Glass Bulk vending Wire Hurdy gurdy Dodge Neon

how to l hookup a mic to a dvd player l bought a koss dvd player that plays cdgs but no mic hookup is it possible to hookup a mic to a dvd player it is not as simple as that you actually need to mix the mic input with the cd audio output i suggest you connect it to an audio receiver with mic input although if you don't have a receiver a stand alone karaoke machine is probably cheaper  Karaoke SCART DVD Laserdisc Microphone Mixing console Receiver (radio) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox TRS connector Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Amstrad CPC Copy protection Super Audio CD Home cinema VHS Phonograph S-VHS Sound Blaster Dance Dance Revolution Hearing aid Girls Aloud Computer hardware Grateful Dead Transformer Video CD Computer DVD-Audio Electronic amplifier Musical Instrument Digital Interface Jack plug Enterprise content management Sega CD DVD player Macromedia Flash Compact disc S__CAM Input impedance Headphones USB flash drive Ayumi Hamasaki Operational amplifier Bemani Data compression PlayStation Portable MP3 Ripping Synthesizer Voltage regulator Apple Macintosh XLR connector Oscilloscope Digital rights management Central processing unit MPEG-2 SingStar High-definition television Disc jockey High fidelity Interactive fiction Analog-to-digital converter Audio stream input output Beastie Boys Artificial neural network Telecine Software-defined radio Digital audio player Hardware random number generator Machinima Xbox 360 Digital circuit S-Video Audio level compression Blu-ray Disc Super Video CD Mixtape ZX Spectrum Sega Dreamcast Teleprinter Flip-flop (electronics) Pioneer Corporation Neural network Composite monitor Digital audio workstation Speech synthesis BASIC programming language Screenshot Nintendo Revolution Television Compact audio cassette RCA connector Delta Goodrem Multiplexer FairPlay CD-G Multitrack recording Phase-locked loop Nintendo DS Karaoke Revolution

is the thomson dti top up tv anytime set top box any good i was looking to initially subscribe to sky digital however an offer i subscribed for was not honoured i then decided on virgin media tv however we do not have cable in our area so my last option is to use top up tv to benefit from the sports channel options is top up tv any good and is setanta sports any good for supporters following the premiership matches there have been a lot of changes to freeview since it began and these changes have severely disadvantaged those customers subscribing to top up channels you should check the freeview website carefully before you spend your money to make sure which channels are actually available why did you not just complain to sky about their error everybody makes mistakes even the most reputable companies i've had sky for some months now and could never now be satisfied with freeview topup as the range of channels available on freeview topup is actually very poor  Freeview Sky Sports Cable television Top Up TV British Sky Broadcasting Channel 4 Sky Digital BBC Home Box Office Five (TV) ITV Digital American Broadcasting Company Austar Set-top box Media in Ireland High-definition television Now Broadband TV Sit-up Ltd Chorus Communications Broadband Internet access British television Satellite television DVD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting XM Satellite Radio Virgin Mobile Global System for Mobile Communications GSM services BBC News 24 Teletext Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Foxtel ITV Satellite radio Media in Canada More4 Radio Caroline Xbox ABC1 Xbox 360 TiVo Disney Channel Interactive television Sport in Ireland Bluetooth Rogers Communications TV3 Ireland Digital Subscriber Line NTL Media of the United Kingdom North American Numbering Plan BBC Radio 4 Television network Analogue television in the United Kingdom Alex Ferguson Television in the United States Subscription business model ITV2 United States Postal Service News Corporation Dish Network MTV Sport in the United Kingdom Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Optus Television Table tennis Blackjack Anchor Acorn Computers Digital audio broadcasting UKTV Redundant array of independent disks Telephone exchange ABS-CBN Star Wars: Galaxies Direct broadcast satellite Credit card Oscilloscope Open access WWOR-TV Time Warner S4C Chelsea F.C.

can putting my batteries in a freezer prolong its life i buy the good batteries but they die so fast i don't use them that often and i always make sure i turn off my electronics if not in use what in the world could be making them die so fast i heard from somewhere that batteries can last longer if placed in a freezer they didn't say how long anyone ever tried this i tried but didn't work what could i be doing wrong i'm always having to buy new batteries for my cd player tape recorder and alarm clock putting batteries in the freezer or refrigerator doesn't necessarily prolong their life alkaline batteries stored at room temperature self discharge at a rate of less than two percent per year so normally refrigerating or freezing them will only help maintain their charge by a tiny amount hardly worth the effort of chilling them however if alkaline batteries are stored at higher temperatures they will start to lose capacity much quicker at degrees f they only lose about per year but at degrees they lose per year so if you live in a very hot climate or are storing your batteries in a very hot location it may be worthwhile for you to store your alkaline batteries in a refrigerator instead nimh and nicd batteries self discharge at a much faster rate than alkaline batteries in fact at room temperature about degrees f nimh and nicd batteries will self discharge a few percent per day storing them at lower temperatures will slow their self discharge rate dramatically nimh batteries stored at freezing will retain over of their charge for full month so it might make sense to store them in a freezer if you do it's best to bring them back to room temperature before using them even if you don't freeze your nimh batteries after charging them you should store them in a cool place to minimize their self discharge  Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Lithium ion battery Toyota Prius Water (molecule) Battery electric vehicle Ice cream Bicycle lighting Brewery Lithium ion polymer battery Thermal power station Action potential Fuel cell Diode Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Ford Ranger EV Thermoregulation Temperature Circuit design IPod Incandescent light bulb Solar power Jet engine Motor oil Nuclear reactor Fossil fuel power plant Kitchen Climate of the United Kingdom Heat Overclocking Urban heat island Wind power Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy CPU design Second Battle of the Atlantic Haloalkane Hydride Lead-acid battery Urinary incontinence Cold fusion Solar cell Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Explosive material Nuclear power Tag Ozone depletion Capacitor Nuclear fusion Severe weather terminology (United States) Airsoft Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ammonia Bipolar disorder Capitalism 8 mm video format Ice Steven Wright Bong Wind turbine Milk Terraforming Air conditioning RISC Ozone hole Sento CPU cache Windows XP Stuttering Hybrid vehicle Daylight saving time MP3 Axial compressor Transistor Electrophysiology Basement Food preservation Effects of global warming Laserdisc Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat index Poker jargon Fire fighting Refrigeration HVAC

are dvds going to be released still since hd dvd and blu ray disc replace vhs and laserdisc i wanna know because i don't feel like collecting blu ray or hd dvd yes because there are millions of people that only have a dvd player and don't have a hd format player they will still be buying movies i agree that there is a format war between hd dvd the cheaper backward compatible format and blu ray the technologically superior format but they might both survive the reason is because they are both discs that can use the same laser companies will start producing low cost universal players that can play both beta was the superior format to vhs but they were not physically compatible plus sony charged too much to licence the beta format if this happens again blu ray may not win even though it is better personally i'm waiting for a combo player hopefully a toshiba model  Laserdisc DVD Videocassette recorder VHS High-definition television Sony DualDisc Video CD Betamax S-VHS Compact disc PlayStation 3 8 mm video format IBM PC compatible Super Audio CD PlayStation 2 Betacam Audio commentary (DVD) Who Framed Roger Rabbit IPod Xbox 360 Console wars Camcorder Television Regional lockout Karaoke PlayStation Portable Counter-Strike Terminator 2: Judgment Day Floppy disk Handheld game console Macrovision Nintendo Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MP3 Digital rights management Laser Gramophone record Robotech MiniDisc S__CAM Format war CD-ROM Rush (band) Modchip Hard disk Octopus card Video codec Digital Theatre System Videotape Super Video CD Sony Computer Entertainment Blu Cantrell MPEG-2 Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Warez Ren and Stimpy ATI Technologies Copy protection The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Single (music) Roxette Sega The Criterion Collection TiVo Toshiba CD recorder Nintendo Revolution Pioneer Corporation Video game music JVC Videodisc Dolby Laboratories The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Dragon's Lair Optical disc Pornography L'Arc-en-Ciel History of Microsoft Windows DVD-R UK Singles Chart Poker jargon ITunes Music Store SelectaVision Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Dolby Digital Sega Saturn The Cure Game Boy Jean-Michel Jarre Digital audio player Path dependence Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure MIPS architecture Gran Turismo (game)

user reviews of hearing aids they are largely pointless hearing is very subjective everyone has a different hearing loss and everyone responds differently to having a hearing loss every person with a hearing loss will respond differently to a hearing aid in the same way that i might like a bmw but you might prefer a lexus so from what i have seen web sites that try to compare hearing aids do a poor job i can find you a patient of mine who thinks the company i work for makes the best hearing aids in the world as i do but i can probably find another patient who had a bad experience and remember bad news always travels faster than good the true acid test is to get a hearing test and then have the hearing professional demonstrate some real hearing aids programmed to match your loss if the place you go cannot do this for you walk or run away then negotiate a free no obligation no fee trial of your hearing aids for at least a month see how you get on with them in the real world don't be afraid to shop around consider starkey audibel siemens resound widex oticon avoid phonak really avoid miracle ear or magnatone  MP3 Hearing aid Insurance Audiophile Social rule Hearing impairment Clinical depression Food and Drug Administration A Course In Miracles M__ni__re___s disease Prostate cancer Duesberg hypothesis Decibel Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Podcasting Phonak Health insurance Bipolar disorder Economic inequality Biology and sexual orientation Baldness treatments Unemployment Milton H.

cricket cell found one lost my own could i use the one i found i found a cricket cell shortly after losing my own would i be able to use it if so how soon after that account is inactive or is there no need to wait i'd like to use it instead of having to buy me new phone but if i can't i'll toss it how'd you feel after you lost your phone this is probably how this phone's owner feels now if i were you then i'd turn it in by calling the number to the cricket phone company which i just found out is cricket and hey you never know they might give you a phone just for turning it in it's really the right thing to do besides if the phone owner doesn't find it soon they'll probably end up cancelling it anyway so you wouldn't be able to use it  Cricket Sydney Riot of 1879 North American Numbering Plan Ocean's Twelve English cricket team Taxicab Surveillance Test cricket Telephone tapping History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) West Indian cricket team Telephone Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Telephone directory History of Test cricket (to 1883) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Japanese mobile phone culture Payphone Private branch exchange Time Out of Mind The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Mobile phone About a Boy Full Metal Panic?

can't get progressive scan to work i have a samsung sa model hd tv which seemed like a wonderful purchase when i bought it since i was told that it has hd capability as well as progressive scan capability however i'm trying to get the progressive scan mode on however every time i try to turn it on the screen goes blank do i need the usb upgrade or something i found out by looking at the back of the tv that you need to hook up the component video in to the ps but each time i try that the signal is black and white do i need a special converter i am not familiar with your tv but tvs automatically detect the input and scale to their native resolution so there is no need to set your ps to progressive output what progressive resolution do you try p p or p perhaps your tv supports only p and p and not p actually for p you will need an hdmi cable as well set your ps at p and it should work just fine  Television SCART Digital Visual Interface Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Xbox 360 High-definition television Original Amiga chipset 1080p Digital photography Universal Serial Bus ATSC DVD High-Definition Multimedia Interface Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple IIGS Geographic information system Sound Blaster Atari 8-bit family Interlace Oscilloscope Sinclair ZX81 Digital television Video codec Bluetooth Teletext Game Boy Amiga Home cinema Laserdisc Image scanner Nintendo GameCube Liquid crystal display television Laptop S__CAM Digital circuit Computer display NTSC Commodore 128 Mouse (computing) Widescreen PlayStation 3 Analog-to-digital converter Steam (content delivery) Video ZX Spectrum Hard disk VHS MPEG-2 Atari ST PC Engine RGB color model Light-emitting diode Creative Zen IBM PC compatible Air traffic control Enterprise content management Amstrad CPC Broadcast television system SETI Game Boy Advance Sound card Acorn Electron MIM-23 Hawk IMac Vorbis Windows Vista Video Graphics Array Windows XP FireWire Betacam Camcorder Color Graphics Adapter Macrovision Windows 2000 Compact disc Copy protection Commodore 64 RCA connector IBook Digital Atari 2600 Floppy disk Refresh rate Digital signal processing Blu-ray Disc IPAQ Portable Document Format Halting problem Mass spectrometry Functional magnetic resonance imaging Digital cinematography DV Galileo spacecraft Nintendo DS Computer display standard Advanced Technology Attachment

i heard audio cable requires break in is there any objective data support this claim thanks t green i am looking for objective published data of audio cable physical electrical properties before and after long usage that supports this claim hearing test data or claims does not count because it is subjective and many variables player receiver amplifier speakers are included thanks t green i have read some articles about audio cables and how they need to be broken in installed in the right direction etc i have also read articles about how this is ridiculous basically a wire is a wire a conductor that has no directional properties nor do the properties change with use unless you put more current through the wire than it can handle in that case it could get hot melt the insulation and perhaps if it gets hot enough to melt or partially melt the wire i would put most of the claim of certain wire properties as snob appeal or the manufacturer taking advantage of some people who are not technical and are willing to pay exhorbinant prices for claims that cannot be substantiated from wiki many of the most outspoken subjectivists including reviewers columnists and pundits lack engineering training technical knowledge and objective credentials and most will fully admit a lack of understanding as to the technical merits of what they are analyzing but nevertheless praise a product's innovation and performance based on perceptual jargon counterintuitively subjectivists claim but cannot substantiate that wires are directional and therefore give better sonic performance in one direction subjectivists often claim that home theater sound is inferior to high fidelity sound even though double blind tests have shown that this is wrong many subjectivists believe that the sound from records is superior to the sound from home theater subjectivists often look down on home theater sound even though many subjectivists accept fm radio as high fidelity  DVD High fidelity Sound recording Radio Compact disc Spark plug Musical Instrument Digital Interface Printed circuit board Electrical wiring Nintendo GameCube Phonograph MP3 Electrophysiology Gramophone record Windows XP Transistor Transformer Ethernet Appeal Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cable television Synthesizer Universal Serial Bus Oscilloscope Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Car audio Movie projector Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Causality Antenna (radio) Ceramics Coaxial cable Overhead lines IPod Telephone tapping Transmission line Circuit design WiMAX Action potential Headphones Television Postmodernism High-definition television High-voltage direct current Subwoofer Franz Boas Optical fiber Langmuir probe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Resistor Vacuum tube Digital Gas metal arc welding Microphone Audio data compression C plus plus XML Vorbis Solar power Information warfare Harp William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Morse Code Stereophonic sound Science Second language acquisition National Electrical Code (US) Electromagnetic radiation Podcasting Electronics Digital audio broadcasting Decibel IEEE 802.11 Scientific skepticism Wire Home cinema Modem Sound effect Nakamichi Sound design Engineering Visual Basic Mixtape Current (electricity) Explosive material DualDisc Tesla coil Alternating current Gross domestic product Floppy disk Jet engine

why do guitar amps with high wattage have head amps maybe i don't understand head amps exactly but when you look at guitar amps with low wattage they have the control switches and knobs attached to the amp however when you move onto taller amps with higher wattage why do they all have head amps that need to be attached couldn't manufacturers make all amps with the controls attached onto it can someone explain how a head amp also works some of them have a lower part that appears like a speaker is there a tiny speaker built in to it but why do some head amps like this http www musiciansbuy com mmmbcom images marshall avt h jpg appear to have a bit of space for what seems like a tiny speaker built in is there even one there how would you know what guitar amp and amp head combo you would go for it seems like a lot of mixing and matching that would be hard to try out i mean if let's say i get a marshall amp that comes with a head amp wouldn't that be the best choice for a head amp since it was basically built for that kind of amp this is a very good question but there are many parts to it guitar amp head are seperate from the cabnets speakers for a couple of reasons high wattage heads are more so designed to be taken on the road and amp heads are easier to carry then a huge heavy all in one unit second professional amp heads and cabinets can be interchangable for example maybe you like the quality of a marshal amp head but the sound quality of a mesa cabinet this can be done easily and third is cost a amp head almost always has a seperate price tag from the cabinet this allows you to do the second thing i mentioned and it makes the retailer a lot more money floor units or the all in one amps with the speakers built in are to us guitar players more of a means to practice without lugging around a huge half or full stack amp setup although there are a few amps liek this that have been played thourgh a lot for small venues such as the glorious fender twin amp heads work much in the way that a built in amp works in a all in one unit does the only differences is the power they draw and the amp circuit used to amplify the signal but these can amplify using one of many technologies such as all tube or all solid state or hybrid solid states use mosfit transistors to amplify sound tubes use ac bias and hybrids use a little bit of both  Marshall Amplification Electronic amplifier Instrument amplifier Operational amplifier Audiophile Electric guitar Vacuum tube Transistor Loudspeaker Guitar Oscilloscope Electrophysiology Central processing unit Kenwood Electronics Kirk Hammett Solar power Synthesizer Computer Valve sound Amplifier Bicycle lighting Effects unit Transformer Phonograph Clarinet John Myung XML Subwoofer Fender Telecaster Digital circuit Ampeg CPU design Semiconductor device Circuit design MP3 Electronic organ Bicycle frame Mesa Boogie Adam Jones Pump It Up Harmonica Optical fiber MOSFET Hard disk Microphone Electric motor Integrated circuit Modem Diode Violin PlayStation 3 DIY audio Extreme Programming Stevie Ray Vaughan Vacuum cleaner Mountain bike Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jack plug Double bass Jimi Hendrix Time Out of Mind Microeconomics Xbox Floppy disk Paintball Electrical wiring Thermal power station Decibel Strap-on dildo Poker jargon Impedance matching High-voltage direct current Drill bit Gramophone record Inflation Tire Bipolar junction transistor High fidelity DVD Spacecraft propulsion Analog computer Carburetor Car audio Eddie Van Halen Logic gate Dynamic random access memory BS 1363 Sport utility vehicle Trombone Printed circuit board Relay Atari 8-bit family Table saw

how do i wire a new traxxas transmitter and receiver to my battery and servos i have a traxxas receiver and a top qualifier transmitter and traxxas servos traxxas battery pack and yellow crystals from my receiver i have my battery and my two servos in the correct slots i put in my crystals and try it but nothing happens please tell me if there is a speacial way to put in the crystals or something else i assume both unit use the same xtal sometimes units use a xmit xtal and a rcv xtal verify that obviously if the xtals came with the unit and are not marked xmit and rcv then u are good to go if they are verify they are in the right unit u have things in the right slots verify that the battery is connected properly to to verify that power is turned on to both units xmit controls are centered if it still doesn't work the first thing to verify is power from the battery with the unit on under load then power on the boards that is a little harder the next thing to do is to see if u can get another xmit to drive the rcv and vise versa good luck  Crystal radio receiver Floppy disk Radio controlled airplane Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Protoss Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Laptop Radio Wire wrap Hybrid Synergy Drive Xbox Screw Liquid crystal display IP (complexity) Windows XP Crystal oscillator Solar cell Battery (electricity) Tesla coil Toyota Prius Thermostat SGI Indy Telephone exchange Vacuum tube Sega Manual transmission Transmitter Three-phase electric power Radio controlled car Circuit design Hybrid vehicle Xbox 360 Antenna (radio) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Electric motor Fox hunting IBM PC compatible Car handling Atari 8-bit family Cold fusion Bicycle lighting Advance Wars: Dual Strike Quantum Corporation 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Federal Standard 1037C Early IBM disk storage Nintendo GameCube Canon T90 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Wi-Fi Electrical generator System/36 Nintendo 64 Ford Ranger EV Light-emitting diode Interactive proof system USB flash drive Phase-locked loop Cellular network Atari ST Luck Computer forensics Aircraft flight control systems Voltage source Submarine Embedded system Telephone tapping Sega Saturn Nintendo Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Zerg Power Macintosh G3 Solar car Barbed wire Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Kasparov versus The World City of Heroes Electronic speed control Modem Missingno.

how can i determine quality of charge on my aa or aaa bateries meters always show corect voltage even when to some extent batteriy tester shows fully charged cells by how quickly it flicks to voltage voltage itself reads ok even when cells are nearlyu dead is there a method using meters to determine quality of charge nope i am assuming you are talking about the quality of charged rechargables and the answer is no there is no meter for this right off hand but there is a way to test it it voltage doesn't directly have anything to do with charge on a cell its only a consequance of constant load so a battery that is almost dead would have a slightly lower voltage then one with a full charge for batteries in most devices there is something called a dropoff voltage and depending on the device this can be not very low so batteries don't last long in these devices but its the draw of current that reduces the voltage and this can easily be determined by figuring out how much current the device draws then you devide the batteries max hourly current by this figure and if you get a lot less time then the batteries are advertised for then you know your batteries are not being charged properly  Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Circuit design Lithium ion battery Capacitor Oscilloscope Action potential Solar cell Nickel metal hydride Diode Volt Electrophysiology Voltage source Welding Transformer Electric motor Toyota Prius Wind turbine Vacuum tube Electricity meter Liquid crystal display Langmuir probe Direct current Bicycle lighting Electronic amplifier Membrane potential Battery electric vehicle Thermal power station Explosive material Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Electroshock gun Solar panel Three-phase electric power Voltmeter High-voltage direct current MOSFET Energy storage Extreme Programming Light-emitting diode Circuit breaker Impedance Memory effect Electrical generator Radiation hardening Renewable energy Hydrogen economy Hall effect Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Internal ballistics Variable Frequency Drive Uninterruptible power supply CMOS Oxygen sensor Digital photography Output impedance Microphone Peltier-Seebeck effect Loudspeaker Phase-locked loop Analog-to-digital converter Naval mine Lead-acid battery Thermostat Alternating current Airsoft Maxwell's equations M16 (rifle) Tesla coil Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hybrid vehicle Lithium ion polymer battery Fuel cell Spark plug Service life Semiconductor Wind power Electricity PlayStation Portable Firearm Galvanometer Logic families Universal Serial Bus Semiconductor device Hybrid Synergy Drive Flash memory Incandescent light bulb Power supply Switch Potentiometer Impedance matching Anode RC circuit Ohm's law

how come the volume button on a radio makes the sound go louder i am sure there is a very easy explanation for this but how does it work i have no idea you see you're asking a serious question so i'll give you a serious answer let's start with you how do you go louder answer you move a greater volume of air through your vocal chords want proof stand in front of a mirror with your mouth about an inch away and gently go hahahahahahahahahahahaha as gently and quietly as you can see any moisture on the mirror maybe a little but not much now repeat the experiment and this time go hahahahahahahahahahahaha as loudly as you can turn up the volume see the moisture on the glass proof positive that more air came through the volume control is well named because it refers to how much inside a radio the radio waves are converted into electrical impulses which vary in step with the radio wave and are connected by wires to a loud speaker actually the wires are connected to a magnet in the back of the speaker so that the magnetic field now varies in step with the electrical impulses the magnet in turn is near a piece of metal or other magnetic material which moves back and forth in step with the changing magnetic field so we now have electrical impulses turned into a mechanical action back and forth or in and out motion the last step is connection with the speaker cone made of thin material that pushes the air in front of it again in step with he magnetic material and we hear sound inside you your vocal chords are the speaker cone the wires connected to them are nerve cells running from your brain which sends electrical signals that duplicate the sound your brain wants you to make you also send signals to the lungs to apply a greater or lesser volume of air across the vocal chords to control loudness in the radio some of the electricity tells the speaker exactly what movements to make to reproduce a sound and some electricity tells the speaker how loud to make it send more electricity it gets louder send less and it gets softer its all about the volume of power being supplied in the radio the signals for what sound to make and the signals for how loud to make it all come into the speaker as one pulse of energy the exact ways of doing this vary from one piece of equipment to another in some the amplifier the part that sends out the power and pulses to the speaker runs wide open all the time the volume control acts like a flood gate that controls how much gets through to the speaker what happens to the unused power it turns into heat and is vented into the air in this method the volume control is really an attenuator which is to say a device that reduces power literally an attenuator that is off blocks nothing at all all the power gets through this is why old fashioned radios had volume control knobs that actually were hot to the touch otherwise some equipment actually builds up more power to make things louder the volume control tells the equipment to make more power i hope this helps for more detailed information and helpful illustrations see this http electronics howstuffworks com amplifier htm i hope this helps  Radar Oscilloscope Synthesizer Electric motor Sound recording Radio Light Electrophysiology Solar cell Welding Electronic amplifier Seismometer Spacecraft propulsion Digital circuit Circuit design Transistor Electric guitar Tesla coil Phonograph Violin Capacitor Digital Diode Hearing aid Audiophile Transmitter Movie projector Piezoelectricity Relay Gramophone record Floppy disk Stage lighting Electronic filter Nuclear magnetic resonance Decibel Switch Antenna (radio) Electrical wiring Sun Electronics Mouse (computing) Naval mine Audio level compression Functional magnetic resonance imaging Electricity Optical fiber Vacuum Coaxial cable Laser Carburetor Railgun Stereophonic sound Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Echo chamber Fluorescent lamp TGV Sound Lightning Directed-energy weapon Magnetic field Musical Instrument Digital Interface X10 (industry standard) Color Internal combustion engine Speed of light Fusion power Mixing console Electromagnetic radiation Federal Standard 1037C Alternating current Potentiometer Energy development Ethernet Semiconductor device Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Marching band Internal ballistics Effects unit Current (electricity) Resonance Urinary incontinence Electronic organ

how do you order channels on comcast digital cable ok technically my question is a lot more specific than that i am a big fan of military shows on the discovery channel i like the show combat zone in particular whose episodes are many times available for free via on demand however i was interested in watching the military channel when i go to the channel it says i am not authorized to watch it leading me to believe i must order the channel it says hit info button for ordering information i hit the info button and it comes to a screen describing the show that's currently airing on the channel however none of the options presented are related to ordering the channel or unlocking it if anyone has had this problem in the past or to those who just know how to solve it please help thanks in advance thanks for the answers though i don't really get the relevance of the first one the general consensus seems to be to call comcast and order the channel s however does this cost anything and if so how much you don't unlock it you call comcast and ask to buy the package that the military channel comes with sorry as of now you can not just buy channel at a time  Cable television Bluetooth Comcast Television in the United States Wheel of Fortune TiVo Digital television Public-key cryptography $ale of the Century OLN Home Box Office High-definition television Mouse (computing) Xbox 360 Oscilloscope Hollywood Squares MTV2 Advance Wars: Dual Strike News program MMORPG MapleStory DVD AmigaOS MTV Jams Media in Canada Dish Network Nintendo GameCube ITV Pump It Up Macromedia Flash Let's Make a Deal Whose Line Is It Anyway?

is it possible to use a way antenna splitter in this situation i am in college and am about to room with someone that i don't know i've tried contacting her multiple times but she won't get back to me so i was wondering about using a way signal splitter i've heard of other students doing this my only concern is whether we would be able to watch seperate channels at the same time the dorms have cable but no box it just plugs into the wall like regular antenna would this be a problem anything is much appreciated that should be ok the cable sounds like it uses the tuner in your tv to set change the channels the only concern would be if the signal were degraded by being split try it out and see if the signal is too bad and you get very poor picture quality you can purchase an amplifier at radio shack or other places for under most likely tho it will be no problem at all  Cable television Audiophile Television Coaxial cable High-definition television Antenna (radio) Wi-Fi SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Modem Loudspeaker Digital Subscriber Line Radar Microphone Digital television Impedance matching Oscilloscope XERF DVD Home Box Office Federal Communications Commission High fidelity Software-defined radio Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Musical Instrument Digital Interface Amateur radio Radio Gramophone record Set-top box TiVo Ethernet TV-FM DX Freeview Sound reinforcement system Satellite television Federal Standard 1037C NTSC Crystal radio receiver Code division multiple access RS-232 DMX (lighting) Global System for Mobile Communications Decibel Digital cable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jack plug Kenwood Electronics Diplexer Transmitter Electrophysiology WWOR-TV Cellular network Sound recording Citizens' band radio Analog signal Bluetooth Television in the United States Receiver (radio) Electronic amplifier Electric guitar Composite video Aliasing Stereophonic sound ANT1 Ultra high frequency Advanced Technology Attachment Wavelength-division multiplexing Sound card S-Video FM broadcasting Sound Blaster Foxtel Wardenclyffe Tower Atari 8-bit family Audio data compression TGV Remote control Satellite dish Mixing console Universal Serial Bus Escape from New York Headphones Wireless access point Pirate decryption IEEE 802.11 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Laserdisc Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how can you tell whether you need a battery or if the charger is faulty for a power tool great question i'll say this first batteries will die out way more often before the chargers ever do that being said let's try to figure this out you can try charging that same battery with a different charger that you may have in the house that is from another power tool the conditions that need to be met in order for another charger to qualify as good enough for that battery is that the battery end of the charger must fit the battery obvious the output voltage a number followed by v or volts printed on the primary charger must match that on the secondary testing charger the output current a number followed by a or amps printed on the primary charger must match that on the secondary testing charger if the battery receives a full charge from that testing charger then we know it is the primary charger is faulty if it doesn't then of course the battery is the problem now if you don't have another charger that matches the above criteria then i suggest banking on the fact that batteries almost always die before chargers and buying a new battery even if it turns out to be the charger if it can't fully charge the new battery at least you'll have a new second battery that can come in very handy i hope that helps  Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Transformer Volt Battery electric vehicle Ford Ranger EV Electric boat Circuit design Hybrid vehicle San Diego Chargers Oscilloscope Hubble Space Telescope Operational amplifier CMOS Universal Serial Bus PlayStation Portable Electrophysiology Electronic amplifier Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Solar cell Three-phase electric power Lead-acid battery Wind power Incandescent light bulb Vacuum tube Toyota Prius Digital circuit Turbocharger GED Electrical generator Nuclear fusion Wind turbine Diode Airsoft Cincinnati Bengals Dodge Charger Electricity Output impedance Impedance matching Capacitor Memory effect Welding power supply Liquid crystal display Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Baghdad Battery Voltage source Headlight Electroshock gun Action potential Dan Fouts Laptop Solar panel Decibel New York Giants Oakland Raiders Lithium ion battery Dosimeter Renewable energy Welding Thermostat RS-232 Lithium ion polymer battery Hall effect Relay Thermal power station Blasting cap Monetary policy Extreme Programming Windmill Jumpstart 3rd Grade Fluorescent lamp Direct current Life insurance Telephone exchange New York Jets Electrical element Spark plug Solar car 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines MOSFET Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pittsburgh Steelers Negligible Autism Phantom power Ampere Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Compiler optimization Loudspeaker Membrane potential Radio controlled car Education in the People's Republic of China ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity

anyone have links or know where to get atm service operation manuals assuming you're talking about atm machines here and not some other acronym atm obviously all service operator manuals start at the manufacturer but how they get into your hands may not be so simple most manufacturers will not sell direct they sell to distributors and service companies your best chance at finding a manual is to call the manufacturer first ask if they will sell one direct if so great however most likely you'll have to settle for asking them for some distributors ask for more than one distributor get to names of distributors and try contacting them for your manuals also you could try asking whoever services your atm to see if they would know how to get you one it's all about making the right connections and being patient  Automatic teller machine Asynchronous Transfer Mode Siphon Embedded system Postage stamp Amway Windows XP Distributor Manual transmission BMW NEC Corporation Citigroup Popular, Inc First-sale doctrine Enigma machine Carburetor Edison Records Cisco Systems NASDAQ Business Symbolics Call centre Digital Subscriber Line Bank of China (Hong Kong) Credit card fraud Domain Name System Elevator Ethernet Tax Grey market MetroCard Telephone Xerox Marvel Comics Alcatel Inventory Pinball Copy protection Frame relay Central processing unit RISC Serial communications PowerPC Teletraffic Engineering in Broadband Networks Spark plug Vending machine Telephone exchange Broadband Networks Expressnet Congestion control 7-Eleven BIOS Multiprotocol Label Switching UNIVAC Laserdisc Ibanez Digital Equipment Corporation PolyGram EFTPOS Saab Automobile Traffic contract Acorn Computers TransLink (Brisbane) MTR W H Smith X.25 Enterprise content management ATM Adaptation Layers Private branch exchange Gas metal arc welding IBM PC compatible Japanese toilet Warranty Air traffic control Audi Economy of the Republic of Ireland Wolseley plc GNU General Public License Krag-J__rgensen Coffin Trademark Canadian National Railway Smart card Garbage collection (computer science) Discover Card Genetic algorithm NCR Corporation Virtual Network Computing Btrieve Diving regulator Operating system International Computers Ltd TiVo Commodore 64 TLA Unix Konica Minolta Rebreather Acronym and initialism Ignition system

comcast cable subscirbers does comcast cable suck as bad in your area as they do in mine ma we have digital cable and our service is constantly interrupted for one reason or another frozen screen pixelated picture continuous outages etc we've exchanged the boxes numerous times and we've had more service calls than i can remember and each time we get the same stock conclusion from the service person your cable should be fine now in my dreams unfortunately comcast is the only cable company in our area so switching to another service isn't an option does anyone else suffer from the same crappy service btw we tried dishtv also not an option because of our location the signal was terrible i live in ct service is o k i just wish they would carry nesn so i could see red sox games and not keep changing channel lineup  Cable television TiVo FSN (Fox Sports Net) Atari 8-bit family Comcast Television Digital video recorder Digital television Telephone Boston Red Sox Dish Network Satellite television Freeview ATSC High-definition television RGB color model KQED Pixel Digital photography Public Switched Telephone Network Telegraphy KING-TV Sony Pictures Entertainment News program SCART Original Amiga chipset Commercial broadcasting NEC Corporation Telephone exchange Red Sox Nation Home Box Office Amstrad CPC Digital Subscriber Line Atari 2600 Media in Canada Xbox 360 Oscilloscope Voice over IP Canadian Broadcasting Corporation PlayStation Portable Digital cable GSM services Federal Standard 1037C TechTV Television in the United States ITU-T Telephone tapping Broadband Internet access WSBK-TV Public Broadcasting Service DVD Ethernet Channel 4 News Corporation Nintendo GameCube Bluetooth Missingno.

iwant to hook up a marine radio to my rock speakers do i need a converter for this if i need a converter where can i purchase a cabinet to hold the marine radio and converter it shouldn't be a problem to plug the speakers directly into the radio to be sure check the owner's manual for your radio to determine what the speaker output impedance is it should be either or ohms i'm guessing that your rock speakers are ohm if that is the case simply connect both speakers in parallel to the jack that plugs into the radio  Loudspeaker Electrophysiology Circuit design Transformer Nominal impedance Impedance Modem Output impedance Resistor Ohm's law Spark plug Commodore 64 IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Telephone exchange Ethernet Transmission line Capacitor S-Video Atari ST Advanced Technology Attachment Input impedance Enterprise content management Coaxial cable Operational amplifier Audio power SCSI RCA connector Electrical resistance Jack plug Voltage source Decibel Desktop computer Current source TRS connector Antenna (radio) ALOHAnet Ohm Damping factor Membrane potential DMX (lighting) Speaker of the British House of Commons Microphone Software-defined radio Oscilloscope Universal Serial Bus Audio crossover Electronic amplifier Manual transmission Common Unix Printing System Carburetor United States House of Representatives Battery electric vehicle XERF Audiophile RC circuit Parliament of Canada Classic rock Bose Corporation Burglar alarm Computer bus Series and parallel circuits Low voltage differential signaling Seismometer Presidential system Atari 8-bit family Computer hardware Reflection seismology RLC circuit TIA-568A/B Fluorescent lamp Acorn Electron Residual-current device Motor oil Electrical network Compiler optimization Xbox RL circuit Phoneme Artificial neural network Sound Blaster D-subminiature Two-stroke cycle Subwoofer Btrieve Enigma machine Sinclair ZX81 Congress of the United States Bass guitar CPU cache BS 1363 Lord Chancellor De Lorean DMC-12 Alternating current Automatic transmission Bombe Marine aquarium Headphones

can you charge the new ipod shuffle through your lap top and if u can how do you know it is charging when i plug my new ipod shuffle into my lap top all it does is blink the orange dot how do i know if its charging and when it is charged i already looked at the manual and i think im stupid all usb ports are energized at volts any device you can usb charge should be able to charge just the same on yoru laptop as your desktop but some internal hubs lack the current to properly charge usb devices please be advised though that each port can usually give out ma when charging or powering a device and if your laptop is running on battery this can help dry the battery in your laptop really fast i charge my iaudio x l on my notebook all the time it takes a very very long time because my mp player has a hour battery but it works in a pinch or to just top off the battery  Laptop Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive Apple Macintosh IPod shuffle Digital audio player IMac Hard disk Floppy disk FireWire Battery (electricity) Volt Lithium ion battery IPod mini Desktop computer Computer bus Apple Computer Desknote Flash memory IPod nano Windows XP PowerPC History of Microsoft Windows PowerBook Cowon IBM PC compatible Musical Instrument Digital Interface AlphaSmart Oscilloscope Nickel metal hydride Redundant array of independent disks IBook Mouse (computing) USB mass storage device class Game Boy Serial ATA Secure Digital card Personal computer Sharp Zaurus PlayStation Portable Creative Zen IPod photo Archos Xbox 360 Jack plug Battery electric vehicle Bluetooth Vacuum tube Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Apple Newton Toyota Prius SCSI Lighter Game Boy Advance SP ITunes Mobile computing Embedded system Dongle Wi-Fi Pentium M Computer hardware Touchpad Computer Thermal power station Creative Nomad PC card Closed-circuit television Extension Cord CompactFlash Parallel port ThinkPad Diode ACCESS.bus Pac-Man CMOS Wearable computer RS-232 Digital photography Danger Hiptop Three-phase electric power Incandescent light bulb Metroid Prime Plug-and-play Nintendo DS Softmodem Capacitor Electricity Handspring Vorbis Solar cell Game Boy Advance ITunes Music Store High-voltage hazards Sega ReactOS

flat cable help i'd be impressed if any one knows what i'm talking about i have a yamaha rs and i just got the aieb expansion board the first step in installation is to unplug the flat cable out of its connecter how do i do that flat cable or ribbon cable will most likely look like several wires next to each other in a neat row side by side usually grey in color but this can vary at both ends it should have a plastic connector for wider cables this is usually similar to molex keep in mind though that ribbon cable can also be a totally flat solid conductor in this case usually it should be brown or green in color and the end of the cable snap or slide into small plastic recepticles if this is the case review your intructions because these can be set in place by friction alone or with a clasp similar to the clasp on a all metal watch if you have the latter of these cables then the ends should have small brass conductors similar to what you would see on an old nes cartridge these are also prone to tearing so please be careful  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Drill bit Atari 8-bit family Ethernet Ribbon cable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Coaxial cable IPod BS 1363 25-pair color code Television TIA-568A/B Typewriter SCART Floppy disk Xbox Ground and neutral Amstrad CPC IBM Selectric typewriter Seismic retrofit Spark plug High-voltage direct current Advanced Technology Attachment Solar cell Wire Bassoon Zipper Power cable Guitar Internal ballistics Universal Serial Bus Handloading Oscilloscope Loudspeaker Terminal ballistics Fuse (electrical) D-subminiature Transformer Glass Sega Saturn Circuit design Enigma machine Serial ATA Knitting Category 5 cable Printed circuit board Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Space elevator Electric power transmission Rail terminology Harp Casting Microphone DVD Skateboarding trick Welding Violin Marching band Jack plug Arcade cabinet Explosive material Trombone Super Nintendo Entertainment System Masonry Bicycle brake systems Mouse (computing) Dog agility Lightning rod Overhead powerline Gramophone record PlayStation Portable Earring RS-232 Computer cooling Electricity pylon Commodore 64 Glossary of climbing terms Saxophone Sinclair ZX81 RCA connector Sundial PlayStation 2 USB flash drive Game Boy Advance Optical fiber Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Antenna (radio) Electricity meter Dice Game Boy Material properties of diamond Three-phase electric power Plastic Dot matrix printer Rail tracks

digital radios are said to use ten times more electricity than the old analogues why what exactly is taking the extra power is this because we are in the infancy of digital or will we be stuck w ever more power hungry equipment w tv's i understand plasmas are ludicrously inefficient due to the screen technology is the rf stage also eating up exponentially more power as in digital radios is this likely to improve or is it a giant leap backwards in power and resource conservation if this is correct the amount of power used over a ten year life span of a digital radio would cost you more than buying many analogue sets that for all intents and purposes sound exactly the same and have other reception advantages over digital as well you might want to keep an eye on this if you think analogue mean tube or valve sets the brand new digital sets have been quoted as using times the power of modern solid state sets still being produced you might want to keep an eye on this if you think analogue mean tube or valve sets the brand new digital sets have been quoted as using times the power of modern solid state sets still being produced thanks for sending the further info below further research leads me to conclude that this is largely eco scare mongering and that although digital rf stages consume around watts compared to watts this in itself is insignificant from edward b subject re by analogue i didn't mean ancient valves message how many watts per channel is the amplifier capable of this has an awful lot to do with the rating as well if the older radio is rated for only watts output watts per channel and the newer radio is rated for watts per channel there will be a huge difference in how they perform as to power consumption the front end of a digital radio will draw a bit more current than a standard superheterodyne analog unit the complexity of the digital units would be the culprit there it takes more power to operate the front end asic fec and audio decoder circuits before the signal is actually analog from there the pre amplifier and power amplifier would com the digital radios are much more efficient than their valve tube counterparts vast strides were made with solid state especially where power consumption was concerned we have had to take a step backward to get digital since the processing chip sets are operating at extremely fast data speeds this causes the chip sets to consume more power with the advent of the volt cmos complimentary metal oxide semiconductor as opposed to the older volt cmos or even volt ttl transistor transistor logic chip sets we should see the power consumption of these unit come more in line with what the older solid state units did as with any newer technology there is a learning curve in this instance it has been very steep since we have already learned several valuable lessons with digital video in your case sky in our case directv and dishnet the older systems for these were hot and very inefficient the newer versions are cooler and more efficient they are not where we want them to be but we are getting there as with any high speed data transfer there is going to be a tremendous amount of heat simply due to the fact that the chip set is executing several million commands per second i own a pioneer xm radio system of the first generation the last generation delphi consumes approximately the power to get the same job done for example that also does not take into account the power capability of the amplifier stage obviously a higher powered amp will consume more power than a low powered amp  Digital photography Gramophone record Kenwood Electronics Laserdisc Solar cell DVD Radio Application-specific integrated circuit Logic families Fuel injection Electrophysiology MP3 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Hard disk Bass guitar Synthesizer Teletext Resistor Floppy disk PlayStation 3 Movie projector Decibel Welding Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Original Amiga chipset Sound recording Bicycle lighting Electronics Electric motor Dynamic random access memory Atari 8-bit family ITU-T Compact disc High-voltage direct current Digital Cable television Television Wind power Sound Blaster Digital audio broadcasting Nuclear power Radiation hardening Amplifier Bluetooth Carburetor IBM PC compatible Software-defined radio Digital-to-analog converter History of computing hardware Amstrad CPC Capacitor Universal Serial Bus Code division multiple access Spacecraft propulsion DV Super Nintendo Entertainment System Future energy development Fluorescent lamp X10 (industry standard) Embedded system Laser Lighting Cray-1 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tesla coil Redundant array of independent disks Diesel engine Brewery

which duracell batteries in general last longer and why i am enquiring into the distinction between the following products duracell plus duracell ultra m is there any distinction i've seen duracell plus sell for at a budgens by contrast i was able to pick up the duracell ultra m batteries which also indicate the power left in the battery for at a nearby newsagents so which has more power plus or ultra m right from their web site duracell ultra m has been specifically formulated to meet the demands of the latest high powered devices duracell ultra m makes the music last longer much longer the uk s number one battery brand offers reliable long lasting power for your household devices such as toys clocks remotes or torches as u see above every battery type from a single mfg is optimized for a specific job going from mfg to mfg their equivalent usage type may be better than another then u must make sure u are getting freshly mfg units they loose capacity sitting around ymmv so all u can really do is experiment yourself i don't take anybody word for something because i don't know how they came to their conclusion test methodology makes a difference like my car gets mpg while yours only gets mpg oh did i mention i ran it at a constant mph and u ran yours at a varying average of mph with stops and starts and fully loaded  Hybrid vehicle Toyota Prius IPod Digital photography Hybrid Synergy Drive Bicycle lighting Nickel-cadmium battery Grid energy storage Wind power Universal Serial Bus Renewable energy Windows XP Global Gillette Solar cell E85 Crayola Personal rapid transit Overclocking Fuel cell M16 (rifle) Central processing unit Procter & Gamble Solar power GeForce 6 Series Radeon IMac Locomotive Constitution Explosive material Energy development Laptop Electrical generator Transistor TGV Compiler optimization Welding Carburetor Embedded system Sport utility vehicle Wayne Corporation Internal combustion engine Automobile Honda Civic Light-emitting diode Lincoln LS Biodiesel Fixed-wing aircraft Crash test dummy RISC General Dynamics F-111 Manual transmission Energy storage Airsoft Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Pentium M Heinkel He 100 Non-native pronunciations of English Radio controlled car Heinkel He 112 Messerschmitt Bf 109 Hard disk PlayStation Portable Transformer Parody advertisement Field-programmable gate array Carbine Wi-Fi USB flash drive GED Color Doomsday argument Enigma machine Baseball Thermal power station Elevator Project Nike Xbox 360 O scale Internal ballistics Fuel injection Headlight Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bluetooth Windows 2000 De Lorean DMC-12 Diode ZGMF-1017 GINN IBM PC compatible RFID Transformers: Robots in Disguise MP3 Apple Computer Celeron Hydrogen vehicle Peugeot 505

loose scart cable on my portable tv the scart cables are loose and cause the picture and sound to go fuzzy resulting in repeated jiggling and frustration some answers on here suggest replacing the socket how easy is this and does it entail taking the tv apart thanks if it is in the actual set that the connector is loose you would be better off having a tech service it based on the repair time it would be relatively inexpensive the high voltages and current in a tv make it dangerous for a rookie to attempt a repair call a local shop to see what they would charge you  SCART Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Oscilloscope Welding DVD RCA connector Universal Serial Bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Television Commodore 64 Nintendo Entertainment System Ethernet Jack plug RS-232 Microphone D-subminiature SAM Coup__ Arc welding Fuse (electrical) Set-top box Xbox 360 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets S-Video Radiation hardening Vacuum tube High-voltage direct current Digital circuit Amstrad CPC Action potential Digital television Computer Lineman (occupation) Impedance PlayStation Portable Tesla coil Composite video Power cord Membrane potential Extension Cord Phantom power Submarine communications cable Home cinema Sega Saturn Dimmer Weight training Audiophile Direct current Parallel port Cathode ray tube Nintendo GameCube Gas metal arc welding Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Battery electric vehicle Personal computer Ribbon cable Commodore 128 Atari 2600 Earthing system PC Engine Lithium ion battery Broadband Internet access Bicycle frame Digital Subscriber Line Electrical wiring (UK) Advanced Technology Attachment Incandescent light bulb IPod Fluorescent lamp National Electrical Code (US) Glossary of climbing terms Game port SCSI Operational amplifier Floppy disk Circuit design IBM PC compatible Gender of connectors and fasteners Loudspeaker Computer bus Three-phase electric power Harp Synthesizer Battery (electricity) Transformer Cable television Bicycle lighting Electric power transmission Light-emitting diode Telephone exchange Electrical generator Scientology beliefs and practices Drill bit Traditional animation CPU design Laptop Atari ST Electronics Ground and neutral Logic

sandisk sansa e who has one and what do you think of it i was attracted to this mp player because it has gb of flash memory and its only i have a few questions to anyone who owns one or knows about it it has a microsd slot is there a limit on the size of the card i will probably get a gb to start with will it support hd sd cards what is the actual battery life on this unit does it have playlist setup features like the ipod can i use it with itunes just let me know what you like dont like pros and cons of this device im looking for a replacement for my gb nano how would you compare this device to an ipod nano in my opinion its more bang for the buck considering the nano is for an gb model do you think the sansa is better how is the sound quality i have an e which is the gb version i actually chose it over the nano because it was cheaper at the time i was coming off a rio chiba and all my music is in wma format going to apple would've necessitated converting all my music to aac to be played on the nano the sansa will not work with itunes would be nice if it could but apple probably won't let that happen the battery life is pretty good i only kept track of it once and it was like hours i use it during my afternoon commute and a couple of evenings a week and only charge it about every two weeks about microsdhc i answered another question about this and found that sandisk plans on releasing a new firmware for the sansa connect a different model that will support microsdhc so it's within the realm of possibility microsdhc could come to the e series from what i have found the biggest microsd card you can use is gb in a year of ownership i haven't needed to use a microsd card in fact i am only using gb but i'm weird i use the fm radio periodically i have used the fm radio recorder twice i have used the voice recorder once and only to see if it worked the sansa e series plays video it is easy to use sandisk's software to convert the video to the motion jpeg format the player uses but it is hard to get video in the first place all videos and podcasts seem to be made with the ipod in mind so it's hard to get that content for a sansa i ended up having to screenscrape a video by using camstudio and that technique doesn't always work so the extra features are nice but not all that useful the sansas are good players but i think if someone is already using an ipod they should probably stick with apple  IPod nano Walkman Vorbis Apple Computer Digital audio player MP3 FairPlay Podcasting Secure Digital card IPod shuffle PlayStation Portable Apple Macintosh Flash memory QuickTime Online music store Floppy disk Disc jockey Nintendo DS Atari ST Digital rights management Atari 8-bit family IMac Memory Stick USB flash drive Apple IIGS Gramophone record CompactFlash Sound Blaster Archos Verizon Wireless H.264/MPEG-4 AVC FireWire Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DVD Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mouse (computing) Game Boy Apple II family SonicStage Winamp MiniDisc Xbox PlayStation 3 Radeon Advanced Audio Coding Video game music Rhapsody (online music service) Windows Vista RealNetworks Computer Apple Newton Music radio Amiga ATI Technologies Poker jargon Macromedia Flash Extreme Programming Multimedia Card Laptop Tungsten Handheld Apple typography PC Engine IPAQ Memory card High-definition television Redundant array of independent disks SmartMedia Nintendo 64 We Belong Together Commodore 64 Sound card Computer and video games Game controller PlayStation 2 PowerBook Iriver Musical Instrument Digital Interface WNNX (FM) Laserdisc This Week in Tech Streaming media Handheld game console System 7 (Macintosh) Common Unix Printing System Slot machine Creative Nomad Universal Serial Bus Sega Dreamcast

someone help me please i got an orange d mobile phone about months ago and its been working fine until hour ago it has medium to full signal but wont let me send or receive texts or phone calls when you try it says emergency calls only and error when sending texts i have not had the phone unlocked or anything like that done to it and i have tried moving to a different place went out side and the signal went from medium to full but the display says limited service is its dialing password locked turn off this feature as it can cause this problem in some phones most likely the sim card subscriber information module has become disconnected because it is slipping in the little holder you may have dropped the phone remove the sim module which is usually under the battery which you have to remove first and slide it back in gently if this happens a lot place a small piece of electrical tape over the end of the sim card to keep it in place once the sim is in its location and working the sim card could also be dirty or have moisture around it causing a bad connection remove the battery and sim card as above put a small dab of rubbing alcohol on a clean cloth and then wipe the connections on the sim card the non labeled side with the cloth wipe the matching connections on the phone with a dry part of the cloth keeps damaging liquids out of the equation here replace the sim properly oriented in its place put the battery back in and turn on the phone hopefully now it works repeat when you have problems this problem is common to phones kept in people's pockets due to the higher humidity next to one's person  Global System for Mobile Communications Bluetooth Telephone tapping Modem Federal Standard 1037C Radio Battery (electricity) Telephone exchange Mobile phone Emergency telephone number IPod Gmail Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting UK telephone numbering plan 9-1-1 Surveillance Nintendo DS Voice over IP Musical Instrument Digital Interface Universal Mobile Telecommunications System N-Gage Oscilloscope Transformer The Sims 2 Telephone numbering plan Ethernet Wi-Fi Mattress Digital Subscriber Line Subscriber Identity Module Digital photography Atari 8-bit family Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Electric motor Gramophone record The Inside Floppy disk Password Universal Serial Bus Diode Textile manufacturing Apollo Command/Service Module Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Caller ID Malware Machinima Broadband Internet access Laptop Teletext Windows XP Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Toyota Prius Amateur radio Poker jargon Dual-tone multi-frequency MSN Messenger Nickel-cadmium battery Morse Code Global Positioning System RFID Virgin Mobile Pirate decryption Verizon Wireless USB flash drive Baseball Vostok 1 BlackBerry Embedded system 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Pottery Color National Weather Service Cellular network Electrophysiology IPAQ Switch Television The Sims 2: University Jack plug Apollo 13 Calculator Johnny 5 Strap-on dildo History of computing hardware Magnet DeviantART Internet fraud Apollo 15 Urinary incontinence Smart card Solar cell History of radio DVD

circuit city price matching how do i price match something at circuit city that i found at best buy for cheaper you need to bring in proof right well what do i bring the item isn't currently in stock at best buy so i can't bring in a receipt and its not featured in a sale circular so i can't bring that what i have done in the past is to go to the retailer's website and get a print out of the item with the price i know the competiting retailer will honor that type of comparison if the internet pricing is different then there's really nothing else you can do hope this helps  Amazon.com Auction Argos (retailer) Retailer Arbitrage FairTax Wal-Mart UK Singles Chart Best Buy Sears Holdings Corporation Price discrimination NASDAQ Airsoft Computer and video games Day trading Surplus value Paintball W H Smith Tesco Mac OS X Solar cell Bulk vending Mutual fund Economy of India Electronic commerce Stock Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Citigroup Internet fraud Commodity RuneScape economy Neopets Digital photography Great Depression Law of value $ale of the Century Rebate (marketing) Apple Macintosh Taxation in the United States United States Postal Service Overclocking Penn effect Money supply Telstra Publishing Advertising Suggested retail price Transformer Topps Discounts and allowances New York Stock Exchange Capital accumulation Video game crash of 1983 Konfabulator Gold as an investment System/36 Stock market Fair use System/34 Mortgage Microsoft Microeconomics Quake III Arena Nintendo Magic: The Gathering Computer Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 First-sale doctrine Windows Server 2003 Video game publisher Nintendo DS The Apprentice 2 Technical analysis Online shop Eaton's De Lorean DMC-12 Legal research Textbook Plastic Marketing Fry's Electronics Temasek Holdings United Kingdom corporation tax Rational pricing Boots Group RFID DVD Liberty Dollar Prices of production USB flash drive Berkshire Hathaway Utility cycling Sam Walton C plus plus DIY audio Mac OS X v10.4 The Price Is Right Warez Loss leader

what is the difference between a neon sign and a led sign i plan on placing a sign on the window the sun shines a lot on the window what would be better to get what is the difference please help thank you so would you go with a http www signwholesale com product info php cpath products id or b http www jantecneon com mm merchant mvc or c http www signwholesale com product info php products id as far as visibility goes both are highly visible neon has a nostalgia about it so if your business is also nostalgic i suggest neon neon is more expensive and requires proper maintenance when it goes bad led signs would probably be recycled if they went bad after the warranty unless you can purchase a maintenance agreement neon is a gas lamp which requires a high voltage ballast to light the ballast is similar to the ones used in flourescent lighting the ballast will require service and the neon tube itself might need service from time to time if it gets cracked this requires someone who knows how to work on this kind of sign led signs use what are called light emitting diodes light emitting diodes have a very long life compared to other kinds of lamps the best way to protect an led display is to keep the lettering moving or flash the display periodically don't just leave it lit steadily unless you don't wish to change the message on it led displays do have one drawback their electronics are more likely to be damaged by power spikes than the neon circuits would so the led display should be used with an appropriate surge protector or in a building with surge protection built into the breaker box for the led display make sure there is a high brightness to it and good contrast in other words brightly lit leds on a pitch black colored background red and orange colored leds or changing colors such as red yellow and green would probably get the most attention  Fluorescent lamp Lighting Diode Incandescent light bulb Traffic light Vacuum tube Bicycle lighting Neon Laser Color Plasma display Compact fluorescent lamp Neon lamp Cathode ray tube Neon sign Electrodeless lamp Light Mouse (computing) Fluorescence Solar power Liquid crystal display Welding Semiconductor device Stage lighting Oscilloscope Xenon flash lamp Organic light-emitting diode Mercury-vapor lamp Transformer Ultraviolet Solar cell Photoelectric effect Aurora (astronomy) Christmas lights Relay Fuse (electrical) Helium Xenon Light pollution Laser diode Rail terminology Sodium vapor lamp Geissler tube Color temperature Spark gap Ballast (electrical) Ceramics Transmitter Digital Solar variation Black body Service life Circuit breaker Circuit design Fire alarm control panel Nuclear power Operational amplifier Street light Gallium arsenide Plasma (physics) Electric light High-voltage direct current Sega Saturn Pedestrian crossing Electronic amplifier Transistor Spacecraft propulsion Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gamut Piccadilly Circus Radiation hardening Citgo Infrared Battery electric vehicle Animal communication Light gun Color blindness Railway signal Current source Ionizing radiation Gmail Enigma machine Phosphorus Thermographic camera United States dollar Haloalkane Flashlight Game Boy Diamond

who to seek for diagnosing repairing vintage stereo unit's sound months ago i inherited grundig fleetwood stereo system made sometime around the early to mid s in germany from my great grandmother who passed away in december it has an am fm radio a turntable for s s s as well as many sound preset buttons including an option for stereo sound and the speakers line the bottom portion of the unit the physical unit itself is in amazing condition and has not been used in the last years for anything other than a table decoration piece i was amazed to see that the radio still works on the stereo producing very clear reception however the sound fades in and out during play it starts off strong clear and loud then slowly fades out only to slowly reach its original volume again after several seconds we have not be successful in getting the turntable to work but i am more concerned with sound who do you think i should seek to look into this problem for me and potentially repair it so the stereo can be enjoyed again any decent audio repair shop should be able to help you if the unit hasn't been on for over years some of the capacitors may have dried out or the electrolytic may have deformed it's probably a tube unit and some of the tubes could be showing their age switch contacts could have oxidized over the years and need cleaning the turntable has rubber drive parts that have probably deteriorated  Gramophone record Phonograph Audiophile Radio Oscilloscope Microphone Compact disc Capacitor plague Disc jockey Stereophonic sound Synthesizer IPod Loudspeaker 8-track cartridge Arcade cabinet Sound recording De Lorean DMC-12 Receiver (radio) Vacuum tube Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Toyota Prius Digital audio broadcasting Violin FM broadcasting N-Gage Pinball Floppy disk Transistor High fidelity Car audio Bass guitar Tony Banks (musician) Computer Guitar Multitrack recording Battery (electricity) Explosive material Bong Tire USS Thresher (SS-200) Wheel of Fortune Nintendo Entertainment System Movie projector Laserdisc Mixing console Urinary incontinence Atari ST Prank flash Central processing unit Capacitor Jack plug Digital audio workstation USS Trigger (SS-237) Transformer Unusual types of gramophone record Sound effect Switch USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Wood Phonograph cylinder Thermal power station Game Boy Circuit design Dairy Seismic retrofit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tesla coil Electric motor Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Mercury Atlas 6 Panasonic House music USS Tunny (SS-282) DIY audio Apple IIGS The Beatles discography Harp ZX Spectrum USS Whale (SS-239) Sega Saturn The Jam Effects pedal Upholstery Rod Stewart Heinkel He 112 Ceramics Japanese toilet 8 mm video format John Cage Sound Blaster Electronic amplifier MiniDisc Titanium Echo chamber Nakamichi Walkman Sampling (music) Electric guitar

technical question about my stereo i have a disc rca stereo i know not great but it's a decent little unit the problem is it was working fine one day then the next time i don't know how long it was i went to play a cd no sound whatsoever it looks like it's playing the tracks but nothing on the radio tapes etc i thought maybe it was the speakers so i tried a different set still nothing i may have had some power outages someone suggested that they may have blown my transistors whatever those are the stereo is only years old i want to know if it would be worth taking it to a shop to have someone look at it fix it the unit cost about i know that's not much but right now i can't afford to buy a new one any advice from anyone the speakers it came with were the ones not working but also tested them with a different set of speakers still no sound i assume that there is some indication on the panel that it is reading the disc track track time whatever that would indicate a problem other than in the drive mechanism or control circuitry the transistors referred to are the audio output devices it there is no noise from the speakers at full volume level that is it that could cost more than have the value of the unit for each part alone look for a tech friend or another unit  Gramophone record Stereophonic sound Vacuum tube Phonograph Compact disc Compact audio cassette Floppy disk Digital circuit DVD Mixing console IBM 1620 Electronic amplifier Jack plug Sound Blaster Operational amplifier VHS High fidelity Amstrad CPC Walkman Atari 8-bit family Central processing unit Oscilloscope Audiophile Synthesizer Movie projector 8 mm video format Sega CD MiniDisc Quadraphonic The Pet Sounds Sessions Microphone Television Electric motor MP3 Nintendo Entertainment System Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting CPU design Transistor radio Audio system measurements XERF CMOS Sony Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Universal Serial Bus The Beatles discography Effects unit Acorn Electron RCA Hard disk Relay IPod Phonograph cylinder Videocassette recorder Copy protection Liquid crystal display Logic gate USB flash drive RCA connector Pet Sounds Amplifier Electronics Analog-to-digital converter Automobile Kenwood Electronics Marshall Amplification MOSFET A Day in the Life PlayStation 3 NTSC Disk storage Mixtape Redundant array of independent disks Player piano Transformer Effects pedal Xbox 360 Moore's law Karaoke Semiconductor device Grateful Dead Radio Magnetic cartridge Apple IIGS Dolby Laboratories Embedded system Microprocessor Sinclair Research Ltd Chicago (band)

my central air run capacitor went out it was volts microfarads can i use a capacitor with v mf anyways bottom line will a volt micro farad work it takes a volt micro farad capacitor its hot and i want to know if this will work till tommarrow ac motor capacitors in general you may make substitutions for oil filled run capacitors on permanent split capacitor psc motors by going to the next higher standard or stock microfarad rating for example a microfarad capacitor may be substituted for a microfarad capacitor even in an emergency situation you should never substitute a capacitor with a lower capacitance value or voltage rating for the proper capacitor otherwise you run the very real risk of permanent motor damage another possibility when substituting capacitors is to wire them together in parallel to add microfarad ratings for example you may wire a microfarad capacitor in parallel with a microfarad capacitor to achieve the equivalent capacitance of a microfarad capacitor you also may use the same procedures when making substitutions for the start capacitor on a motor be sure you maintain the correct voltage rating for all capacitors when combining caps to avoid damage or personal injury you should always use the exact replacement capacitor whenever possible a little extra advice never discharge a capacitor using a screwdriver or other dead short method instead use a ohm w or higher power resistor or a watt light bulb to slowly and safely drain the capacitor's residual charge using a light bulb thread the bulb into either a pigtail socket like the type used with temporary light strings or use a handlamp aka drop light with a homemade pigtail cord end or plug the male plug into a homemade pigtail cord fitted with a standard a parallel blade female plug on the pigtail end use either a pair of heavy duty insulated alligator clips or inch female quick disconnects to connect the lamp assembly to the capacitor p s when you purchase the proper replacement caps buy an extra start and run cap for just such emergency situations you may also want to consider purchasing a replacement relay and overload as well these parts may be available as a kit  Battery (electricity) Electrical element Transformer Incandescent light bulb Series and parallel circuits Electrophysiology Fluorescent lamp Tesla coil Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electric motor Action potential Vacuum tube Volt Resistor Impedance Diode Light-emitting diode Transistor Thermal power station Capacitance Electrical generator Operational amplifier Universal Serial Bus Spark plug Bicycle lighting Capacitor plague Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Low-pass filter Circuit breaker Oscilloscope Electric power transmission Voltage source Three-phase electric power X10 (industry standard) Membrane potential Loudspeaker Solar cell E85 Motor oil Transmission line Jet engine Strap-on dildo Impedance matching Internal ballistics Toyota Prius Electricity Headlight High-voltage hazards Lineman (occupation) RC circuit Phase-locked loop Screw Carburetor Electrical wiring AC power Electronic amplifier Electrostatic discharge Christmas lights Welding Lawn mower Enigma machine Residual-current device Tire Power factor correction Gas metal arc welding Relay Lightning Electrical resistance Decibel Street light CMOS Split phase Lighting RLC circuit Phantom power Alternating current TGV MOSFET Intravenous therapy Fusor Resonance Light switch Printed circuit board Coaxial cable Rail terminology Central processing unit Commodore 64 Explosive material Computer

mm male to mm female adapter when fully plugged in there should be audio output sound music etc coming out from both the left and right speaker headphone etc right the reason i ask is because i have one that when used doesn't have audio output from both the left and right when it's fully plugged in if i moved the adapter out of the phone a little in a certain place then there's audio from both sides this is a replacement b c the st one did this too the product description doesn't say whether or not its stereo or not it's from meritline com this is annoying b c when if i get it to work w audio output from both sides and it slightly moves then there's sound from only one side or none then i have to move it again so nothing can really be moved to keep the audio output coming from both sides unless it's very carefully the product page http www meritline com earphone plug adapter transfer mm plug into mm small plug html it has bands rings i'm guessing w phones the bands would be for listening and the microphone but aren't the rings bands insulators from what i know the metal tip is the left channel audio the middle metal part is the right channel and the bottom is the ground the headphones i use don't have a microphone they're just regular headphones for music so shouldn't the adapter work the headphones i use have a mm jack which is the purpose of the adapter the headphones are stereo also the adapter is for standard mm headphones to be used on a phone that accepts mm headphones what u describe and the web page match that is a stereo plug does the headphone have the same configuration it could be just a mono headset is the headphone the same size as the adapter plug maybe u don't need the adapter  Jack plug Headphones Microphone IPod TRS connector Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Binaural recording Loudspeaker Amstrad CPC Stereophonic sound Bluetooth Walkman Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Spark plug Gramophone record RCA connector Tungsten Handheld Apple IIGS Audiophile 8 mm video format MP3 Xbox N-Gage D-subminiature FM broadcasting Digital audio broadcasting Modem 3D audio effect Karaoke Nintendo DS Sega Dreamcast Digital audio workstation Mixing console Common Unix Printing System Surround sound Sound Blaster Sound design Telephone exchange Game Boy Nominal impedance Danger Hiptop SCART Game Boy Advance SP Nintendo Entertainment System Musical Instrument Digital Interface Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Electrophysiology Bose Corporation Secure Digital card Movie projector Copy protection Subwoofer Compact disc Sound reinforcement system Transistor Compact audio cassette Oscilloscope High fidelity Disc jockey Dolby Digital Grateful Dead PC Engine XLR connector Transformer Atari ST DIN connector Vacuum tube Advanced Audio Coding Stereoscopy Web browser Laserdisc Atari 8-bit family Sound card Balanced audio Radiotelephone Manual transmission DVD Synthesizer Universal Serial Bus Television Radio Surveillance Videoconferencing Glossary of partner dance terms HyperText Transfer Protocol Equal-loudness contour Commodore 64 Digital audio player Speech recognition Shure Incorporated Tapwave Zodiac Sinclair ZX81 Computer bus Enigma machine BS 1363

some websites say you can recharge your regular batteries have you done this i have a few battery chargers and i'm thinking of sticking some of my non rechargeable batteries in it just to see what happens has anyone ever done that i accidentally stuck my rechargeable alkalines in an nimh charger if i remember correctly and they were ruined now i'd like to try to charge my non rechargeable alkalines i've seen special charges on the internet for this purpose but i'd like to try the chargers i already have there have been products claiming to recharge regular alkaline batteries out for years even before real rechargeable batteries basically they don't work all batteries work by chemical action the chemistry inside a rechargeable battery has been designed to be reversed when a current is put through in the reverse direction this returns the chemicals to their original state ready to be used again the chemistry in a regular alkaline battery has not been designed to be reversible running a current through them in the reverse direction will not restore the chemicals to their original state it could cause the batteries to leak or catch fire it's not safe  Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Battery (electricity) Bicycle lighting Battery electric vehicle Alkali Game Boy Advance SP Lithium ion battery Fuel cell Toyota Prius Dodge Charger Lithium ion polymer battery Airsoft PlayStation Portable Laptop Artillery Hybrid vehicle Automobile Electric boat Ammonia Halo: Combat Evolved Fire extinguisher Hydrogen peroxide Hydride Hot Wheels San Diego Chargers IPod Base (chemistry) Lead-acid battery AlphaSmart Protoss Water purification Thermal power station USS S-42 (SS-153) Hydrochloric acid Electrode Cincinnati Bengals Action potential Ford Ranger EV New York Giants USS S-37 (SS-142) Internal ballistics Chemistry Oplan Bojinka Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Plutonium Dishwasher Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder National Weather Service Headlight Nintendo DS Dosimeter M60 machine gun ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Incandescent light bulb Hand grenade Autonomous building Anode Mars Exploration Rover Glossary of American football Smoke detector RuneScape skills Vacuum tube Apple Computer Electrophysiology Universal Serial Bus Shell (projectile) Explosive material Lewis Urry USS Silversides (SS-236) Xbox 360 Enzyme Error-tolerant design Torpedo USS S-38 (SS-143) Pittsburgh Steelers Second Battle of the Atlantic Lumber Virgin Mobile Honda Insight Alkaline Trio Sulfuric acid Electrical generator Manual transmission Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Unterseeboot 505 USS S-44 (SS-155) Molecular nanotechnology Ionizing radiation Green Lantern Sulfur Technetium Energy development RX-78 mobile suit series Walkman Michael Faraday Cosmic Era technology

what is so special about blue ray technology is it here to stay or go the way of dat players is it really better than hi def or does it take a signal meter that can read and see the difference what tv's does it work best on i really think it is just a passing fad that will disappear just like dat players and tapes digital audio tape first the technology question it s got more storage than hd dvd which gives the publishers more options a blu ray dvd can hold gb for a single layer disc vs gb for hd dvd that means that potentially an hd film plus the extras and special features and potentially or more hours of data think games alternate endings previews etc could fit on a blu ray disc this is a similar format war to what existed in the late s and early s vhs vs beta beta was a much higher quality format that offered a superior picture coincidentally it was also a sony technology as is blu ray but it lost out because the vhs format was less expensive in an age when price mattered and the entire concept of watching movies in the home was new so the new questions are is the viewing public willing to pay more for the player and the films to get a little better quality and potentially more features is the computer industry going to drive the technology having the potential to store gb on a single disc could make a difference in archival and data backup and could potentially drive the cost of blu ray down is either format going to last long enough to win the war the third question is kind of like your fad question there s no doubt in anyone s mind that high definition tv is here to stay there s also no doubt that people want to watch rented or purchased movies in hd the question then is how are they going to want to get them there is already talk of places like blockbuster online or net flix renting films via high speed internet download just as mp s are well on their way to replacing cd s a device similar to an hd dvr would be in the home and the film would download the viewer would be able to rewind fast forward and pause just like a dvd or dvr but after a certain timeframe the film would render itself unwatchable purchase of films in this manner is also being looked at the issues that exist there are piracy protection and download speeds to download a gb hd film including the dvd content would take hours or more through dsl and adoption of the technology will be slow to non existent if the film pauses and breaks up as the download continues during playback so the answer to your question is worth hundreds of billions of dollars to the various industries the people who make the tv s players blank media the film studios who make the movies the high speed internet service providers and everyone else involved in the industry  Gramophone record MP3 Digital photography Enterprise content management Sound recording Digital rights management 8 mm video format MiniDisc Warez Camcorder Sony Broadband Internet access PlayStation 3 Karaoke Film Walkman ITunes Music Store Atari 8-bit family Windows Vista Commodore 64 Mixtape Wheel of Fortune Xbox 360 Nintendo Revolution ITunes Betamax Cable television PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast Macrovision Computer and video games Video CD Digital video recorder Microsoft Super Audio CD Xbox Television Digital Subscriber Line DualDisc Oscilloscope 8-track cartridge Nintendo GameCube ZX Spectrum Pornography Ebook Macromedia Flash Digital Audio Tape Online music store Modem Betacam Amstrad CPC Asynchronous Transfer Mode Super Nintendo Entertainment System Videotape Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Ethernet S-VHS Computer Movie projector Photography USB flash drive Magnetic tape QuickTime Video codec Phonograph PlayStation 2 High fidelity Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Machinima Audiophile Vorbis Windows 2000 SCART CD-R Secure Digital card Windows XP Google Nintendo Gmail BBC Bluetooth Open source culture Podcasting Modchip

downsides of mp players made in china i was planning to buy an mp player that is china made which has similar features with that of an ipod even had a built in camera mostly these gadgets are relatively much less expensive compared to that of an ipod so i was worried that it might not last for a year or worse for a month just basing on the concept that high price equals high quality and cheaper price equals cheaper quality i am not saying that china products are cheap and of poor quality i just think that it's too much of a bargain that these manufacturers are selling a video player just like an ipod but at a lot less money i just wanna know if it would really be worth it to buy one do you guyz have any idea on the disadvantages of these mp players do you have any disappointing experiences owning one i hope you could give me some specific details on the downsides of these gadgets thanks a lot mine has been working for a year the headphone suck i had to replace them and the battery sucks the quality seems fine though for what i paid for a gig model no camera though but plays amv video that i convert myself  Digital photography Walkman IPod IPod shuffle Laserdisc Apple Computer Microeconomics Gross domestic product Airsoft ITunes Music Store Wal-Mart IMac Radeon Gramophone record ITunes Creative Zen DVD Sport utility vehicle Hydrogen economy Inflation Monopoly (game) Tariff Apple Macintosh High-definition television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PE ratio Binoculars Free trade Capitalism IPod nano Compact audio cassette Bulk vending Camcorder Mutual fund Capital accumulation Strap-on dildo Audiophile Atari ST View camera Yugo Poker jargon Nintendo Machinima Nintendo DS Digital cinematography Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Inkjet printer Publicly funded medicine Tax Video game crash of 1983 Bicycle lighting Handheld game console Blackjack Solar power Temasek Holdings Digital rights management NVIDIA Sega Saturn Law of value Health insurance Game Boy Advance FireWire Sega Ford Motor Company USB flash drive Personal rapid transit Final Fantasy XI Outsourcing Computer and video games IBM PC compatible Overclocking Digital cinema Computer Videocassette recorder ATI Technologies PlayStation Portable Paintball Leica Amstrad CPC Plastic American individualist anarchism Digital audio player Citigroup RuneScape economy Television Loss leader Sears Holdings Corporation CPU design Illegal drug trade Headphones Price discrimination 8 mm video format Pharmaceutical company

someone please explain this bluetooth thing to me how does it work i just got a new cell phone after upgrading from my year old dinosaur this one has bluetooth capability i know that means that i can hook up a cord free ear piece device to it but are there other things i can use it for i saw this device at wal mart that looked almost like a thumb drive is this something i can plug into my computer and put information on like a thumb drive and then plug it into my phone and upload the pictures music or whatever or am i totally confused please someone clarify this for me i know my phone can play music and videos and has bluetooth capability my computer is older so if this is the case would these devices work with my current computer i want to know if i am able to upload stuff to my phone without having to pay out the nose for internet connection hi there bluetooth is used in a number of ways the st way is to purchase a bluetooth headset and use that to make phone calls you can program your phone to be voice activated so you can say a person's name into the headset and it'll dial the relevant number the nd way is to buy a bluetooth dongle and connect it to your computer you can pair this dongle to your phone and computer to allow you to copy music pics etc from your computer to your phone or vice versa the rd way is in my opinion the most useful you can use bluetooth to transfer things such as music tracks ringtones pics contacts etc between phones this means that if your friends or relatives have any music etc that you like on their bluetooth phones they can send them to you equally you can send things to them the same way if you want any further information on how to operate this stuff  Bluetooth Mobile phone Telephone exchange Modem Computer BlackBerry Universal Serial Bus Telephone IPod ITunes Uploading and downloading Secure Digital card Hearing aid Voice over IP Phreaking Mouse (computing) Commodore 64 Xbox IPAQ Surveillance Verizon Wireless Television Dongle Telephone numbering plan General Packet Radio Service Universal Plug and Play Nintendo Revolution IBM PC compatible MSN Messenger Linux Ring tone File sharing Symbian OS Digital photography Personal digital assistant N-Gage Call centre Personal computer IMac Atari ST Headphones Floppy disk Apple Newton Gmail Windows XP Killer application Malware Digital rights management Telephone tapping Windows 2000 Wireless Application Protocol Internet Digital camera Private branch exchange Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Nintendo Entertainment System Wi-Fi Xbox 360 Security token Computer and video games Network Switching Subsystem FireWire Vacuum tube Bulletin board system Global System for Mobile Communications TiVo PlayStation 2 Session Initiation Protocol BitTorrent Spyware PlayStation 3 Karaoke Computer virus Jack plug Embedded system Toll-free telephone number Nintendo DS Data retention Warez Danger Hiptop Microcontroller Apple Desktop Bus Port (computing) Global Positioning System Flash memory Computer hardware Japanese mobile phone culture

what's the difference with an hd dvd player and an hd upconvert why does it matter and should i go with hd dvd player or blu ray high def picture is considered to have lines of resolution and an hd dvd has all lines stored on its disc which is displayed by your tv an upconverting player takes a dvd which has lines of resolution and using a mathematical algorithm attempts to fill in the picture to reach lines of resolution the extra detail isn't there but the technology does its best guess approximation the end result is a better than dvd picture quality but worse than hd picture quality to get the best picture quality you'll need either and hd dvd player or a blu ray player both are equal in quality but blu ray is supported by more companies while hd dvd is cheaper i'd tend to side with blu ray if i picked one but i wouldn't buy any existing blu ray players outside the ps current hd dvd players i would buy and at a cheaper cost but know that hd dvd has a lesser selection of titles than blu ray  DVD Blu-ray Disc Digital photography Gramophone record Anamorphic widescreen Video CD Handheld game console Compact disc Color MP3 Super Video CD DualDisc NTSC Television Computer Digital rights management VHS Movie projector PostScript H.264/MPEG-4 AVC GamePark Pornography CPU cache S__CAM MPEG-2 Quicksort Solar cell Video codec Videocassette recorder Copy protection Final Fantasy XI High fidelity Digital image editing PlayStation Portable Online DVD rental ATI Technologies Sony RuneScape economy Widescreen Regional lockout Super Audio CD Wheel of Fortune HD DVD Compact audio cassette Search engine optimization Windows Vista Floppy disk Deinterlacing Machinima Atari ST Scientific method Rugby union Camcorder Rendering (computer graphics) Stereoscopy Image file formats Hash table Manga Nintendo Revolution Motion picture rating system Prisoner's dilemma Warez Digital cinema Publicly funded medicine Slot machine Poker jargon Vorbis Inflation JPEG Violin Betting (poker) Pok__mon Chronicles Microeconomics Digital television ELO rating system SCART The Criterion Collection Blockbuster Video Audiophile 2004-05 NHL lockout Nintendo 64 Def Leppard Digital cinematography Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Atari 8-bit family Anti-aliasing Tetris Condorcet method Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Plasma display Doctor Who missing episodes Password cracking Pixel Analog-to-digital converter Halting problem Modchip Page replacement algorithms

if flash memory is temporary then how do flash based mp players and usb devices retain their memories i am surprised to see how many of these answers are wrong flash memory is actually a very old technology only updated to todays standards nowadays flash storage is more commonly flashed using an electrical charge but this hasn't always been the mainstay originally flash rom was designed to carry simple basic stamp instructions and even more commonly as the bios for almosty all computers both pc and mac many in early production were flashed using specific light wavelengths such as uv or near ir and programmed or interfaced using a special eeprom station the intended effect was a robust permanent storage solution that could not be easily erased or require battery backup unlike ram which is unstable and requires constant power to retain any storage only within the last few years has electrically flashed storage cards and internal memory become common such as flash cards and flash based mp players an in depth explanation of how this type of flash rom is accessed erased and written to is available at howstuffworks com  Flash memory USB flash drive Read-only memory BIOS Universal Serial Bus Memory (computers) Apple Macintosh Non-volatile memory IPod Floppy disk PIC microcontroller Computer Random access memory Modchip EEPROM DVD IBM PC Personal computer MRAM Windows XP PC Engine Programmable logic device Secure Digital card BASIC programming language Laptop Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Computer bus Digital photography USB mass storage device class Embedded system CompactFlash Sharp Zaurus Central processing unit Macromedia Flash Redundant array of independent disks IMac Hard disk File system Booting PowerPC Atari ST Apple IIGS Game Boy RISC Commodore 64 TI-83 series History of computing hardware Apple Newton AmigaOS Ferroelectric RAM Ethernet Digital camera C programming language Explosive material PlayStation 3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Saturn Apollo Guidance Computer IBook ZX Spectrum Dynamic random access memory Java programming language Game Boy Advance PowerBook Apple II family Camcorder History of Microsoft Windows SmartMedia Nintendo Revolution Bicycle lighting Data remanence File Allocation Table MiniDisc History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Enterprise content management Battery (electricity) Windows Vista CPU cache Nintendo GameCube Emulator TRS-80 Computer and video games Nintendo DS CPU design Apple Computer Serial ATA Microprocessor Walkman Light-emitting diode Power-On Self Test

after an air bed is inflated using d batteries how many more inflations will they provide for i just got an air bed and i now know that one the bed is pumped completely the batteries wont be used until i want to reinflate again how many more times will the d sized batteries inflate depends on how big a bed and the type of batteries used one thing to keep in mind is that each time you inflate the bed it will take longer than the previous time there will come a point when it takes too long for you to want to wait for a full inflate beyond that there will come a point where the batteries will only turn the fan so fast such as a point where the fan turns but won't add any pressure this may be at a point that is too low a pressure for a comfortable bed  Thermal power station Thermostat Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Strap-on dildo Diving regulator Jet engine Diving suit Energy development Ford Ranger EV Inflation Personal flotation device Battery electric vehicle Action potential Explosive material Internal combustion engine Mars Exploration Rover Paintball Nickel-cadmium battery Car handling Battery (electricity) Hubert H.

new air conditioner feature i have this air conditioner and it has a remote on the air conditioner it says artic glacier on the remote there is a button it says follow me and when i push the follow me button a weird little face appears on the lcd of the remote can someone please tell me what the follow me feature does thank you very much i have figured out the answer i appreciate your answer too jc thank you the air conditioner sits in the window and yes you are right is a single unit when i press the follow me button on the remote and is on the remote only it will tell me the temperature via remote so if i go outside and take the remote with me it will tell me the temperature outside not what i have the air conditioner set too and also when i press that button a little kinda smiling kinda frowning face appears on the remote still working on what that is but i halfway got it thank you much i tried to look up information on your air conditioner but i could not find it all i can do at this point is offer you a guess on what that feature does i will first assume that this air conditioner is a single unit like a window unit or one that sits on the floor if this is the case then my guess is that the follow me feature will turn off the air conditioner unit when you leave the room and then turn it back on when you come back all by sensing the remote which would mean you would have to keep the remote on you that's my best guess if it isn't that try searching for the instruction manual online i'm sure that'll have the answer you are looking for hope that helps  Mouse (computing) Windows XP Danger Hiptop Prank flash Modem Aerial (dance move) Solar power Professional wrestling holds Poker jargon Wheel of Fortune Windows 2000 Photography Canon T90 Password Ecco the Dolphin The Visitation Guilty Gear Escape from New York Angel One (TNG episode) Xbox Syphon Filter HVAC Sega Dreamcast The Doctor Dances Japanese toilet Nintendo Revolution Saints and Soldiers ITunes Jumpstart 3rd Grade IPod Screenshot X10 (industry standard) IP (complexity) The Chemical Brothers Forth programming language Datalore (TNG episode) Visual Basic Physical paradox Eggerland series Whose Line Is It Anyway?

can an electrical storm or improper grounding from cable system blow out my electronics i have power strips in my home that are supposed to protect my electronics from blowing up surge protectors but when i came home several of my electronics were blown up like my tv router cable modem and monitor all these things were connected via cable or data lines from road runner's cable system could their improper grounding cause my stuff to blow up i called the technician to come out but they have yet to come out and inspect the grounding they of course are denying it could happen with lightning all bets are off almost anything can happen this includes a small device surviving and a larger huskier device being destroyed having surge suppressors on your ac is a start they should be good ones such as isobar isobar has very good multiple protection components some of the cheap ones only have a minimum single component protection yes lightning can come in the ground of the cable system it can come in any ground though you would need to as an experienced electrician about what path the surge got in to damage your equipment it would be hard to prove in came in the cable ground without some expert experience you can install your own additional grounding systems but the best way is to disconnect your equipment from anything that comes into the house when lightning is around this includes the ac power as well as cable and phone lines  Universal Serial Bus Lightning rod Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ground (electricity) Modem Lightning Digital Subscriber Line Broadband Internet access Spark gap Fuse (electrical) Earthing system High-voltage direct current Transmitter Router Cable television National Electrical Code (US) Optical fiber RS-232 Electricity pylon 2003 North America blackout Spark plug Transformer Embedded system Wind turbine Password Private branch exchange Electricity Overhead powerline Loudspeaker Phreaking Printed circuit board Power line communication Ground and neutral Integrated Services Digital Network Advanced Technology Attachment STS-61 Computer Hurricane Rita Wi-Fi Jack plug Audiophile BS 1363 Relay Floppy disk Federal Standard 1037C Lineman (occupation) Telephone tapping High-voltage hazards Electric power transmission Battery (electricity) Redundant array of independent disks NSA encryption systems Telephone Power strip Geomagnetic storm Naval mine Static inverter plant Seismic retrofit Musical Instrument Digital Interface Antenna (radio) History of radar Alternating current SCART Windows XP Computer bus USB flash drive Circuit design Fluorescent lamp Digital circuit Electrical engineering 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Wardenclyffe Tower Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Electrical wiring (UK) Electrician War of the Worlds (2005 film) GSM services Digital photography Bluetooth Jet engine Disaster Directed-energy weapon Parachuting Overhead lines Television Amateur radio Apollo Command/Service Module

i'm making an emergency kit for my house what all should be in it i am going to make an emergency kit for my home what should be in it just in case a hurricane or some natural disaster hits and power is lost or we are trepped what should go in every kit thanks for your time and all answers are greatly appreciated the first thing you should always have is a flashlight most of you probably already do blankets if you have children you should have more than one because you need to keep warm and it is dangerous to sit for a long period of time in a running car first aid kit my kit has band aids large bandages medical tape neosporin peroxide alcohol pads ace bandages and burn cream hand warmers these are little packet things that you can get at most places that sell camping gear food i carry mre's meal ready to eat you can get them at most military surplus stores water in a lot of climates if you are stuck for a while the water will freeze but most of the time it should be fine chains if you live where there is a lot of snow chains might be something you want to carry just in case a tow strap if you get stuck you want to make sure if anyone stops to help you that they can pull you out they won't always have the equipment for that so having one on hand helps extra socks hats gloves and coats you might not always have your coat with you during the day but if you are stuck it will be super cold come night time extra socks will be needed if your feet get wet if you have a baby extra diapers wipes and formula these are always nice to have on hand even if it's not an emergency situation here are the items you should always have available fresh water on average assume you'll need at least two quarts of water per day per person that's the minimum you should store for drinking don't forget about your pets too store water in clean plastic containers bottled gallon jugs of water from the supermarket are good choices food human beings can live for quite a long time without food as long as they are adequately hydrated however it's important to your health and comfort that you keep some food on hand for emergencies opt for canned goods which have a reasonably long shelf life and are generally safe from rodents or bugs choose items that are palatable cold as you may not have fuel for heating you might also consider survival packs or military packaged meals that are sold in sporting good or army surplus stores warmth if the power goes out you may need to provide some warmth for your family stash a few blankets in your box as well as some waterproof matches you might even want to consider some extra warm clothing such as sweatshirts or jackets hats gloves and scarves are a good idea if your climate gets cold in the winter sanitation basic hygiene and sanitation should still be maintained include some antiseptic gel premoistened wipes and toilet paper tools don't forget the basics like a flashlight extra batteries pliers hammer nails and radio a compass might be useful if you intend to spend some time on foot you should also pack a can opener and a knife a flare and a whistle can be used to signal rescuers so include them in the kit basic first aid equipment like bandages splints tape and pain relievers should also be part of your emergency supplies remember food expires batteries die and moths can eat through blankets check your supplies once a year to ensure that everything is safe and maintained replace anything that's old non working or expired one flashlight electric torch with batteries spare batteries one pair trauma shears emt shears pennycutters two pairs nitrile exam gloves one biohazard waste bag any sturdy sealable plastic bag will do one sam splint structural aluminum malleable two triangular bandages four x gauze pads lint surgical sponges two rolls gauze roller bandage cling ten adhesive bandages sticking plasters elastoplast band aid type one roll medical adhesive tape two x abdominal pads one pocket

is it bad to mix two different brands of batteries in a remote i have one energizer and one duracel left aaa i put them both in my tv remote and they seem to work fine but i've heard that you shouldn't do it so can someone explain if i need to take them out or if they're okay the battery companies will of course recommend that you not mix brands see energizer faq link below because it means that they can sell more of their brand batteries however when you read a little more about how batteries actually work see how stuff works link below you might decide that there is some cause for concern when it comes to mixing battery types mixing old batteries with new batteries is commonly discouraged check your manual for whatever device takes batteries and it's also safe to assume that different brands may use different agents in their batteries putting them together and throwing current and heat into the equation sounds like a bad idea it's probably best to play it safe use the same types of batteries and change all batteries when performance starts to wane hope this helps  Battery (electricity) Johnny 5 Nickel-cadmium battery Bicycle lighting Battery electric vehicle Apple Computer Nickel metal hydride Avenue Q Lithium ion battery Thermal power station Remote control Manual transmission Embedded system Parody advertisement Anti-aircraft warfare C plus plus Bass guitar RFID Daylight saving time Digital photography The Star Wars Holiday Special Hybrid vehicle Xbox 360 Hearing aid IPod Redundant array of independent disks Naval mine Jack plug Nuclear reactor Fuel cell Dance Dance Revolution Smoke detector Sears Holdings Corporation PlayStation Portable Light-emitting diode Windows XP Vacuum tube Solar power Explosive material Game Boy MUMPS Credit card Jumpstart 3rd Grade Toyota Prius High-voltage hazards Superconductivity Energy development Autonomous building Jet engine Poker jargon Oscilloscope Energizer Bunny MiniDisc Laptop Diode Television commercial Microphone Second Battle of the Atlantic Global Gillette Torpedo Electric motor Incandescent light bulb X Window System Electroshock gun Cruising (maritime) C programming language Internal combustion engine Carburetor Advertising Ford Motor Company Solar cell The Dalek Invasion of Earth Modem Telephone exchange Baseball Canon T90 Lewis Urry Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family Enigma machine Hey Jude Nintendo Scientology beliefs and practices Subwoofer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Lincoln LS Pun GED TiVo Street-Legal Traffic light Heat Photography ExxonMobil E85 Altruism Volt ITV

quick charge or regular recharge for nimh battery i have an energizer quick battery charger that fills up energizer nimh batteries in minutes i just bought a sanyo regular charger with sanyo nimh batteries but it takes hours to fill capacity is it better to use the regular charger or the quick one what is the difference other than one being faster than the other thanks as long as the chagers are working correctly there is no real difference other than length of time in the charging of the battery the issue with quick chargers is if they don't shut off when the battery is charged they will damage it the damage is caused by the heat of the higher current required to charge the battery faster as long as the quick charger shuts off correctly there is no problem  Nickel metal hydride Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Battery electric vehicle Toyota Prius Lithium ion battery Turbocharger Ford Ranger EV Bicycle lighting Airsoft Vacuum tube Television commercial Dodge Charger PlayStation Portable Action potential San Diego Chargers Hybrid vehicle Universal Serial Bus Internal ballistics Lightning Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Lightsaber Ionizing radiation Items in the Metroid series Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Incandescent light bulb Protoss IBM PC compatible Electrophysiology Radio controlled car Pittsburgh Steelers Digital photography Geomagnetic storm Solar cell Memory effect GunZ The Duel Thermal power station Uninterruptible power supply Halo: Combat Evolved IPod Game Boy Advance SP Diode Electric boat Laptop Armored Core Tribes 2 Welding Redundant array of independent disks BattleTech technology Electroconvulsive therapy New York Giants Hard disk Wind power Mobile phone Fusion power Carburetor Final Fantasy XI Electric motor Stroke Artillery Energy development Insulin Loudspeaker The Secret of NIMH Explosive material Second Battle of the Atlantic Apollo 13 Honda Insight Torpedo Galileo spacecraft Nuclear power Solar power Equine conformation Renewable energy Shell (projectile) GED Fossil fuel power plant AlphaSmart Mental illness Whew!

do batteries run longer when they are frozen no they'll run longest when they're warm freezing them increases their capacity for the duration that they remain cold but doesn't help and in fact hinders extraction of their current if you keep them cold until you use them you'll better preserve whatever charge exists in them once you start using them however you want them warm so that you can extract the greatest percentage of current they hold you can never extract all of the juice in a battery you're only drawing it down to some percentage of its capacity you want that capacity to be the greatest while you're storing it for use but you want to be able to decrease that capacity as you draw down the current to squeeze the most out of it let's say that the battery will never discharge more than of its capacity if the capacity is when cold and when warm will be units of the former and units of the latter you'll get more units out of the battery if you can decrease its capacity as you're using it there's also aspects relating to the amount and flow of current that are addressed by the physics of hot and cold and electron excitability but i'm definitely not the right person to address that for a casual answer  Battery (electricity) Lithium ion battery Water (molecule) Energy development Action potential Solar power Future energy development Renewable energy Heat Nickel-cadmium battery Nuclear power Drowning Wind power Circuit design Vitamin C Fuel cell Carbon dioxide Carburetor Aurora (astronomy) Capacitor Thermal power station CPU cache Nickel metal hydride Plasma (physics) Energy Ocean thermal energy conversion Current (electricity) Cold fusion Langmuir probe Water Fluorescent lamp Permittivity Supply and demand Global warming Diode Solar cell Entropy Technetium Brewery George W.

wireless power output i have a really week signal in my house and i have a linksys wireless range extender there i was wondering how i could make my own antenna amplifier to help boost a little bit of both reciving and sending i am aware that there is a legal limit and that doing this will not help as much as i think but i would like to try it out so if there was a way to make like a watt amp for the antenna that would be nice thanks i can get a signal in multiple places but the place i have the repeater is the best signal and it still isnt much the only other place i can think of putting it is hanging it out the window the wireless signal is comeing somewhere but the odd thing is that of the time im the only one using it i get like unbievible speeds when good signal kbps and i havnt been able to track down the house its coming from if it is maybe you can accomplish something by amplifying the signal but would it be easier to try combination of the wires with wireless access point for example you can have your router in the basement and connect it with network wire to access point on the second floor  Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 Wireless access point Antenna (radio) Modem Electronic amplifier Cellular network Loudspeaker Cable television Operational amplifier Radar Router Broadband Internet access X10 (industry standard) Bluetooth Federal Standard 1037C Transformer AirPort Transmitter Telegraphy Universal Serial Bus Xbox Amateur radio Oscilloscope Global Positioning System Decibel Internet Audiophile Communications satellite Electrophysiology Television Citizens' band radio Power line communication TGV Instrument amplifier DVD Software-defined radio PlayStation 3 Central processing unit Bass guitar Telephone Code division multiple access Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Electric motor Very Long Baseline Interferometry Wardenclyffe Tower Overhead lines VHF omnidirectional range Transistor RS-232 Crystal radio receiver Sound recording General Packet Radio Service Coaxial cable PlayStation Portable Tesla coil Telephone tapping Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Wireless mesh network SCART MIM-23 Hawk Voice over IP Kenwood Electronics Circuit design Phase-shift keying Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Amplifier Digital Subscriber Line VFO Resistor Time-division multiplexing Morse Code History of radio Direction finding IS-95 Ultra wideband WiMAX Wireless Cisco Systems Galileo spacecraft Computer Wardriving Electric guitar History of radar Satellite television Mobile phone radiation and health Verizon Wireless Global System for Mobile Communications Analog computer Computer network Space-time block code Field-programmable gate array Vacuum tube Apollo Guidance Computer

suggest me which dvd player is good but the cost should be around if you have an hdtv you should consider hd dvd and or blu ray they are true hd formats unlike dvd they go beyond the picture quality in hd cable and sattelite channels so far blu ray has more support and most likely to win the format so go with blu ray the cheapest blu ray player is the sony playstation it's you don't have to use it for gaming but there is other multimedia features on it that don't have anything to do with gaming like store songs on the hdd or you could go for a sony dvd player for very cheap at http www amazon com if you even have a hdtv but still on a budget there's one for that upconverts dvds to near hd just as good picture quality as hd cable and satellite channels i hope this helps you make the right buying decision  DVD PlayStation Portable PlayStation 2 Blu-ray Disc Digital television Xbox Television Laserdisc Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega Dreamcast GamePark Handheld game console TiVo Cable television Warez Xbox 360 MPEG-2 Sony Nintendo GameCube Computer and video games MP3 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ATI Technologies Home Box Office Sound Blaster Video Video codec Video CD Columbia Pictures Digital cinematography Videotape Video game music Gran Turismo (game) Blu Cantrell Super Video CD Nintendo DS Dolby Digital Videocassette recorder Digital rights management British Sky Broadcasting Nintendo 64 Copy protection SCART Sony Computer Entertainment Dolby Laboratories Sega VHS S-VHS Compact disc Delta Goodrem Resident Evil (video game) Pornography Fahrenheit 9/11 Camcorder Ayumi Hamasaki Amstrad CPC Regional lockout Moving Picture Experts Group 8 mm video format Nintendo Betacam Musical Instrument Digital Interface Walkman Console wars PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Digital cinema Digital video recorder Girls Aloud HD DVD ITunes Music Store Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DualDisc BBC ATSC Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital photography Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMIX Console game DVB Streaming media 24 (television) Final Fantasy XI Secure Digital card Windows Vista PolyGram Digital audio broadcasting Macrovision Advanced Audio Coding Final Fantasy IX Amazon.com Machinima NTSC Outsourcing MiniDisc Enhanced remake Anamorphic widescreen

how to tell power of speakers how do you tell how powerful speakers are basically how much volume they can handle how good they sound and how to tell if they are about to blow out most speakers have the power handling capabilities printed on them example watts rms continuous means you shouldn't have an amp pushing more then watts per channel on them some speakers might go as far to say on them watts rms and watt peak which means no more then watts per channel with an amp to drive them  Audio power Loudspeaker Decibel Marshall Amplification Audiophile Vacuum cleaner Grateful Dead Kenwood Electronics Mike Watt Stereophonic sound Bass guitar Amplitude Citizens' band radio Steamboat Acorn Electron Orders of magnitude (power) Horsepower Effective radiated power Transformer Root mean square Electronic amplifier Car audio Bicycle lighting Steam engine Sound Blaster Welding power supply Action potential Inverse-square law Ampeg Klipsch KMFDM Watt steam engine Subwoofer Solar power Redundant array of independent disks Mesa Boogie Amstrad CPC Signal-to-noise ratio Advanced Mobile Phone System AC power Impedance Power (physics) Surround sound Kirk Hammett James Watt Clear channel Instrument amplifier Movie projector Operational amplifier Compact disc Electric motor Sound pressure level William Watt Original Amiga chipset Mixing console HP BASIC for OpenVMS Fan (implement) Light-emitting diode Alternating current Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis XML Electricity Federal Communications Commission Atari POKEY FM broadcast band Australian English Audio crossover Cellular network Paper Mario Digital Theatre System Shortwave Explosive material Wi-Fi Effects unit Electric guitar Resistor Solar panel BS 1363 Timeline of steam power The Jam Hydropower Crofton Pumping Station Transistor Four wheel drive Synthesizer Acorn Atom Atari 8-bit family Electricity meter Laser engraving Cell (microprocessor) Wind turbine XERF Solar cell Low-power broadcasting Korean language Singlish Hydraulic machinery Lightsaber Den Watts

can i use a blank dvd r disc to store mkv and mp files i've tried to burn my video files onto the disc so i could watch them on a bigger screen but it doesn't work i've given up btw if anyone knows how to burn the files on to watch with a portable dvd player that would be awesome anyway i am now trying to just store the mkv and mp files on a blank cd but cds don't have enough space on them i noticed that dvd r discs hold gb so i'd much rather put my files there would it still work i hope my explanation isn't too confusing thanks for your answers yeah why not all you need to do is open your dvd burning software and select data dvd as your template then you drag and drop i do this with my shows all the time to conserve space even though i have over tb episodes of shows esspecially dual audio mkv files anime and full motion video can be storage intensive just remember to take insane care of them because mp and mkv modified mp divx xvid are very touchy on error correction and a very minor scratch can make a video completely unusable learned the hard way this is why the dvd format was designed for mpeg layer video because it is a much more forgiving format this has a lot to do with keyframes which are set by your encoder when you encoded yoru files  DVD Video codec Floppy disk Laserdisc MP3 ITunes Digital rights management CD-ROM DivX H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Disk image Blu-ray Disc Copy protection Gramophone record XviD Warez Ebook Macromedia Flash Digital audio player IPod MiniDisc PlayStation 3 QuickTime DualDisc CD-R Sega Dreamcast Super Video CD Ripping Movie projector Video CD Hard disk Ogg PlayStation Portable NTSC Creative Zen ZX Spectrum Screenshot Compact audio cassette USB flash drive MPEG-2 Xbox 360 Apple Computer Enterprise content management PC Engine PlayStation 2 AmigaOS Windows XP AVI Nintendo GameCube OpenDocument Digital video CD recorder Podcasting Acorn Electron High-definition television Atari 8-bit family Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Apple II family JPEG DVD-RAM Mouse (computing) Library (computer science) Moving Picture Experts Group GIF Windows 2000 NTFS File format Computer virus TiVo Sega Saturn Advanced Audio Coding Super Audio CD PNG Redundant array of independent disks Xbox Knoppix Poker jargon Television XML Commodore 64 Walkman Data compression VHS SMPTE time code WavPack Virtual memory MP2 (format) File Allocation Table Digital video recorder

i need something called an ear mic or ear microphone any suggestions it's supposed to help you hear yourself while you're singing so that you are able to better fine tune your voice does anyone possibly know where i can find one at a reasonable price i wouldn't use an ear mic this is normally a microphone worn in the ear it won't help you hear yourself as other hear you the best thing is to record yourself on a cassette or cd or any audio recorder you have then listen to yourself after you are done recording you sound different to yourself because your voice travels through the bones and sinus cavities in your head to your eardrums this colors your voice even wearing a good set of headphones isn't ideal because your voice is still getting to your eardrums through your head and coloring the audio you hear it's best to completely separate hearing your voice completely from the speaking process  Microphone Binaural recording Stereophonic sound Multitrack recording Ear Headphones Sound Hearing impairment Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Highway 61 Revisited Audiophile Mixtape Loudspeaker Pet Sounds Gramophone record Sound effect Electronic voice phenomena I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Decibel Compact disc Ear canal It's All Gone Pete Tong Timpani Social rule Audio data compression Skull Karaoke Sound design Sound recording Temporal bone Traumatic brain injury Blood on the Tracks Jack plug MP3 Sampling (music) Tuatara Vowel The Who Earwax Psychoacoustics NTSC Time Out of Mind Sense Walkman High fidelity Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ossicles Stereoscopy Sound film Head Nashville Skyline Circuit design Compact audio cassette Laserdisc Music Mixing console Louie, Louie Acoustics Radiotelephone Grateful Dead Joy Division (band) Rush Limbaugh Video game music The Microphones Dubbing (filmmaking) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases This Week in Tech Hearing (sense) Dither Radio drama Whale song Steve Reich Shure Incorporated Empire Burlesque Equal-loudness contour Noise-cancelling headphone The Empty Child Diving (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Bose Corporation Freddie Mercury Sphenoid bone English grammar Cyberspace Echo chamber Stuttering Hip hop rivalries Covert listening device God Save the Queen Neuros Maxilla Apple IIGS Tetrapod A Day in the Life MOS Technology SID Ontological argument IPod Weighting filter Disc jockey

how to hook up vcr dvd recorder to t v with no cable box bought these components now i'm not sure how to hook it all up would like to be able to copy videotapes onto dvds the dvd recorder has a cable jack but the vcr does not thanks for your help all vcrs that i am familiar with have f type connectors the threaded ones that are usually associated with cable tv for input and output if you can run the rf output from the vcr to the rf input on the dvd recorder if you can set the output channel from the vcr usually there is a switch to set this to either channel or then set the dvd recorder to the same channel if you don't have the same type of connectors on both units then you will need a converter of some type since you say that the dvd recorder has a cable jack i will assume that this is an f type rf connector if the vcr has rca type output jacks for audio and video then you need an rf modulator these are fairly inexpensive and can be purchased at radio shack and some discount stores with a decent electronics department good luck  SCART DVD Television RCA connector Videocassette recorder Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laserdisc S-VHS Xbox VHS Jack plug S-Video Camcorder S__CAM S/PDIF Digital video recorder Sound Blaster High fidelity Copy protection XLR connector Macrovision Composite monitor Atari 2600 8 mm video format Amiga Commodore 64 Nintendo Entertainment System Musical Instrument Digital Interface Electronic amplifier Betamax Videotape Karaoke Home cinema High-definition television Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC Microphone D-subminiature Universal Serial Bus Compact disc Operational amplifier Computer RCA Ethernet TRS connector Gramophone record PlayStation Portable PAL USB flash drive DVD recorder Remote control Sega Dreamcast Frequency modulation Analog-to-digital converter Atari ST Cable television Embedded system DVD player Nominal impedance Mixing console TiVo DV AES/EBU Set-top box Betacam High-Definition Multimedia Interface Balanced audio Original Amiga chipset Central processing unit PC Engine NTSC Coaxial cable PHP Sound card Film Loudspeaker Nintendo GameCube Logic gate Desktop computer Atari 8-bit family MPEG-2 Transformer Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Synthesizer Light-emitting diode Digital Visual Interface Sinclair ZX81 Laptop The Walt Disney Company Home Box Office ZX Spectrum Video game crash of 1983 Digital audio workstation

can i use an v charger with a v battery i have a stayer bce p v cordless drill with a duff battery charger can i use a v or v charger with my batteries alternatively where can i obtain a stayer or equivalent v charger thanks i am in london uk voltage is important trust me if the polarity is correct v shouldn't be a problem because battery chargers generally are unregulated but v would most definately be too much actual output on a v charger is porbably closer to volts i would only use a charger designed to charge the same battery chemistry though such as ni mh or ni cd some chargers also use sensitive voltage triggers to prevent overcharging if you use a charger that is designed for a higher voltage device you woiuld need to time the charging cycle instead of doing what most americans do and leave it on the charger  Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Bicycle lighting Circuit design Diode Capacitor Oscilloscope Volt Battery electric vehicle Transformer Incandescent light bulb Lithium ion battery Electrical generator High-voltage direct current Ford Ranger EV Impedance Electrophysiology Lithium ion polymer battery Power (physics) Switched-mode power supply Electricity Turbocharger Solar cell Vacuum tube Digital circuit Switch Electric motor Three-phase electric power Tesla coil CMOS Liquid crystal display Direct current Microphone Action potential Airsoft Dodge Charger Memory effect Universal Serial Bus San Diego Chargers Operational amplifier SCSI Electroshock gun Phase-locked loop Thyristor Membrane potential Transistor Alternating current Decibel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Radiation hardening Floppy disk Current (electricity) Dosimeter Wind power Thermostat Resistor Piezoelectricity Logic gate Loudspeaker Lead-acid battery Analog-to-digital converter RS-232 Phantom power Hybrid vehicle Electronic amplifier Alternator PlayStation Portable Power supply Electric boat Logic families Particle accelerator Welding Toyota Prius Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Thermal power station Gas metal arc welding Impedance matching Current source Hubble Space Telescope Central processing unit Digital-to-analog converter Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Mercury arc valve Van de Graaff generator Polarization MOSFET Solar car USB flash drive Semiconductor device Maxwell's equations Spark gap War of Currents Superconductivity Negligible

how does that black and decker jumperstarter thing work i know you plug it into the cigarette lighter and the dead battery powers it but if the batteries dead then how the hell does it power anything does that thing convert small amounts of energy in large amounts or what i cant figure it out this device basically works as another battery but it needs to stay and get its power from the car lighter which provides v at the peak incase the car battery is dead then the jump starter would have been previously charged as recommended by the manufacturer then the stored charge is enough to jump start the car i hope this helps  Battery (electricity) Battery electric vehicle Hybrid vehicle Laptop Toyota Prius Lithium ion battery Fuel cell Turbocharger Solar panel IPod Jump start (vehicle) Lighter Hydrogen economy Volt Nickel-cadmium battery Energy storage Alternator Energy development Electrical generator Hydrogen vehicle Automobile Lead-acid battery Solar car Electric vehicle Thermal power station Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Wind turbine Solar power Artillery Explosive material Spark plug Electronic power supply Hydropower Energy Solar cell Diving Renewable energy Circuit design Items in the Metroid series Hybrid Synergy Drive Grid energy storage Windows XP Diesel engine Elevator Bicycle lighting E85 Piezoelectricity Carburetor Automobile self starter Future energy development Vacuum tube Aircraft engine controls Semiconductor device Ford Ranger EV Drag racing Internal combustion engine Nickel metal hydride Airsoft Central processing unit Internal ballistics Radio controlled car Transformer The Man with the Golden Gun Chevrolet Corvette Flywheel energy storage Passenger car Action potential Loudspeaker Fire Universal Serial Bus Uninterruptible power supply Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Hearing aid ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Coal Armored Core Game Boy Daylight saving time Diode Alternative fuel Wind power Weapons of Star Trek Mobile computing Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Audio power Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Lithium ion polymer battery Sin City Electricity MBF-P02 Gundam Astray Red Frame Autonomous building Bus rapid transit Oscilloscope Lighting EastEnders Beltway sniper attacks Computer forensics Nuclear fusion
