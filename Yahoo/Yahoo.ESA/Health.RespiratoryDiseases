mycoplasma respiratory infection information i have a mycoplasmal respiratory infection so far for a week and still feel lousy and have inflammatory arthritis ouch how much longer will the fun persisit i can't take z pak or biaxin i have long qt syndrome so my doc could only prescribe omnicef anybody out there know when i'll feel human again any suggestions to speed up the process thanks ya'll hmmm a mycoplasma may not respond well to an antibiotic these germs are rather unique type of a bacteria which actually fall out of the strict definition of a bacteria including some fungal elements sometimes with spores so if all you are receiving is an antibiotic like omnicef then i'd say clearance of symptoms is going to take awhile on the other hand many mycoplasma infections are self limiting requiring little intervention the antibiotic is more prophylactic preventitive then anything else also you may have some underlying interstitial lung tissue component associated with the inflammatory arthritis but arthritic diseases are a bit out of my realm of knowledge still there is a connection between some arthritis diseases and interstitial lung problems the important part of this dx is if you have an atypical mycoplasma infection cultures and perhaps a bronchoscopy would be necessary to fully dx this maybe you already had a bronch and culture my guess is you are over and have some serious medical history if you are under then by all means you need to be followed by someone with medical skills to manage heart arthritis and other issues you are having prognosis good getting the arthritis inflammation controlled will go a long way to improving your well being the other is bothersome but usually not serious  Rheumatoid arthritis Medicine Lung cancer Asthma Tuberculosis Psoriasis Anthrax Group A streptococcal infection Reiter's syndrome Mycoplasma Chronic fatigue syndrome Aspergillosis Chlamydophila pneumoniae Sexually-transmitted infection Arthritis Crohn's disease Ulcerative colitis Common cold Bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae Cancer Inflammation Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Autoimmune diseases Conjunctivitis Muscle Multiple sclerosis Cirrhosis Cystic fibrosis Meningitis Folic acid Pulmonary alveolus Antibiotic Lupus erythematosus Dermatology Acne Gonorrhoea Gout Immunosuppressive drug Streptococcus pneumoniae Abscess AIDS Nutrition Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penicillin Traumatic brain injury Cardiovascular disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Osteoarthritis Homeopathy Gastroesophageal reflux disease Blood Legionellosis Coeliac disease Medical analysis of circumcision Cellulitis Sepsis Hepatitis Hypoglycemia Cephalic disorder IgA nephropathy Bronchitis Allergy Inflammatory bowel disease Emphysema Diarrhea Immune system Traditional Chinese medicine Pelvic inflammatory disease Malaria Virus Bacterial pneumonia Pharyngitis Helicobacter pylori Rheumatic fever Parkinson's disease Diabetes mellitus Eczema Guillain-Barr__ syndrome Otitis externa Atherosclerosis Candidiasis Antiviral drug Upper respiratory tract infection Biological warfare Wegener's granulomatosis Aortic dissection Fancy rat Erysipelas Bone marrow transplant Mastoiditis

could i have asthma or am i out of shape im average in weight ' and pounds but did not get much exercise when i was younger and would run out of breath doing simple things like walking up the stairs i used to think it was because i was out of shape but i am always out of breath i sat down to read for two hours the other day and could not stop breathing heavily sometimes i wake up to my alarm with a constricted feeling in my chest that doesn't go away during the day it has become a very annoying fixture in my life i have anxiety issues and the breathing gets worse when i am anxious but my symptoms are not exclusive to anxiety producing situations it might also be important to note that a parent is a chain smoker and smoked around me as a child i am now and do not smoke well it is best if you consult with your doctor first but on my opinion it could be either reason your body may not be used to exercising and you may not have a long endurance status and you just have to work up to it since you mentioned that you never got exercise when you were younger then again i wouldnt doubt the asthma part of it since i used to have asthma as well inhalers really do help since you have a constricted feeling in your chest as if you arent feeling that your getting as much air as your should be your lungs may very well be damaged from the second hand smoke you always breathed when you were younger thankfully you dont smoke now a sport that does help in both you situations is swimming first of all you said u didnt get alot of excercise and swimming is great for your body also it is great for treating asthma since it plays a role in breathing because you have to hold your breath as you keep practicing swimming then you will be able to breath longer and deeper and thats how i got rid of my asthma still an inhaler is great to have on handy  Asthma Drowning Tobacco smoking Bong Anxiety Diving Pneumonia Lung cancer Urinary incontinence Rebreather Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cannabis (drug) Bronchoconstriction Fire fighting Breastfeeding Angina Exercise Emphysema Hyperventilation Cocaine Shock Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Methamphetamine Allergy Sauna Hand grenade Lung Hypertension Diazepam Panic attack Transsexuality Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Chronic fatigue syndrome Opioid Equine conformation Mojave people Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder First aid Cancer of the larynx Blood (computer game) Muscle Tai Chi Chuan Breaststroke Cigarette Smoking Man Milton H.

asthma advair question someone told me that advair can could cause heart problems that it can could cause someones heart to stop is that true why or why not why would she say such a thing that isn't true the person told me it made her have heart problems but if that was true i wouldn't think that the fda would approve of the drug doctors wouldn't prescribe it i'm so worried about taking it now i'm going to see if my psycharist will help me take it tonight just in case i have a serious side effect of the medince just in case i have a allergic reaction to the medince since my whole family doesn't take things seriously should i have my psycharist help me take it tonight why or why not why does she think advair caused her heart problems i would like to check more into this because when my son was at the allergist on wed he lowered his advair from to and kept asking if he was having any chest pains he also started telling me that i shouldn't worry about things that god was in control and there was nothing i could do i had not idea what he was getting at i thought he was just trying to be nice to me at first the only thing i was worried about at the time was his weight because he weighed over lbs and is only going to be yrs old on i have not called him back over this because he is only in the office on wed and thurs i have not been able to sleep worrying about this i got up at am and started checking on the internet and found your message i am going to call his pediatrician this morning and make an appt because i think there is something to this i will freak out if he has something wrong with him and i was not told about that this medication can cause problems if you want i can report back what i found out there are a lot of medications that cause serious problems out there that the fda approves and the reason they do is because it is apparently worth the risk of fixing one problem and taking a chance that the other problems it could cause would not happen i am tired and i guess what i am trying to say is i think they feel it is better to treat the asthma and take a chance that you may never get the heart problem i know my dad had a brain tumor and the medication they gave him helped the tumor but in the process he developed luekemia which is what he died from i don't think it makes any sense but that is the way they do things i am not happy thinking that my son may have or develop heart problems and i think you should talk to someone i am definiately going to this morning do not stop taking it though it can be very dangerous and cause you to have an asthma attack i am still giving it to my son i am just going to have him checked out and that is what you should do i do not know how old you are but have your dr give you a ekg  Asthma Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Aspartame Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Debugging Social rule Avenue Q Traumatic brain injury Grandview, U.S.A.

asthma question what does wrosening of asthma mean using your inhaler more than u have ever before it means that your asthma is not under control anymore this happened to me all year what you need to do is get yourself to a pulmonologist a doctor who specializes in asthma and have him her re evaluate your situation they may have to adjust or add medications so you can keep your asthma and your attacks under control as you get older your respiratory system changes a little bit and your asthma can change worsen too are you on any preventative medication i'm on preventative meds plus an albuterol rescue inhaler keep your doctor informed of your situation especially if it is worsening if there's anything i've learned it's that you have to be on top of this and incredibly aware of what's going on your symptoms what's working and what's not if you have to write down when you're experiencing attacks how often what your symptoms are etc etc i see my pulmonologist again later this month and am hoping the new meds will give me an improved reading on my breathing tests good luck and please see your doctor  Asthma Medicine Pulmonology Pneumonia Migraine Allergy Tobacco smoking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Homeopathy Salbutamol Influenza Hay fever Prostate cancer Childbirth Breastfeeding Multiple sclerosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Placebo effect Folic acid Autism Traditional Chinese medicine Congestive heart failure Legionellosis Alternative medicine Sleep apnea Clinical depression Epilepsy Terri Schiavo Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Atrial septal defect Rabies Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Pulmonary hypertension Drowning Propranolol Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Star Wars: Galaxies Chlamydophila pneumoniae Extreme Programming First aid Physical therapy Air pollution Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Myasthenia gravis Malaria Triage Lung cancer Parkinson's disease AIDS Methylsulfonylmethane Hypoglycemia Hypothermia Multiple chemical sensitivity Bronchitis Duesberg hypothesis Fecal incontinence Myocardial infarction Botulism Potassium bromide Acute respiratory distress syndrome Heliox Stroke Growth hormone treatment Insulin Medical record Stuttering Mesothelioma Gastroesophageal reflux disease Obesity Diabetic neuropathy Milton H.

what is desert lung what are the symptoms how to cure what is cocci the sunny southwest was a great place for training the fliers of world war ii but it turned out to have a special medical problem the young airmen and crews at the large flying fields built in the southwest by the army air corps came down with a feverish illness at an alarming rate the disease that the fliers had contracted was what local people called valley fever desert fever or san joaquin valley fever the technical name is coccidiodomycosis kok sid dee oy do my ko sis or cocci for short cocci is a sickness of degree most people catching it do not get sick at all they don't even know they have the disease of those who do get sick most have flu like symptoms this is what happened to the airmen only a very small percentage of cocci patients develops the disease in its serious or disseminated form widespread throughout the body what causes cocci cocci is a fungus disease caused by a tiny form of plant life somewhat like yeast or mildew the tiny seeds called spores are found in dust and are inhaled into the lungs but they can spread to other parts of the body too in rare cases infection may result when the fungus filled dust settles in a skin scratch the problem of the swirling desert dusts was partially solved by the air corps when it learned to control dust stirred up along runways through irrigation and planting grass or laying more concrete infected soil is the danger the disease is not spread from human to human after one bout with cocci the body develops immunity to a second infection small desert animals such as gophers and some domestic animals may be infected by inhaling the spores but they do not spread the infection to human beings who gets cocci the disease may occur in any resident of the infected areas or a visitor often offering a diagnostic puzzle to the doctor back home people most likely to be exposed are those in dusty occupations such as farm workers earth movers and archaeologists however the more serious or disseminated form of cocci is many times more frequent in non white people and those with impaired immune systems persons between the ages of and are most likely to develop symptoms of the disease although people of all ages can have symptoms in its simple form with the flu like symptoms cocci affects both men and women equally but the serious form of the disease is found more often in men than in non pregnant women pregnant women seem to be more susceptible to the serious form how the spores affect the body floating freely in clouds of dust the tiny cocci spores enter the body when they are inhaled most never get anywhere the body's wonderful defense system works too well the spores get caught in sticky mucus inside the air tubes and are moved back up into the throat where they are either spit out or swallowed harmlessly but some few cocci spores do continue the invasion they work their way down the air tubes to the end of the passage the little air sacs of the lung where the air ends up when it is inhaled deep in the lung the spores begin to grow they develop into pods that are filled with even tinier seeds the pods burst open the seeds pour out and spread in the lung and sometimes to other parts of the body and wherever the spores settle down the body reacts with inflammation in the lungs little patches of inflammation develop around the spores cavities or scars may result and eventually deposits of calcium when the spores stay in the lungs the disease is said to be in its primary form when the fungus spreads throughout the body to the internal organs bones brain and even the skin cocci is in its disseminated form symptoms perhaps as many as to percent of all people infected with cocci develop no symptoms at all some to percent do get sick usually within one to three weeks after the cocci spores invade the body fever may go as high as degrees there are usually aches and pains and a cough a week or two after the fever develops some patients get a rash that resembles the measles there may also be tender red spots on the sins and pains in the joints usually symptoms disappear within a month or so though full return of energy may take some months the disseminated form of the disease is a great deal more serious with very high fever and extreme fatigue it has been estimated that about one percent of white patients develops the disseminated form of the disease but in ten to twenty percent of dark skinned patients cocci progresses to its disseminated form it can be fatal diagnosis usually diagnosis is made on the basis of one or more of the following three types of tests recovery of the cocci organisms from sputum phlegm or some other body fluid blood tests that reflect the body's reaction to the presence of the fungus and skin tests many people without the disease may have a skin reaction in some cases a biopsy may be needed these tests are quite reliable but they may fluctuate according to the stage of the disease the tests are not positive in every case of cocci in some instances the diagnosis may rest on circumstantial evidence particularly for people living in an area of the southwest where much cocci is found in most cases however these tests are helpful chest x rays reveal some of the abnormalities associated with cocci but the shadows may be mistaken for those of tuberculosis or some other lung disease treatment patients suffering from the flu like symptoms of cocci in its primary form will probably be sent to bed by the doctor symptoms such as cough and fever will be treated for the disseminated form of the disease a variety of drugs are now available occasionally surgery is recommended to remove a diseased portion of the lung bone or skin the future there are many mysteries yet unraveled about cocci and better methods both to prevent and treat the disease remain to be found simple avoidance of infected areas is probably best for newcomers among black mexican and filipino adults those who have lived there since childhood may well have developed a kind of immunity to the disease that newcomers do not have methods for the control and sterilization of dust are being studied and improved some research including work on a vaccine is now being done on ways to make people immune to cocci when to check with your doctor about cocci anyone living or traveling in the southwest united states should be aware of cocci and suspicious of flu like symptoms fever aches and pains and a cough these may disappear in a day or two without treatment on the other hand the symptoms might indicate serious illness such as flu or cocci it is wise always to check with a doctor because only he can tell more information can be obtained by calling your local american lung association at lungusa

why is my chest popping sternum area i was in a car accident year ago it was pretty bad i t boned a mini van that pulled out in front of me i had a twisted vertebrae and strained muscles and ligiments in my back i also sustained air bag burns to arms and face my chest had a laseration across the middle due to the seatbelt it hurt then and was told that nothing showed up on the x rays now my chest has been popping for some time now what could this be you should go back to your doctor and let him or her know about this x rays taken at the time of your accident are not current there are a couple of things i would wonder about first it could be scar tissue which is less flexible and may be making this popping noise as fibers in it break second it is possible to have leakage of air from your lungs into the mediastinum the area in your chest that's kind of between your lungs that air can be trapped in the tissue and then 'pop' as it's pushed out by muscular action it also may be from some arthritic changes in your ribs from damage from the accident in any case your doctor can check it out and let you know for sure good luck  Equine conformation Sternum Professional wrestling holds Lung Autopsy Tetrapod Drowning Scar Rib Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling throws Muscle Weight training Traumatic brain injury Tyrannosaurus rex Aortic dissection Asthma Lung cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma X-ray Internal oblique Fecal incontinence Myocardial infarction Pneumothorax Diving Vertebra Nuclear explosion Crash test dummy Professional wrestling attacks Optical fiber Peripheral nervous system Swimming Boxing The Empty Child Single bullet theory Myasthenia gravis Sin City Characters of Lost Electric shock Scoliosis Snake Duchenne muscular dystrophy Anatomy Piccolo Junior Saga Mesothelioma Chest Abdomen The Ashlee Simpson Show Radiation therapy Bone Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Action potential Butterfly stroke Menstrual cup The Shining (film) Spina bifida Lightning The Inside Sperm Whale Fast bowling Professional wrestling aerial techniques Medicine Ventricular fibrillation Link (Legend of Zelda) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Becker's muscular dystrophy Captain Thunderbolt Acne Asbestos Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dinosaur Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Larynx Swingout Car safety Tobacco smoking Humerus Metastasis Mediastinum The Contender (television series) Stephen King Mechanical ventilation Backbreaker Airbag Hip fracture Futurama (TV series - season 3) Breech birth Wound healing phases Gesture

what are the medical tests for ms multiple sclerosis ms is a disease that is extremely difficult to diagnose the reasons for this include more than symptoms are linked to ms and each person develops symptoms differently many of the symptoms mimic problems that occur with other diseases there is no blood test for ms yet symptoms usually come and go many symptoms are vague and hard to quantify such as fatigue sexual dysfunction depression and cognitive difficulties these often get attributed to stress by general practitioners and patients may never referred to a neurologist in my case the neurologist that finally diagnosed me estimated that i had ms for at least years before my diagnosis based on things that he saw on an mri sure enough i could think back that many years to a series of tremors sensory symptoms and cognitive clues which took me to many doctors including some neurologists but never resulted in a diagnosis things are improving on this front because of the increased use of mris which allow neurologists and radiologists to actually take a look at the brain and spinal cord for characteristic ms lesions however ms is still a very tricky disease to definitively diagnose and the process may require patience it is important to find a neurologist that you feel comfortable with and have confidence in to work on your diagnosis after all if you do have ms this person will likely be your partner in health for a long time diagnostic tests and procedures magnetic resonance imaging mri scan mris use magnetic waves to produce images of the brain and spinal cord a special contrast material gadolinium is usually injected for the scan when ms is suspected as it reacts to areas of inflammation and will light up when a lesion is active indicating demyelination is occurring the mri does not hurt but can be a strange experience it helps if you know what to expect during this test there are also some things you can do to make your experience better as mentioned this is considered the best test for diagnosing ms as abnormal lesions appear on mris in over of people with ms however of people with ms do not have abnormalities that can be detected on an mri producing a false negative and some age related damage looks like ms lesions producing a false positive medical history the doctor will ask a number of questions about the symptoms that you are currently experiencing and any that you have experienced in the past it is a good idea to make a symptom log before you see the doctor listing any sort of symptom that you have had in the past how long it lasted and other information about it list all symptoms even if other doctors told you there was nothing wrong in addition take all other medical information along including which prescription drugs you are on any medical test results you may have and other doctors findings you will also be asked several questions about medical history of relatives drug and alcohol use as well as other health issues that you may have had in the past all of this information will help a neurologist piece together a picture to help determine if ms is a likely diagnosis neurologic exam the doctor will be testing for the following functioning of the cranial nerves these control the senses as well as how you talk and swallow coordination strength reflexes sensation he will do this by having you perform tasks like touching your nose then his finger in succession touching you with various instruments and having you report a sensation or looking for a response himself and doing an examination of your eyes these tests do not hurt the entire test will probably last about minutes but may be as long as two hours evoked potential testing three main types of evoked potential tests are used in the diagnosis of ms each of these tests requires that electrodes are attached to your scalp and connected to an electroencephalograph eeg to record brainwaves in response to different stimuli the different tests are brainstem auditory evoked potentials baep a series of clicks are played in each ear through headphones visual evoked potentials vep a series of checkerboard patterns are displayed on a screen sensory evoked potentials sep mild electrical shocks are administered to an arm or leg the doctor is looking for both the size of the response and the speed in which the brain receives the signal weaker or slow signals may indicate that demyelination has occurred and that ms is a possibility however this test is also not specific to ms and abnormalities could indicate another problem a series of all three tests could take up to two hours to complete

career as a respiratory therapist i'm currently taking prerequisite courses for the respiratory therapy program i wanted to know the pros and cons of the career to those of you that are respiratory therapist do you find your job as stressful or equal to a rn respiratory therapy is good because you don't have to deal with feces and urine you do have to work with sputum and blood if you don't like operating needles then you might have trouble performing arterial blood gases rts have more patients than nurses do you would have less one on one patient contact than as a nurse some nurses only have a few patients an rt might have or that's a lot of chest x rays blood gases and treatment information to remember i think the best thing for you to do is shadow an rt and a nurse chances are that your rt program prerequisites can be used to get you into a nursing program also from my experience my rt program didn't have a cut off there was not a problem getting clinical placements and i went straight through the nursing program at my college was bad for benching people on waiting lists because they had so many people wanting to become nurses it was very hard work and at times seemed impossible however i made it through with a lot of studying and determination compared to how my mom is when she comes home from work i think that rts are not as attached to their patients and therefore less likely to 'bring their work home' with them an rt program would be less difficult to get into less difficult to stay in and would get you a very good job when you graduated i would talk to nursing and rt students who are nearing the end of their programs to gauge how it was for them  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Physical therapy Prostate cancer Pneumonia Nurse Medicine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Stomach cancer Transsexuality Stroke Lung cancer Aortic dissection Dialysis Psychoanalysis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Asthma Medical record Insulin Reparative therapy Occupational Therapy Cancer Urinary incontinence Childbirth Bronchitis Alternative medicine Traumatic brain injury Paralegal Myocardial infarction Hypertension Dissociative identity disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Paramedic Migraine Intravenous therapy Multiple sclerosis Breast cancer Cognitive therapy Pulmonology Palliative care Social rule Emergency department Diabetes mellitus Cytomegalovirus Chiropractic Reflexology Education in Portugal Legionellosis Hypoglycemia Borderline personality disorder Folic acid Tocopherol Psoriasis Obstetrics Graduate school Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chlorpromazine Addiction AIDS Tai Chi Chuan Traumatic incident reduction Post-traumatic stress disorder Aspergillosis Electroconvulsive therapy Group A streptococcal infection Milton H.

how many people with copd aspirate during anesthesia any information or websites would be a great help thanks the copd should not by itself change the rate of aspiration the more important factor is the presence of gastro esophageal reflux and or hiatal hernia there is a chance of aspiration with any anesthetic but small a tube into the trachea does protect the lungs but it's gotta come out sometime so there is always a risk thus you just wait until your patient is awake enough to cough and keep their airway cleared  Gastroesophageal reflux disease Intubation Esophageal cancer Mechanical ventilation Hiatus hernia Pneumonia Brachial plexus Pulmonary aspiration Asthma Cancer Lung cancer Drowning Liquid breathing Cancer of the larynx Malignant melanoma Urinary incontinence Anesthesia Lung Inguinal hernia Local anesthesia Epidural General anaesthesia Adjustable gastric band Cystic fibrosis Heartburn Prostate cancer Achalasia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bronchitis Stroke Pulmonary alveolus Obstetrics AIDS Endotracheal tube Pulmonary embolism Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Mesothelioma Esophageal atresia Needle aspiration biopsy Acute respiratory distress syndrome Opioid Abortion Pulmonary hypertension Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tobacco smoking Chest tube Trachea In vitro fertilisation Cephalic disorder Radiation therapy Esophageal speech Diabetic retinopathy Route of administration Abdominal thrusts Intraocular lens Esophagus Traumatic brain injury Helicobacter pylori Sodium thiopental Hernia Barrett's esophagus Premature birth Common cold Wheeze Spirometry Respiratory acidosis Caffeine Shock Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lifestyle diseases (alternative medicine) Respiratory tract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lethal injection Human lung Thoracentesis CO2 retention Hepatitis C Emergency medical technician Obesity Cholecystitis Heliox First aid Larynx General anaesthetic Intravenous therapy Caesarean section Tuberculosis Health issues and the effects of cannabis Alzheimer's disease Peptic ulcer Nurse anesthetist Coeliac disease LASIK Publicly funded medicine Malignant hyperthermia Electroconvulsive therapy Respiratory system Medical analysis of circumcision Polycystic kidney disease

what about the tb shot i have to get a tb shot tomorrow and i know i will have to go back hours later so it can be read i got mine when i was young but i don't remember much does it hurt what is the procedure like hi have you ever been hospitalized and given intravenous medications isn't it that before they give these meds especially penicillins they have to do skin testing to know if you are allergic to the drug this is the same procedure they do in tb shots or ppd purified protein derivative the inject the a tiny amount of the medication just underneath the skin later it becomes reddish and if a nodule will be formed they will measure the largest diameter of this to determine whether it is a positive or a negative result this can only be done after hours because some of the reactions are delayed and cannot be detected right away to be truthful its the most painful kind of injection more so than just plunging the needle in the muscles this is because the nerves for pain are located just underneath the skin and they are touched during the procedure don't worry it will just take a few seconds  Allergy Prostate cancer Insulin Mantoux test Intravenous therapy Lumbar puncture Rheumatoid arthritis Local anesthesia Childbirth Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lethal injection Obstetrics Asthma Group A streptococcal infection Tuberculin Route of administration Cocaine Myocardial infarction Sleep apnea Breast cancer Tuberculosis Penicillin Hay fever Carpal tunnel syndrome First aid Needle aspiration biopsy Traumatic brain injury Tattoo Acne Anesthesia Amiodarone Polymerase chain reaction Penis Malignant melanoma Epidural Acupuncture Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Nuclear medicine Technetium Methylsulfonylmethane Cancer Stopping power Hypoglycemia Massage Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cardiac stress test Animal testing Botulin toxin Eczema Gastroparesis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Ultraviolet Narcotic Paracetamol Chiropractic Psoriasis Syphilis Action potential Scar Immunosuppressive drug Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Malaria Gout 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Herpes simplex virus Narcolepsy HIV Diazepam Dialysis Enzyme Stroke Caffeine Thimerosal Coeliac disease Multiple chemical sensitivity Weight training Anthrax Atherosclerosis Growth hormone deficiency Chlorpromazine STS-62 Apollo 8 Spider Fecal incontinence

what does a respiratory therapist do my friend is one and was telling me that she saves lives all the time i don't want to be rude and ask how exactly she saves lives so i thought i'd ask on here any clue respiratory therapists do many things breathing treatments ventilator management patient education respiratory assessment of patients obtain arterial blood gases to evaluate the respiratory system perform pulmonary function testing to evaluate and assess lung disease evaluate patients for appropriate oxygen devices monitor patients who are on oxygen in the hospital home and other health care facilities treat patients in hospitals in the home long term care facilities etc assist with codes in the hospital providing an airway by intubation if necessary and by performing compressions cpr treat all patient populations some rts specifically work with babies most work on everyone suctioning via the mouth nose or tracheostomy and many more things rts are important members of the health care team the rt is completely disposable everything that an rt can do can also be done by doctors and nurses but neither is specialized in those procedures we know more about all things respiratory than do nurses and almost equal to regular doctors we save lives improve the quality of life in our patients and provide education to patients their families and other health care professionals  Physical therapy Mechanical ventilation Pneumonia Acute respiratory distress syndrome Nurse Traumatic brain injury Asthma Childbirth Emergency Medical Services Triage Publicly funded medicine Medical record Lung Myocardial infarction General anaesthesia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Emergency department Sleep apnea Obstetrics Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Stroke Psychiatry Emphysema Liquid breathing Palliative care Prostate cancer Respiratory system Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Drowning Cancer Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Pulmonology Artificial respiration Lung cancer Atrial septal defect Pulmonary alveolus Intubation American Red Cross Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bronchitis Public health in mainland China Terri Schiavo timeline Anesthesia Physical examination Cytomegalovirus Certified Nursing Assistant Cardiac arrest Tracheotomy Traditional Chinese medicine General practitioner Myasthenia gravis Circulatory system Occupational Therapy Ebola Pulmonary hypertension Nursing National Institutes of Health AIDS Continuous positive airway pressure Cystic fibrosis Terri Schiavo Clinical depression Medicare (Canada) Botulism Pulmonary edema Mental Health Act 1983 Massage Heliox Medical prescription Tobacco smoking Urinary incontinence Endotracheal tube Pulmonary embolism Health insurance Aortic dissection Decompression sickness Euthanasia Intracranial pressure Ambulance Psychiatric hospital Hydrogen sulfide Diabetes mellitus Computed tomography Apnea Pharmaceutical company Duchenne muscular dystrophy Death Coronary catheterization Medical malpractice

how reliable accurate are pulse oximeter results without going into a complicated history which involves my son being diagnosed first with asthma like problem then with pneumonia then with pneumonia asthma please tell me if oxigentation measurement done by a pulse oximiter is a reliable indicator of a problem in the absense of other symptoms my year old is behaiving fine eating again and being playful and energetic no breathing problems no wheezing or crackles oxigen was shown to be at this freaked the dr out and she gave us an inhailer with albuterol i don't want to use it my son hates this stuff i'm puzzled at being confronted with a normally behaving child who coughs a little and an oxygen reading which says he needs breathing treatments pulse oximeters are reasonably accurate most of the time it's important to treat the patient not the equipment when in doubt an arterial blood gas is accurate the normal oxygen saturation for a normal healthy person is even when i was having lots of trouble with asthma when i was first diagnosed i was always or better sometimes a pulse oximeter doesn't read properly because of movement light getting to the sensor plastic nails anemia nail polish poor circulation aberrant hemoglobins and there are a few other reasons for a poor reading if your son was at saturation that's low but not critical depending on how your doctor diagnoses asthma she might be very observant and uses all the potential symptoms to see disease there is a possibility that your doctor thinks a cough and low pulse oximeter reading mean that your son has asthma needing treatment depending on the intensity of the cough i would probably agree i think the cough is the most important sign of asthma that you have described if the cough was severe i think your son would have been prescribed an inhaled steroid for daily use if you have an albuterol inhaler for your son what does it say to do with it use x inhalations y or z times a day as needed use x inhalations every four hours maybe your doctor was just being prudent and giving you the resources to treat your son if he has an asthma attack for some background i have asthma i have normal breath sounds a cough that improves with albuterol or inhaled steroid depending on how bad it is i don't cough anything out i get short of breath when working hard i can function just fine in normal activity my pulse ox runs consistently my breathing is normal when i am not symptomatic and you wouldn't be able to tell that i have asthma by looking at me sometimes i use a treatment or two a week of albuterol and sometimes i go on advair because my cough gets bad it all depends on the weather air pollution stress and any asthma triggers i am exposed to i was diagnosed because i had a horrible cough that wouldn't go away  Cystic fibrosis Hypertension Stroke Insulin Myocardial infarction Traumatic brain injury Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Decompression sickness Acute respiratory distress syndrome Cancer Prostate cancer Anemia Sickle-cell disease Hypoglycemia Sleep apnea Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Urinary incontinence Migraine First aid Psoriasis Pulse oximeter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Group A streptococcal infection Malaria Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atrial septal defect Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Triage Atherosclerosis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Bipolar disorder Emphysema Lung cancer Carbon dioxide Shock Growth hormone treatment Hay fever Aortic dissection Lupus erythematosus Epilepsy Clinical depression Pulmonary embolism Anxiety Blood pressure AIDS Radiation therapy Common cold Coronary heart disease Anorexia nervosa Cirrhosis Autism Fire fighting Osteoporosis Crohn's disease Tobacco smoking AIDS reappraisal Post-traumatic stress disorder Eczema Osteoarthritis Psychosis Controversies in autism Pulmonary alveolus Sleep Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mesothelioma Tocopherol Traditional Chinese medicine Leukemia Sewage treatment Mastocytosis Haloalkane Cardiac arrest Schizophrenia Chlamydophila pneumoniae Legionellosis M__ni__re___s disease Turner syndrome Vitamin C Nutrition Chlorpromazine Rabies Propranolol

when i run i can't breathe asthma or something else this may seem like an odd question to post on yahoo q a but i figured i'd wing it out there before eventually making a dr appointment somewhere ever since high school i've had a hard problem breathing when i run i was in marching band since i was and it never affected me during marching band etc unless we had to run i'm fine walking fast but jogging give me minor breathing problems where it seems that my heart is beating too fast and i can't catch up to myself internally when i finish running or jogging etc my entire body feels overexerted like i'm going to pass out or something and my heart beats very fast my mother's side of the family has an asthmatic history with my mother having the worst case with near death experiences due to her asthma and my oldest brother years older used to have it bad but his died down a bit and my other brother mos older doesn't have it at all my brothers and i didn't go to dr growing up from anyhow so possible asthma thanks for all your comments if it helps i don't jog or run regularly however i do swim at times and don't have any problems swimming no matter how fast i swim i'm ' and weigh about or so that's pretty normal it is possible you may or may not have asthema or other health problems but you can also be healthy and have that problem it all has to do with being strong and in shape when you lift weights your muscles get sore in the same way your heart is a muscle when you run it works harder movig more blood and air through your body at the same time your lungs have to work harder too if you don't run alot your heart and lungs are not in shape or used to it so it's normal to feel that way if you run more and more your heart and lungs become stronger and you are more able to handle it but even athletes face that to an extent so it's not that it isn't perfectly normal it's ok for running to be hard but the only thing is don't overdo it or do more than your body can handle if you really want to run start slow and just do a little then work your way up to more and more as you desire i would also recommend keeping up with your target heart rate you can google target heart rate and find lots of information about that find out how to measure yours the range you need to be in and work to stay within that range you could also talk to a health professional like a personal trainer or your doctor about that if you think you might have asthma or anything else find out about that too just remember that those are seperate things best of luck  Asthma Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Drowning Prostate cancer Running Urinary incontinence Muscle Social rule Dieting Pneumonia Pitaten Swimming Stomach cancer Diabetes mellitus Weight training Anorexia nervosa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Heart Cancer Diving Exercise Cardiac arrhythmia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Myocardial infarction Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Decompression sickness Childbirth Fecal incontinence Breaststroke First aid EastEnders Kender Lung cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tobacco smoking Time Out of Mind Aspartame Shock Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Tocopherol Butterfly stroke Unreal Piccolo Junior Saga Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic brain injury Aerial (dance move) Carbon dioxide Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cocaine Babe Ruth Blood (computer game) Computer virus Sport rowing Backstroke Death Poliomyelitis Mattress Physical examination Knife Lung Psoriasis Shen Gong Wu Coeliac disease Heart rate Milton H.

throat swab i have been coughing a lot latley it's that kind of cough you get from congestion in the chest my throat isn't sore or anything and other than that i feel fine so do you think they'll have to do the throat swab i've never known of having to have a throat swab strep test without having a sore throat the dr will usually ask me if i have been exposed to strep and then offer me the strep test to be sure if your coughing is coming from the chest and not from a scratchy throat i don't think you have to worry about having a throat swab you can also let your dr know you would prefer not to have one unless he she feels it is absolutely necessary which i doubt they will push one on you under the circumstances best of luck hope you feel better soon  Group A streptococcal infection Streptococcus Common cold Rheumatic fever Pneumonia Deep Throat (Watergate) Infectious mononucleosis Nasal congestion Philosophical skepticism Cocaine Pertussis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Breastfeeding Upper respiratory tract infection Transmission (medicine) Hay fever Urinary incontinence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cytomegalovirus Drowning Treehouse of Horror IX Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma W.

recovery time from pulmonary embolism does anyone have any ideas on how long the recovery time is i had a pulmonary embolism blood clots in lungs about month ago i'm fatigued but no chest or breathing problems there is no recovery time for the pulmonary embolism what you need to remember is the condition which you have recently suffered is potentially fatal i am not threatening you but it is true as per the study half the people who suffer pulmonary embolism would not show any symptoms at all if you have had an episode of pulmonary embolism you are always at the risk of developing another episode sooner or later i would recommend you need to discuss with your doctor about the options that are available to prevent further occurrence of this condition the preventive measures range from weight reduction reduction of smoking mobility using stockings and regular anti coagulant blood thinning drugs mean time if you experience sudden onset of breathlessness and chest pain seek medical attention asap please do not underestimate this condition hope this helps regards  Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Stroke Traumatic brain injury Pulmonary hypertension Asthma Decompression sickness Multiple sclerosis Atrial fibrillation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Air embolism Lung cancer Deep vein thrombosis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Atrial septal defect Pneumonia Hip fracture Tobacco smoking Intravenous therapy Emphysema Chest pain Apoplexy Oral contraceptive Coeliac disease Mesothelioma Panic attack Tuberculosis Hypertension Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Childbirth Folic acid Paracetamol First aid Anticoagulant Equine conformation Medicine Sickle-cell disease Aspartame Anorexia nervosa Narcolepsy Diabetes mellitus Aneurysm Atherosclerosis Psoriasis Osteoporosis Lung Obstetrics Migraine Shock Miscarriage Stomach cancer Respiratory system Aortic dissection Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pulmonology Breastfeeding Repetitive strain injury Aspergillosis Obesity Medical cannabis Cannabis (drug) Anxiety Acupuncture Angina Abortion Physical therapy Urinary incontinence Malaria Sleeping sickness Cystic fibrosis Bipolar disorder AIDS Amiodarone Myasthenia gravis Mitral regurgitation Pope John Paul I Lupus erythematosus Psychosis Crohn's disease Turner syndrome Drowning Radiation poisoning Growth hormone treatment Parkinson's disease Electrocardiogram Schizophrenia

is there a way to get asthma medication without health insurance when i was diagnosed with asthma while living in the us my doctor gave me a large box no joking of physician samples of the inhaled steroid he thought would work i obtained medication that way for four months basically it cost to get diagnosed and every two months to go back and get more meds i really don't know how much it would have cost otherwise likely far more the poster who mentioned wal mart's prescriptions is partly correct i have seen the list of medications available and unless you're on albuterol unit doses for a nebulizer then there isn't much there for you even then only gets you unit doses which is days at maximum dose there are no inhaled steroids or inhalers on that list unfortunately you will likely have to pay out of pocket for your asthma medication it's important for you to know that if you are prescribed an inhaled steroid it might be expensive and also be the backbone of your asthma control i've found that my albuterol salbutamol doesn't do as much to stop my coughing as my advair does since i started on advair month i've been in control and feeling good if you don't have much money and will have to pay out of pocket please inform your doctor of this instead of advair month you could get the same effect with albuterol and flovent at lower cost this doesn't work as well but much better than either alone for price dry powder inhalers dpis tend to be most expensive these are advair spiriva pulmicort symbicort flovent and there are a few others they tend to be long acting bronchodilators and inhaled steroids also being generally the newest drugs next most expensive are unit doses for nebulizers these are usually short acting bronchodilators and you would have to buy a nebulizer with air compressor to use them albuterol by unit dose usually runs about dose and you might have to take it x a day that can get pretty expensive fast drugs available by nebulizer are albuterol atrovent duoneb pulmicort xopenex and there are a few others the most inexpensive although still fairly expensive are metered dose inhalers mdis this is what is commonly called an inhaler they usually hold a hundred doses of medication each these are the most portable and normally don't require additional equipment to use drugs available this way are albuterol atrovent combivent like duoneb flovent and a variety of other inhaled steroids advair xopenex and there are many more this is probably the best and most cost effective way to get your medication there are a bunch of different inhaled steroids only available as mdis too far more than there are as dpis to make an mdi work more efficiently a holding chamber might be prescribed it's a plastic tube that holds the medication so that patient co ordination is less critical these cost about and are washable if i was without insurance and needed medication i would either continue to get physician samples like i did when i was in the us or i would try to get my medications as mdis for greatest economy and portability  Health insurance Salbutamol Pharmaceutical company Publicly funded medicine Medical prescription Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone treatment Folic acid Cannabis (drug) Prescription drug Common cold Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Drug addiction Migraine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cystic fibrosis Medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Hay fever Homeopathy Canadian and American health care systems compared Clinical depression Insurance Medicare (United States) Bong Physician COX-2 inhibitor Medicare (Canada) Prostate cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Multiple sclerosis Bipolar disorder Pneumonia Antipsychotic Alternative medicine Radiation therapy Intravenous therapy Animal testing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Growth hormone deficiency Candidiasis Rabies Obesity Internal ballistics General practitioner Endometriosis Paracetamol Malaria Carbon dioxide Welding Stomach cancer Microeconomics Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Rebreather Schizophrenia Tobacco smoking Duesberg hypothesis Drug abuse Cocaine Propranolol Health maintenance organization Psychiatry Maprotiline Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Illegal drug trade Arguments for and against drug prohibition Androgen insensitivity syndrome Food and Drug Administration Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tianeptine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Clinical trial Asbestos Economics Antidepressant Menstrual cycle Hydrogen sulfide Diazepam Health care in Canada Health care in the United States Gross domestic product Pharmacopoeia CPU design Epilepsy Allergy Diabetes mellitus

anyone use the inhaler albuterol this is the nd time my doctor has prescribed me this inhaler i had congestion in my chest and weezing i have never used this inhaler because one of the major side effects is increased heart rate and it makes you anxious i am afraid to use the inhaler b c i have anxiety problems panic attacks i feel that if i use the inhaler and feel my heart beat faster it will cause me to panic to all those who have used this please let me know how you feel when you use it i have been using salbutamol albuterol since january and only once has my heart rate increased noticeably when it did it was because i was under a ton of stress and i used inhalations in about an hour to stop my coughing it worked alright but i was shaking and heart rate was in the 's in a few hours it wore off and i was fine what i did is not recommended and that's why i had a side effect taking more than your doctor prescribes can cause an increased incidence of side effects since you get anxious easily then you might benefit from xopenex xopenex is stronger than albuterol more expensive and is used for heart patients commonly because of the reduced incidence of increased heart rate i recommend that you talk to your doctor about your medication if you are prescribed something and you don't use it then you don't have any benefit from it albuterol is one of the most benign medications i know of it's the respiratory equivalent of tylenol for problems that it causes some patients do have trouble with it because of heart problems allergy and unknown reason for increased incidence of side effects they go on xopenex when this is known most people do well on albuterol  Asthma Pneumonia Cystic fibrosis Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer Cannabis (drug) Drowning Clomipramine Panic attack Salbutamol Tobacco smoking Paracetamol Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Urinary incontinence Cocaine Lung cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Stomach cancer Childbirth Sleep apnea Hypertension Parkinson's disease Bipolar disorder Maprotiline Psoriasis Allergy 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Folic acid Tocopherol Insomnia Transsexuality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Traumatic brain injury Hay fever Mesothelioma Medical cannabis Obesity Acute respiratory distress syndrome Hypoglycemia Anorexia nervosa Propranolol Medicine Antidepressant Tai Chi Chuan Haloperidol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Gastroesophageal reflux disease COX-2 inhibitor Rebreather Bong Diabetes mellitus Migraine Growth hormone treatment Breastfeeding Meditation Asbestos Chlorpromazine Amphetamine Isotretinoin Cardiac arrhythmia Stroke Angina Medical prescription Shock Arguments for and against drug prohibition Atherosclerosis Insulin Amiodarone Diazepam Cardiovascular disease Coronary heart disease Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Multiple sclerosis Reflexology Health insurance Obsessive-compulsive disorder Multiple chemical sensitivity Alcoholism Physical examination Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Weight training Buprenorphine Aortic dissection Tianeptine Triage Baldness

how is asthma diagnosed what kind of test do they do asthma is in fact a clinical diagnosis based more on symptoms than tests it is characterised by a triad of cough wheeze and breathlessness sometimes accompanied by mucous production it is sometimes loosely defined as reversible airways disease pulmonary function tests are often used to quantify and check the progress of the disease but they do not define it and can often be normal the nearest to a specific test is perhaps the histamine challenge test where patients are subjected to a combination of histamine and exertion in order to produce wheeze again though this test can be useful it is potentially dangerous and always unpleasant additionally if an asthmatic is particularly stable at the time the test is carried out it may give a false negative finally asthma is much more a disease of young children than older children or adults the largest group of significant asthmatics are years old within these ages neither pulmonary function tests nor histamine challenge can be performed anyway  Allergy Hypoglycemia Atrial septal defect HIV test Cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Myocardial infarction Wheeze Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Diabetes mellitus Myasthenia gravis Pneumonia Lung cancer Aspergillosis Sleep apnea Hay fever Traumatic brain injury Atherosclerosis Emphysema Homeopathy Coeliac disease Food allergy Pulmonary hypertension Autism Bronchiolitis Cystic fibrosis Prostate cancer Sickle-cell disease Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Medicine Bipolar disorder Cardiac stress test Ataxia telangiectasia Physical therapy Propranolol Goodpasture's syndrome Aspartame Stroke Psychosis Duchenne muscular dystrophy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pulmonary embolism Diagnosis Anemia Breast cancer Tuberculosis AIDS AIDS reappraisal Rheumatoid arthritis Pulmonary alveolus Anxiety Growth hormone treatment Dementia Prenatal diagnosis Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Mental retardation Mesothelioma Duesberg hypothesis Alzheimer's disease Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Turner syndrome Immunoglobulin E IgA nephropathy Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Aortic dissection Histamine Angina Stomach cancer Psychiatry Syphilis Mastocytosis Autism rights movement Erectile dysfunction Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Dissociative identity disorder Fluticasone Group A streptococcal infection Chest pain Tocopherol Heartburn Motor neurone disease Medical analysis of circumcision Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcolepsy Leukemia Schizophrenia

why can't i stand smokers i've always hated it when those close to me smoke i get this overwhelming feeling of disappointment and anger i really can't control it i know it's because my grandpa died of lung cancer and my uncle is now paralyzed from a stroke due to smoking and drinking no one else really smokes in my family just my grandpa and uncle when i found out my bestfriend smoked i was so angry i told her i was disappointed and thought she should quit today i found out my bf started to smoke he said sorry to disappoint me usually i would storm out in anger but i've learned that i can't force people to stop smoking so i told him not to do it around me or even let me see the pack i have also requested that from my bestfriend for some reason i always have this heavy weight on my chest when i see something like that i know not seeing it won't change what i'm feeling but it'll make me forget even for a moment i really just want to smack them instead of being calm i can't accept it it's understandable really especially those who have lost someone close to them you can't help but think god how can people be so idiotic to smoke it is only going to kill them quicker i know i feel that anger being a smoker before what stopped me was watching a video on youtube go figure basically have your friends do this get a fresh kleenex inhale and hold the smoke in your mouth blow it onto the kleenex inhale the pull and then blow out you will notice how much tar there is from not inhaling and then on the other blow there is hardly any thus meaning all that tar is going somewhere in your lungs ever since seeing that i've quit smoking how gross you can't force people but you can tell them how it makes you feel and why  Tobacco smoking Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Smoking pipe Cigarette Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cigarette Smoking Man One Piece minor characters Lung cancer Causality Cannabis (drug) Cancer of the larynx Drowning Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan EastEnders God Emperor of Dune Megan Griffin Tobacco Humphrey Bogart Characters of Lost Medical cannabis Milton H.

cystic fibrosis and lupus my boyfriend has cf and his last dr visit they tested him for lupus one of his test came back and its not looking too great we're waiting for the other one my question is with his cf how much more of a toll would lupus have on him i want to talk to him but he's a bit shooken up and trying to figure out how to tell his dad im just trying to stay strong for him and let him lean on me so anyone that can help me i appreciate it so much thanks i have cystic fibrosis but am not very familiar with lupus so my comments are based on some quick internet research since lupus is an auto immune disease and your boyfriend already has cf his body is going to attack areas of his body that are healthy in addition to those that may already be damaged or compromised by the cf one of the side effects is inflammation which could impact his pft results and breathing capabilities i wasn't able to find information on how severe the inflamation can be so i can't comment on how much impact it could potentially have and some of that would depend how much his lungs are damaged by the cf i'm sure the docs are probably on top of it but i did see that there is a type of lupus called systemic lupus erythematosus sle it's caused by hypersensitivity to a medication and causes the body to make antibodies that attack the body's own healthy cells medications commonly known for this are chlorpromazine hydralazine isoniazid methyldopa penicillamine procainamide quinidine sulfasalazine symptoms of the sle usually occur after months of the medication usage i'm not specifically familiar with any of these drugs and don't remember being treated with any of them but that doesn't mean they aren't used for something associated with cf best thing to do would be to talk further with the doctors get more tests including a second opinion from someone that specializes in lupus treatment and review your boyfriends medication history both current and past since he's probably known for years that he has cf likely since early childhood he's used to the idea of one disease and what it entails however when we're thrown a new and serious illness it tends to hit us just like it would a 'healthy' person when i found out i am diabetic a result of the cf i cried all the way home from the doctors office and was more worried about the diabetes than the cf he'll get used to it but may need some time and will need your support as far as telling his dad it may be better to wait until you have the confirmed results of the tests if he and his dad are close then it may be better to just flat tell him and get it over with since his dad may very well notice that something is bothering him above all try to keep a good sense of humor about the situation find something about it to laugh at it will help a lot i'm sure you have plenty of cf jokes so find ways to add jokes or humor into the lupus aspect contact a lupus support group and see how those individuals deal with it what impact it has to their lives etc sorry i can't give you specific information best wishes  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Prostate cancer Allergy Medicine Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Asthma Cancer Psoriasis Rheumatoid arthritis Tuberculosis Immune system Autoimmune diseases Cirrhosis Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis HIV test Folic acid Stroke Cytomegalovirus Psychosis Ulcerative colitis Coeliac disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Fibromyalgia Urinary incontinence Organ transplant Malaria AIDS Radiation therapy Hepatitis Social rule Insulin Immunosuppressive drug Immunology Apoptosis Duesberg hypothesis AIDS reappraisal Propranolol Fecal incontinence Atherosclerosis Chemotherapy Homeopathy Diarrhea Common cold Traumatic brain injury Crohn's disease Theory of conduct Chlorpromazine Tocopherol Decompression sickness Herpes simplex virus Pharmaceutical company Myocardial infarction Nutrition Arthritis Group A streptococcal infection Alzheimer's disease Amiodarone Mesothelioma Cholera Legionellosis Acne Addiction Bipolar disorder Sickle-cell disease Rabies Antiviral drug Anxiety Leukemia Alcoholism Schizophrenia Terri Schiavo Clinical depression Equine conformation Diffuse parenchymal lung disease Inclusion body myositis Cephalic disorder Genetic disorder Antiphospholipid syndrome Hay fever Cardiovascular disease Aortic dissection Antibody Aphasia </TEXT>
