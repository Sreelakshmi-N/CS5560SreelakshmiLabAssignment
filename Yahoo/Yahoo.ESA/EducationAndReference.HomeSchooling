hi i have a project about the home education i want c ur opinions as soon as possible me i prefer the schools but it seems that marie curie didn't so i will b happy c ur oppinions and what do u think about the advantages disadvantages of the home school education for where i live and the society i'm in i definitely prefer homeschooling if we had half day one room schoolhouses where the children were with a mix of ages and could work at their own pace i might choose that over homeschooling but that doesn't exist anywhere around here advantages of home education students can work at their own pace they're never behind the class and feeling bad or ahead of the class and getting an ego or feeling bored parents can include subjects and content they feel important that the schools may not work on students usually have time to work on things they find interesting kids have more time to be kids since they don't need to take as much time in class to get their work done plus other things that fill up their school day kids usually have better role models at home than in school having same age peers as the primary social models doesn't exactly help kids mature well kids are in a training ground for adulthood not perpetual childhood less chance of suffering under things like bullying being outcast for not wearing the right clothes less chance of being focused on all the material things in our schools here nintendo ds's psp's ipods cell phones even at the elementary level and more less chance of growing up in an environment in which there are negative attitudes towards learning and doing well where sex is encouraged at a young age where others are partying on weekends doing drugs and alcohol i recently heard a story from a mom who decided she had to pull her child out of the only nearby school they're in a rural area the gr elementary girls were prostituting themselves often making deals on the school bus rides if parents make social outlets an important aspect the kids usually interact with a variety of ages get used to meeting strangers etc there's so much more of course all potential advantages depend a lot on how parents go about homeschooling it's like being a parent it's not enough to simply have the kids how you parent them makes a difference disadvantages people who are ignorant about homeschooling and make nasty or stupid remarks people who are actually prejudiced to the point that they'll have a great time hanging out regularly with a homeschooler but as soon as they find out the homeschooler is homeschooled then they shun the homeschooler because s he is a social retard happened to a girl i know public school advantages great for parents who are not willing or not able to homeschool their children great for ultra social kids might outweigh home education's advantages if there is something you really want for your child's education and there's no way for you to provide it through homeschooling for example immersion or bilingual language programs public school disadvantages many are the flip side of the home education advantages i wrote above other things kids don't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom they can get help fairly quickly instead of having to wait through other held up hands assuming their parents are relatively good they won't undergo some of the abuses that occur under teachers some are mildly verbally abusive and not enough to really be caught or canned others are more abusive and administration for whatever reason doesn't explore it further i know a young woman who had the same teacher for a subject two years in a row the teacher spent a lot of time telling the students how stupid they were and that they were the stupidest bunch he'd ever taught another girl i know had a teacher throw a book at her undoubtedly other things what it all really boils down to is which one is the right fit homeschooling isn't for everybody public school isn't for everybody private schools aren't for everybody parents need to find what's right for their family  Theory of conduct Hikikomori Second language acquisition GED Beavis and Butt-head Education in the People's Republic of China Infantilism Waldorf Education EastEnders Boston Public Extreme Programming Education A.

what's a good way to talk to my year old about politics in easy to understand terms kentucky's law says i must teach my son civics i thought with the upcoming presidential election i would concentrate on teaching him about the different parties how the president is elected etc how can i teach my son something that seems to have the whole country divided something such as u s politics and its nuances are sometimes difficult for even adults to comprehend what are some good resources i can use to help explain these things in kid friendly terms btw if you are against homeschooling don't bother answering my question with your rhetoric about how i'm damaging my child etc etc i'm sick of it i didn't mean baby terms just kid friendly you know something a year old could comprehend this website has a section on textbooks and curriculum for studying government http www cathyduffyreviews com history geography history geography index htm you could use something like that as a basic coverage of government branches i would also suggest reading through the constitution then perhaps you can visit the official national websites of the republican democrats and some of the smaller parties and discuss the differences in what they say and how they are publicly perceived positively and negatively and you can discuss with him what party you belong to and why then i would look at your local elections in addition to state and national you could do an on going study of what the job that is up for election is about and what each candidate claims as their platform via websites and how they are portrayed in the media i would definitely discuss the importance of image sound bites and perception are in killing or making a campaign howard dean barry goldwater perhaps you could watch national debates look at past achievements of candidates and go to rallies and speeches by various candidates best if you can do opposing ones with in the same race and note the speech and crowd reactions if you and he really like a particular candidate maybe you can volunteer a little bit with their campaign and thanks for asking this question because it has helped me think about what i want to do with my own children when they are old enough to study this  Barry Goldwater 2004 Democratic National Convention Politics of the United States U.S. presidential election, 2004 Voter turnout Republican Party (United States) U.S. presidential election, 2008 Elections in the United States Alan Keyes U.S. Electoral College Howard Dean U.S. presidential nominating convention British National Party ROC presidential election, 2004 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 John Edwards Homeschooling Hillary Rodham Clinton Libertarian Party (United States) Politics of the Republic of China Third party (United States) Red state vs. blue state divide United States House of Representatives Moral Politics Vicente Fox Quebec sovereignty movement Ralph Nader Election Rick Santorum Plame affair Brian Lenihan Green Party (United States) Republic U.S. presidential election, 2000 Kuomintang Legal research U.S. presidential election, 1980 Bill Clinton A Course In Miracles Canadian House of Commons Democracy U.S. presidential election, 1964 President of Germany Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. presidential election debates U.S. presidential election, 1960 Government of France Civil rights Bill Maher Congress of the United States Paul Hackett Philosophy Conservative Party (UK) Intelligent design movement American liberalism Teach the Controversy George Lakoff Ian Paisley Ross Perot Southern strategy Bloc Qu__b__cois Green Party of Canada Liberalism Economics GED Patrick Hillery Michael Badnarik Zell Miller Parti Qu__b__cois leadership election, 2005 Abortion debate MoveOn U.S. Senate election, 2004 Politics of Belarus U.S. presidential election, 1860 Elections in the United Kingdom Cindy Sheehan 2004 Republican National Convention Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Read my lips: no new taxes Jeb Bush Lyndon B.

for the un schooling family could you describe a day in your home i have read up on this method of home schooling and although it sounds good in books i have yet to understand how to apply it in my home do you teach math english i copied and pasted one of my previous answers to similar questions and i would like to add another resource book on unschooling that i think gives a pretty good snapshot of this method of learning as well as the life style the unschooling handbook by mary griffith isbn hope this helps a bit but please understand that unschooling is the hardest to describe since it is different for each family it is unique to their life style as well as each individual in that family here is a rundown of our unschooling way of life first and most important we have long talks and discussion about anything and everything we do math and language arts in the more traditional way since i believe that math reading and writing are the most important things a person can learn if these are firmly in place you can learn anything you put your mind to proper communication is very important for history we choose movies documentaries talks with veterans good historical fiction books games and other literature for geography we do essentially the same but we also include games travel video's road trips and cooking meals from the regions map skills regular and topical as well as compass reading are learned because these skill are a necessity where we live one should not rely on technology gps alone these gadgets can break making basic survival skills a must the boy scouts the civil air patrol can teach many of these skills as well science is part of everyday life the first six years are the day's of creation each day has enough subject material to cover a years worth of reading experiments as well as field trips one drawback are the animal habitats they become a permanent part of our families zoo home economics's and life skills chores learning how to budget shop and cook by planning the meals and preparing them getting a job balancing a checkbook even at age and learning how to save learning how to work with and interact with all kinds of people on the job or while doing their volunteer work are skills that need to be practiced and cannot be learned properly from a textbook they are learning languages cultural diversity and music from members of our congregation who gladly share their knowledge and talents with them because the children are genuinely interested bible sunday school awana's youth groups and bible camps add daily devotions voila no curriculum needed unless you like to have a chronological study my kids did want to do that so we got one civics's study a basic book add a study of the constitution go to see your elected officials in action at your state capitol follow a bill to see how it is drafted and what it takes to move it through the system volunteer at voting booths or a candidates campaign speech and debate sign up for toastmasters or another club electives use h for everything from cooking sewing photography veterinary science to robotics sports the sky is the limit both for recreation and competition i would say all that adds up to much more than the average textbook could cover life was meant to be experienced lived and questioned with all it's ups and downs the added benefit is that learning actually clicks because it is a part of their daily life it makes sense and they gain the needed self confidence to become independent with that i can do attitude  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices Mathematics Education in the People's Republic of China Science Cognitive science Philosophy Boy Scouts of America A Course In Miracles Harrow School Education Intelligent design movement Franz Boas Education in Romania Economics Literacy GED Biology Toastmasters International Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Philosophy of mathematics Education in the United States Second language acquisition Social psychology Computer Waldorf Education Theory of conduct Bah__'__ Faith and Education Software engineering Aesthetic Realism Religion Education in Taiwan Psychology Photography Microeconomics Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Cyberspace Scouting Art Strategic management Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Teach the Controversy Music Autism Democracy Church of Christ Chinese language Education in Portugal Human Voter turnout Quizbowl Education in Japan New Testament Aikido Socrates Dyslexia Logic Extreme Programming Church of Christ, Scientist Sant Thakar Singh Sant Mat Sociology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Physics Civil rights Linguistics The Giver Education reform SAT Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Copyright Modernism Literature Anthropology Crossword Western philosophy Computer and video game genres Unemployment Geography Consensus decision-making Deconstruction History Jacob Neusner Universal pragmatics Simone Weil

is home schooling easier than actually attending school from my understanding no you still have to do as much if not more work and studying to keep up with your grade level it offers freedom to vacation as a family if you're ill you aren't missing out on any important lectures i would think that you'd have to be really good at being self taught good luck  Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Portugal Graduate school High school College Aesthetic Realism Education Brentwood School (Los Angeles) A-level Education in Japan Education in Taiwan Unemployment Secondary education in Japan Law school Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in South Korea Education in Malaysia IB Diploma Programme Public education Education in Germany Johann Philipp Reis Luck Medical school Education in Sweden Education in Australia Education in Singapore Secondary education in France Culture of the United States Juris Doctor Quicksort General Certificate of Secondary Education Education in Canada John Rawls Open University Predestination Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Danish Folkeskole Education No Child Left Behind Act Karl Jaspers Air Education and Training Command Education in Hong Kong Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Community college University of Maryland Baltimore County Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination GED Grade (education) Beatmania IIDX Ludwig Wittgenstein Professor Academia Education in Romania Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination Education in England Turkish education system University of Coimbra Education in France Alternative medicine Go ranks and ratings Capitalism Jewish studies Advanced Placement Program Middle school Dog training Sin Grade (climbing) Education in Albania French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools The Hockaday School Leo Strauss College admissions McGuffey Readers Harrow School Economics Martial art Louis MacNeice Richard Feynman Education in Finland Seamus Heaney Pump It Up Waldorf Education Tripartite System National Certificate of Educational Achievement Nicomachean Ethics Hogwarts Alan Watts Swami Vivekananda Reiki Leaving Certificate Scientology beliefs and practices Membrane potential Master's degree Primary education Fannie Farmer American and British English differences Singing school Prevenient grace

how do you deal with science i actually had some pretty strong opinions about home schooling but reading some of the questions and answers here have made me feel somewhat less hostile to home schooling but i cannot shake one of the few experiences i have had with a woman who was home schooled she actually tried to convince me that mudras hand positions in yoga can stop a heart attack now whether she was fed this nonsense as religious dogma or she came to believe it as an adult this woman was either never taught proper science never taught critical thinking or never taught either how to you both assure that your children are getting a proper science education i've seen a number of people say that their children are self taught in this department and make sure your children can think critically i'm home educated i don't do anything like chemistry or physics they're not needed for the uni course i'm going to do but my brother was able to do both subjects successfully right up to the hsc year using what he could find at home or easily get from the pharmacy local store etc i have done various critical thinking courses since i was years old though there's no reason why home educated kids should feel deprived of the opportunity to learn how to think critically for themselves ps i was told by a cardiologist a while ago that coughing can help if you reckon you're having a heart attack so while the idea of yoga might not be the whole answer if it relaxes you and therefore your heart muscles i guess it may help the flow of blood to the heart muscle thus reducing the amount of pain and possibly limiting the potential damage hannah  Religion Abortion debate Asthma Myocardial infarction Education in the United States Meditation Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Education Medicine Education in Hong Kong Francis Crick Atkins Nutritional Approach Urinary incontinence Orgasm Tai Chi Chuan Homeschooling Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Breastfeeding GED Drowning Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in the People's Republic of China Consciousness Atherosclerosis Jewish philosophy Philosophy of education Human Falsifiability Milton H.

when it comes to homeschooled students is there anywhere that offers assistance with college preparation i live in nyc if that makes any difference assistance as in college applictions and college advisors etc in our area there is a teen group that specifically offers classes for college bound kids not only academics but test taking etc you might contact your local homeschooling group and ask them about similar groups there is a price for each class also most colleges have an early entry program in which teens can take a few classes before graduation this greatly reduces the stress and work of college entrance as well as preparing kids for college i'd look at local colleges and the state uni too i'm not in ny but if ok has it surely ny has similar things  Education in the United States Homeschooling GED Graduate school Community college Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Medical school College Education in Australia Lawyer Independent school (UK) Lynbrook High School Education in Taiwan Education in Germany Education in Romania Secondary education in Japan Juris Doctor Walt Disney World College Program Georgia Institute of Technology University of North Texas Trinity College, Dublin Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Cornell University Yearbook High school Scholarship University of Bristol Education in Malaysia College admissions Boy Scouts of America A-level Master's degree Seneca College Gwinnett University Center Higher education in Japan Columbia University University of Massachusetts Amherst Education in Japan Hunter College High School University The College of New Jersey State University of New York Maritime College Academic degree Education in Portugal Florida State University Student loan Caldwell College SAT Physician Air Education and Training Command The Citadel (Military College) Education in Sweden Georgetown University Quizbowl Pennsylvania State University Bentley College Waldorf Education Education in the Republic of Ireland Tuition Education in Finland Charter school Johns Hopkins University Physical therapy Norwich University Otterbein College Affirmative action Salt Lake Community College University of Central Florida University of Maryland, College Park Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Mount Holyoke College California State University, Los Angeles Baylor University Brown University United States Naval Academy No Child Left Behind Act Saint Joseph's University Michigan State University Saved by the Bell American University Secondary education in the United States University of Virginia Christian Brothers University Grade (education) Duke University Anti-intellectualism Doctor of Philosophy Tulane University North Carolina State University Smith College Kwantlen University College Paralegal Mutual fund Bryn Mawr College Babson College Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology University of Maryland University College University of Toronto

has anyone tried public school after homeschooling i homeschooled my son last year k and now his dad wants him to try a public school we has tried to other public schools before homeschooling and had negative results once i started homeschooling my son did better i was proud and saw how proud he was of himself i'm having issues with the idea of public school i was wondering if anyone tried public schooling after a good experience with homeschooling i have four boys and my oldest will be entering first grade soon i know i can't give him the time to be homeschooled with my other three sons and my husband going to school and work full time i'm scared to try the unschooling method because he might get behind i tried homeschooling due to my children not getting enough education in public school however our situation changed and i had to send them back to public school reluctantly they did fine socially because in homeschool we allowed for more socialization than they did in public school but academically they were light years ahead of students their age especially in reading and grew bored also one of them used to hate math i found a new way that helped her learn it and it became her favorite subject when she went back to public school she hated it again needless to say we are now going back to homeschool again they couldn't be more thrilled back to friends fun and lots of learning i say that whatever works for each child's individual instructional needs is the best route to go these links might help you why homeschooling is a valid choice http www associatedcontent com article why homeschooling is a valid choice html keeping babies and toddlers busy while homeschooling the older kids http www associatedcontent com article busy and enriching activities for babies html also if you need to know anything else about homeschool or public schools i'm available just mail me through yahoo i'm currently earning a degree in early childhood education and am a writer with multiple books coming out soon i mainly write about education and parenting those are my articles at the links above  Waldorf Education Education in the United States GED Education A.

in california how hard is it to start homeschooling after a child is enrolled in public school my son in going to be starting first grade for k i had him enrolled in a charter school which provided a homeschooling program he did well but his dad thinks we should give the public schools a chance again and not do homeschooling next year i'm having issues with this because he did really well with the homeschooling dh said that if there is any problem we could just start homeschooling again however i would like to homeschool w o the help of a charter school if we do go back to homeschooling not a problem a growing number of us have come to homeschooling after our kids attended school for a time the key is to have a support system including i suggest joining a statewide group such as hsc chn or chea and joining a local support group in california we are fortunate to have a variety of options for educating our children outside of the classroom the homeschool association of california has an article on their website about the special situation of withdrawing a student from school in order to homeschool http www hsc org chaos legal special situations php basically there are two parts you the parent notifies the school that your child is transfering to another school just the same as if you were moving enrolling in a private school etc they may have papers for you to sign books to return etc do not neglect this step unless you wish to subject yourself to accusations of truancy as the director of your own private school you can then send a request to the old school for the student's cumulative records here's a sample letter http hsc org chaos legal cfile letter php in ca there is no homeschool statute do not tell the school you plan to homeschool because legally that is not what you will be doing the school bureacracy may not know how to process that they would be correct to say homeschooling is not a legal option in ca the legal and technical situation is that your child is attending a private school if you are homeschooling independently of course i'm assuming you are following the private school guidelines such as submitting the psa in october keeping required records all these issues are covered in depth at the hsc website www hsc org the four legal options for ca homeschooling families are more succinctly stated in the hslda ca legal analysis establish your own private school hire or be a credentialed tutor enroll in a public school or charter school isp enroll in a private school isp http www hslda org laws analysis california pdf if you want someone to talk you through the process or recommend local homeschool support groups there are county contacts listed on the hsc website as well happy learning  Education in the United States GED No Child Left Behind Act Charter school Domain Name System Waldorf Education Education in Romania Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act School choice Education in Portugal Education in Malaysia Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China SAML Affirmative action Miami-Dade County Public Schools Public education Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gmail High school A.

question about a structured day i am going to be homeschooling my yr old twins this yr i have purchased alpha omega lifepac's and my plan is to do a structured day i think that my boys and myself need the structure i am aware that it may not work out this way but i am just wondering what your day is like also i would like to take either friday or monday's off to just go and do something fun does anyone do just day school weeks i also want the day that we take off to be our field trip day and go to museums and stuff i know that it is all part of learning thank you there's a big difference between having structure and having routine structure can be quite limiting as it means putting restrictions on activities whether academics if social what i usually say to new homeschoolers is to look at the routine you already have in your home when you wake when you rest when you eat when you bath find your natural rhythm and find how best to put the homeschooling in there to be quite honest no matter what you do it takes so little time to homeschool it seems silly to structure your day around that rather than vice versa we finished a full curriculum in two hours a day in less than four months that was with four kids we had several trips out a week at that age learning is best by living  Homeschooling Education in the United States GED Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Rudolf Steiner Waldorf Education Education in Romania Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Boy Scouts of America Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Family from One End Street Vegeta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Fraternities and sororities Garfield Academia Bipolar disorder Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Urinary incontinence Ben Johnson (athlete) Social rule Hunter College High School Graduate school United States House of Representatives Fasting Hollywood Squares Ocean's Twelve American and British English differences Wheel of Fortune Independent school (UK) Autodidacticism STS-62 New York Giants University of Houston Gregorian calendar Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Extreme Programming About a Boy Daylight saving time Final Fantasy: Unlimited Star Trek: Enterprise Intelligent design movement Another Side of Bob Dylan Subud Teachers (film) USS Wasp (CV-18) Education in the People's Republic of China Charles Darwin's education Vince McMahon Experiential education USS Yorktown (CV-10) Plame affair Parsifal Fertility awareness USS Wallace L.

i want some time off school how can i trick people into thinking i should stay home i have been trying so hard at school recently and my mum thinks i am perfect i am feeling really run down and would appreciate some ideas thanks don't try to trick people about this tell your mum that you are feeling really run down the most likely possibilities for why you feel this way are not getting the proper nutrition you may need some extra protein more veggies and or fruit you are still growing and you are working to your capacity maybe even pushing yourself too far you need really good nutrition and some high protein snacks in between a handful of almonds and a glass of milk cheese and tomato juice that kind of thing not getting enough sleep this may boil down to discipline when i was pushing myself to the edge and beyond in school i found i needed more not less sleep this meant completely disciplined use of my time early to bed and a little bit later rising time not getting enough of the right kind of social life balance is important always you can push for a little while but you need the societal support of others not partying but just a coke with friends or a walk and a talk at least once or twice a week not getting enough physical exercise one of the best ways is just to walk or walk and run alternating between them for seconds at a time or swimming or whatever you like tennis instead of trying to trick people into rest enlist their support to help you do this really great thing you are doing for yourself the hard work will pay off but only if you learn the balance that goes with it you'll feel better all round and have good reason to be proud of yourself as well maggie  Aerial (dance move) Social rule Hamster Veganism About a Boy Vegetarianism Breakfast Peruvian cuisine Milk Equine conformation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mojave people CPU cache Hypoglycemia In-N-Out Burger Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Potassium Weight training Food Little Britain The Book of Five Rings Theodicy Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soy milk Insomnia Kender Avenue Q Cuisine of the Philippines Tai Chi Chuan Socrates Out-of-body experience EastEnders Prostate cancer Ketchup W.

how do you get organized to homeschool elementary kids i will be homeschooling my first grader next year along with a preschooler and a new baby last year when i did kindergarten we broke up the curriculum and did subjects each day totaling about an hour a day of instruction time but this year he definitely needs more instruction time maybe hours and my preschooler needs about an hour of my time just with her too so how do you schedule it all i'm planning on doing art music and science social studies with them together but reading and math really needs to be separate the way i've been planning my days i feel like there will be no time for outings errands and social interactions how do you do it are homeschooling moms mostly staying home all day if not please tell me your secret i never did get organized i provide lots of reading material and i make sure it is available at all times i enforce a bit of writing and math occasionally but i don't get into a strict schedule until between the ages and i'm always amazed at what can be accomplished when one just lets it happen we stay home in the mornings and are usually out of the house by pm so that's how i schedule it all i don't but i know that's not for everyone that being said for a first grader i would say hours of actual school time is plenty i like the idea of focusing on one or two subjects a day rather than jumping from subject to subject for a pre schooler one hour i think is more than enough play it by ear and see what works for each child try not to over schedule things rather leave time in a day week for you to just be with your kids enjoying their company doing chores gardening going on social outings or just being still and quiet for me that has always been the joy of homeschooling dropping that frenzied schedule that so many people are on and just enjoying life at a slower pace with my kids good luck  Homeschooling Education in the United States Kindergarten Waldorf Education Education in Taiwan Social rule Education in Romania GED Education in Japan Mathematics Montessori method The Adventures of Pete & Pete Doug Music Hopkins School High school Baseball CPU design Murdock-Portal Elementary School The Fairly OddParents Education in Germany Graduate school EastEnders Avenue Q JumpStart International League Recurring South Park characters CPU cache Scientology beliefs and practices Harrow School 1957 World Series Jon Secada Theory of conduct Recess (TV series) Daylight saving time Swingout Education A Course In Miracles Education in France The Amazing Race SAT Master's degree Education in Hong Kong Education in Albania Glen Ridge, New Jersey Hikikomori Secondary education in Japan Rudolf Steiner Bah__'__ Faith and Education Hogwarts subjects Primary education No Child Left Behind Act Baby Blues Professor X NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Science Bowl Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Love and Theft Compiler optimization Early childhood education Fairfax County Public Schools Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pitaten Bart chalkboard gags Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Family from One End Street About a Boy Junior Certificate W.

are there any independent studies that prove that homeschooled chilldren are better in areas like education behavior psychological social mental emotional etc when looking at things like achievement tests it's not necessary for the data to be independent of the homeschool 'lobby' if you will as long as the data are reported in peer reviewed journals the peer review process helps to take out much of the bias found in slanted journals brian ray has done much research in this area so you should check out his info at nheri yes it is a pro homeschool group but numbers don't lie when it comes to standardized testing as for social aspects i have seen only one peer reviewed journal article and it showed there was at worst no difference between homeschool kids and public private school kids and at best homeschool kids were slightly better in social situations the article was in the peabody journal of education volume pgs homeschooling is still relatively new it has only taken off in the last years not enough time to do much research then confirm that with further trials i'm sure in the next years we'll see much more research being reported of course the fact that the nea hasn't done or at least hasn't published any studies showing that homeschooling is detrimental to kids says volumes to me about its effectiveness if it weren't effective don't you think the nea would be all over that  Homeschooling Psychology Education in the United States Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Race and intelligence Intelligence quotient Rind et al.

what do you look for in a homeschool program what kinds of things make a homeschool program valuable to you do certain things like cooperative classes or playdates determine how interested you are in something what kinds of things will totally turn you off to a program program meaning club group co op event what do you look for in a homeschooling group do you look more for things like classes playdates etc one of the biggest thing i consider when looking for a group is how well it fits our personalities we are not religious and are unschoolers so finding a group where we feel comfortable and free to be ourselves could be challenging we got very lucky when we found our teaching co op it is really great it has a family atmosphere and is fun and relaxed it meets once a week in a church because of the size and the facilities available there but is not a religious co op it also has an impressive array of classes offered each year and the people there are absolutely wonderful i like the fact that if my daughter doesn't want to wear her shoes in class or all day which happens a lot no one minds i like that there are a lot of families there that believe in natural learning i also find that the moms who teach in our co op are very patient and willing to find creative ways to make their classes fun and engaging the kids are all great too we haven't found any even newbies who have had trouble or caused trouble with anyone else there are other co ops local to us but they don't seem to offer what we're looking for one is religious and although that wouldn't keep me from joining in and of itself it's much smaller and doesn't offer much variety the other is a very structured program which might work well for a family that is less relaxed than us they have their prescribed courses for each grade level and that's all there is there is no choice as far as which classes to take so i guess flexibility atmosphere and good personality fit are the biggest factors influencing our interest in a homeschooling group or any group for that matter  Homeschooling Education in the United States Theory of conduct Social rule Waldorf Education Alcoholics Anonymous Goodness and value theory Culture of Lithuania Time Out of Mind Bipolar disorder Social psychology A Course In Miracles Reiki Theodicy IBM PC compatible Tai Chi Chuan Prostate cancer Education in Portugal Determinism Religion Ludwig Wittgenstein Predestination Supernatural Graduate school Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Strap-on dildo Summa Theologiae Urinary incontinence Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pitaten Rudolf Steiner Causality Experiential education Human nature Church of Christ, Scientist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ethics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Contract Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Object-oriented programming Strategic management The nature of God in Western theology Lindy Hop Extreme Programming Futurama (TV series - season 2) Theology King City, Ontario Anderson Cooper Master's degree Meditation W.

i am going to start homeschooling my year old th grade this school year we moved to fl years ago from va schools in va were great schools in fl are a disgrace i have decided no more of this for her i will home school instead i am new at this so even after checking into it i am still not sure about the best methods or best programs i know i do not want a religious or christian based program not because we don't feel those things don't have a place in our lives but i do not want her education to be based on slanted views i want it to be based on historical and scientific facts with openess to variying opinions and theories sorry not trying to offend anyone here we plan to move back to va at some point until then how do i make sure she is getting the education she needs to be able to at least re enter the public school at her correct grade level for when we get back to va my desire and goal for homeschooling is to improve her education not make is suffer any more than what the fl system has already done to her in response to some answers i saw florida at least our school district does not require or provide standardized tests they do not provide me with a curriculum they do not require i submit an educational plan the only thing the county told me is you're on your own we already did the living in virginia with relatives thing for the last school year and she had to come back as that relative was unable to keep her indefinitely and after our house had been on the market for that entire school year and did not sell the market is dead here we are unable to say for sure when we will be able to move to va in response to some answers i saw florida at least our school district does not require or provide standardized tests or any other tests they do not provide me with a curriculum or books or even require any particular books they do not require i submit an educational plan the only thing the county told me is you're on your own we already did the living in virginia with relatives thing for the last school year and she had to come back as that relative was unable to keep her indefinitely and after our house had been on the market for that entire school year and did not sell the market is dead here we are unable to say for sure when we will be able to move to va thank you everyone for your responses you have provided me with many ideas and web resources to check out as for panama i did not ask for your judgement of me and my abilities as you do not know me nor did i ask for insults i just wanted honest guidance without personal attacks i emphathize with where you are at i was there a year ago with my dd i could not fathom homeschooling i thought i was too inadequate and so i sent her back to her school with trepidation it lasted only weeks and then i pulled her out i now found myself homeschooling her and no plan or any idea what to do next i cannot advise what to do in fl as i live in ca the rules in ca may be different i am only offering you what i discovered along the way in ca you do not have have to register with the school district althought the local schools have homeschool and independent study programs and they would like the children enrolled in one so they can receive money for their attendance in the homeschool independent study program there are several charter schools set up in ca that act as schools for the homeschoolers this has advantages and disadvantages advantages you receive money and or books tutoring or programs for the child paid for by the charter school as long as the program or books do not have a religious content most programs books will fly all these schools have an es educational specialist teacher who visits the child and parent to discuss curriculum review work by the child and discuss progress or strategies some charter schools are very hands off as to what you use to teach others have specific texts and curriculum many of these charter schools also give money to the parents to spend for the child's education including enrichment such as music lessons dance lessons art lessons etc all these wonderful things that have disappeared from the ca public schools disadvantage you must follow the rules of the charter school for home schoolers some charters schools have pretty rigid curriculum and there is not much in the way of flexibility all the charter schools require you take the state standardized tests the schools receive money for each student who tests in addition if a certain percentage of students do not take the test then the school may loose funding and its license and credentials to continue that is why there is so much pressure in ca public schools its all tied to money what the powers that be will not tell parents is that you can opt out of the standardized testing it is afterall the usa and we still have rights you simply write a note to the school stating that you do not want your child to be tested i know this for a fact as i opted my son out ot the tests from st grade through th grade in public school as i disagreed with how the school district was using the tests as far as what to teach to keep her up with her grade level you should be able to find state standards for each grade in ca the state standards are king right now and you can find the standards posted on the school district websites you might try the fl and va school district websites for standards by grade by subject if they are not there call the district offices and request as to how to obtain them they should be public information the school district office might mail them to you or direct you to the appropriate website if you strike out there try the state board of education for the states back to the next step after i found myself homeschooling i reached out to everyone i knew who was homeschooling to seek advise on materials i choose to sign with a charter school so i could get funds my particular charter school is very open and flexible its philosophy is that parents should decide what is best for their child it supports every method out there from unschooling to waldorf to montessori to classical to traditional plus several others i cannot remember i would sugget that you reach out to friends and search out other local homeschoolers for help and advise i have found other homeschoolers to be very helpful and supportive look on the web for local homeschool message boards and support groups if you have friends that are teachers seek their advise too figure out your strenghths and figure on teaching those subjects then if you can afford it hire some one to tutor what ever you feel you cannot possible teach in ca we have lots of businesses that teach math and reading which is often cheaper than hiring a private tutor you can also contact the local colleges to find a student to tutor your child but if your child is a very good student you may be able to use the homeschool texts that are available you can buy canned curriculums by grades from several different publishers some with a strong christian basis and some without a religious basis these curriculum package cover all subjects so you do not have to worry what to choose or you can do what i did which was piece stuff together subject materials based on advise from my daughters tutor all of which i threw out cause it was awful and advise from other homeschoolers which was more practical and helpful just know that few homeschoolers have hit on the perfect program for every subject the first time i was surprised and relieved when i realized that it was really ok to experiment to find what works for you and your child i found if i hated the program text then my child hated it too its hard to teach what you do not like and often what works for one kid does not work for anyother look to your instincts when you review materials you know your child so review the materials by asking yourself will she would like the material and its approach does it cover what you want her to know do you think it is straightforward enough to implement easily are you interested in it does it grab you etc do a search on web for curriculum reviews you will find lots of homeschoolers giving reviews of programs or books they have used or read i have found those reviews helpful go to websites that sell to homeschoolers and look at what they offer or suggest one website that i use alot is ww rainbowresources com they sell to homeschoolers and they have tons and tons of books games reference material etc every thing is very nicely reviewed and they often let you take a peak inside the books i have also done searches at amazon for books and reference materials whatever you do decide it will be ok i am sure that your daughter will be fine if she is weak or behind in any areas especially reading or math focus on getting those areas up to grade level if she is doing fine at school and is at grade level then at the minimum read alot write alot do research papers and most importantly keep up with the math everything else will fall into place good luck i hope this helps  Tripartite System National Certificate of

do any of you homeschool your children does anyone homeschool why do you do it what method curriculum do you use i homeschool my two oldest children aged and hi samantha i too homeschool my son who is years old he did go to school in the uk until july sometimes many people forget that sometimes you feel that you are the only people home eductaing especially if you do not have a huge network of family anfd friends people do home school for so many reasons ours was the education in school was not meeting our sons specific needs my son had a speech and language disorder which is better now also dyspraxia dyslexia and specific learning problems what seemed to make it more complicated was that he was aslo identified as being gifted in maths but the lea could not get their heads around the fact that he still had all these other problems especially with his recording of the information he was taking for ever to finish work as he found it so tiring as he struggled with fine motor skills he could manage verbally no problem or if someone could scribe for him couldn't get a scribe for him in class this was such a huge problem for the education authority he is also displaying various aspegers syndrome traits which we are waiting to see a professional for loads of these issues came up an all of our letters to the lea and also to the head of the education depeartment but these where not even looked at i still feel very angry and hurt as your child is just another name and number in the school system if your difficulty does not fit into a neat little box it's tough luck as you do not get listened to since home educating my son he is so much better more relaxed less stressed and much less highly strung all these things which many teachers had noticed how ironic they did nothing to help him or listen to what i was saying in letters to them the school and the education authority we work together to meet his specific needs and with getting one to one help from me his mum he has improved we do not follow a strict curriculum but often pick up things which i know are on the national curriculum because he is interested in the subject we do not sit down am to pm everyday is different and is usually lead by my sons interests using things he is interested in we incorporate the maths literacy science life skills and so much more my knowledge has increased so much since home teaching him and love everyday with him we do a lot of work using the computer and all the resources you can get from it using local and major towns libraries we do lots of museums parks and lots of crafts and cooking he make small cakes weighing and measuring through to putting them into their tins while i stand back and supervise he loves cooking and thinks he wants to be a chef this week don't know what he'll be next week i also know people who do the formal side of home schooling and if that fits you your lifestyle and most importantly your child then you do that way that suites you all as a family i do not think there is a right or wrong way to home educate i personally am so happy to have this choice we where not given choices to help our son in the school setting so this has worked out wondrefully for us hope you are enjoying home schooling it is hard work sometimes but well worth the effort happy home schooling from one family to another home schooling family  Dyslexia GED Education in the United States Education Education in the People's Republic of China No Child Left Behind Act Asperger syndrome Waldorf Education Mathematics Social rule SAT Pitaten Education in Japan Literacy Education in Romania Stuttering Education in England Scientology beliefs and practices Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Intelligence quotient Alexander Technique Dyspraxia Hearing impairment About a Boy Bah__'__ Faith and Education Second language acquisition A.

m yhusband was dead set against homeschooling and had something to counteract every point i tried to make now all of a sudden he's changed his mind he told me last night honey you've convinced me i think you should homeschool him what's up some part of me thinks he's not sincere even though he says he is my husband rarely changes his mind on something especially if he has strong feelings about it i asked him if he's just trying to see if i fail so he can say i told you so but he says no he'll help me any way we can and he's even talking about scheduling a science field trip am i wrong to be so suspicious what do you think he has up his sleeve you know your husband better than any of us on here but what i think honestly is that you are doubting yourself at homeschooling it is hard to teach your child at home and even with asking simple homeschooling questions on here there are tons of people out here willing to put us down and judge us your husband might be sincere with his change of heart but since we are ridiculed so much you might just be preparing yourself for the downfall which may never come just keep doing what your doing for your son as long as your son is happy and safe that's all that matters  Homeschooling Theory of conduct GED Waldorf Education Current teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule Mojave people EastEnders Sydney Riot of 1879 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Education in the United States Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fiddler on the Roof The nature of God in Western theology Coming of Age (TNG episode) John Kerr Past teachings of Prem Rawat A.

can you homeschool someone else's children i live in georgia i've pondered the thought of taking in a few kids in a daycare setting in my home but i would prefer to school them also i have a and year old that i am schooling it's not necessarily true that you need a license it will depend completely upon homeschooling laws as well as home business laws where you live first check with homeschooling laws where you live looking at this http www hslda org laws default asp state ga as long as you have a ged or high school diploma you could function as a tutor however there might also be the possibility of functioning as a daycare which would probably give you even more tax credits and would give the parents a tax credit if you get tax credits for childcare there then check into how you could run that in your home you might be able to run it as an in home daycare or as a tutoring business without any fuss completely depends on city laws that one where i live you don't need any sort of license to run a dayhome like a daycare but without any required credentials and with limits to the number of kids and all that but a tutoring business in your home would require a business license a town just outside my city requires a license for a dayhome all depends on where you live  GED Homeschooling Education in the United States Day care Community college Domain Name System Copyleft School choice Expert system Juris Doctor Childcare Taxation in the United States American Institute of Certified Public Accountants High school Visual Basic Political subdivisions of New York State Halting problem Separation of church and state Uniform Resource Locator Master's degree Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Japan Lawyer Identity theft No Child Left Behind Act Graduate school Education in Australia Driver's license Credit card Extreme Programming Trademark GNU General Public License Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax BASIC programming language Child support Insurance Physician Profession Mortgage PHP Quantum computer Kindergarten Windows Server 2003 Notary public Pretty Good Privacy Education in Germany Counties of the United States Identity document Free trade FairTax Annuity CPAN Nurse IB Diploma Programme Natural deduction Architect Dissociative identity disorder On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Teacher Waldorf Education Universal Serial Bus College Value system Bipolar disorder Tuscarawas County, Ohio Freedom of speech HyperText Transfer Protocol Immigration to the United States Bank Dictionary United States Postal Service Child Surveillance Software license Education in Portugal A.

online elementary school hello my son and i are going with my husband overseas and i want to know what is a good online elemetary school i want to home school my son i heard that jubilee academy was but i wanted to get a second opinion plus i here that alot of homeschool kide are really smart because of the one on one attention with your child and i know that i can teach my son more things his school taught him when he was in public school my son is going to first grade and i want to home school him for one year any suggestions first clarify your educational goals for your son together with your husband for example we wanted a christian education for our sons before they were born but found later that we couldn't afford private schools we're so glad to be homeschooling because it bonds you as a family rather than everyone having their own private schedules also our goal is not to make our children smart we believe that all children are people are just smart in different ways homeschooling allows you to get to know who your child is and tailor their education to their bent or personal interests we want our sons to learn how to serve others with the knowledge that they gain not to become rich and famous you can do it girl you are equipped not because of a degree conferred on you i know that is highly offensive to professional educators but simply because you know your son better than any teacher could you are concerned about his well being so you can learn how to teach him it's not always easy but it is do able sonlight curriculum is what we use now and they have a user friendly website with discussion forums and telephone help too a lot of overseas parents love it shipping is great but for the first few years i sort of scoured the libraries and used book sales to put together my own stuff i love william bennett's book of virtues and ed hirsch's what every grader needs to know series for k th i think it's time consuming to make your own curriculum but very personalized for your child just do your homework and your child will benefit from seeing you learn to teach him why stop at one year my seventh grader just asked if he could be homeschooled for high school and my th grader told me i was getting to be a pretty good teacher those compliments can take me through the whole school year there are a lot of pitfalls and numerous joys as well when you teach your own go for it  Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Waldorf Education GED Education Brown v.

why do home education naysayers always try to muddy the waters by substituting socialisation for socialising socialisation has nothing to do with kids getting to 'hang out' and socialise with other kids their age so why do homeschooling naysayers continue to rely on it as their sole argument in support of schools socialisation by definition is 'the process whereby the individual learns to conform to the moral standards codes of conduct role expectations and role performances in a specific society ' and what better way for kids to learn that than by living working learning and playing in the midst of their society and not segregated and shut away in school for years of their childhood in fact anyone who stops and thinks about it for just a moment must see that in childhood at least socialising with others their own age is the antithesis of socialisation unless they're really expecting their six or sixteen year old to learn how to conform to the standards expectations and conduct required by their wider society from other six sixteen year olds hannah oh dear we're back to those age old paradigms again evidenced by what spelling the fact that i spell words like 'socialising' and 'socialisation' with an 's' and not a 'z' i'm not from the usa ergo i don't use your 'american style' spelling i spell words as they are spelt in my country and that means using the letter 's' and not 'z' not missing out the letter 'u' and spelling words like 'gaol' as 'gaol' and not 'jail' as someone from the usa might spell it to spell words like socialisation and socialising as 'socialization' and 'socializing' may be 'correct' for you but would definitely be wrong and misspelled if i was to write them thus tyler and mckenna's mom would you please post a full reference for the article you cite or alternatively for the journal in which you found it i tried searching on general search engines such as 'google' and the more academic ones like 'science direct' but was unable to find any trace of the journal you cited thanks hannah first tyler can i get a link to your journal article i tried to google it and it's not showing up on google anywhere there's an international journal for teaching and learning but that's about it and they don't have any articles on homeschooling the number you've provided directly contradicts the studies done by ray in ' shows that in indep testing homeschoolers beat out public schoolers by to points in all standardized testing regardless of race or income there are several other studies but this is primary as for socialization and the original question i think it's easy for people to confuse the two since the theory that children are incapable has been pushed for so long nearly one hundred years although even sixty years ago the idea of the 'teenager' boundless free time and no responsibility was unheard of it is in the best interest of many special interest groups to market children in a certain way from disney to department of education it's better to have children who are limited in resources are believed to be incapable of coping with an 'adult' world and that children should be kept with other children although for centuries millenia children have been learning through interaction with family and mentors who have taught taught them the necessary skills for survival and growth the idea of public schools were good at first when facing the idea that many adults were kept illiterate by lack of finances and opportunity namely by the church and upper classes but in our society children do not face those same deficits it is definitely time to reevaluate the roles of public education in this light  Education Education in the United States GED Education in the People's Republic of China Economics

what do you think about high school home school well i have been home schooled ever since my parents got divorsed wich was in th grade now i am going to high school my mom says i have the choice of being home schooled or going to public school everyone says i should go but my family says i should stay home school so i can focus on school work and get good grades to get into college and so i was just wondering what other peoples opions are yes this is a personal question but i was just wondering it will depend a lot on the schools in your area if you have top quality schools with programs that you'd really like to get into and you're comfortable with the idea of going back to school it might be worth a shot if it's either a toss up either way or the schools near you are lower than what you could do at home i would definitely stay at home there are so many self driven curricula out there for all levels of science math lit history worldview foreign languages etc that you really shouldn't have a problem with that there are several curricula that are well supplemented by dvd lessons cdroms and online resources that you should be able to find whatever you need as a homeschooler you can also have access to a number of co op classes taught by degreed teachers so you can take the classes you need personal instruction with in co op and work on the rest at your own pace you may also be eligible for concurrent enrollment at a community college near you to take upper level classes and get college credit at the same time my advice to you whatever you do base it on the academics a lot of people will tell you to go for the socialization factor but that's not a good reason for choosing your educational track i have a feeling you don't live in a cave so you can have a social life either way choose it based on what you really want to do what you feel is best for you rather than on your social life good luck  Homeschooling Education in the United States Education Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Education in Taiwan Graduate school GED Education in Hong Kong Secondary education in Japan Education in Singapore Education in Portugal Grade (education) Education in Malaysia Intelligent design movement Secondary education in France Education in France Community college SAT IB Diploma Programme Education in South Korea Charter school Secondary education in the United States Education in Australia College Experiential education Education in Austria Medical school Master's degree High school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hunter College High School Franklin W.

school homeschooling how long can a parent home school a child do you feel that this is as satisfactory as what a teacher school would do until they're finished which is to say that until they've reached their educational goals or until they reach a point beyond which they're unable or unwilling to continue for whatever reason since all parent child homeschool relationships are unique and all teacher school situations are different whether one mode would be more or less satisfactory than another would require a case by case analysis having said that a home education approach can offer opportunities that the traditional school cannot match one on one attention and very individualized instruction non didactic approaches to subjects normally taught via lecture and textbook flexibility in scheduling and so forth a parent that chooses to home educate has a greater investment in the individual child's success than the public school teacher does while the school teacher supposedly has been trained specifically to the role of teaching often the homeschool can provide the student child with 'real world' interactions that cannot be achieved in a classroom for example a homeschooled child might be able to attend governmental functions such as legislative sessions city council meetings or even courtroom trials and observe the workings of government first hand where the traditional school's ability to provide such field trips would be significantly less and in some cases non existant research on academic outcomes is inconclusive and suffers from self selection and other biases but typically indicates that for the majority of homeschooled children for which data is available better outcomes for homeschoolers a frequently raised objection to home education is that the child student misses out on important socialization or what might be termed social training or indoctrination that occurs within the traditional school this idea is based on two assumptions that the traditional school provides this type of training in some designed form and that the home education environment does not both of these assumptions are questionable and assuming that they are true begs the question of whether this type of social indoctrination is truly desirable and who decides what the curriculum will be the people who work in the public education establishment tend to overwhelmingly lean toward the political left and will tend to teach those things that are high on their values list the system itself is based on socialist ideals while this is not wrong it doesn't provide a balanced view of the political and social spectrum to the student a home education approach can provide either a more balanced view or it can provide a view tilted to the right wing it will provide the student with the parents' view in most cases this can be either a plus or a minus depending on the extremity of the parents' views and their committment to them  Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Waldorf Education Economics Teach the Controversy Infantilism Microeconomics Social psychology Ethics Drama Intelligent design movement Education Education in Portugal GED Law of value Graduate school A Course In Miracles Grade (education) Second language acquisition Separation of church and state Political economy Education in Romania Causality No Child Left Behind Act Coercion Intelligence quotient Education in Germany Strategic management Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rudolf Steiner Asperger syndrome Danish Folkeskole Education Goodness and value theory Charter school Professor Creation-evolution controversy Academia Education in Taiwan Multilingual Franz Boas Autism Tripartite System Capitalism Education in Hong Kong Education in Austria Single Transferable Vote Model (economics) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theodicy Object-oriented programming Gender role Experiential education Transsexuality Culture of the United States Requirements analysis Feminism Anti-intellectualism Objectivist philosophy Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Philosophical skepticism School choice A.

homeschool what do you think about it i am homeschooled and it is super cool sometimes i like it other times i hate it but i now my mom is doing the right thing by homeschooling me because the schools by me are horrible what do you think if you like it why if you disagree with it why i like it i like teaching and helping my son learn my son likes it because he can learn in his own style and at his own pace we have the freedom to learn what we want to learn i disagree with comments about parents not being able to teach what they do not know i have learned much along with my son i have learned much in order to teach my son i have even learned things from my son education is never ending students whether in public school private school or at home should never quit learning teachers should always be students studying to learn more  Homeschooling Education in the United States Waldorf Education School GED Accelerated Christian Education John Caldwell Holt A.

home schooling parents are you finding teaching at home to be pretty much what you had expected before you started or is it fairly different from your expectations in what ways well since i expected homeschooling to be public school at home i have been very pleasantly surprised it takes us just a few hours each day to complete all our lessons not am pm we do much of our work on the couch not at a table we can skip days whenever we need a break not follow a rigid schedule we can have school outside on nice days instead of being cooped up in a classroom we can take vacations while the other kids are in school not with the crowds we can have field trips every month not just twice a year  Homeschooling Education in the United States Hey Arnold!

what is the average cost of a k education for one year say a rd grader like my child i understand that some individuals only supplement with their products you may still know what it would cost or at least have an idea i am interested in the program for my child and would like to know what i should be expecting to pay thanks so much homeschool families are always great about answering my questions all answers are really appreciated as i do not know of anyone who homeschools their child i'm starting my th year with k as an independent consumer direct user it used to cost me for all six courses but now with their choice subscription plan i can do it for less if you sign up for a yearly contract versus a monthly one then you'll save right there they currently have a off sale for subscriptions and materials spring sales are better this year's was it has been as high as off you can also find some used k materials on ebay or the k used stuff yahoo group another option is to subscribe to four courses at at time you plan to do math and la year round there are lessons each and then you do two other courses in a semester each history and art then science and music as they typically have lessons this saves on the base subscription you can also do something like i did this year and did music only in the summer your child can be in different grade levels at the same time and can also go at different paces in each course it is so wonderful my son does two years of math in one and flies through science and history doing about yrs in one year spelling takes longer like the full months if you don't get a course done in your month contract period it can carry over to the next renewed contract if you finish a course by say december you can add the next grade level in or you can switch it out to a completely different course this year i paid just under for a four course subscription we dropped k algebra for teaching texbooks and only do music in summer i only had to purchase one consumable workbooks kit from k for about new the rest of our materials i purchased used for about another here is the link to the pricing page http www k com schooling programs k direct get k consumer direct and the materials kit contents http www k com pdf material kit contents pdf i did purchase at off you can get the sale by august st just do the math on the pricing page to see what it would cost you here's the link to the k used stuff group k curriculum items only http groups yahoo com group k usedstuff let me know if you need more input feel free to email me we love k as others have mentioned there might be a k virtual school option public school in your state if so then the school pays for your curriculum and supplies a computer and printer most of the va's include the upgrade kits you can get the books at a library  Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Open access Waldorf Education Education in the People's Republic of China Subscription business model Oxford English Dictionary Graduate school Education in Germany GED Education in Taiwan Gmail Economics Advanced Placement Program SAT Hunter College High School TeX World Wide Web FairTax Education in Portugal Intelligent design movement MMORPG Digital rights management Education in Australia Master's degree Microeconomics America Online Education in Singapore Microsoft Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology E85 CPU design Economy of Russia Monetary policy IB Diploma Programme Sinclair Research Ltd SCO-Linux controversies Pharmaceutical company Education Electronic commerce TiVo Inflation Biodiesel Illegal drug trade Software engineering Mac OS X Google Junior Certificate Game programmer Copyleft IPod Computer Common Unix Printing System Librarian High school Education in France Cable television Stuyvesant High School Open source culture A-level Apple Macintosh Secondary education in the United States Mach kernel Education in Hong Kong A Course In Miracles Education in Japan The Princeton Review Neopets Food and Drug Administration Annuity Experiential education Jumpstart 3rd Grade Secondary education in France Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Hampshire College HyperText Transfer Protocol Supply and demand ITunes Internet fraud Value added tax American University E-mail spam Medical school Ajax (programming) Amway Kwantlen University College Web traffic Gross domestic product Life insurance Management information system Windows 2000 Web crawler

does your child use k products to homeschool your child or does your child attend a school that uses it how are they doing how long have they been involved are you all enjoying the experience how do you feel about the curriculum i know some of you can't stand k why i just posted a long reply to your cost of k question you can get some of my info there we're starting our th year with k as independent homeschoolers not involved with any virtual public school some people assume that's the only way to use k and it's not true you can purchase it just like you would any other curriculum and only do one course or all six first i'll tell you why some hs'er are opposed to k they are opposed to any public school at home program because it's not true and pure homeschooling they don't think you should invite the government into your home i'm not going to start a flame war about it here it's been done too many times the past six years since k started what really gets my goat about it though is the same hs'ers are not anti calvert who also runs virtual public school programs as connections academy i've seen the virtual schools help way way too many people many my friends and it's a wonderful option for many families it's great as a bridge between public schooling and hs'ing it gives parents who are gun shy a chance to try out home education it helps families where both parents are not all the way on board etc my son has done awesome in k he's scored in the th percentile on all standardized tests even when tested a year ahead i love k 's dynamic not static like a printed one from most curricula planning and progress tools i am in awe by the depth and breadth of the curriculum i learn so much that i never had even in college i love the ease of use and the professional online and offline components my son enjoys it immensely not all of the time is on the computer like many think and i can't say enough good about it you can attend an online seminar about the program and gain access to a one week demonstration account to see the online component in detail please note that until the middle school years you as a parent will still need to be involved in teaching it's not a sit your kid at the computer and let it do the teaching program far from it yes there are things they do independently more so as the grades progress but you'll need to guide and lead them k 's science history and art are so good you won't find an equal anywhere language arts is very strong too and has many strands literature phonics spelling composition vocabulary analogies grammar usage mechanics public speaking etc the history from st th is a four year coverage from the stone age to the space age th and th are american history using the history of us books as a spine and middle school repeats world history in more depth art is paralleled with history which is so much fun it not only covers art methods and artists but also architecture clothing furniture etc music trains with the kodaly and solfege methods we did switch out of k math at their pre algebra level th and now use teaching textbooks for algebra the math just wasn't a good fit for him like st th was a great thing about k is how you can have different grade levels for your child and they can progress through each course at differing speeds the spine of the curriculum is based on the core knowledge foundation scope and sequence you can view download copies of the k scope and sequences for each course at their site it will show you a portion of the depth and breadth of each course let me know if you need want more info  Mathematics GED SAT Waldorf Education Education No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Science Python programming language Education

public school private school homeschool pros cons first it will be helpful to recognize that there are differences among the three general categories you've listed these differences may be in terms of philosophy curriculum rigour or policy some of these things will overlap between the public and private school universes it is quite possible to have both traditional and progressive schools in either the private or the public sector there are liberal arts schools in the public sector and there are vocational schools in the private sector one should also bear in mind that the term public school can include charter schools and various tax subsidized alternatives to the traditional neighborhood school having said that the public school is tax subsidized so the student's family doesn't have to pay tuition generally there are some fees but they tend to be small public schools are required to accept all students that live within their neighborhood area can typically reject students from outside that area geographic segregation and have to justify expelling a students that is disruptive or maladjusted to the school all races and socio economic groups must be treated in an egalitarian fashion which often results in confused values and watered down curricula the curriculum in a public school can be set at the state level the school district level or the school level and is often driven by political forces public schools as a socialized institution typically disconnect the family the education consumer from the producer the school economically eliminating the feedback that a market can provide as a result the legislative bodies over schools typically enact accountability measures these typically have mediocre success and always result in administrative overhead that removes resources from the classroom the private school is usually funded through a combination of tuition and donations a trade off must exist between the resources of the school and the cost to the family some of these schools offer assistance and scholarships to those in need those that can pay more are apt to attend better schools resulting in better educations for their children since the school is dependant on the payment of tuition these schools are directly accountable to the families that pay to send their children and must satisfy them paying the tuition also results typically in a higher motivation to succeed in the student private schools can be either religious or secular though there are more religious schools than non religious as a result private school curricula often reflects the values and ideaologies of the sponsoring organization there is concern that such schools may not provide an appropriate balance in representing other viewpoints private schools tend to be more elitist than their public counterparts private schools tend to emphasize academics and generally don't have athletics and other non or extra curricular programs unless there is a source of funding for them usually in the form of donations private schools are not geographically segregated and typically don't provide student transportation with the result that it is often necessary to commute fairly large distances to deliver and pick up students schools are free to determine their own admitance policies and can reject or expell students that don't fit within the schools business model curriculum decisions are made by the school its sponsoring organization and must be responsive to the demands of the market nevertheless the private school patron must accept the offering from a particular school or take his or her business elsewhere there are too many different variations of homeschool to list individual pros and cons in general terms homeschool is a decision to take personal responsibility for the education of the child every pro for one person could be a con for someone else but that someone else may choose a different path which will negate the whole issue anyway a typical critic of homeschool will argue that there are fewer resources available to the homeschool student than there would be in a school environment or that homeschool children are not as well socialized as their schooled peers on the other hand a typical proponent of homeschool will claim that there are more resources available and that homeschooled children are better socialized because they aren't subject to the artificial reality of age segregated classrooms and the other non real world conditions that exist in the school especially public school setting the reality is that the availabity of resources and the level of social education is dependant on the individual situation the real answer to you question depends on what you want in the education of your child  Students'

my daughter's father my ex husband won't consider homeschooling do you have any advice i would be the one homeschooling her and i plan to change the way i earn a living to be able to have the time everyday to spend with her she is about to begin the rd grade and has been in different schools so far for various reasons the school she attended in nd grade and will continue in unless i can do something about has math and reading average standards of about each when the national average is about approx you see she is a very bright child and has always been not bragging it's just the truth she's always gotten a's and b's and would get honor roll except that she loves to talk can't ask for everything lol i tried to explain that the curriculm in the school was obviously a problem and that it didn't matter if she got a's and b's if the work was easy basically she needs and deserves to be challenged it's very hard here to find a great school with space for her most go by an annual lottery which does not give us good odds of her getting in do your research you don't need a teaching degree all of the teachers in her school have one so what happened to thosed kids are you saying that they are all the problem she loves to talk didn't say it was a problem or that i was trying to fix it i plan to put her in activities that she can't do if we don't get home from school and work until about pm and she goes to bed at there's homework dinner bath and geez that's about all there's time for if i'ld be home with her all day teaching and spending time with her why should i not do that instead of spending about hours together each day during the week much of which is spent running around and doing things to get ready for tomorrow there is no time for fun except on the weekends when she wants to hang out with her grandmom plus she spends time with her dad this way we will have the time for quality time and enjoying each other not every school has gifted programs and even when they said they would put her in an advanced reading class they didn't do anything very differently then the regular reading class as i also said it is very hard in this area first of all to find a good school second of all that will have a space for her how many schools do i keep trying now that can't be good for her were we live they have better schools for middle school kids and if they works out she might be back in school in years and we definitely some really good high schools but she is going to need the credentials to get in the school why pick a kid with a's and b's from a bad school when you can get them from good schools instead littlebarb her teaching credentials include being her daughter's mother she seems to have actually graduated the grade she'll be teaching her one and only student and it sounds like she's able to research and read a teacher's manual in third grade it's not terribly difficult to teach one student not knowing her or her situation other than what is written i find it pretty antagonistic that you would judge her so harshly please get the facts on homeschooling rather than just the stereotypes on to our regularly scheduled question if you have sole custody it's really your decision your ex though he can state that he disagrees wouldn't have much of a say in it if you're in a joint custody situation though that could get a bit sticky you may need to get your attorney involved i understand where you're coming from i pulled my son in first grade for the same reason he was years ahead of his class and very verbal and quite frankly he wasn't learning a thing he was bored silly his teacher not knowing how to handle him threatened to recommend adhd testing and medication it was starting to take more time calming him down from his day at school and unlearning the habits that he was being taught than it does to homeschool him for bright kids especially the ones that don't fit neatly into their school's gifted class pattern homeschooling can be a great option my son is starting th grade at age he is on grade level in a few subjects and on a th th grade level in others he is also dyslexic he is very verbal very hands on and our school system just plain isn't able to accomodate him the majority of the teachers in our district are just not trained to work with gifted kids much less those who don't sit still and listen at all times i'm not saying they're bad teachers many of them are very good but gifted education is a whole different ballgame gifted kids deserve an education on their level but it's not always available in the classroom i would suggest contacting hslda the link is below they are very well versed in the laws in every state and they can tell you what you need to do they can also most likely put you in touch with a homeschool group in your area that can help you http www hslda org default asp bhcp good luck with everything it sounds like you're doing the right thing  GED Milton H.

what can happen if you did homeschool for a year but didnt finish it and now your going to normal school they cant refuse you of school ryte but i didnt complete the year so what can they do will i just go back to the grade i was doing the homeschool for or will i go back grades help please for starters no they can't refuse to let you enroll in public school because you were homeschooled in the past your grade placement will depend on a combination of factors including your age your tested skill levels and the special programs for which you qualify and that your school district has to offer you may be enrolled in the grade that is appropriate for your age but be placed in classes for your skill level in our district that is the most likely scenario so if your reading was strong but your math not so hot you might be in an honors english class but a remedial math program until you catch up right now i can tell you that your writing is not strong don't worry about not finishing your skills and age are the most important considerations and what you were already told about high school placement by credits is correct  Homeschooling Education in the United States GED Graduate school High school SAT Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Secondary education in the United States Education in Romania Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology College admissions Education in South Korea Education in Portugal Stuyvesant High School North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Waldorf Education Education in Malaysia Education in Hong Kong Secondary education in Japan Salt Lake City School District Hunter College High School Education in Australia Lynbrook High School Montgomery Blair High School Education in Singapore Public high school New Trier High School Affirmative action Shreveport, Louisiana Miami-Dade County Public Schools Community college Master's degree Medical school Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) Ontario Academic Credit Education in Canada Law school Kwantlen University College Dyslexia IB Diploma Programme Junior Certificate Software testing National Certificate of Educational Achievement Pascack Valley High School Japanese tea ceremony Education in Austria Education in Japan Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy School Suncoast Community High School ELO rating system Charter school Magnet school Jaime Escalante Princeton High School, Sharonville, Ohio Education in France Beaverton School District Glen Ridge, New Jersey Education in Sweden Sport rowing Chiropractic Lowell High School (San Francisco) University of Alabama Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 A-level Science Bowl Equal Protection Clause Quizbowl Higher education in Japan Fast bowling Desegregation busing Dog agility Canyon del Oro High School Education in Albania Middle Tennessee State University Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Secondary education in France Adlai E.

i am going into th grade and i am afraid to go to school i have been attending a virtual charter school online and my mom now wants me to go back to school now so that i can socialize with other kids my age i am an a student and also a perfectionist my worst fear is taking tests did you ever hear of taking tests home well that is exactly what i want to do to ease my stress if they will not let me do that does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep calm and not worry my childhood years away is socialization the only reason your parents want you to go back to school honestly there are many social opportunities for homeschool kids google your hometown and homeschool or homeschool group and you should find them if you do end up going back to school the tests shouldn't be a problem trust me they're not as hard as you think they are designed to evaluate if you actually learned the material even if you don't make perfect grades on them which you may or may not you can still get good grades you may want to go ahead and get a book on test taking tips it may ease your stress your teachers probably won't let you take your tests home but if you talk with them they'll be able to give you some tips for not stressing through them it is a necessary skill to learn whether you're in a classroom or homeschool it's something you'll need to be able to do in college it's a lot easier to learn now when your transcripts don't matter as much than in high school or college just settle into it you're making it more stressful than it is if you can ace your homeschool classes chances are you can ace the tests  Homeschooling Education in the United States GED Education Grade (education) Education in Malaysia Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania SAT School Boston Public Test (student assessment) A.

non religious home school programs do these exist i'm currently using a beka books in the th grade program previously we just skipped the bible classes because i wasn't religious and we didn't have to send any reports in this year we do i know nothing about the bible and all of that and for next year i was wondering if anyone has heard of home school programs that do not revolve around religion and please do not come into this question and preach to me about religion there are alot of home school programs that do not revolve around religion i use james madison high school because they offer a college prep diploma and regular diploma the tuition runs around for all years but you can pay it monthly which will run about a month there are many other programs that are affordable too a million other people will probably recommend pennfoster which is a good program but they don't offer advanced courses and i found that the number of credits required to graduate wasn't enough for my local college they required a min of credits keystone is a bit pricier than jmhs or pennfoster but they are an excellent program as well there are many other options out there too simply google high school correspondence school correspondence schools are were they send you text books and you mail the work back to be graded some also offer online courses and you'll get alot of information check the accreditation of the program though you'll want it to be regionally accredited if you plan on going to college do some research on accreditation southern association of colleges and schools sacs is one regional accreditation alot of these programs are work at your own pace and ment to be done independently but if you have someone teaching you the material i'm sure that would work out fine too check k too your state may offer a virtual public school which is free and you can take classes through them with a virtual public school you'll have a teacher available to you and have deadlines just like a regular class good luck  Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Education in Germany Graduate school Law school Education in Malaysia Juris Doctor Advanced Placement Program Athabasca University Homeschooling Distance education Associate's degree Education in Portugal Community college Education in Canada Pennsylvania State University Education in Hong Kong No Child Left Behind Act Independent school (UK) Education in Taiwan High school Grade (education) Education Master's degree College Education in Romania Education in France Credit card Intelligent design movement Education in Japan IB Diploma Programme GED University of Michigan Medical school University of Central Florida Librarian United States Postal Service School choice Teacher Cornell University Brown University Ontario Academic Credit Education in Singapore Franklin W.

what is the best accredited homeschooling program for k not just high school it depends on your definition of best when i think in terms of accredited programs best means the accreditation is a valid and useful one the southern association of colleges and schools means something acme accrediting agency does not and the program meets the needs of my family for example abeka academy as opposed to just using abeka curriculum is an excellent program and their accreditation is accepted just about everywhere but if you are not christian it is not the best program for your family in order to hold an accreditation a program has to be a part of an actual place example abeka only holds an accreditation if you are enrolled in abeka academy you can still use their materials and get the same education without being enrolled in their school but you will not have the accredited transcript or diploma these items are not necessary to have a successful homeschool education but if that is what you want that is how you go about getting them in order to find the best for your family start looking around but remember if a website says their curriculum is accredited and they don't have the option to enroll in an umbrella school meaning your child would be considered an offsite student then it isn't a valid accreditation  Homeschooling Education in the United States School accreditation GED Juris Doctor Education in Australia University of Central Florida Law school Patrick Henry College Education in Hong Kong Software engineering Community college High school Florida Institute of Technology California Baptist University Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University Athabasca University University of Houston Paralegal St. John's College, U.

is it possible to do homeschooling and public schooling both at once i'm and i feel that some of my teachers do a shtty job teaching but some teachers are real good was wondering if i can do homeschooling for some subjects like math perhaps i really can't stand these teachers i was seriously thinking about starting a riot with all the kids in the school against dumba teachers websites would be cool thanks well i think supplemental work in the language arts area would enhance your ability to express yourself tremendously but in most states you cannot opt to take say half your core classes at the highschool an the other half at home and expect all of the credits to appear on your public school transcript and yet as i stated with my first sentence there is absolutely nothing wrong with enhancing your studies with additional work at home say for example you find your world geography teacher is really nothing more than a babysitter really doing nothing more than engaging the class in meaningless busy work you could do a homeschool geography class at home and actually learn something you home class will not be a credit on your transcript but the a you will get for that class definitely will some states not all but some will allow you to take online classes instead of traditional sit in a classroom classes you will just have to check the rules for your school bottom line even though i seriously don't agree with your use of curse words as a means of self expression i admire your tenacity in exploring options to maximize your education  Homeschooling Education in the United States Waldorf Education Education in Romania GED No Child Left Behind Act Education in Malaysia A Course In Miracles Drama Graduate school High school SAT Tai Chi Chuan Boston Public Hogwarts subjects Greek language Secondary education in France Reiki Education A.

school bus im going to start school in four days and im worried about the bus dropping me off its my first year in public school what if the buss drops me off far and i have to walk alone and get abducted but really the problem is i have to catch the bus at in the morning and they thinkg of dropping me off near a highway can you gve me some tips and im worried the people will think im rich and they wont like me can you give me some feedback when i started public school i also had to ride the school bus if you live in the suburbs the only reason you would get dropped off away from your house is if it's a bus stop and the a lot of other kids will get off with you so you won't be alone if you live in the country like me then the bus driver really should know what he's doing and will drop you off in the right place one time my bus driver drove passed a girls house because she hardly ever rides the bus and she went up told him she was on and he simply turned around and went back to her house i never saw the bus not drop someone off at their house where i live the bus driver would get in a lot of trouble if they did something like that to a little kid for example so they generally are fairly careful about people liking you just be yourself just be careful not to be too shy because then poeple think you are stuck up sometimes that's what happened to me you could try introducing yourself to people you'd like to meet and just be friendly good luck starting school was scary and fun at the same time for me  Hitchhiking Social rule Chris Amon Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete 2000 Australian Grand Prix About a Boy School bus Aerial (dance move) Oh My Goddess!
