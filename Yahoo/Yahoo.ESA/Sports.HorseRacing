i want a horse kind of but my trainer turns down every single one whats should i do i sorta kinda want a horse but everytime i find what seems like the perfect horse my trainer always has something to say about it like this one horse i found on the internet that was a good horse for beginners learning how to jump and is really good with kids but she said that it would be a difficult horse so should i just wait or just try to keep finding that perfect horse maybe because you only kind of want a horse maybe your trainer knows you're not ready for one for real yet but even so there's a balance it's ultimately your choice your trainer can't tell you no but if i were you i'd trust their advice especially if you're buying from the internet people can say whatever they want about what they're selling and it may not be true your trainer should know what's best maybe ask them to direct you to some trusted breeders suppliers if you ask your trainer for advice they can help you find a good one  Horse breaking Horse Rich Mullins Microeconomics Horse gait Weight training Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dog training Quake III Arena Cliff Richard Horse racing Pok__mon Trading Card Game Eventing Socrates Battle Frontier Supply and demand Thoroughbred horse race Trojan horse (computing) Obedience training Taikyoku shogi Breeders' Cup GunZ The Duel Radio controlled airplane Seabiscuit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Smarty Jones Sunday Silence Equine conformation Dog agility Theodicy Martial art Cattle A Course In Miracles Boxing training Pok__mon (anime) Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Girls Aloud Missingno.

in horse racing what do the classes represent ie c c c and which class is superior as the grade them i want to know about the classes and how they grade the horses and which grade is superior does the grade improve as you go up numerically or viceversa in gb and ireland races are rated according to their class the higher the class of race the better the prize money and therefore the better the quality of the race class races are made up of group group group and listed races the so called pattern races class races tend to be high end handicaps and conditions races and the odd high value maiden race class races are made of predominantly handicaps classified races and maidens class races are much the same as class just lesser in value class races are made up of maidens median auction races sellers and claimers class races are again similar to class but lesser in value then we have the class dreaded banded races these are races for horses who are so poorly rated that they cannot get a run in any other types of race personally i think we should scrap these races and take the useless horses out of the racing population they'd have a much happier life doing something like showjumping or dressage each class of race has a minimum value that is the bare minimum of prize money that should be on offer for that class of race minimum values change several times a year and unfortunately they always seem to go down  Grade (education) Eventing Affirmative action Thoroughbred horse race Life insurance Graduate school A-level Conditions races Education in the United States Resistor Illegal drug trade Capitalism Dressage Melbourne Cup Beatmania IIDX Gambling Equine conformation Diamond Motor oil Sport rowing Slot machine Show jumping Circuit design Makybe Diva Go ranks and ratings Grade (climbing) Galactic Civilizations Secondary education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Supply and demand Education in Japan Mortgage Education in Hong Kong Listed building Auction Warrant Officer Horse racing Thoroughbred Poker jargon Education in Portugal Junior Certificate Arbitrage Mutual fund Final Fantasy XI Coin collecting Race and intelligence Security (finance) The Amazing Race High school Seabiscuit Kart racing Audiophile Volvo Ocean Race Murder Education in Australia Sport in Ireland Commodity markets Steel Horse show Species Insurance Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Canadian Pacific Railway Horse Mercedes-Benz PGA European Tour Equitation Social class Might and Power Grand Prix motorcycle racing Flat tax Diablo II Electronic amplifier Tour de France Motion picture rating system Economic inequality Family name Over (cricket) Growth hormone treatment Breeders' Cup Paradox Industrial Revolution Education in Romania Secondary education in the United States Advanced Squad Leader Privatization Mental illness Ra (board game) Gross domestic product 8 mm video format Airbus A320 No Child Left Behind Act Jet engine Education in Germany Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME College admissions GED American Quarter Horse

horse racing and the triple crown ok i need to know names of the prelimary races in order to qualify for the triple crown how long training generally takes for horse and rider how much these horses run for registration processes and anything else you guys think is useful ty technically there are no qualifying races for the kentucky derby the preakness and the belmont stakes the only qualifier is that any horse entered must be a registered three year old thoroughbred must not be on the starters stewards or vets list on any track i e must be gate qualified and the owner has to have paid the proper entry fees qualifiers come into play only if the field for any of the races is oversubscribed the derby field is limited to starters if more than horses are entered the top twenty ranked by earnings in graded stakes are allowed to start in the derby everyone else gets their entry money refunded graded stakes are races that a committee of people appointed for the task have rated as having the necessary quality to be considered top races grade races are the creme de la creme after that there are grade and grade races any money earned in graded stakes counts towards derby or preakness qualification in practice you're never going to see the belmont stakes oversubscribed there are so few horses that can get miles in top company it's rare to even get a full field of entered buchanan sir barton and broker's tip all won the derby as their maiden victory while it's doubtful now that a maiden would be able to get into the derby field it isn't impossible and there are no rules to prevent it the derby today has a purse of added it costs to enter the derby with an additional to start the winner of the derby street sense earned for winning the preakness had a purse and curlin won for his victory the belmont stakes had a purse and rags to riches won for her victory this link gives you the names and information of some of the more important prep races for the triple crown http www ntra com content aspx type other id however it's important to note that it's possible for a horse to come into the triple crown with no prep races as a three year old at all if a horse won enough graded stakes money as a two year old to be in the top twenty for the derby field or if fewer than horses were entered in the derby then a horse could just train up to the derby although it would take a wizard of a trainer and one heck of a horse to win under those circumstances  Smarty Jones Belmont Stakes Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing Horse racing Man O' War (horse) Sunday Silence Secretariat (horse) Spectacular Bid Seabiscuit Belmont Park Horace A.

horses question plz help what is truelly the fastest horse breed is it the american quarter the thoroughbred the standard bred morgan or the arabian and which is the most beutiful of them i have asked manny ppl n everybody says adifferent thing plz help me i wana buy a horse thx you'll get many different answers on this because much of this is a matter of opinion thoroughbreds have been bred for generations for speed at the gallop the fastest gait thoroughbreds are generally considered the fastest horses and can run at speeds of miles and hour quarter horses were bred for working livestock as well as speed at short sprinting distances of mile quarter horse people will likely argue that at short sprints their horses are fastest standardbreds were bred for speed also but at the trot or pace which is simply not as fast as a gallop morgans and arabs have not been bred for speed per se the arabs a long time ago when the sheiks raced them but not so much now so arabs and morgans would not be as fast as a thoroughbred are you planning on racing a horse unless you are you don't need a fast horse beauty is so much a matter of personal taste that everyone will tell you something different arabs have lovely heads with dished muzzles and a high tail carriage so many will say they are the most beautiful but morgans are pretty too and saddlebreds can have wonderful flashy gaits  Equine conformation Horse Harness racing Standardbred horse Arabian horse American Quarter Horse Horse racing Thoroughbred Tennessee Walker American Saddlebred Morgan horse Thoroughbred horse race Equitation Barb (horse) Sprint (race) Trakehner Triathlon Trot (horse gait) Dressage Ben Johnson (athlete) Kentucky Horse Park Appaloosa Seabiscuit Drag racing Racing Newmarket Warmblood Woodbine Racetrack Middle distance track event Akhal-Teke Roan (color) Show hunter High-speed rail Kentucky Derby Icelandic horse 24 Hours of Le Mans Bicycling terminology Hanoverian (horse) United Kingdom horse-racing Spectacular Bid Gray Wolf Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Fast bowling Gambling TGV Preakness Stakes Athlon Might and Power Running Species Docking Friesian horse Welsh Cob (Section D) Meadowlands Racetrack Show jumping Havanese Exceller Cross-country equestrianism Ruffian (horse) American Paint Horse Belmont Stakes Clydesdale (breed) Sports timeline Pekingese Harry Payne Whitney 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.

when you are riding a horse what is it called when you are riding a horse normally like on a saddle with your legs on both sides because there is side saddle bareback and thanks i don't believe there's a general term for riding in a saddle with one leg on each side there are many disciplines of riding in which you're in a saddle with one leg on each side and i believe instead of a general term we use many specific terms for whatever discipline the rider is doing the two blanket terms for riding are western and english if you're riding in the big saddle with the horn it's western if it's a smaller saddle without the horn it's english but even then there's many many different things you could be doing with your horse if western you might be doing western pleasure horsemanship trail riding running barrels or poles cattle cutting or some other ranch type event if english you might be doing jumping or just flatting and you might be using a wide variety of saddles hunt seat saddle seat dressage personally instead of saying that i'm riding normally with one leg on each side of the saddle instead i say that i'm flatting or hacking or jumping my hunter actually i believe if you just say that 'i'm riding my horse' most people would understand that to mean riding normally with a saddle the other two are less common most people ride normally with a saddle that's why there's no name for it it's not really special it's not uncommon  Horse Cowboy Horse tack Equine conformation Equitation Show jumping Western Saddle Comanche Arabian horse Dressage Hunt seat Horse gait Eventing Rodeo Rail terminology Horse show American Quarter Horse Bicycle Skateboarding trick American Bison Appaloosa Archery King Ranch Seabiscuit Standardbred horse Stirrup John Wayne Bullfighting Tank locomotive Tennessee Walker Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Bicycle frame Thoroughbred Bull riding Connemara pony Thoroughbred horse race Windsurfing Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Cavalry Charreada Breaker Morant Martingale (tack) Paragliding Cowboy boot Bridle Kitesurfing Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics Clarinet Unicorn Trail Mountain biking Tour de France Steer wrestling Traveller (horse) Arizona Territory Pistol Switzerland at the 2004 Summer Olympics Zion National Park Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ostrich United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Bow (weapon) Fast bowling Noseband National Finals Rodeo American Saddlebred Horse breaking Tai shogi Glossary of climbing terms Crop (implement) Western (genre) Ammonite Dog agility Charisma (horse) Chris LeDoux United Kingdom horse-racing Professional wrestling aerial techniques Selkirk Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Fox hunting Snowboarding Western music (North America) Aerial (dance move) Captain Thunderbolt Belmont Park Native Americans in the United States Coney Island Spanking Chu shogi American Old West Chariot Surfing Livestock Milton H.

why does a person have to mount a horse on the left side who started the tradition of mounting a horse on the left side in the ancient cavalry s the right handed soldiers always carried their sword in its sheath on their left legs since swords were long swinging the left leg over the horse would be akward or almost impossible so they could bend it a little to put the left foot in the stirrup and swing their free leg over the horse so this habit as in many things is based on tradition also a horse is worked with from the left side with leading it is again easier for a right handed person to lead with his her dominant hand etc  Cavalry Cowboy Swingout Equine conformation Horse Horse tack Stirrup Professional wrestling holds Horse gait Professional wrestling throws Cowboy boot Queen's Guard Horizontal bar Lance Charleston (dance move) Medieval warfare Backstroke Suplex Side pass (dance move) Knife Fast bowling Bullfighting Comanche Glossary of climbing terms Butterfly stroke Trooping the Colour Ancient warfare Glossary of partner dance terms Kick Himura Kenshin Roman legion Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day Taikyoku shogi Colours, standards and guidons Battle of Marston Moor Pole vault Show jumping Contredanse Professional wrestling attacks Figure skating Military history of China Sword Parade (military) Cheerleading Circle (dance move) Nathan Bedford Forrest Harness racing Fencing Ko shogi Twelve Swords of Power Armour Skateboarding trick Katana Battle of Agincourt Glossary of ballet terms Types of bowlers in cricket Sling (weapon) U.S. 1st Cavalry Division Lindy Basic Batting (cricket) Boxing Polish cavalry Punt (boat) Show hunter New Model Army Double bass Archery Dressage Softball MS-07 Gouf Battle of Waterloo Piledriver (professional wrestling) Cavalry in the American Civil War Traveller (horse) Jousting Jazz Xiangqi Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby Cricket Club (weapon) Jazz dance moves Alexander the Great Front crawl Lead and follow (dance) Burial Samurai Third Battle of Gaza Lightsaber combat Martial art Mounted infantry Road Tank Battles of Lexington and Concord Diving Pickett's Charge Seabiscuit Philip Kearny ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity

how much does a clydesdale horse cost like the ones in the budweiser commercial this is the horse racing section and clydesdales don't race but to answer your question like any purebred horse breed you would probably be looking at a few thousand dollars minimum to buy a registered clydesdale the price would vary a lot depending on the horse's age show record bloodlines and training older horses with extensive training and successful show records and good bloodlines will cost the most possibly reaching into figures a younger horse that has little training no show record and parents who aren't especially well known would be the least expensive by the way in reference to the previous poster no horse costs one billion dollars and you can't buy a live horse on ebay it's against ebay rules  Thoroughbred Selective breeding Arabian horse Horse Clydesdale (breed) Microeconomics Arbitrage Supply and demand $ale of the Century Appaloosa Equine conformation Dog agility Friesian horse General aviation Dot-com Hyperinflation Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Canadian Pacific Railway Illegal drug trade Anheuser-Busch Wal-Mart Inflation Bulk vending Horse racing Live 8 FairTax O scale Amway Standardbred horse High-speed rail Advance fee fraud The Amazing Race Neopets Euro War horse Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
