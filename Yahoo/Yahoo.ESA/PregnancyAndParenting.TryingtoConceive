me and my dh have been ttc for month we have sex once a day and no luck i dont no what is wrong we are both fertile and i even sit with my legs up afterwards ok the fact that you said you are having sex every day indicates to me that you really don't know your body and when you actually ovulate i would highly suggest you start charting your temps each day in bed before getting up eating or drinking search on t internet for some good bbt sites to help you basically by doing this it willclearly indicate to you when your most fertile days are also every day is not always the best way to get pg as usually the sperm needs a day to charge up again it is told by fertility specialists to have sex only every days if after a few months of ttc while knowing your body better you are still not pg then perhaps ask to see someone for some basica tests on you both dr's however don't consider you have a problem unless you have been ttc for a year at least with no success take your pre natal vitamins give hubby some vit c e zink and good luck  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Puberty In vitro fertilisation Toronto Transit Commission Ovulation Social rule Birth control Sexual reproduction Pregnancy Infertility Polycystic ovary syndrome Sexual intercourse Oral contraceptive Tocopherol Old wives' tale Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Toronto Subway and RT Abortion debate The Star Wars Holiday Special Androgen insensitivity syndrome Emergency contraception Fecal incontinence Guinea pig Fertilisation Germaine Greer Spider Paget's disease of bone Ploidy Friends Brian Close Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer Ovum Rod Stewart Jam (TV series) Holes (book) Birthday Sperm Whale R.

how accurate are pregnancy tests that have been sitting around in your home for a few months this morning i used a pregnancy test that i purchased from the hpt online store about a few months ago it was still in the original packaging but has been sitting around since march right now i am about days late for my period but my last period i think was actually implantation because it started two days before it was expected and was brown and pink then it stopped and i had a light period i tested then with a similar test but i figured if i just implanted right before my period then it would be too early to make a long story short my periods are always this glamorous production meaning i get cramps and nausea a full week before it actually comes now i have nothing but a big stomach constipation and constant sleep so to get to my reason for posting this question will using old test give me a false response and if so what tests generally work well i am going to wal mart today but will not test again until wednesday morning it could be expired or if you read the instructions it says you should not store below certain temperature in your home or over a high one we had a particularily warm summer hitting over the 's which i k now is about what the box says normally do not store over degrees so think of that too i tested with first response and got the correct positive after testing with a few others and getting negatives good luck  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Sears Holdings Corporation Thermoregulation Stomach cancer Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 SAT Drug test Pregnancy test Mattress RFID Dialysis Fertility awareness Wal-Mart Normal distribution STS-62 Gastroparesis Abortion Coeliac disease Abduction Phenomenon Scientology beliefs and practices GED Oscilloscope Weather lore Global climate model Daylight saving time $ale of the Century RISC Hubble Space Telescope Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Capercaillie Sea level rise Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Climate of the United Kingdom Ovarian cancer Big Bang Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Circuit design Solar power Heinkel He 112 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Heinkel He 100 Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Emergency contraception Dog USS Yorktown (CV-10) Prenatal diagnosis Haloperidol Prostate cancer Wheel of Fortune Aortic dissection Diode Bayesian inference Adjustable gastric band Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 STS-61 Ozone depletion Billboard Hot 100 Paul Is Dead Soap opera UK Singles Chart Explosive material 2000 Australian Grand Prix Craps Ceramics Young Earth creationism Gregorian calendar Poker jargon Computus Psoriasis Steam (content delivery) Jeopardy!

eating african yams increases chances of having twins so does anyone know where to buy them are there any vitamins or other forms you can buy these in i heard the mexican yams decreases ovulation and used for birth control but i'm concerned about the african yams the ones you buy at the supermarket i'm not sure what type those are please no smart answers and answers like you can buy them in africa serious answers only it has been reported that this variety of yams is linked to twins however i doubt that specific variety is available here in the united states also you would have to eat a lot of them it is a staple in the diet of the women there i am talking about yams with every meal and they probably eat them all of their life not just when ttc which has something to do with the high rate of twin births i know in large communities there are specialty stores such as those for latino or asian foods perhaps there is something similar for african foods i would start there  Ramen Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Malaysia Oral contraceptive Folic acid Vegetarianism Nutrition Milk Tofu Food Veganism Tocopherol Supermarket Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Soul food Hispanic Cancer Organic food Anemia Famine Cuisine of the Southern United States Breakfast Domesticated turkey Dieting Stomach cancer African American Vernacular English Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Thailand Retinol Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Fecal incontinence Guinea pig Maize Fertility awareness Irish cuisine Watermelon Egg (food) Chile pepper Domestic rabbit Food storage Menstrual cycle Atkins Nutritional Approach Bread Colorectal cancer Green Revolution Birth control Healthy eating Coeliac disease Raw food diet Diabetes mellitus Insulin Culture of Africa Binge eating disorder Obesity Genetically modified food Biology and sexual orientation Toronto Streetcar System Vitamin C French cuisine Chicken Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Super Size Me Aztec Soybean Potato DDT Human skin color Cassava Agriculture Prostate cancer Hamburger Overpopulation Acorn Cuisine of Denmark Urban sprawl Anorexia nervosa Cuisine of Brazil Race (U.S. Census) Cat Cheese Demographic transition Best Buy Omega-3 fatty acid Peanut Sauerkraut Taboo food and drink Local food Meal Root vegetable Miso Economy of Togo Hypoglycemia Elephant Abortion debate Protein-energy malnutrition Delicatessen Vitamin Emily Kngwarreye

how long after i take prometrium to bring my period should i begin ttc i have not had my period since may and had my blood drawn on august th thursday to confirm that i am not pregnant my results will not be back until wednesday august but my doctor prescribed mg of prometrium progesterone for days to bring on my period and she suggested that i begin taking it tomorrow august th which is sunday if it comes back that i was pregnant would this harm my baby and would i still get a period if i was indeed pregnant if i am not pregnant how soon after i take prometrium progesterone to bring on my period can we begin ttc hey prometrium is a natural progesterone just like your body produces so it will not harm your baby if you are indeed pregnant a lot of women actually take prometrium during early pregnancy if their progesterone levels are low if you are pregnant you shouldn't get your period as progesterone helps build the lining of the uterus if you aren't pregnant the lining will be shed within five days of going off prometrium i took it back in march after not getting my period since december i took it for seven days and got my period about four days after going off i ended up having a normal cycle the following two months and conceived the second month as well hopefully your body will figure things out like mine did and you'll ovulate your next cycle i really watched cervical mucas looking for the fertile stretchy stuff and also bought a basil body thermometer from wal mart and started charting my temperatures your temperature will spike after ovulation this took the guess work out of wondering if i ovulated or not here's a few websites that might help http www praying ababy com bbtcharting html http www fertilityfriend com helpcenter ffbook ff fertility signs html the book taking charge of your fertility by tony weschler is also a great book that was super helpful also these websites offer free trials for you to enter bbt temperatures and it detects when and if you are most fertile and if you ovulate www fertilityfriend com good site http www tcoyf com even better i hope this helps oh and you should ovulate around days after your period begins this number fluctuates quite a bit from person to person it could certainly occur later so checking cervical mucas and bbt will help a lot start trying around eleven days after your period comes sperm can live up to five days at least every other day until after ovulation no more than once a day  Pregnancy Ovulation Progesterone In vitro fertilisation Puberty Obstetrics Miscarriage Emergency contraception Human chorionic gonadotropin Estrus cycle Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infertility Endometriosis Gonorrhoea Urinary incontinence Folic acid Pregnancy test Sharon Tate Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Breastfeeding Fertilisation Ovary Abortion debate Ovarian cyst EastEnders Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Malaria Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Solar variation Prostate cancer Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Niddah Cancer Endometrial cancer Spina bifida Cytomegalovirus Hormone replacement therapy Sexual reproduction Multiple birth Tocopherol HyperText Transfer Protocol Endometrium Fasting Abortion Cervical cancer Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Estradiol Bipolar disorder Twin HIV test Thermoregulation Temperature Religion and abortion Cat Vampire Ovarian cancer Prenatal diagnosis Elephant Swyer syndrome Psoriasis Sexual abstinence Infantilism Sexual intercourse Gregorian calendar World Wide Web Dog Uniform Resource Locator The Chemical Brothers Flowering plant Coeliac disease Gregory Goodwin Pincus Wal-Mart Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Time Out of Mind Rosa Parks Ovum Female reproductive system (human) Breast cancer Calculating the day of the week Cystic fibrosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Tsetse fly Cholesterol Human cloning Toronto Streetcar System

hi the highest temperature on the day is the ovulating day as the second poster said your temperature goes up after you have already ovulated if you are waiting till then to have intercourse then its too late use some other ovulation predictors like a kit or use the mucus method to help pinpoint ovulation time temperature is not always reliable as several things can interfere including if you are sick or if you have been drinking your temperature will go up and then you have no way of telling  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Emergency contraception Birth control Sexual abstinence Oral contraceptive Mucus Hyperthermia Niddah Common cold Ovarian cyst Hiking Estrus cycle Pregnancy Thermoregulation Ovarian cancer Fruit Flowering plant Fasting History of sex Pachypodium ambongense Cat Progesterone CPU cache Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Rabbit Law School Admissions Test Pachypodium baronii Hydrochloric acid Dehydration Estradiol Pregnancy test Carburetor Entropy Sonar Mitral valve prolapse Sexual reproduction Decompression sickness Spacecraft propulsion Guinness Paleoclimatology Climate of Salt Lake City Sexually-transmitted infection Father's Day (Doctor Who) Weather forecasting First aid The Day After Tomorrow Branch predictor Fruit tree propagation Bread Radiometric dating Weather lore Infertility Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Instrumental temperature record Chocolate Sexual intercourse Global climate model Carpel Climate of the United Kingdom Nebraska Diseases of the honeybee Water purification Conifer cones Alps Semiconductor STS-50 Wang Mang Polyethylene terephthalate Cannabis (drug) Nuclear weapon design Christmas Homebuilt aircraft Community emergency response team Coffee In vitro fertilisation Salvia divinorum Strap-on dildo Rule of St Benedict Sniper Rape Death Valley National Park Solar power Heat equation Statistics Cocaine Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Pachypodium brevicaule Compact disc Autonomous building Gynecologic hemorrhage Ocean's Twelve A.I.

before i get called an idiot just an ovulation question i was wondering if you can ovulate twice in one cycle is it possible no abusive or smart ass remarks please thank you this is actually a good question there's two possibilities here only of the time is it possible to ovulate twice in a month so it's not a common occurence while your body may not ovulate twice it may attempt ovulation more than once in a cycle what this means is that your body can go through all the motions fertile cm ovulation pain matured follicle lh surge but not actually ovulate due to stress illness travelling etc and then go through those same motions and actually ovulate with the second attempt this one is a little more common than actually ovulating twice both of these situations give women a second chance at conception within the same cycle pretty cool huh great question and good luck  Ovulation Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Estrus cycle Puberty Pregnancy Ovarian cyst Fertilisation Conifer cones Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fruit Flowering plant Female reproductive system (human) Birth control Carpel Infertility Premenstrual stress syndrome Moss Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Human chorionic gonadotropin Time Flower Emergency contraception Ovum Singlish Acne Hair Breastfeeding Tsetse fly Progesterone Ovarian cancer Marchantiophyta Endometrium Infantilism Stem cell Social rule Malaria Follicle-stimulating hormone Aikido Chronic fatigue syndrome Kodocha Bipolar disorder Darwin from Orchids to Variation American Idiot Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Spore Anorexia nervosa Luteinizing hormone Species Non-human animal sexuality Seed Sexual abstinence Domestic violence Sexual reproduction Canadian House of Commons Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Sandworm (Dune) Numerology Baldness Extreme Programming Aladdin (1992 film) Jean Baudrillard Scientology beliefs and practices Blood on the Tracks Meiosis Twin Game show Chinese calendar Goodness and value theory 2000 Australian Grand Prix Simone Weil Poker jargon Maya calendar Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Shit Orgasm Gynaecology Mountain Gorilla Ozone depletion Entropy Conjunctivitis Baldness treatments Glacier Parliament of the United Kingdom Kyle Broflovski Pregnancy test Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Michelson-Morley experiment Beavis and Butt-head Abortion debate Predestination The nature of God in Western theology Anovulation

has anyone ever taken hormonal treatment to induce menstruation and ovulation i went to the gyno today for my pap and annual exam and i haven't been having my period and i'm not pregnant i'm having some blood work done to check my thyroid levels prolactin levels insulin levels and other hormone levels tommorrow there is a possibility that she is going to put me on medications that manually take over my cycle causing me to have my period when i should and ovulate when i should has anyone else ever tried a similar treatment and what was your experience with it peaches i tried vitex and some other complexes already they worked for a few months and then didn't work for me so i'm finally going to the doctor i have done this before they had me take a medication called provera for days depends on the doctor and your period starts in days if you're trying to get pregnant your doctor may also prescribe medicine like clomid if not they may have you just take the provera the first time i took the provera it made me a little sick but i was fine after the first time the best advice i can give you is to take right before bed that way if it does make you feel sick you can sleep through most of it  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertility awareness Prolactinoma Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Ovulation Progesterone Obstetrics Hyperprolactinaemia Sleep Stomach cancer Medicine Oral contraceptive Hypoglycemia Puberty Breastfeeding Malaria Birth control Diabetes mellitus Thyroid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Cancer Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Estrus cycle Human chorionic gonadotropin Orgasm Prolactin Ovarian cyst Epilepsy Bipolar disorder Psychiatry Infertility Physician Endocrinology Insomnia Acne Physical therapy Folic acid Emergency contraception First aid Transsexuality Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Acromegaly Growth hormone deficiency Nutrition Abortion Obesity Amiodarone Maprotiline Amenorrhoea Fecal incontinence Gynaecology Growth hormone treatment Pregnancy test Endocrine system Miscarriage Niddah Hormone replacement therapy Hypertension Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fibromyalgia Pneumonia Triage Radiation poisoning Chlorpromazine Nurse Panic attack Hepatitis C Ionizing radiation Hyperthyroidism Coeliac disease Post-traumatic stress disorder General practitioner Erectile dysfunction Baldness treatments Vitamin C Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baldness Stuttering Medical prescription Estradiol Church of Christ, Scientist Gastroparesis Thyroid cancer Anorexia nervosa Lupus erythematosus Glucokinase Morning sickness

how do you know when you are ovulating and when is the best time to get pregnant the only true way to know when you are ovulating is to chart your cycles not all women even those with regular days cycles ovulate on day it's a myth and why so many young women find themselves not pregnant after months of trying if the day rule was true then the rythm method would be fail proof birth control wouldn't it anyway there's a great resource book called taking charge of your fertility book which will teach you indepth what you need to learn to effectively chart your cycles to determine when and if you are ovulating after you've read that i reccomend going on to http www fertilityfriend com and using the online tools to imput your info in the beginning it's easier to let the computer do the graphing until you fully understand what you are doing it also has places to mark when you had sex and you can look at the graph and know if you timed things right to result in pregnancy just don't go at it blindly you may be one of the few who ovulate on day but you might not and it could be months and years of frustration while ttc and uneeded tests and proceedures at the fertility clinic because you stopped too early or missed the window of opportunity each month because of the day myth  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Oral contraceptive Birth control Ovulation Emergency contraception Astrology Puberty Pregnancy test Niddah CPU cache Ovarian cyst Sexual abstinence Sexual intercourse Twin Compiler optimization Friends Autism Folic acid Human chorionic gonadotropin Miscarriage World Wide Web Scientific method Estrus cycle Abortion debate Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Spina bifida Sexual reproduction Flowering plant Abortion Common Unix Printing System GED NP-complete Ovary History of sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extreme Programming Perl Graph theory Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tocopherol Health issues and the effects of cannabis Randomness Gonorrhoea Literacy Cytomegalovirus Python programming language Debugging Fruit AIDS Computus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Marilyn Monroe Hebrew calendar Coeliac disease Solar variation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breast cancer Fibonacci number IP (complexity) Urinary incontinence Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Tamriel Endometriosis Expert system Gregory Goodwin Pincus Conifer cones Multiple sclerosis Joseph Campbell Obstetrics Prostate cancer Ramsey's theorem Windows 2000 Cheating in Counter-Strike Knots Landing Glossary of graph theory Multiple birth Mathematics Ovarian cancer Artificial neural network EastEnders Progesterone Logo programming language Roe v.

regarding my bbt could i get some advice hello i was just wondering if this is normal i just starting charting this cycle and im confused i am trying to be more aware of my cm quality etc and taking my temp at the same time every morning so here is my questions my temp was pretty steady each morning until a few days ago when it started changing for example day it was day it was day and today i did not have eggwhite cm yet so i dont know if i already ovulate and not realize it i really dont know how to check my cervix yet or exactly what to look for i have tried but i dont really know exactly how far it need to check or where exaclty it is i have read tcoyf and seen the pictures but im still confused can you please help thank you the temp dip is usually due to the estrogen surge that precedes ovulation so i would expect that you might ovulate in the next day or so it is typically cd anyway so that makes sense your vagina is about the same length as your middle finger try sitting on the toilet or putting one leg up on the edge of the tub and inserting one clean dry finger inside your cervix is like a very small penis shaped dealy o that lengthens and shortens throughout your cycle and has a hole in the middle the os like the hole in a penis when you're fertile the cervix is shorter and it is way up at the top of your vagina so you can barely feel it it's soft like the your cheek and way up high really flush with the top of the vagina so that sperm can easily slip in there to find the egg when it's high you can't really find it i can't reach it any longer if you want to feel what low cervical position is feel it when you're about to get your period and it will be much lower in your vagina and feel more like the tip of your nose for me it's literally an inch or so long then and i can easily feel the opening and the penis shape of the cervix hth  Menstrual cycle Menstrual cup Strap-on dildo Sexual reproduction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Vagina Condom Pregnancy Birth control Knife Violin Cervix Drill bit In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Sexual intercourse Ovulation Equine conformation Intersex surgery Penis Female reproductive system (human) Cervical cancer Textile manufacturing Fertilisation Childbirth Floppy disk Anal sex Niddah Poker jargon Casting Cat Orgasm Bong Ovary Tampon Mattress Diaphragm (contraceptive) Emergency contraception Internal ballistics Professional wrestling holds Milton H.

is there a certain position that will help you conceive a girl i really want a little girl but i want to know what position is best for that for a girl have sex days prior to ovulation rather than the day before or the day of ovulation the reason is because the boy y chromosome swim faster but die sooner girls x swim slower but live longer which means that by the time your egg drops the boy chormosome would most likely have already died leaving the girls to continue on good luck  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Puberty Pregnancy Ovulation Flowering plant Niddah In vitro fertilisation Spice Girls Twin Emergency contraception Sex Fertilisation Breaststroke Bond girl About a Boy Backstroke History of intersex surgery Drosophila melanogaster Sexual reproduction Sex assignment Platypus Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Grammatical aspect Butterfly stroke Chromosome Swimming Woman Child sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Grumpy's Three Wishes Birth control Girls Aloud Sex and intelligence Phaedo Oral contraceptive Abortion debate X chromosome Front crawl Intersexuality Y chromosome Sexual identity Pedophilia Ovary Ploidy Teen Girl Squad Sexual abstinence Vehicular cycling Luck Billboard Hot 100 Quicksort Cloning Lyte Funky Ones Multiple birth Conifer cones Earth Girl Arjuna Incarnations of Immortality Social rule Gender Conker's Bad Fur Day Gamete Aquarium (album) Urinary incontinence Beatmania IIDX RuneScape economy Recess (TV series) Ovum Swyer syndrome Lazarus Long Melbourne High School Intersex surgery Medley swimming Good Charlotte Mojave people Infertility Romulus and Remus History of sex Sexual differentiation Happiness Tropical year Drag racing Kodocha XYY syndrome Estrus cycle Anglo-Chinese Junior College Miscarriage Johnny Weissmuller Parthenogenesis Speed of light Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Strap-on dildo Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Geri Halliwell The Suffering (game) Faster-than-light Moore's law Great Teacher Onizuka

pregnancy tests ok this may sound really stupid but i was thinking all of the pregnancy tests say that they are accurate from the day of your missed period but this is assuming you conceived around ovulation i know is the most fertile time but what if you didn't conceive until a couple of day before you period was actually due how long you after your official missed period would you expect to get a positive test sounds like it would be a trick question but not really you have to be ovulating to get pregnant which usually takes place at least a week before you are suppose to get your period so if you ovulated a couple days before you where suppose to get your period then your period wouldn't be late for at least days after you ovulated either way how do you know you ovulated  Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test In vitro fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Infertility Ovulation Estrus cycle Oral contraceptive Friends Emergency contraception Birth control Ovarian cyst Human chorionic gonadotropin Miscarriage Fertilisation Niddah Multiple birth Obstetrics Neighbours Sexual abstinence Sexual reproduction Gonorrhoea Maya calendar Ovarian cancer Abortion Ovary Hormone replacement therapy (trans) HIV test Paul Is Dead Abortion debate Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Prenatal diagnosis Marriage Conifer cones Married... with Children Debugging IBM PC compatible Knots Landing Flowering plant Philosophical skepticism Twin Big Brother UK series 6 Drug test Guinea pig Ovum Breastfeeding Adoption The nature of God in Western theology Eddie Guerrero Female reproductive system (human) Social rule Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Natural family planning Billboard Hot 100 Religion and abortion Gynecologic hemorrhage Kasparov versus The World Carpel Childbirth EastEnders Prosecutor's fallacy Time Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder George W.

im so annoyed and the test says it negative days late and went to the doctor today took a urine test which came back negative but my question is how reliable are the urine tests at the drs are they the same accuracy as hpts should i wait and go in for a blood test never been late before in my life so this is getting frustrating please help yea i am a little over anxious right now but it can be hard when you have been trying for so long and its been the first time with a glimpse of hope for me lol i will wait it out and see but some of you are just straight asses with your answers and should really think about what you are saying before you give advice the doctor's test are more effective than the test you buy at the store i know that for a fact i was three weeks late and still getting negatives on the home pregnancy test went to the doctor and it was a very faint line your only days late that is no big thing you need to wait until your at least days late before you should take a home pregnancy test with both of my kids it took weeks after my missed period before it showed up on a home pregnancy test wait another days and take another test if it's negative then wait another days and take another test if that one is negative and you still haven't started your period then go and get a blood test done i think you jumped the gun by going to the doctor so soon there are so many factors that can cause a period to be late stress is the number one cause along with change in diet or exercise just be patient and wait it out  Prostate cancer HIV test Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drug test Hypertension Stomach cancer Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy test Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Vitamin C Coeliac disease Billboard Hot 100 Shaggy dog story Abortion Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Endometriosis Cytomegalovirus Prolactinoma Miscarriage Anxiety Folic acid False negative Chronic fatigue syndrome Autism Insulin Dieting In vitro fertilisation Veganism Bayesian inference Jackass: The Movie Numerology Hypoglycemia Clinical depression Medicine Tobacco smoking Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tocopherol Triage Jeopardy!

when can i test to see if i'm pregnant my fiance and i both have strong feelings that i am pregnant my period started on the th last month so assuming that it'll fall on the same day this month is it safe to test now i know they have pregnancy test that say find out as soon as days before you're period but i read the side of the box and it says that of women tested positive days before your expected period so to me that's not very accurate and it's not days it's days i'm just soooo anxious to find out and yes we want to be preggers do you think if i am pregnant that it'll show up no matter if i test today or in days thxs in advance you can test now but it is possible to read negative since it is still early you are more likely to have an accurate reading once you miss your period but the home pregnancy tests claim that you can tell up to days before so the only thing you have to lose is the extra cost of a preg test why not if it is positive then you will know if it is negative then wait a few more days and then retest  Pregnancy HIV test Pregnancy test Miscarriage Drug test Friends Fertility awareness Coeliac disease Abortion debate Menstrual cycle Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Ovarian cancer Abortion Autism GED EastEnders Endometriosis Infertility Breastfeeding Psoriasis Prostate cancer Folic acid Melanie Wilkes History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Gonorrhoea Obstetrics Oscilloscope Ben Johnson (athlete) Turner syndrome Prolactinoma Birth control Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Oral contraceptive Taken Pregnancy fetishism Adoption Spina bifida Niddah Isotretinoin Chemical abortion Experiment One Tree Hill (TV series) Sydney Riot of 1879 2005 English cricket season Breech birth Human sexual behavior Twin Childbirth Sexual abstinence Fantastic Four M16 (rifle) Philosophical skepticism Maya calendar Dispensationalism Thalidomide History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Diabetic retinopathy Jeopardy!

another question sorry ok so if i'm not ovulating how would i or my doctor know they don't like to see you until after a year of trying before running any 'real' tests do they have a test of some sort to see if you actually ovulate i'm just a little bumbed again this month and need some assistance thanks gals pk what's a u s they make you wait a year because there are many factors involved not just ovulation but the thickness of the mucus how many sperm are being ejaculated and if the sperm go the right way there are two ovaries and about the sperm go the wrong way aka to the ovary that doesnt have the egg that month then if the sperm survive all that if they can penetrate the egg or even if there is an egg there they may be too early or too late there is a study out there i forget what book but it says women get pregnant about more times then they realize but no baby or pregnancy is suspected because the body terminates it quickly because it is too damaged in some way i had problems because my cervix is tilted it took us months to conceive plus if you smoke drink what medicines your on and the stress level all effect how a pregnancy will happen so i say relax quit smoking and have fun thats how we got pregnant  Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Infertility Miscarriage Birth control Oral contraceptive Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Sexual reproduction Ovulation Pregnancy test Childbirth Obstetrics Prostate cancer Fertilisation Female reproductive system (human) Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cancer Abortion Breastfeeding Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Human chorionic gonadotropin Health issues and the effects of cannabis Tobacco smoking Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovum Emergency contraception Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Jam (TV series) Premature birth Progesterone Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometrial cancer Sexual intercourse Tocopherol Friends Multiple birth Cancer Psoriasis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Folic acid Breech birth Sterilization (surgical procedure) Flowering plant EastEnders Oral sex Prolactinoma Orgasm Teenage pregnancy Chronic fatigue syndrome Gonorrhoea Estradiol Stroke Diabetes mellitus Days of our Lives Twin Cytomegalovirus Colorectal cancer Safe sex Multiple sclerosis Spina bifida Humphrey Bogart Gynaecology Testicle Pornographic movie Bipolar disorder Semen Knots Landing Human sexual behavior Cervix Condom Social rule Cervical cancer Schizophrenia Cystic fibrosis Prenatal diagnosis Asthma Pelvic inflammatory disease Premature ejaculation Guinea pig Edward's syndrome B-47 Stratojet Spermatozoon Hypertension Strap-on dildo Medical analysis of circumcision Niddah Acupuncture Chimera (genetics) Genital wart Episodes of Lost (Season 1)

can a doctor easily track how the fertility of a woman declines are there any models i can use the model would probably take data like when previous children were born etc the only thing i can think of would be to have her do several clomid challenge tests on cycle day blood is drawn to test fsh follicle stimulating hormone estradiol levels then clomid is taken from cycle days and blood is drawn again on cycle day to check fsh level again if the fsh levels come back abnormally high it indicates that the woman has low ovarian reserve is in perimenopause or is in menopause depending upon how high the levels are  Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Puberty Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Follicle-stimulating hormone Amenorrhoea Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral contraceptive Ovarian cyst Human chorionic gonadotropin Hormone Infertility Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Luteinizing hormone Hypoglycemia Testosterone Thyroid Estradiol Estrus cycle Endometrial cancer Fertility awareness Acne Urinary incontinence Prolactin Sleep Estrogen Ovary Atherosclerosis Sexual differentiation Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Nutrition Hormone replacement therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Chemotherapy Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Endocrinology Hypopituitarism Growth hormone deficiency Breast cancer Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Cancer Growth hormone treatment Cryptorchidism Pregnancy Baldness treatments Delayed puberty Biology and sexual orientation Growth hormone Miscarriage Orgasm Anorexia nervosa Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Colorectal cancer Traumatic brain injury Obstetrics Erythropoietin Stem cell Prolactinoma Cardiac stress test Prenatal diagnosis Extreme Programming Anabolic steroid Cardiovascular disease Medicine Intersex surgery Insulin resistance Endocrine system Lupus erythematosus Obesity Malaria Coagulation Turner syndrome Stroke Childbirth Dysmenorrhea Blood pressure Insulin Folic acid Progesterone Hypertension CPU cache Androgen Multiple sclerosis Puncture Vine Anemia Diabetes insipidus Cholesterol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cytomegalovirus Demographic transition Metabolic syndrome Cervical cancer Diabetes mellitus

what could this be im confused implantation bleeding or something else ok im ttc just started this month my last period was around july i have been having unprotected sex with my husband almost everyday well for the last week i have been feeling funny okward i was wearing white shorts a week ago of course they cant stay white and i went to the bathroom and noticed a spot on them in the crotch area it wasnt red like blood it was like a really light rusty color and no i didnt sit on anything but my underwear went colored at all like it went right threw then last mon i was in the wis dell and wore gray shorts with my swimsuit and noticed the spot again so i have been wearing paintyliners since and nothing for the past days i get a light pain in my lower back and feel like i do the day i get my period but i dont get it for like a few more days i dont know if this is enough info to get anything out of but its all i got now so any answers that might help me please let me know also fri i was lightheaded for awhile too i think its too early for preg test and i know i asked this q before i only got answers out of it so i thought i would post again with a different title i dont know if this has to do with anything but for the last like month i think i have been craving pickles and icees slushies and just recently frensh fries with ketchup on them well the spotting does sound consistent with implantation spotting since it is not bright red and is brown that indicates old blood and that's what i had when i was pregnant with my son i thought my period was starting but it never came since this was over a week ago i would take a pregnancy test as within a couple days of implantation there is enough hcg in the urine to be detected by an early pregnancy test you will also get period like cramps and such as your uterus stretches a lot of women get positive pregnancy tests at days past ovulation and it you take one and it comes up negative then just wait until your period is late and take another you might have ovulated sooner than you thought too i don't think you'd have food cravings yet but i remember being super thirsty and tired before i knew i was pregnant good luck this first month may have been the charm  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Pregnancy test Endometriosis Miscarriage Abortion Obstetrics Emergency contraception Prostate cancer EastEnders Oral contraceptive Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends Urinary incontinence Birth control Ocean's Twelve Ovarian cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Undergarment Tour de France Prenatal diagnosis Coeliac disease Big Brother UK series 6 Ovulation Endometrial cancer Social rule Diabetic retinopathy Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Breastfeeding HIV test Marilyn Monroe Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toronto Transit Commission Childbirth Psoriasis Piccolo Junior Saga Abortion debate Puberty Progesterone In vitro fertilisation Billboard Hot 100 Twin Ben Johnson (athlete) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jennifer Lopez Anal sex Rosa Parks Niddah New York Giants Blood on the Tracks The Shining (film) Polycystic ovary syndrome The Inside Drug test Capercaillie Folic acid Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Avenue Q Cytomegalovirus Knots Landing Professional wrestling slang Gynecologic hemorrhage Estrus cycle Lucille Ball Columbine High School massacre Futurama (TV series - season 5) Singlish Red Hot Chili Peppers Guinea pig Pittsburgh Steelers Katelyn Faber Sin City Horse Neighbours Sauna Pelvic inflammatory disease Satchel Paige Characters of Naruto Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dog Social aspects of clothing Sexual intercourse The Venture Bros.

when your ovulating do you have period like cramps i am suppose to ovulate today and i am so far light bleeding and cramping does this make sense yes the cramps are called mittleschmerz and the light bleeding is called ovulatory spotting ovulatory spotting occurs during ovulation when estrogen levels drop suddenly causing blood vessels in the uterus to release small amounts of blood estrogen is high right before ovulation and dips when the egg is released and then within a matter of hours progesterone starts to be secreeted in high amounts but during the couple of hours or so that the estrogen is low and progesterone is just starting to climb a little blood may be released so the spotting should occur immediately after ovulation but for some women it will take a few hours before they see the spotting on their panties or when wiping so by the time you see the spotting you have already ovulated but ewcm mixed with blood is still considered extremely fertile so it's a good time to bd however if the bleeding becomes more than spotting and lasts longer than just today then it may actually be your period coming sooner than expected probably from an anovulatory cycle  Ovulation Oral contraceptive Puberty Fertility awareness Estrus cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polycystic ovary syndrome Ectopic pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Emergency contraception Birth control Ovary Pregnancy Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy Endometrial cancer Endometrium Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovarian cyst Ovarian cancer Urinary incontinence Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Stroke Miscarriage Premenstrual stress syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Estradiol Childbirth Blood pressure Swyer syndrome Embryo transfer Testosterone Niddah First aid Uterine fibroids Sexual differentiation Diabetic retinopathy Coagulation Breast cancer Turner syndrome Jet engine Eye Dialysis Infertility Gynaecology Conifer cones Cholesterol Tsetse fly Sexual reproduction Professional wrestling slang Non-human animal sexuality Bleeding Traumatic brain injury Earthworm Hyperinflation Estrogen Twin HIV test Amenorrhoea Pregnancy test Fertilisation Anabolic steroid Cancer Cramp Prolactin Professional wrestling match types Intracranial pressure Stomach cancer Delayed puberty Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Decompression sickness Hemorrhagic stroke Spider Carbon dioxide Carburetor Von Willebrand disease Progesterone only pill Abortion Tide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cup Rocky Mountain spotted fever Ovum Hyperprolactinaemia Breastfeeding Flowering plant Osteoporosis Dead zone Vaginal bleeding Intravenous therapy Tocopherol Massage Gonadotropin-releasing hormone

do most insurances cover sperm analysis i was wondering do most insurances cover sperm analysis some insurance companies are great and cover all infertility workups and treatments others do not the only way to know is to contact your insurance carrier and request in writing their policy on infertility coverage it's good to get it in writing or the name and employee number of who you spoke with so there are less problems when going for treatments some fertility specialists require upfront payments and like to reimburse the patient so they can make sure they are paid fertility treatments can be extremely costly so if you have all your insurance terms in writing it makes it more difficult for the specialist to demand an upfront payment from you what you could do to have a sperm analysis is have your partner go to a urologist they can perform a sperm analysis and send the results to your dr or give you a copy to keep when the urologist submits the bill to insurance it may be covered since it is not from an infertility specialist hope this helps lots of luck baby dust  Infertility Insurance Publicly funded medicine In vitro fertilisation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Life insurance Medicine Medicare (Canada) Legal aspects of transsexualism Annuity Adoption Health care in the United States Primerica Financial Services Mortgage Workers' compensation Unemployment HIPAA Health maintenance organization Contract Lloyd's of London Transsexuality Microeconomics National Health Service Canadian and American health care systems compared Medical malpractice Fertility awareness Human cloning Student loan Risk management Copyright Pharmaceutical company Unemployment benefit Sexual intercourse Liability insurance CPU cache Social Security (United States) Endometriosis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cystic fibrosis National Insurance Abortion debate Social Security debate (United States) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Phimosis Testicular cancer Medicare (Australia) Vicente Fox Terri Schiavo Managed care US health reform under FDR Prolactinoma Advance fee fraud Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Medicare (United States) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Title insurance Cryptorchidism Home insurance Varicocele Compensation of employees Pelvic inflammatory disease Money Medicaid Canada Health Act Government debt Economy of the United States Genetic disorder Multiple birth Mutual fund Wal-Mart Radiation therapy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Social security Obesity Payroll X chromosome Medical analysis of circumcision Great Depression Product Lifecycle Management Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Stem cell Adverse selection Bank Credit card National Kidney Foundation Singapore Polycystic ovary syndrome Bond Shoppers Drug Mart Artificial insemination Health savings account Xerox Surety bond US health reform 1912-1920 Menstrual cycle Term life insurance Randomized controlled trial

trying to conceive but am unsure if i'm ovulating help my husband and i have two girls that were both unplanned it seemed so easy to get pregnant with them we now have decided to have another i've done hrs of research online i realize now how difficult it is my cycles range from to days i remember i used to have stretchy egg white discharge but i haven't seen that in a long time i still have a period every month though does this mean i'm not ovulating start charting on fertilityfriend com you can enter your body temp your mucus readings your results from opk's ovulation tests that is the only way i could really know and in my opinion was the only way i conceived last month after months of ttc take your bbt every morning before you get out of bed at the same time every morning start taking ov tests from days through you can get tests at dollar tree or you can get a day pack at most pharmacies for about don't do ovulation tests using first morning urine wait til later in the morning or in the afternoon just take them at the same time of day every day a test line that is the same or darker color than the control line is a positive anything fainter than this is a negative it detects the lh surge and a positive result means that you should ovulate within hours from taking the tests this is why you really need to take them every day for a while if your cycles are messed up some women get positives but the egg never pops out but they help with fertility awareness the next step is getting your progesterone p tested days after you ovulate blood test talk to your obgyn about this p levels indicate whether an egg actually came out this month because after you ovulate the empty space on the ovary starts to emit progesterone this doesn't happen if the egg never leaves the ovary enter the data on the website it'll generate a nice chart for you and will also tell you when your most fertile time is and also when you most likely ovulated i swear by that site and have only been using it for a few months  Fertility awareness Ovulation Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy Puberty In vitro fertilisation Progesterone Human chorionic gonadotropin Emergency contraception Pregnancy test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Flowering plant Infertility Niddah Apollo 8 Obstetrics Birth control Ovarian cyst Endometriosis Urinary incontinence Drug test Stomach cancer Fruit Ovarian cancer Tide Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease Shaggy dog story Social rule Friends STS-62 Prostate cancer Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breastfeeding HIV test Breast cancer CPU cache Coeliac disease Ocean's Twelve Ovum Mountain Gorilla Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ben Johnson (athlete) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency The Lovely Bones Swyer syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Compiler optimization Flower God Emperor of Dune CPU design Housebreaking Ginkgo Nuclear fallout Cytomegalovirus Sexual abstinence Conifer cones Theory of conduct Sexual reproduction Blood on the Tracks Kodocha Female reproductive system (human) Time Out of Mind Surveillance Jet engine Expert system Endometrium Menstrual cup Pachypodium baronii Rabbit Debugging Jean Grey Gynaecology Vitamin C Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carbon dioxide RISC Calvin and Hobbes Guinea pig Bipolar disorder Platypus Collision detection Pachypodium brevicaule Technetium STS-59 UK Singles Chart Gonorrhoea Lightning Miss Saigon Egg (biology) Carpel Spacecraft propulsion

isthe pull out method a useful method how manyof you have used the pull out method and became pregnant as the father of i'd have to say that the pull out method is perhaps the worst method of them all keep in mind that during intercourse semen seeps out long before ejaculation and sometimes it's enough to impregnate your partner my first son was unintentionally conceived using the pull out method so to answer your question my wife and i have become pregnant via that method at least once i do know that some religions frown upon birth control if that's the case here i guess to pull out is better than nothing at all during the times that we weren't trying to conceive we used various methods of birth control all effective for us i myself like most men hate condoms so we used different types of spermicidal jellies the today sponge and even contraceptive films we opted not to use the pill implants or injections because we knew that we would want to conceive again and again and again and i hope this helps  Birth control Condom Sexual intercourse Safe sex Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Masturbation Sexual abstinence Menstrual cycle Oral sex History of sex Pregnancy Diaphragm (contraceptive) Marriage Fertilisation Abortion Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Infertility Sterilization (surgical procedure) Intrauterine device Sex education Penis enlargement Prostate cancer Personal lubricant Religion and abortion Incest Abortion debate Knots Landing Anal sex Premature ejaculation Endometriosis In vitro fertilisation Sex toy Pornographic movie Depo Provera EastEnders Cervical cap Katelyn Faber Heracles Acne Strap-on dildo Teenage pregnancy Ejaculation Artificial insemination Hera Urinary incontinence Friends Mandrake (plant) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cum shot Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ontological argument Medical analysis of circumcision Nonoxynol-9 Mary, the mother of Jesus Psoriasis Fuel injection Guiding Light AIDS pandemic Kurt Cobain Days of our Lives Humanae Vitae Religion and sexuality Father Orgasm Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Apollo Human sexual behavior Password Sexual revolution Borg Soul Incest taboo Semen Witch trial AIDS Human Gonorrhoea Farscape Peter Griffin Guinea pig Erection Simone Weil Taken Scientology beliefs and practices Human penis size Sola fide Western philosophy Lawrence v.

monthly cycle ok you might think im being really dumb but im kinda confused me and my hubby are trying to get pregnant and im trying to work out when i will be ovulating im just abit confused about the definition of the cycle is it the time between your periods or is it including your period coz i've been told both i know when the best time to try is i want to now when my cycle starts is it at the beginning of my period or the first day after my period has ended i've been told both first i want to say congratulations on starting a family we just had our first baby a son in march and couldn't be happier remember it's not dumb to ask questions and get answers it's dumb not to especially when it comes to parenthood start taking those prenatal vitamins if you haven't already and you can see your doctor for a pre conception checkup your doctor will provide you with a lot of helpful advice and materials to assist you and answer any questions you may have most women are on a day cycle so that they will ovulate around days from the start of the last period there are online calculators you can use to help you determine the day you'll ovulate do a search on ovulation calculator start keeping list of the dates your period starts so you can find out how long your cycle is once you figure out when you'll be ovulating you can start trying around day or so after your period as the sperm can survive a couple of days and be waiting for the egg to be released we got pregnant during the fourth month of trying beginning on day good luck god bless and have fun trying  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Oral contraceptive Ovulation Niddah Maya calendar Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roe v.

i had two healthy pregnancies and now m c could taking birth control have ruined my hormone balance after my second uneventful pregnancy i was almost years old and felt i was done with having babies i went on two different birth control pills in an eight month timeframe one was ortho trycyclen one was a progestin one one caused my migraines to worsen the other i wouldn't stop bleeding so off i went and got pregnant within two months i m c at weeks the heart had stopped my hormones were out of whack all through it nightsweats hot chills weird stuff my dr said probably chromosome problem seven months later i was pregnant again m c at eight weeks bleeding started after intercourse that was two years ago two months ago i finally got pregnant again but spotted and then stopped and then m c at weeks bleeding started the day after intercourse my period seems to always follow sex too when i am late i joke with dh that we need to get busy to get rid of my pms now i am in my late 's and am trying again anyone else had m c after birth control pills sorry for your losses i have also had m c's and still birth at weeks that was a cord knot i was not on birth control at any point with the loses but i know with my m c's all i had problems with my hormone levels it seems that hormones levels being wacky is responsible for the loses in both of our cases i'm sure your hormone levels being off could have come from the pill thing while mine was due to pcos either way they are both hormonal related what helped me was using clomid it works opposite of birth controll it tells the body that progesterone and estrogen are low and your body in turn makes a ton of both hormones it also makes your eggs really mature and you get a lot of eggs when you ovulate so your chances are increased dramatically clomid works for women who have simple infertility issues i got preg the st i ever used it i'm weeks now with a healthy baby and things are going perfectly it maybe worth a try to ask about it it's a pill so insurance covers it except the co pay and many women have success using it hormonal issues almost always have to be treated with medication of some sort hope you have better luck next time  Fertility awareness Endometriosis Progesterone Birth control In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Obstetrics Emergency contraception Breastfeeding Abortion debate Puberty Turner syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Depo Provera Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy Ovulation Acne Twin Hormone Cancer Childbirth Chronic fatigue syndrome Homosexuality and transgender Abortion Prostate cancer Testosterone Psoriasis Migraine Prolactinoma Tocopherol Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Growth hormone treatment Intersexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transsexuality Estrus cycle Transgender Premature birth Spina bifida Anabolic steroid Sexual intercourse Gonorrhoea Legal aspects of transsexualism Sex assignment Knots Landing Ovary Ovarian cancer Ovarian cyst Neighbours Cryptorchidism Morning sickness Sexual abstinence Teenage pregnancy Oral sex Diabetes mellitus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Stroke Radiation therapy Anemia Sex education Sexual differentiation Baldness treatments Breech birth Growth hormone deficiency Nutrition Baldness Stomach cancer History of sex Androgen Obesity Postpartum depression Chemotherapy Human sexual behavior Breast Amenorrhoea Osteoporosis Sexual dysfunction Multiple sclerosis Delayed puberty History of intersex surgery Hypoglycemia Clinical depression Guinea pig Prenatal diagnosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insulin

clomid i am thinking about taking clomid because i am not ovulating and have been ttc for months my ob said she would prescribe it to me do you think i should see an infertility doctor first or take clomid from my ob thanks many fertility doctors are ob's clomid is actually commonly prescribed to encourage ovulation i took clomid myself but it was unsuccessful for me i had other hormone issues that made the clomid ineffective however i have talked to many other women who have had success with it go ahead and take it from your ob otherwise if you go to a specialist some insurances may not cover the medication or procedures regarding fertility generally you need to have a referal that is pre approved by your insurance good luck  Infertility In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transsexuality Emergency contraception Medicine Ovarian cyst Ovarian cancer Puberty Legal aspects of transsexualism Progesterone Obesity Childbirth Health insurance Gynaecology Medical prescription Endometriosis Bipolar disorder Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Terri Schiavo Oral contraceptive Osteopathy Pharmaceutical company Homeopathy Growth hormone treatment Urinary incontinence Psychiatry Stomach cancer Baldness treatments Androgen insensitivity syndrome Natural family planning Transgender Breastfeeding Estrus cycle Prolactinoma Alternative medicine Female genital cutting Abortion Physician Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Nurse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Medicare (Canada) General practitioner Sexual abstinence Stem cell Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Testosterone Ovary Dieting Gregory Goodwin Pincus Traditional Chinese medicine Fasting Turner syndrome National Health Service Publicly funded medicine Cryptorchidism Miscarriage Abortion in Canada Canadian and American health care systems compared Psoriasis Estradiol Paget's disease of bone Hormone Birth control Multiple birth Breast Gonorrhoea Conifer cones Acne Chemical abortion Medicare (United States) Juris Doctor Amiodarone Adjustable gastric band Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Clinical depression Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Epilepsy Tocopherol Intact dilation and extraction Growth hormone deficiency British monarchy Health care in the United States Religion and abortion Prescription drug Testicle Flowering plant Friends Adoption HIPAA

what do you think my cycle has only changed twice in my yrs i'm now ttc i had a miscarriage in jan at weeks and recieved a d c cycle was still normal up until june now i come on from the th th and come back on at the end of the month around the th th went to the doctors he did'nt do any labs he said lets just keep and eye on it what do you think it is and which cycle do i use to chart ovulation the from the begining of the month or the one at the end yes unfortunately sometimes when you try to conceive the stress can screw with your cycles a little bit i agree with your doctor that it's not necessarily anything to worry about yet a lot of women have some fluctuations in their cycles if you have had lots of stress traveling illness better or worse nutrition or more or less exercise than usual are all things that can throw off your cycle as far as which type of cycle to use as far as trying to determine ovulation you could either just start on day or so and have sex every day through day or you could try to learn how to chart your cycles so that you can see when ovulation happens you can do this by monitoring your cervical mucus and taking your basal body temperature every morning there are a lot of good resources out there for helping you learn www fertilityfriend com is a good one or you can download a free manual from www nfpandmore org a good resource from your bookstore is taking charge of your fertility by toni weschler basically you want to check your cervical mucus when you go to the bathroom by wiping and examining the tissue when you see your mucus start to be clear slippery stretchy and resembles egg white then you need to start having sex every other day when the mucus dries up then you are probably past ovulation hope that helps good luck  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Infertility Birth control Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Mucus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Bipolar disorder Oral contraceptive Childbirth Urinary incontinence Nutrition Emergency contraception Cancer Puberty Cystic fibrosis Obstetrics Niddah Breastfeeding Medicine Psoriasis Herpes simplex virus Common cold Autism Asthma Theory of conduct Coeliac disease Progesterone Infantilism Tsetse fly StarCraft: Uprising Hypoglycemia Social rule Sexual abstinence Insomnia Blood pressure Weight training Astrology Estrus cycle Fancy rat Extreme Programming Carpel Human papillomavirus Chronic fatigue syndrome Microeconomics Cat Cervical cancer Tocopherol Physical therapy Carbon dioxide STS-62 Avenue Q Time Sin City Folic acid Anorexia nervosa Radiation therapy Phoebe Halliwell Friends Gonorrhoea Fecal incontinence Red Hot Chili Peppers Fruit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sauna First aid Triage Literacy Dead Like Me Legal research Swingout Abortion Thermal power station Premenstrual stress syndrome Autonomic nervous system Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Stroke 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cervix Scientology beliefs and practices The Five Doctors Sexual reproduction Endometriosis Clinical depression Milton H.

will the baby be ok intoxicated while conceiving my husband and i were very intoxicated and i beleive we conceived a baby condomn broke and i am ovulating i am so worried because of the amount of alcohol in both of our systems that the baby will not survive or will survive but have some dissabilities no way don't worry your baby will be fine bear in mind that it would probably take at least hours for conception to take place after sex and a further to days for the fertilised egg to begin to interact with your body fully i e connect to your blood supply so the alcohol was most likely out of your system even before the egg became fertilised many doctors will even say it is ok to have the occasional very small amount of alcohol during pregnancy it is more importnat that you look after yourself now take your pregnancy vitamins and stay healthy  Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cycle Multiple birth Twin Breastfeeding Miscarriage Childbirth Emergency contraception Folic acid Fertility awareness Fertilisation Oral contraceptive Sexual reproduction Ovum Hypoglycemia Egg (food) Ovulation Amniotic sac Edward's syndrome Infertility Addiction Premature birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual abstinence Anemia Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Decompression sickness Abortion debate Puberty Psoriasis Health insurance Buddhism Birth weight Coeliac disease Vitamin C Female reproductive system (human) Stomach cancer Health issues and the effects of cannabis EastEnders Vegetarianism Alcoholic beverage Veganism History of sex Drug test Blood alcohol content Cirrhosis Niddah Cephalic disorder Drunkenness Sex Caffeine Vitamin Knots Landing Jam (TV series) Ovary Infantilism Cholesterol Hyperthermia Birth control Teenage pregnancy Sea-Monkey Fuel injection Spina bifida Blood pressure Social rule Human chorionic gonadotropin Fetal development Conifer cones Coronary heart disease Psychosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Guinea pig Cytomegalovirus Prostate cancer Omega-3 fatty acid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Human cloning Gonorrhoea Capercaillie Driving under the influence Sex education Moss Doxepin Baby Blues Healthy eating Coffee 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Caesarean section Rape Halaal Breech birth Anencephaly Polycystic ovary syndrome Clinical depression Scientology beliefs and practices Hangover Paracetamol Ethanol

my pregnancy test showed a very faint line like an evaporation line but a couple of hours later it darkened considerably and is now decidedly looking like a bfp and is coloured blue like the test line is this wishful thinking or could it be for real i can't wait til tomorrow to try again i just wanna know now i am dpo ttc for months it was there but so so faint in the minutes when i took it it just got darker over a couple of hours i guess i'll have to wait until the morning thanks for your fast answers dpo days post ovulation my period is due in days hence why it would be faint if it is positive i'm so excited only trust a test that is taken and looked at when you have aloud the right amount of time to pass after that the lines can get affected by the air and crap in it if you had a line when you took the test and that line indicates pregnancy then i would assume you are pregnant hopefully a congrats is in order  Pregnancy Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy test Apollo 8 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gamma ray burst Obstetrics Solar eclipse Childbirth Birth control GED Family Feud Toronto Subway and RT Jeopardy!

irregular periods pregnancy i have had irregular periods since i went off the pill in after being on it for over years only ovulating every months until this may and june when i ovulated each month my partner and i have had unprotected sex in hope of falling pregnant but i am concerned about the irregularity of my periods that this may not occur i am currently overweight and i am not sure whether this may be the cause can anyone offer some advice and some information about whether i can fall pregnant or not thank you for your time being overweight is not a concern unless it is a symptom of pcos pcos has many symptoms one of them being overweight and pcos does cause fertility problems however if you don't have pcos you can do internet research on it then your weight is not an issue it looks like being on the pill for so long has caused your cycles to be irregular unless of course you were irregular before you went on the pill in which case you are returning to what's normal for you i think the fact that you ovulated two months in a row is a good sign as long as you're ovulating you have a chance of getting pregnant i would continue to monitor your cycles for a few more and see if you continue to ovulate if may and june prove to be a fluke you may want to go in and talk to your doctor about taking something to stimulate ovulation every month good luck  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Birth control Puberty Infertility Ovarian cyst Psoriasis Breastfeeding Folic acid Malaria Obesity Ovarian cancer Prolactinoma Endometriosis Estrus cycle Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep apnea Progesterone Prostate cancer Abortion debate Miscarriage Guinea pig Nutrition Bipolar disorder Sexual abstinence Stomach cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Abortion Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Spina bifida Ectopic pregnancy Clinical depression Turner syndrome Neighbours Tocopherol Twin Fertilisation Apollo 8 Caffeine Endometrial cancer Tobacco smoking Stroke Hypertension Sexual intercourse Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sex education Conifer cones Knots Landing Sleep Human chorionic gonadotropin Duchenne muscular dystrophy AIDS Medicine Gregory Goodwin Pincus Herpes simplex virus Autism Premature birth Childbirth Cephalic disorder Teenage pregnancy Gonorrhoea Health issues and the effects of cannabis Premenstrual stress syndrome Baldness treatments Myocardial infarction Diabetes mellitus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Flowering plant Acne Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Alanis Morissette Cytomegalovirus Infantilism Human penis size Huntington's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anorexia nervosa Cardiac arrhythmia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Heartworm Paroxetine Amphetamine Hyperprolactinaemia Oral sex Religion and abortion Hypoglycemia Big Brother UK series 6

antihistamines me and my bf are ttc i am due any day now but having had some minor symptoms then there is a chance i could be pregnant this morning i took an antihistamine without having a second thought if i am pregnant could this be harmful to baby thanks in advance due my period any day now are antihistamines safe to take during pregnancy according to maternal fetal toxicology by koren most of the antihistamine compounds available over the counter have not been implicated in fetal or pregnancy problems a large study of exposure in pregnancy showed that only with diphenhydramine benadryl was there a significant association with fetal defect this medication was thought to cause an increased incidence of cleft lip and palate but recent studies have not been able to prove this the use of antihistamines in the first trimester does not appear to increase the risk for major birth defects as always it is important to discuss the use of any medication over the counter or prescription with your care provider  Pregnancy Cephalic disorder Miscarriage Abortion debate Folic acid Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder Breastfeeding Congenital disorder Abortion Antihistamine Psoriasis Spina bifida Herpes simplex virus Abortion in the United States Turner syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tobacco smoking Hay fever Schizophrenia Cancer Fetus Premature birth Prenatal diagnosis Roe v.

doctor who you know is very familiar with maca and could give me an educated opinion about taking maca during pregnancy i really hope to talk to someone soon maca magic answer we cannot recomend maca while you are pregnant while maca is non toxic even at high doses it does stimulate graffian folicals stimulates fertility and it would be unwise for us to try and answer your question because there seem to be no studies that indicate it's safety during pregnancy we simply do not know there have been studies with animals however which indicate maca increases birth weights and the size of litters maca is also frequently used by woman after giving birth or to become pregnant perhaps peruvian woman in the andes would be better able to answer this question as they have been using maca for several hundred years so far in the usa there have been no studies that we know of that can help answer your questions maca question i'm pregnant and would like to find out if taking the multivitamins prescribed by my md and the maca would have any negative effects on me or my baby maca magic answer we do not recommend maca during pregnancy the implications are unknown and have not been studied however it is commonly used in peru during preganacy and has a long history for increasing birth weights of animals even though another site says this ive linked both sites below there are a lot of ways to use maca root for better health one way that is often overlooked is its effects our body during pregnancy is maca root safe to use while pregnant maca root can be consumed safely throughout your whole pregnancy maca root is actually not technically an herb it is a whole food it is actually part of a daily diet consumed by the people of peru it works very well to balance hormones and keep progesterone levels high while you are pregnant this can be especially beneficial during the first trimester there are no hormones in the maca itself so there is no need to worry about over doing it in anyway it works by stimulating and healing the pituitary gland so that it can function at a higher efficiency there is no way to overdose on maca root there is no toxicity from it worrying about overdosing on maca is the same as worrying about overdosing on potatoes it is a food not a drug maca root supports a healthy pregnancy there are vast amounts of nutrients found in maca root it can almost be a pre natal vitamin in itself due to the large amounts of vitamins minerals and amino acids contained within maca root helps to ensure that your unborn baby is getting the nutrients that he or she needs choosing the right maca root there are a lot of different brands of maca root out there i have successfully only used one kind of maca root throughout two of my pregnancies this is because the extracts and gelatinized versions do not contain the whole food therefore they will not provide the same benefits i highly recommend navitas naturals organic raw maca powder it is a reputable product from a great company navitas maca root comes directly from the farmers who cultivate them and are free of heavy metals chemicals and pesticides i have found the best prices on navitas maca root to be from amazon you can go straight to it by clicking here how to eat maca root maca root tastes like it sounds like a root the taste can easily be compared to that of a potato but slightly more bitter if you try and eat it plain you will spit it out fairly quickly this is why it is best to disguise the taste in food personally i put two tablespoons of maca root in my morning smoothies it tastes great when mixed up with bananas and fruit it is best to take about two tablespoons daily but you can do more or less depending on your individual needs i would recommend speaking to your doctor about this he she would know more than i do as you can see from above both sites say something differently i wish you well good luck  Menstrual cycle Organic farming Chocolate Oral

could i be pregnant after miscarriages in the last year my husband and i are ttc my period was due today and i took a hpt this morning and it came back neg i have a day cycle and according to an online ovulation calculator i should have ovulated july we tried on july what are the chances that i just tested too early and my hcg is not strong enough yet how long should i wait to retest if i don't get my period for those of you who are also ttc especially after miscarrying you'll understand how the wait is just awful and the temptation to keep on taking hpt's is so strong i haven't said anything to my husband that i was due for my period today because i feel so bad to get his hopes up and then get my period any advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated thanks ovulation occurs days before you next period is due so if you have a day cycle you will ovulate on day give or take a day either way if you have had miscarriages get a got vitamin like centrum and break it in have before taking it then get wheat germ oil in capsules the wheat germ oil has trace minerals and vitamin e in it that helps the integrity of your blood vessels get some sub lingual vitamin b they do have a brand called b total sub lingual that is good it will help you with morning sickness they used wheat germ oil for a long time for infertility but have dropped it by the wayside because now they have infertility drugs you need to try to eat a healthy diet and not junk food wait until you are absolutely sure that you are pregnant do get the vitamins and wheat germ oil capsles take these and it will help you it is what i recommended in the hospital to those who had miscarriages i would usually see them again in a year to have a baby when my son in his mid 's married his wife in her mid 's she had been married before and never used birth control and never had gotten pregnant she complained of being tired all the time so i brought her the above mentioned vitamins she was good about taking them with in a year they had a baby i still smile about that if you start spotting and think you are pregnant go to your ob dr because you made need progesterone for a while to keep you from miscarrying normally the ovary produces it during implantation to help with implantation if the ovary does not produce the hormone then the implantation will not take  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Tocopherol Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cancer Miscarriage Prostate cancer Puberty Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovulation Stomach cancer Ovary Pregnancy test Coeliac disease Infertility Folic acid Birth control Emergency contraception Morning sickness Vitamin C Breastfeeding Endometriosis Cryptorchidism Vitamin Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Veganism Acne Vitamin D Fruit Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Twin Psoriasis Egg (food) Friends Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Estrus cycle Sexual reproduction Anemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cancer Bodybuilding Milk Knots Landing Vegetarian nutrition Anne Boleyn Antioxidant Hypoglycemia Neighbours Fecal incontinence Coronary heart disease Kodocha Paget's disease of bone Guinea pig Anorexia nervosa Omega-3 fatty acid Oily fish Elephant Bipolar disorder Dieting Obesity Diarrhea Food Gynaecology Abortion Tooth Infantilism HIV test Baldness treatments Flowering plant Common cold Premature birth Clinical depression Cyanocobalamin Tlingit Dietary supplement Cytomegalovirus Endocrine system Food guide pyramid Ectopic pregnancy Scar Pelvic inflammatory disease Flour Potato Endocrinology

is there any special way to have twins by eating medication naturally etc any tips there aren't any twins in the family though unfortunately there is no known way to force a twin reproduction with medication or diet it really is all natural ultimately ti comes down to genetics if everybody in your family has had twins you are more likely to have them identical twins are conceived when the fertilized egg splits into two separate yet identical entities which each grow on their own and fraternal twins happen when the mother drops two eggs and both are fertilized at the same time by different sperm hence them looking similar as opposed to identical i hope this helps best of luck to you  Twin Multiple birth Human cloning Meiosis Sexual reproduction In vitro fertilisation Infertility Pregnancy Fertility awareness Parthenogenesis Abortion debate Nature versus nurture Cloning Menstrual cycle Biology and sexual orientation Intersexuality Puberty Homosexuality and medical science Birth control Fertilisation Species Ovum Leatherback Sea Turtle Goldfish Flowering plant Shark Sri Aurobindo Genetic disorder Emergency contraception Beetle Human Egg (biology) Gamete Androgen insensitivity syndrome Alternation of generations Stem cell Spider Snake Medicine Cell growth Adoption Human nature Coeliac disease Animal Prostate cancer Hamster Sex DNA Mitosis Elephant Nile crocodile Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Miscarriage Grasshopper Bird Octopus Menopause Aphid Intelligence quotient Male reproductive system (human) Ovary Multiple sclerosis Earthworm Dog Kakapo Conifer cones Polycystic ovary syndrome Spermatozoon American lobster Heritability Twin study Crohn's disease Autism epidemic Chimera (genetics) Xenomorph Ayurveda Semen Old wives' tale Pioneer Fund Conjoined twins Biodiversity Guinea pig Mitochondrial DNA Cystic fibrosis Giant Panda Pinophyta Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cellular differentiation Cephalic disorder Meme Ovulation Organic farming Frog Maya mythology Bee Digit ratio Twin cities Endometriosis Origin belief

ttc question my husband and i are finally ready to start ttc we really want a summer baby because i am a teacher and i would love to have the whole summer home without having to pay a sub for my room for the whole maternity leave basically that means we need to conceive in either aug or sept we couldn't start earlier because of a transfer of medical insurance or it would be considered a preexisting condition and insurance would not cover baby my question is when you first started trying how long did it take i know that you can't plan things like this so exact but i am just curious basically if we do not conceive in aug or sept then we will stop and wait until next july and start again we will be less picky at that time and continue until we succeed the reason we are on such a time crunch this year is bc i am starting a new job in a new school district i will not have enough sick leave to cover my maternity leave after i run out of sick days i would basically be responsible for paying for my own sub for the remainder of the maternity leave my friend last year had to lose a month from her paycheck to cover that expense i would like to not have to do that until i have built up enough sick leave to atleast cover half of my maternity leave thanks alot of people are questioning why i would have to pay for a sub it would be the same no matter what pregnant or not if i miss more than days of work weeks i am docked pay to cover the cost the district incurs to cover my leave the district has to pay dollars a day to have someone in my room over an entire maternity leave that adds up fast so that is why we are wanting to try and do this right the first time and like i said i know it isn't always that easy but we want to try it this time and if not we will start all over next year by then i will have about weeks worth of sick time saved up assuming i don't have to use those sick days earlier i havent read the other answers yet they look too long haha but when we ttc in april we got lucky on the first try literally unfortunately it ended in m c at weeks but there is hope you can conceive that fast it all works with your ovulation it may be too late this month but next month you could track it there are things like basil body temperature charting your cervical mucus and using the site fertilityfriend com twoweekwait com is an excellent site if you have questions as an overview ovulation occurs usually days after the start of your period this is your prime time for baby making if you track your body temps first thing in the morning it can help you see when your are ovulating cervical mucus is also a great way to check so there are many resources to help you keep up with it to make it happen quicker as far as the work thing i'd think there would be legal obligations for them to cover your maternity leave but anything longer than that they'd have you cover so consult someone on that if you can legally they cant do that best of luck trying to conceive i wish you lots and lots of baby dust  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Toronto Subway and RT Infertility Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule EastEnders Childbirth Microeconomics Ovulation Sharon Tate $ale of the Century Breastfeeding Daylight saving time Education in Germany Social Security (United States) Shaggy dog story GED Toronto Transit Commission Atlas Comics (1950s) Ravi Shastri Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Publicly funded medicine Friends She Loves You USS Taylor (DD-468) CPU design FairTax Scarborough RT (TTC) Abortion in the United States Charmed Unemployment Blackjack Miscarriage Abortion One Tree Hill (TV series) Ben Johnson (athlete) Theory of conduct The Joker's Wild Ra (board game) Plame affair Spice Girls Fasting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wheel of Fortune Divorce The Temptations Jon Secada Contract Oasis (band) National Kidney Foundation Singapore Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Hall & Oates United Kingdom corporation tax Legal aspects of transsexualism Ocean's Twelve CPU cache Floppy disk Slow Train Coming Stomach cancer Jennifer Lopez Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Roman calendar USS Wallace L.

law is pregnant and that is all her family talks about and i am sooo jealous i have become familiar with some of your names on here and just curious what yall are going through right now any signs of pregnancy popping up in my fellow ttc'ers do you think yall will be pregnant how long have yall been trying anything you are doing different that you think might have helped share some silly tww things you do well this is our second month trying to conceive we were so disapointed last month but i was still smoking not a lot like one day but i am convinced that that had something to with it i haven't had a cigarette in over a month and i am so proud of myself i am not having alot of symptoms mainly just tiredness i took a two hour nap today because i just could not keep my eyes open please share gl all o yea i like to stick a towel under my shirt i play like i have a belly haha all in good fun my fiance thinks i'm crazy i am not infertile that i know of yet i am and he is so that is not the problem and i never said we had a problem this is our second month trying just like to hear what other people are going through thanks some myths and truths to help you through all this good luck myth infertility is a female problem fact women and men bear nearly equal responsibility when it comes to infertility infertility is a female problem in of cases a male problem in of cases and a combined problem of the couple or unexplained in of cases that is why we stress that it is important for both members of the couple to undergo medical evaluation and as necessary treatment myth everyone else gets pregnant easily fact a normally fertile couple has only about a chance of conceiving each month more than million people of childbearing age in the u s experience infertility every year and million seek treatment myth relax and you'll get pregnant fact infertility is a disease of the reproductive system although stress can sometimes affect hormone levels and ovulation emotions are not keeping you from getting pregnant the stress and intense emotions you feel are the result of infertility not usually its cause myth be patient you'll get pregnant with time fact infertility is a medical problem that usually requires treatment at least of those who complete an infertility evaluation will respond to treatment with a successful pregnancy those who do not seek help have a spontaneous cure rate of only about which means couples have a times greater chance of conceiving if they get medical help for their infertility problem if you are concerned for any reason about your ability to conceive make an appointment with a medical doctor for an evaluation as soon as possible especially if you as a woman are over the age of have irregular cycles experience painful menstrual periods have suffered several pregnancy losses have used an intrauterine device iud have had a pelvic infection or abdominal surgery if you are a man or a woman and have had exposure through your mother's pregnancy to the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol des or if you are a man and have had a testicular injury or frequent genitourinary infections see a doctor for evaluation myth just adopt a baby and you'll get pregnant fact unfortunately this persistent myth is one of the most painful for individuals and couples to hear because it suggests that adoption is a treatment for infertility not the happy resolution to infertility that it is for millions of families every year more important this statement simply is not true studies reveal that pregnancy rates for couples after adopting are the same as those for couples who do not adopt myth you're probably doing it wrong fact infertility is a medical condition not a sexual disorder on the other hand the timing of sexual intercourse is crucial to the conception process myth your partner will leave you because of your infertility fact the rewards of an intimate relationship require hard work and diligent effort every day from both partners regardless of the difficult challenges posed by infertility without doubt infertility represents a major life crisis one that certainly affects a marriage or partnership fortunately most couples survive the infertility crisis and learn new ways of relating to each other that deepen their relationship you may hit a few rough patches along the way but as long as you keep the lines of communication open there is a good chance you will grow closer through the experience myth maybe you are just not meant to be a parent fact you and your partner have made the decision to become parents because you know how much love and support you have to offer a child having a medical condition that makes it difficult to conceive and bear a child is not a sign from god from the universe from society or for that matter from anywhere else about your suitability to raise children or whether it is meant for you to become a parent myth my life will be overwhelmed with infertility and nothing will ever be the same fact infertility is a life crisis and it will probably have an effect on all areas of your life at one time or another it is perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed with surges of guilt anxiety and sadness at the same time the desire to have a child may fill you with single minded determination at the expense of other areas of your life including your most personal relationships long held notions about who you are and how you envision your life may be tested but you will eventually move through this crisis because resolving infertility is a process that may require you to let go of your initial vision of bearing a biological child it is important to recognize that feelings of loss and grief are common although the emotions and issues surrounding infertility may surface throughout your life in predictable and unpredictable times and ways at menopause for example the intense struggle you are facing now will resolve itself as you work through each decision in the infertility process and move along your unique life path  Emergency contraception Charles Darwin's illness Goodness and value theory Hypertension Homosexuality and transgender

ok another question please read and answer how common is having a tinee tiny amount of blood when you ovulate is it very common and if so right around the time you ovulate if you had this and had fertile cm and a little cramping should one assume that they ovulated we did do the baby dance just in case thank you it really depends on the person as to when ovulation bleeding will occur i think i have only experienced it like xs n my life while on the other hand my bestfriend cs it all the x the funny part about it is that i only saw the ovulation bleeding when i was ttc i think that is because i was paying more attention to what was going on with my body u know the funny thing about ovulation bleeding is that no one is actually sure when it happens some think that the bleeding spotting occurs from the egg ripening n bursting out n some think that its from just the egg ripening itself who knows i do know that is u experience mid cycle spotting with cervical mucus it is an excellent sign of ovulation about to occur or just occuring either way if u did the deed u r right on schedule so good luck n lot n lots of baby dust u  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Ovulation Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Puberty Estrus cycle Pregnancy Stomach cancer Childbirth Emergency contraception Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Bleeding Infertility Progesterone In vitro fertilisation Ovum Fruit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cyst Ectopic pregnancy Soul Gonorrhoea Stroke Abortion Ovarian cancer Coeliac disease Twin Abortion debate Cervix Urinary incontinence Rocky Mountain spotted fever First aid Cancer Endometrial cancer Ovary Traumatic brain injury Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Flower Endometriosis EastEnders Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supply and demand Human chorionic gonadotropin Conifer cones Carpel Nuclear fallout Social rule Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Species Tsetse fly Fertilisation Infantilism Luck Diabetic retinopathy Multiple birth Theodicy Chiropractic Karma Premature birth Samuel Goldwyn Endometrium Tourniquet Estradiol Stopping power Extreme Programming Reincarnation Hemorrhagic stroke Human papillomavirus Subdural hematoma Resurrection of Jesus Female reproductive system (human) Moss Joke Pregnancy test Mucus Ebola Identity and change Exploration of Mars Gynecologic hemorrhage Spider Head louse Pulmonary alveolus Piccolo Junior Saga Breastfeeding Niddah Cervical cancer LSD Seed Death Lung cancer Anemia Drowning Needle aspiration biopsy Jennifer Lopez

what are peoples thoughts i was wondering what peoples thoughts are on the depo injection my sister in law is on it and she is only and wants kids later in life and i have heard some bad things about it some women take months some take years and some never recover from taking depo everyone is different since she's young she can probably get a way with it for a while however tell her that years before she wants kids to use another form of birth control it could take that long for her body to get back on track some women are able to get pregnant within a few months of going off depo but many women do not so to be safe once she's a year or two away from wanting to start a family she should switch methods good luck  Depo Provera Birth control Phoebe Halliwell Emperor Yuan of Han Emperor He of Han The Star Wars Holiday Special K' Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Fertility awareness Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Abortion debate Pregnancy Boom Town (Doctor Who) EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sharon Tate Dancing at Lughnasa Kender Magical thinking In vitro fertilisation Karma Melanie Wilkes Social rule Kid Buu Saga Leo Wyatt Psoriasis Spina bifida Menstrual cycle Blood on the Tracks Friends Kate Vaiden Emperor Xuan of Han Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Heir Apparent Incarnations of Immortality Laci Peterson The Fairly OddParents Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Romulus and Remus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion Pompey Oral contraceptive Sigmund Freud Empress Wang Zhengjun Capital punishment Tocopherol Individual Scarlet's Walk Year of the Spider The Contender (television series) Ben Johnson (athlete) Scarlet Witch Pitaten Carpal tunnel syndrome Scenes from a Memory Luck Consort Fu Urinary incontinence Nero Paroxetine Breastfeeding Edward III of England Charles Manson Piper Halliwell Childbirth Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

ok questions about cm i have read that fertile cervical mucus leading up to ovulation is white or yellowish in color and its not very stretchy the cm when you are ovulating is clear stretchy and transparent so heres my question can sperm effect the color of your cm also i know that if you stretch sperm it stretches like a spider web not just one single strand i am not exactly sure what hostile cm is but if you have very stretchy egg white cm but it has the yellowish color does this mean you have not yet hit ovulation but are close or is this the sperm making it that color thank you for any help i am weeks pregnant i used the cervical mucous checks only because that is what is the best way to detect your most fertile time i can tell you from experience and research that the thicker and whiter it is the more fertile you are i'll just explain it by going through the usual cervical mucous phases it usually lasts about three days day approaching ovulation clear and slippery day ovulation thick white like egg white stretchy but not always stretchy day ovulation ending mucous begins to dry up i know this is probably gross but i also should add that the best way to know which phase the cervical mucous is in is to stick your finger in there and get a sample as close to your cervix as possible don't rely as much on what is on your underwear it's also good to see what phase its in before you have sex and get sperm in there because it's too hard to distinguish what is going on with your cervical mucous when it's mixed with sperm  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Cervix Gonorrhoea Puberty Pregnancy Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Birth control Fertilisation Infertility Emergency contraception Miscarriage Cervical cancer Cancer Knitting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Niddah Ovary Endometriosis Human papillomavirus Cystic fibrosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Estrus cycle Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DNA Spider Paint Semen Chimera (genetics) Bird Abortion Ovum Childbirth Sperm Whale Pregnancy test Textile manufacturing terminology Progesterone Estradiol Cervical vertebrae Flowering plant Fetal development Medical analysis of circumcision Fruit Earthworm Mucus Gynaecology Moss CPU cache Obstetrics Color Psoriasis Orgasm Octopus Vertebral column Chiropractic Liquid crystal Leather American lobster Frog Endometrial cancer Autonomic nervous system Carbon dioxide Spermatozoon Carpel Mixed martial arts Conifer cones Coffee Textile manufacturing AIDS reappraisal Xenomorph Shark Wood Snooker Ectopic pregnancy Seed Abortion debate Timpani Capercaillie Homosexuality and medical science Thoracic vertebrae Strap-on dildo Stomach cancer Sterilization (surgical procedure) Tofu Vagina Roswell UFO incident Apollo 8 Artificial insemination Banana slug Egg (biology) Glass Hydrochloric acid Mendelian inheritance

had a miscarriage last week and want to know about concieving again hi i had a miscarriage last week i should have been weeks but i started spotting on sunday night went to the dr on monday and he said that the baby's development was only at about weeks i miscarried naturally with no d c i have read different things about wait time my dr said to wait a cycle or two because it would be easier to determine how far along i was but he didn't give me any medical reason why i physically couldn't start trying right away has anyone else tried right away and had a healthy baby i just want to know if i can go ahead and start trying any thoughts i'm very sorry for your loss the same thing happened to me when i was about the same ammt of time along i did wait one cycle but then went on to conceive almost immediately after my baby daughter is seven months old and was born completely healthy it might be best to take a month off if not for medical reasons but to distance yourself from it for a bit my husband and i used that month to reconnect and stop the work of trying so hard to have a baby we used protection and just tried to enjoy sex for sex medically i think it's more important to wait if you've had a medical proceedure like a d and c and your body needs to heal or if you were further along at weeks lots of people don't even realize that they were pregnant and just go on to do what they normally would i doubt you'd need more than a cycle to get things back to normal and go back to trying again  Miscarriage Pregnancy EastEnders Infantilism Prostate cancer Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction Marilyn Monroe Neighbours Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charmed Niddah Jon Secada Menstrual cycle Knots Landing Urinary incontinence CPU cache Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual abstinence Negima Childbirth CPU design The Apprentice 2 Abortion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sharon Tate Twin Hall & Oates StarCraft: Uprising Coeliac disease Obstetrics The Inside Hollyoaks The Contender (television series) Premature birth Jean-Luc Picard Operation Market Garden Intersexuality Phoebe Halliwell Beatles for Sale Bipolar disorder Fertility awareness Fasting Traumatic incident reduction Miscarriage of justice Piccolo Junior Saga Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story AIDS Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.

pregnancy test question okay i am not late yet until wed or saturday some where in there i think and i took one of those pregnancy tests that show really low hcgs and i think that it came back positive but i am not sure because i took a ept test and it came back negitive is it to early to tell yet on that one what should i do i have been feeling a little nausious which is to weeks after conception frequent urination which can be between weeks faintness and dizziness occasional headaches increased or slight whitish or yellowish vaginal discharge fatigue and sleepiness what should i do or what do you think both of the test mean if your next period is due sometime between this wednesday through saturday you definitely tested too early this is the reason why your tests are not clear don't test again until after thursday or you'll get confusing results again the best thing to do would be to wait until saturday morning but if you can't do that at least wait until thursday anything before that would be too soon good luck  Pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Saturday Night Live Obstetrics Human chorionic gonadotropin Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Clomipramine Menstrual cycle Doxepin Breech birth Prostate cancer Abortion Drug test Gonorrhoea Fertility awareness Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinalysis Human sexual behavior Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Birth control Oral contraceptive Dehydration Clinical depression Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Otakon Operation Market Garden HIV test Hurricane Katrina timeline Hypoglycemia Traumatic brain injury Thursday Endometrial cancer Fasting Endometriosis Billboard Hot 100 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Emergency contraception Lupus erythematosus STS-59 Bob Harris (radio) Prolactinoma Hyperthermia Pneumonia Maprotiline Combat stress reaction AIDS In vitro fertilisation History of Test cricket (to 1883) Sydney Riot of 1879 Saturday Sexual abstinence Dizziness Sexual intercourse Condom Androgen insensitivity syndrome Easter Herpes simplex virus Major League Baseball television contracts Cytomegalovirus Wednesday Thalidomide Abortion debate Progesterone ACE inhibitor Holy Week Coeliac disease WFAN (AM) Narcolepsy Ben Johnson (athlete) The Ashlee Simpson Show UK Singles Chart Doomsday rule STS-58 Monday Night Football Ebola Game show Sharon Tate Ocean's Twelve 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cephalic disorder Aspartame Topiramate Child sexuality Visit of King George IV to Scotland Andy Kaufman Mojave people Multiple chemical sensitivity Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Liturgical year Menstrual cup Childbirth Extreme Programming The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Gregorian calendar Hurricane Rita

absolutely frustrated ok first of all this is a rant not a question i just want to go back in time and kick my own behind i thought how great it would be to track everything and know exactly when i got pregnant as my first two children were a happy surprise my dh i planned for two years before we decided to go ahead and give it a try started sept ' but here we are still no baby on the way one thing i can stress is not to tell anyone that you have decided to ttc as i am so sick and tired of hearing my mother and everyone else ask any luck yet we thought we were doing it smart by getting everything in line before the baby now we are stuck with all of these hurtful reminders that there is no baby and maybe never will be ex the crib that we bought because the crib i used for the older two i had given away the mini van we bought to accomodate another child the extra bedroom that we made sure was in the new house we bought to make room for baby i'm at my wits end i know people go alot longer than what i have been ttc but it doesn't help the fact that i feel broken and i just wanted anyone else who is currently ttc to know that you are not alone in your hopes and all the ups and down you are facing i feel like i am letting my husband down every month even though i know he will be happy with the family we have it's just absolutely frustrating i would take a surprise baby anyday over going through all of this again i am only and i have been to the doctor already he has said that it can take up to six months for m y birth control to be completely out of my system but six months has definately come and gone i thank everyone for chiming in the main focus of this post was to let anyone ttc know they are not alone in their struggles i totally feel your pain on this i have been trying to concieve since june ' everybody still asks me month after month if i am pregnant yet it feels like the whole world is pregnant or carrying babies around when you can't get pregnant i have no children and a beautifully decorated baby room gathering dust my husband teaches high school and all the kids ask us constantly when we're having kids so they can babysit we've been married for years in terms of all the people questioning your pregnancy i sent this link to all my family and close friends to help them understand what i am going through right now it has really helped them understand where i am emotionally and know what not to say www tearsandhope com months were the hardest for me psychologically or emotionally do your best to stay positive and focus on the things you can control in this situation  EastEnders Pregnancy Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Abortion debate Boston Public Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sharon Tate Social rule Everwood Theory of conduct Hollyoaks Infantilism The Catcher in the Rye Transactional analysis Breastfeeding Neighbours Toronto Subway and RT One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q The Contender (television series) Charmed Paradox Haven (TNG episode) Happiness Melanie Wilkes Poker jargon The Death Gate Cycle Blood on the Tracks Toronto Transit Commission Jam (TV series) About a Boy Baby Blues Alois Hitler Oh My Goddess!

fertility question i have little girls ages and we have been trying for about months for baby number my husband is and i am i know that it gets harder to conceive with age but neither of us is that old my question is this after having absolutely no trouble getting pregnant with the first could a fertility problem suddenly be affecting one of us if so what thanks all lol my husband is in the army he does not smoke weed or do any other kind of drugs honey it gets harder to conceive with age over age not age lol the bottom line is no two pregnancies are the same so even though you got pregnant on a sneeze the last times this one is obviously different you shouldn't even consider there's a problem until it's been months of trying it could be that having rugrats running around has added extra stress and therefore running some interference with conceiving i would suggest buying an ovulation predictor kit an opk will tell you exactly when you're fertile so you know when you need to have sex good luck  Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Infertility Abortion debate Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Birth control Friends Miscarriage Twin Multiple birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Illegal drug trade Oral contraceptive Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Folic acid Common cold Childbirth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psoriasis Obstetrics Fertilisation Postpartum depression Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Breastfeeding Boston Public Pregnancy test Ovulation Tobacco smoking Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Spina bifida Puberty CPU cache Tocopherol Emergency contraception Ectopic pregnancy Health issues and the effects of cannabis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prolactinoma Autism Guinea pig Sexual intercourse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Marilyn Monroe Premature birth Neighbours Infantilism Gonorrhoea Biology and sexual orientation Stroke Coeliac disease Days of our Lives Hollyoaks Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual reproduction Knots Landing The nature of God in Western theology History of sex Teenage pregnancy Elephant X chromosome Humphrey Bogart Schizophrenia Human cloning Meditation Rugrats Sharon Tate Clinical depression Prostate cancer Mojave people Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain Paroxetine Sex and the City Free trade Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baby Blues Osteoporosis Conifer cones Genital wart Drug test Flowering plant Herpes simplex virus Pelvic inflammatory disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Cannabis (drug) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Redundant array of independent disks Social rule Marriage Abortion Stomach cancer Sexual dysfunction Agriculture Mary, the mother of Jesus Niddah

i've heard that sometimes when sperm fertilizes a female egg she can have some bleeding is this true also how much bleeding would there be actually no it is not true not the way you have said it anyway you do not bleed when the sperm fertilises the egg that is incorrect fertilisation will occur without your knowledge the bleeding that you are referring to occurs when the fertilised egg implants itself into the uterus the egg forces its way into the uterine lining and some women experience bleeding because of the break in the uterine tissue it really is more spotting and shouldn't be heavy at all that is why it is called implantation bleeding not everyone gets it though and it is not a sign that if you don't get it you are not pregnant i am currently months pregnant and did not get it  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Miscarriage Fertilisation Twin Infertility Endometrium Uterus Emergency contraception Ovary Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Human cloning Puberty Fertility awareness Ovulation Endometrial cancer Female reproductive system (human) Sexual reproduction Progesterone Stem cell Ovum Abortion Male reproductive system (human) Hydatidiform mole Oral contraceptive Gynecologic hemorrhage Birth control Spermatozoon Sex Estrus cycle Intrauterine device Ovarian cancer Embryo transfer Obstetrical hemorrhage Multiple birth Pregnancy (mammals) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intersexuality Moss Sterilization (surgical procedure) Placental abruption Fetal development Ploidy Polycystic ovary syndrome Asherman's syndrome Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Uterine fibroids Hysterectomy Orgasm Parthenogenesis Vaginal bleeding Mammalian embryogenesis Spider Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Traumatic brain injury Cervix Gonorrhoea Surrogacy Adenomyosis Human development Intersex surgery Sea Otter Sexual intercourse Human Pelvic inflammatory disease Human sexual response cycle Intravenous therapy Friends Frog Sexual differentiation Spina bifida Stroke Vagina Gynaecology Breech birth Man Gamete Hearing impairment Cancer Ocean's Twelve Octopus Oral sex Artificial womb Cryptorchidism Cellular differentiation Swyer syndrome Adverse effect (medicine) Digenea Breastfeeding Earthworm Von Willebrand disease Diabetic retinopathy

any predictions on the outcome or what i need to look out for in my next pregnancy i had nd trimester pregnancy losses the first two was with twins and the last pregnancy was with triplets my doc thinks i have incompetent cervix i had a cerclage put in with the last pregnancies but they failed ive never been pregnant with a singleton i pray about it everyday mayb im just looking for a sign that everything is ok and that im going to have healthy pregnancies and babies any predictions insights or word of incouragement are appriciated thanks i guess my answer would be if you are using fertility treatments you need to be monitered more closely so you don't get pregnant with multiples again i have two friends who lost sets of twins one of my friends lost them in the th week one of them earlier but her mom couldn't carry twins either both of these friends went on to have sucessfull full term singleton pregnancies also because i am high risk i had a preemie and doing fertility treatments the dr moniters me closely through vaginal ultrasounds to make sure i am not producing more then one egg at a time you may have an incompetent cervix or you may just not be able to carry multiples i hope you see a specialist though because if you've lost pregnancies i am soooo sorry you are considered to have fertility issues make sure you have your dr or ob gyn reffer you to a good re and good luck and i pray that you will be blessed with a healthy fullterm baby getting pregnant and staying pregnant is truly a miracle  Pregnancy Miscarriage Abortion Twin In vitro fertilisation Multiple birth Obstetrics Ectopic pregnancy Abortion debate Childbirth Intact dilation and extraction Breech birth Infertility Menstrual cycle Premature birth Fertility awareness Friends EastEnders Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gonorrhoea Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion in the United States Stroke Cephalic disorder Folic acid Birth weight Endometrial cancer Cytomegalovirus Urinary incontinence Roe v.

what to expect going for a hysterosalpingogram next week been ttc for and a half years just wondering what to expect has anyone had one okay i went through this just a few months ago it's really not a big deal take some tylenol or ibubprofen about an hour before you go to the doctor's office hospital be sure to pack at least one pantyliner for afterwards i did mine at a hospital so unless yours is being done elsewhere your experience will probably be the same after doing all the preliminary check in stuff the nurse will have you change into a hospital gown and lie down on the x ray machine table they will insert a speculum just like a gyno exam next they put a clamp on your cervix the sensation is somewhere between moderate to moderate severs period cramps while it's not comfortable it's not the most painful thing in the world either the doctor will then insert a catheter into your uterus and slowly inject the dye as the radiologist takes images of your reproductive organs as the dye is expelled your uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries will show bright white on the image ideally your uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries should light up then the dye will spill into your abdominal cavity the dye itself isn't painful unless they hit a blockage in your fallopian tubes this can be painful but as i had no blockage i can't describe the sensation some docotrs use an oil based dye others a water based the water based can be less painful in the case of a blockage but the oil based can sometimes loosen a blockage on its own if one is found you won't get a choice in which they use but i thought i would let you know that once the test is done they'll remove the catheter clamp and speculum and you can get dressed remember the pad as the dye can sometimes leak out and some people experience light bleeding afterwards the entire process takes less than minutes the doctor will review your x rays to see if anything is out of place shaped wrong or blocked  Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Dialysis Gynaecology In vitro fertilisation Sexual reproduction Ectopic pregnancy Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Childbirth Menstrual cup Pregnancy Abortion Uterus Intravenous therapy Gonorrhoea Ovary Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cancer Intersex surgery Endometrial cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease X-ray Puberty Cystoscopy Fertilisation Traumatic brain injury Stroke Infertility Sex organ Breastfeeding Ovulation Gastroparesis Sexual differentiation Intact dilation and extraction Acupuncture Cervix Medicine Diabetic retinopathy Pneumonia Apollo 8 Myocardial infarction Colorectal cancer Casting First aid Sterilization (surgical procedure) Cancer Migraine Human sexuality Sexual intercourse Textile manufacturing Terri Schiavo Electrophysiology Lethal injection Ebola Penis Fertility awareness Strap-on dildo Shark Aortic dissection Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male First Battle of the Atlantic Blood on the Tracks Compact disc Professional wrestling match types Fecal incontinence EastEnders Upholstery Chlamydia Radiology Tobacco smoking Carbon dioxide Coronary catheterization Pain Cholecystitis Cathode ray tube Chemical abortion Cruising (maritime) Peritoneum Massage Vaginal bleeding Stenberg v.

if i am supposed to ovulate on and cant have intercourse until what are the odds of conceiving i know its possible but i am more curious about the time frame it takes the egg to disinigrate hours is the travel usually quick such as the hours or the latter the hours hopefully i'll ovulate on yeah i think the egg does die in the hour time frame you also need to think about the fact that sperm should already be waiting at the end of the fallopian tubes for the release of the egg therefore your best chance for conception is actually from sex the days before ovulation you also don't know exactly what time of day you ovulate could be in the middle of the night i have heard that stress can delay ovulation any chance you can dream up a reason for being stressed out  Menstrual cycle Ovulation Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Infertility Fertilisation Pregnancy Female reproductive system (human) Oral contraceptive Ovary Sexual reproduction Niddah Birth control Sexual intercourse Sexual abstinence Puberty Ovum Time Artificial insemination Apollo 8 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Spider Abortion debate Jon Secada Carpel Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersexuality Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Quicksort Characters of The Sandman Saga (band) Time Out of Mind Boom Town (Doctor Who) Drosophila melanogaster Polycystic ovary syndrome Flowering plant Oral sex Prostate cancer Spermatozoon Fetal development Old wives' tale Bedbug Bicycle frame Twin Strap-on dildo Speed of light Estrus cycle Orgasm Albatross Craps Time travel Operation Market Garden Sydney Riot of 1879 The Time Machine Game show Digimon The Amber Spyglass Sex organ Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Who Framed Roger Rabbit Have I Got News For You Glossary of partner dance terms Human sexuality Triage Cricket Ovarian cyst Gonorrhoea Snooker Prosecutor's fallacy Noam Chomsky Ontological argument Fasting Ravi Shastri Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia The Inside Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cancer Louie, Louie Aluminium Andrew Dice Clay Pregnancy test Aphid USS Tunny (SS-282) Pelvic inflammatory disease Stroke South Park Ocean's Twelve Phaedo Dead Like Me 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Edward's syndrome Angling G-Man (Half-Life) The Flaming Lips Gypsy moth American Pie (song) Property (ownership right)

clomid and o'l test when is the best time to start using the o'l test i am on clomid mg days i'm on my first day of clomid day q does clomid cause problems with opk's ovulation predictor kits a clomid serophene clomiphene citrate can cause a false positive in opks if taken too soon after finishing the prescription according to most of the manufacturers you should wait at least days before using an opk if you take clomid days you can begin testing on day if you take it you should wait until day the below q a's are related to ovulation testing in general q on what day of my cycle should i start testing a if you have a variable cycle you should use the date of your shortest cycle in the past six months as a starting time cycle length start day q i have a long cycle how many days will i have to test a it varies the best thing to do is figure out the length of your shortest cycle in the past six months and begin testing on the day mentioned in the chart above continuing testing until you detect a surge or have a sustained temperature rise at least days and at degrees higher than the previous six temps if your cycle varies by a week or so you can expect to go through up to tests the more your cycle varies the more tests you'll need example your shortest cycle is days and the longest is you would begin testing on day but may need to continue through tests or even more note that this isn't common but it is possible about of women will detect a surge within days of testing try not to lose patience and keep on testing you'll learn more about your cycle then if you stop best of luck once i got the right dose of clomid i was pregnant within months with both of my children i used the ovulation predictor kits which predict the surge of hormones before ovulation so you know it's the best time to try to conceive fyi they also recommend testing around pm and not using first morning urine  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Infertility Pregnancy test Puberty Tour de France Oral contraceptive Solar variation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Human height HIV test Ovarian cancer Jet engine Drug test CPU cache Emergency contraception Prostate cancer Cytomegalovirus Urinary incontinence Penis Ice core Birth control Obstetrics Hypoglycemia Niddah Toyota Prius Hebrew calendar Childbirth Anabolic steroid Time Maya calendar Software testing Prolactinoma Temperature Biodiesel Extreme Programming Heartworm Hubble Space Telescope Year Malaria Endometriosis Computus Ben Johnson (athlete) Breastfeeding Cancer GED Climate of the United Kingdom Graduate school Glossary of graph theory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovarian cyst Cryptorchidism Sea level rise Gregorian calendar Carbon dioxide Hipparchus (astronomer) Julian day Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Month E85 Clinical depression Global warming Normal distribution Nuclear fallout Branch predictor Turner syndrome Causality Autism Lance Armstrong Physician Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Bipolar disorder Welding Diabetes mellitus Axial compressor Postpartum depression Billboard Hot 100 Sex assignment Progesterone Intelligence quotient Tide Liturgical year STS-62 Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia SAT Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Vitamin C Thermoregulation

is there any way to shorten the length of your menstrual cycle i am ttc and stopped birth control pills in january since then my periods have been so infrequent they weren't before i went on the pill i began taking my bbt and know that i am ovulating but on cycle day rather than cycle day as a result i have many fewer chances to get pregnant is this normal this long after stopping the pill is there a way i e diet excercise vitamins etc to speed up ovulation it's been about months since you stopped the pill most people's bodies are usually getting back on track by this point make an appointment with your ob gyn and tell her of your situation and your concerns she'll probably tell you to wait it out for a while but she may consider using some fertility drugs such as clomid that allow you to precisely control your cycle length and ovulation date most likely your ob gyn will suggest you keep trying until january ' if it hasn't happened by then they'll take some action in getting you started  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Tocopherol Birth control Puberty Acne Folic acid Endometriosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovarian cyst Urinary incontinence Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Vitamin D Niddah Infertility Coeliac disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Twin Progesterone Vitamin C Apollo 8 Guinea pig Migraine Computus Depo Provera Julian day Nutrition Month Year Roman calendar Menstrual cup Heartworm Prostate cancer Antidepressant Fertilisation Anorexia nervosa Antiretroviral drug Breastfeeding Hebrew calendar Isotretinoin Female reproductive system (human) Baldness treatments Chlorpromazine Gregorian calendar Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual intercourse Ovum Alzheimer's disease Vitamin Ovary CPU design Toronto Transit Commission Timekeeping on Mars Toronto Subway and RT Sexual abstinence Multiple sclerosis Sleep Weight training Common cold Hipparchus (astronomer) Conifer cones Maya calendar Kodocha Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Pregnancy test Premenstrual stress syndrome Cat Friends Stomach cancer Anabolic steroid Ovarian cancer Time Malaria Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Toronto Streetcar System TGV Veganism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Paget's disease of bone Clinical depression Cray-1 Vehicular cycling Eclipse cycle Orgasm Obstetrics Tour de France Tropical year Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Meiosis Drug abuse

first time i knew i ovulated and now wondering about my cm been ttc for months i have irregular periods now being looked into and for the first time ever i had signs that showed me i ovulated well it's been approx dpo and what seems to have happened is my cm has almost gone i have read that women have an increase in cervical mucus when the are preg and now my little hope of being preg are starting to fall as my cm is almost gone there's little to say the least so i am wondering if anyone found out they were pregnant and had the same as what i'm going through is is normal for the cm to dry up anyway am soooo confused catherine thank you helpful advice though too scared to do hpt just yet x patricia jean i've tried ovulation strips and they don't really work for me i have noticed something different this month because my dr did some tests around to when he thought was ovulating then two days later i had spotting for one day which i now know was ovulation spotting that's when i knew i ovulated been having twinges sore nipp's all the way until dpo and now nowt not even much cm so i doubt that i'm pregnant this month now first off don't get discouraged every pregnancy is different just like every woman is different some women have ewcm when they ovulate and then dry up when their period comes other like my self always stay moist it is possible to be pregnant because we can't always go by some one else's symptoms so relax take a deep breath and do a hpt remember on average it take a healthy fertile couple year to conceive oh and for your irregular periods ask your doctor about progesterone its a drug that regulates your period making it easier to pin point ovulation also look into seeing a reproductive endocrinologist they are specialist at conceiving and are way better than the regular ob gyn sending you tons of baby dust and the best of wishes  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Ovulation Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Puberty Infertility Progesterone Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cyst Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Estrus cycle Obstetrics Endometriosis Miscarriage Psoriasis Childbirth Gonorrhoea Coeliac disease Folic acid Medicine Cytomegalovirus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Cancer Multiple birth Mucus Human chorionic gonadotropin Asthma Friends Pelvic inflammatory disease Herpes simplex virus Health issues and the effects of cannabis Bipolar disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder EastEnders Jon Secada Morning sickness Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ectopic pregnancy Sexual abstinence History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Abortion debate Fertilisation Flowering plant Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Autism Vampire Infectious mononucleosis Days of our Lives Turner syndrome Neighbours Gynaecology Premature birth Paroxetine Cervix Spina bifida Teenage pregnancy Endometrial cancer Mountain Gorilla Malaria Doxepin Milton H.

so i thought my husband wanted a baby we have been ttc for the past months my fertile peiod this month is anywhere between the th th last night we made love and he pulled out before he ejaculated we used to use this as a method of birth control before we got married i don't know what to think was it an old habit or do you think this means he really doesn't want a baby yet first of all talk to him unless you have an open and honest discussion about this you'll never know for sure it could be just an old habit like you said has he done this any other time since you've been ttc he may also just have cold feet men see having children as a huge responsibility and rightly so they feel compelled to make sure you have the financial resources and right situation to have a baby maybe he's just a little shaken up by the reality of it all now that you're actively trying just talk to him and and see what's up if claims it was habit and he doesn't do it again let it go there's no use worrying  Sexual intercourse Birth control EastEnders Breastfeeding Friends Milton H.

is there any hope for me ttc at i just went on fertility ties com and aked a fertlity doctor about me ttc at and he answered that he really doubt it i have a year old from my st husband but i would like to have with my new husband i plan on starting on clomid as soon as my cycle starts but that doctor made me feel like there is no hope for me i have been ttc for months using ovulation strips and we bd every other day any hope or other women out there ttc after without using ivf don't listen to naysayers and especially some doctor online who doesn't know you or your history he's going by statistics and yes statistics aren't in your favor but people beat the odds in everything everyday i got pregnant on the first try at age unfortunately my baby had a bad heart and passed away in utero i needed time to grieve and we are now trying again i'm hopeful it will happen before the year is over i'm now the odds also say that women in their s are fertile fertile fertile well guess what not all of them i talk to women here every day in their s who can't conceive who have problems i don't have in my s so what do experts have to say about that as long as any woman is ovulating she's capable of being pregnant some can do it quickly and some need more time now i'm sure you know the risks for women our age so it's possible you may need some help at months of trying you're on the borderline if you want to go see a fertility specialist or keep trying for a while longer you've just started to chart your temps i would say give it a couple of cycles and see what happens actually if you end up in a fertility specialist's office it will help the doctor if you've got a few months of charting for him her to refer to i would only suggest you run to the specialist now if you know for sure you don't ovulate or if you have other obvious female problems that could get in the way irregular periods endometriosis etc but you haven't mentioned any of that so i'm assuming that they're not a problem for you also there's a slight chance that hubby may have a lower sperm count or some other sperm issue the path of least resistance points to him getting tested first fixing male parts is a lot easier than female so while you're charting for the next couple of months you may want to send him to a urologist for a sperm analysis it wouldn't hurt good luck and stay positive  Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Infertility Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Miscarriage Puberty Endometriosis Social rule Polycystic ovary syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Friends Jam (TV series) Blackjack Craps Fertilisation Emergency contraception Ovulation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Doomsday argument 1957 World Series Breastfeeding Poker jargon Toronto Subway and RT Philosophical skepticism Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Twin Stomach cancer Toronto Transit Commission Phoebe Halliwell Obstetrics Species Jon Secada Domestic violence Sexual reproduction Multiple birth 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression The Death Gate Cycle Equine conformation Toronto Streetcar System Human cloning Sheepshead Survivor (novel) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) ELO rating system Conifer cones Hebrew calendar Breech birth Pitaten Kasparov versus The World Autism Medical analysis of circumcision Niddah Estrus cycle Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Adoption UK Singles Chart Surveillance Fecal incontinence Eugenics Coeliac disease Ashton-Tate Oh My Goddess!

long lh surge ok i have been testing withopk and got a positive lh surge the test line was darker than control line i tested again hours later and it was still a very positive result is this normal i thought the surge was sudden and could easily be missed as ive been told by numerous amounts of people so is it possible to have a positive result over a day period as its still positive im confused as it says ovulation should take place around hours later i am healthy and do not have pcos any info would be very helpful hi there this is totally normal not every woman is the same some have very short surges where they literally have to test twice a day or they miss it some will have a positive result for a couple of days and others will have a positive result until their period comes all of it is normal the main thing to remember is that once you get that positive you ovulate anywhere from hours later so even if it stays positive for days you would have ovulated a day or two after you initially turned positive this is why once you get a positive there is no need to keep testing good luck  Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertility awareness Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovulation The Amazing Race Pregnancy test Nuclear fallout Akuma (Street Fighter) Pregnancy Emergency contraception 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Hurricane Rita HIV test USS Wahoo (SS-238) Urinary incontinence Gonadotropin-releasing hormone In vitro fertilisation Snooker Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Narcolepsy Social rule Birth control Experiment Breastfeeding SL-1 Color blindness Fluorescent lamp Ovarian cancer Infertility Poker jargon Sydney Riot of 1879 Lonely Among Us (TNG episode) Billboard Hot 100 Sleep debt Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Flood Oral contraceptive History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Big Brother UK series 6 Explosive material Jet engine John F.

when to test what is the most reliable time to do a test on the day of your missed period days after it is late or even longer i took only two days after i was late its now days and i'm unsure if i should test again the majority of women can get a positive the day their period is due taking a test days after you were late should have been pretty reliable hcg doubles in your system every hours in early pregnancy so if you tested again now it should be more than accurate it sounds like you may have ovulated late this cycle ovulating late means that your period would be due later or if you conceived that you would have to test later too you didn't mention having any other signs besides a missing period so i'm wondering if you just ovulated late i would test again using first morning pee if it's still negative give it one more week and test again if it's still negative and no period go to the doctor for a blood test good luck  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Pregnancy test Fertility awareness Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Human chorionic gonadotropin In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Miscarriage Estrus cycle Niddah Ovarian cyst Ovarian cancer Drug test HIV test Obstetrics Childbirth Oral contraceptive Progesterone Maya calendar Ravi Shastri Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Blood type Urinary incontinence Cytomegalovirus Prenatal diagnosis Infertility Coeliac disease Chris Amon Birth control Aortic dissection Paul Is Dead Ron and Fez M16 (rifle) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Prostate cancer Julian day Hebrew calendar Diabetic retinopathy Reliability engineering Immanuel Lupus erythematosus New Morning Prolactinoma Cheating in Counter-Strike Hipparchus (astronomer) Central processing unit Abortion Stroke Time Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 False negative Puberty Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Anemia Social rule Blood on the Tracks UK Singles Chart Sexual abstinence Gonorrhoea Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Month Numerology Group A streptococcal infection M60 machine gun Breast cancer Tide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Failure rate Extreme Programming Chinese New Year English cricket team Sleep apnea Lou Gehrig Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Decca Records Blackjack Chinese character STS-62 British Rail Class 86 Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Cephalic disorder Apollo Guidance Computer Entropy W.

can you conceive outside of your ovulation period sorry to be so naive but we've only just started ttc and i'm a bit confused about the whole thing i would highly suggest purchasing the clearblue easy digital ovulation kit which can be bought at target for instead of which is at most retail shops this digital kit has tests which you pee on every morning preferrably in the afternoon time and if you're about to ovulate hours it will show you a digital smiley face if you're not about to ovulate then it will just show you a circle the test detects lh surge which is a hormone that is at it's top peak when you're about to ovulate release the egg once you see that smiley face you should have sex within hours sperm can stay in your body anywhere from days obviously this depends on both partners' health also the reason i would suggest this digital test rather than other tests in the market is because the other aren't digital you have to kind of guess yourself by looking at pink lines if you're okay with that then you can purchase the first response ovulation kit it's cheaper and has more tests but it's not digital check out the clearblue easy digital opk http www clearblueeasy com digitalovul also i've read that before you have sex it's good for the male to drink coffee about min because the sperm are more jumpy and can get to the egg faster especially the y sperm boy sperm good luck and baby dust to you  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Puberty Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Pregnancy Infertility Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Niddah HIV test Drosophila melanogaster Transsexuality Breastfeeding Milk Social rule Hypoglycemia Sea-Monkey Ovary RFID IBM PC compatible Sperm Whale Ovum Shark Orgasm Billboard Hot 100 Paragliding Hard disk Digital photography Abortion debate DVD Anal sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma History of Test cricket (to 1883) Friends Coffee Organic food Whale The Amazing Race Estrus cycle Smiley Smile Modem Urinary incontinence Hardware random number generator Copy protection Spider Airsoft Daylight saving time Intersexuality Sears Holdings Corporation Neopets The Chemical Brothers The Beach Boys Commodore 64 UK Singles Chart Oral sex German car number plates PlayStation Portable Target Corporation Illegal drug trade Pornographic movie Only Fools and Horses Sound Blaster Wal-Mart $ale of the Century Oscilloscope M16 (rifle) Collision detection Jam (TV series) Sesame Street Nintendo DS Floppy disk Fertilisation Human sexual behavior Drag racing Octopus card Sinclair Research Ltd Cheating in Counter-Strike Roswell UFO incident Pretty Good Privacy Computer insecurity Wild Honey Toronto Streetcar System Strap-on dildo IPod Condom Game show Estradiol Penis Motion picture rating system Parthenogenesis

if you're on provera to restart your cycle when you finish your pills that are prescribed to you and you're waiting for the periods to start again can you ovulate between that time have any of you ladies gotten pregnant in between that waiting period or just were already pregnant and you doc didn't realize that i don't think you can get pregnant during that time you're waiting for your period to start the provera will stimulate your body to shed the lining of your uterus so unless you don't respond to the provera there would be no lining for an embryo to attach to that's why they usually do a pregnancy test before the provera  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Birth control In vitro fertilisation Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Ovulation Infertility Estrus cycle Human chorionic gonadotropin Progesterone Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Depo Provera Abortion Emergency contraception Sexual reproduction Urinary incontinence Friends Uterus Embryo transfer Twin Female reproductive system (human) Ectopic pregnancy Obstetrics Ovarian cancer Abortion debate Endometrium Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian cyst Sexual intercourse Gynecologic hemorrhage Ovum Morning sickness Religion and abortion Ovary Psoriasis Miscarriage Pregnancy (mammals) Childbirth Sexual abstinence Gynaecology Endometrial cancer Methotrexate Pregnancy test Tsetse fly Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prenatal diagnosis The Venture Bros.

what the chance what is the chance of getting pregnant while taking zovia and not using a condom zovia inhibits ovulation via a negative feedback mechanism of the hypothalamus it also changes the cervical mucus rendering it unfavorable for sperm penetration even if ovulation occurs therefore the chances of becoming pregnant while taking any bcp is minimal if taken at the same time every day do remember that being unwell can alter the effectiveness of the bcp so using further protection if this happens is advisable hope this helps  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Birth control Oral contraceptive Puberty Pregnancy Enzyme In vitro fertilisation Estradiol Signal transduction Seed Oral sex Progesterone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infertility Fertilisation Human papillomavirus Cancer Health issues and the effects of cannabis Feedback Safe sex Homeostasis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Electroconvulsive therapy Stomach cancer Human chorionic gonadotropin Psoriasis Blackjack Herpes simplex virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Ovary Pregnancy test Folic acid Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Chemotherapy Cervical cancer Flowering plant Glucokinase Miscarriage Negative feedback Fever Gonorrhoea Sleep Sexual abstinence Stopping power HIV Greenhouse effect Stuttering Nutrition Pornographic movie Corrosion Hypnosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Methotrexate Appetite Amiodarone Schizophrenia Ovarian cyst Sexual reproduction Warfarin Dither Abortion Mobile phone radiation and health Cystic fibrosis Synaptic plasticity Chlorpromazine Estrus cycle Tank Antiretroviral drug Climate change Cervical cap Common cold Condom Second language acquisition Abortion debate Immune system Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis Female reproductive system (human) Sexually-transmitted infection Carcinogenesis Obesity Cosmic Era technology Cannabis (drug) AIDS Business continuity planning Breastfeeding Oxytocin Premature birth Malaria Slippery slope Aromatase inhibitor Paracetamol Gynaecology Tooth enamel COX-2 inhibitor Diabetes insipidus Modafinil

is it true that you con control the gender of the baby when conceiving i have heard many theries like on a full moon boy on a saturday girl from the back girl from the front boy days during ovulation boy lights on boy under covers girl are any of those true and can you control what gender the baby will be check out the shettles method but it is not scientifically proven the method teaches that the girl sperm is slower but lives longer and the boy sperm is faster but doesn't live that long depending on your cervical fluid inside the girl sperm can possible live days so if you have sex few days before ovulation depending on the fluid inside of you the girl sperm can get to the egg if you have sex close to ovulation or on that day the faster boy sperm can get to them faster also if you use lubricant like ky jelly astroglide saliva etc this can kill the sperm i would suggest using preseed which is something like a lubricant but you insert it in your vagina minutes before sex you can check out www preseed com and if you read the posts a lot of ladies have gotten pregnant from it because preseed allows the sperm to live longer in that fluid as mentioned above the shettles method isn't proven but it's very popular so it doesn't hurt to try you can read more about it by google ing it also if you have your spouse bf drink coffee min before sex it makes the sperm swim faster another myth but it's worked for a lot of ladies more myths from the back boy because if you're about to ovulate it gets the sperm closest to the cervix so since the boy sperm are faster they're more than likely to get to the egg faster from the front girl good luck  Menstrual cycle Birth control Sexual intercourse Puberty Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive Condom Strap-on dildo Ovulation Sperm Whale Pregnancy Personal lubricant Menstrual cup Oral sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Safe sex Friends Prostate cancer Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Spider Masturbation Human sexual behavior Niddah Intersexuality Friction Artificial insemination Jon Secada Pornographic movie Vagina Intact dilation and extraction Semen Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Orgasm Obstetrics Intersex surgery About a Boy Female reproductive system (human) Twin Sex assignment Internal ballistics Sex and the City Swimming Vaginal lubrication John Money Speed of light EastEnders Cat Child sexuality The Catcher in the Rye Miscarriage Gay slang Moon Dragon Booster Diaphragm (contraceptive) Action potential Hebrew calendar Freenet Floppy disk Infantilism Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Soul Faster-than-light Childbirth Apollo 8 Moss Apollo 11 Ovum Shark Drosophila melanogaster Equine conformation Contredanse The Chemical Brothers Ovary Kurt Cobain George Costanza History of intersex surgery Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Something Positive Gonorrhoea Marilyn Monroe Dialysis Sex toy Archery Great Teacher Onizuka

so my husband and i have been trying to have a baby for over a yr we have gone to dr all is ok any suggestions i have used the ovulation tests and my dr and i have gone over the best times and dates and still no sucess i have been taking prenatal for a yr also to help reduce risks what do i do now first begin taking folic acid at least one month before you start trying to conceive and during your first trimester by taking micrograms of folic acid a day can cut down your chances of having a baby with neural tube defects such as spina bifida by up to percent it may be difficult to get all of the needed nutrients you need to help produce a healthy baby so taking folic acid may help you greatly you can by the supplement and many drug stores another way to help improve conception is by giving up taking drugs alcohol and smoking smoking and taking drugs can lead to miscarriages premature birth and low birthweight babies smoking can affect your fertility rate also and lower your husbands sperm count second hand smoke can also lower your chances of getting pregnant over indulgence in caffeine can also be a big no no too much caffeine while pregnant can reduce your ability to absorb iron and increase your risk for stillbirth when you are ready to conceive a baby start weaning yourself off of coffee tea and sodas maintaining a healthy weight while pregnant is essential and can also increase your chances of conceiving women whose body mass index is below or above have a harder time getting pregnant so a body mass index in between these numbers can make it easier to conceive you can start by eating healthy get rid off all the unnecessary junk food in your refrigerator and replace it with health foods your body is going to need nutrients and nutrients help a healthy pregnancy create and most importantly follow an exercise program start and stick to a fitness plan healthy exercise programs include to minutes of aerobic activity this can be walking weight training cycling and even muscle training two to three days a week keep in mind too that exercising while pregnant is healthy and recommended knowing when you ovulate can help increase your chances of getting pregnant some women simply choose to stop using birth control when they are ready to get pregnant and when it happens it happens others like to pinpoint their ovulation day start charting your basal body temperature and the changes in your cervical mucus tracking these symptoms over several months can help you to determine when you ovulate each month ovulation predictor kits can also help you figure out when you re ovulating it detects hormones in your urine that signal that ovulation is about to occur by taking certain steps and precautions your chances of conceiving a healthy baby is very likely  Cancer Premature birth Milk Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Caffeine Tocopherol Coffee Osteoporosis Infertility Ovulation Vitamin C Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health issues and the effects of cannabis Abortion debate Obesity Anemia Word of Wisdom Bipolar disorder Insulin Dieting Childbirth Anencephaly Polycystic ovary syndrome Human height Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cystic fibrosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Prenatal diagnosis Atherosclerosis Psoriasis Weight training Cocaine Stroke Migraine Herpes simplex virus Diabetes mellitus Cytomegalovirus Omega-3 fatty acid Pneumonia Tobacco smoking Bodybuilding Clinical depression Guinea pig Addiction Vitamin Common cold Fecal incontinence Gastroesophageal reflux disease Sexual abstinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cryptorchidism Gonorrhoea Haloperidol Sleep Stomach cancer Illegal drug trade Chemotherapy Carbon dioxide Primidone Vegetarianism Cephalic disorder Congenital disorder Exercise Prolactinoma AIDS Ovarian cancer Schizophrenia Stem cell Organic farming Progesterone Multiple sclerosis Birth weight Endometriosis Swimming Chocolate

is it posible ok just wondering is it possible to concive before ovulation and if yes how because the eggs havent been relesed yet thanks in advance you can't actually conceive before ovulation but you can conceive at ovulation from sex beforehand since conception is the act of egg and sperm fusing sperm can live up to days in the right kind of cervical fluid days is probably more realistic but eggs only live hours at the most probably more like most pregnancies result from sex just before ovulation since the sperm have had time to swim up to the fallopian tubes and hang around and wait for the egg to be released so if you are trying to conceive you start having sex every other day about days before you expect to ovulate so that sperm are always there waiting if you wait until you ovulate the egg may be dead before the sperm have a chance to reach it hope that helps  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Fertilisation Infertility Pregnancy Sexual reproduction Emergency contraception Birth control Ovary Sexual intercourse Oral contraceptive Niddah Puberty Ovum Spider Prostate cancer Intersexuality Spermatozoon Miscarriage Chimera (genetics) Ectopic pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Androgen Oral sex Artificial insemination Gonorrhoea Ovarian cancer Estrus cycle Fetal development Sterilization (surgical procedure) Epididymis Shark Flowering plant Old wives' tale Multiple birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Edward's syndrome Abortion debate Pregnancy test Fruit Carpel Pelvic inflammatory disease Twin Sexual abstinence Endometriosis Homunculus Human sexual behavior Sperm Whale American lobster Sex organ Estradiol Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Safe sex Ovarian cyst Marchantiophyta Alternation of generations Parthenogenesis History of sex William Shockley Man Sea-Monkey Premature birth Grunion Gynecologic hemorrhage Ploidy Stroke Whale Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Penis Grasshopper Beetle Progesterone Drosophila melanogaster Homosexuality and medical science Krill Solar power Semen Gynaecology Social rule Hermaphrodite Leatherback Sea Turtle Gamete Douche Male reproductive system (human) Octopus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone The Jam Housefly Giant squid Urinary incontinence The Children of Men Cervical cancer Albatross Cephalic disorder Swimming Anencephaly

anyone on ideas does anyone have any ideas on how to increase your chances at conceiving maybe like herbal remedies why would you need anything of couples will conceive within one year of trying to get pregnant after that visit an infertility clinic this is assuming you both know how to get a women impregnated don't laugh when clarking on the ob gyn service we heard true stories of couples unable to conceive because they did not stop using a condom or they did not know that the male sperm must be deposited and remain in the vagina after the male orgasm etc etc herbal remedies have never been shown to be effective in a scientific way so just disregard the overblown claims if you are above visit the infertility clinic now since fertility will be lower the higher your age is they can advise you what best to do  Birth control Infertility Fertility awareness Orgasm Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Emergency contraception Herbalism Pregnancy Anal sex Fertilisation Puberty Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Friends Medicine Artificial insemination Prostate cancer Masturbation Alternative medicine The Handmaid's Tale Prolactinoma Endometriosis Herpes simplex virus Domestic violence Sterilization (surgical procedure) Homeopathy Testicle Autism Human cloning Traditional Chinese medicine Vagina Douche Marriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Surrogacy Pornographic movie Premature birth Condom Gonorrhoea Adoption Menstrual cup Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cryptorchidism Safe sex Sexual dysfunction Pelvic inflammatory disease Old wives' tale Patent medicine Ejaculation St John's wort Sexual abstinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder History of sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diethylstilbestrol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma History of intersex surgery Roe v.

probablility of getting pregnant around tim of ovulation what's the probability of concieving around the time of ovulation or on the day of the day of ovulation if your partner ejaculates in you in any given month every couple has a chance of conceiving when having sex during her fertile period this of course is barring couples who have fertility problems the most fertile days are the days right before ovulation the day of ovulation and the day after are slightly less the most fertile day of the month is the day before ovulation occurs the reason for this is because the egg's lifespan is so short it only lives for hours after its release sperm on the other other hand can live for up to days inside you if the conditions are right if the conditions aren't right sperm only lives a couple of days in any case the more sperm you have in there waiting when that egg is released the better your chances hope this helps good luck  Fertility awareness Infertility Menstrual cycle Birth control In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Pregnancy Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Puberty Ovum Oral sex Parthenogenesis Twin Miscarriage Flowering plant Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Ovary Homosexuality and medical science Polycystic ovary syndrome Orgasm Sexual abstinence Marriage Niddah Abortion debate Estrus cycle Multiple birth Sperm Whale Strap-on dildo Conifer cones Moss Ejaculation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Old wives' tale Female reproductive system (human) Spider Sterilization (surgical procedure) Penis Intersexuality Semen Octopus History of sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ploidy Endometrium Cryptorchidism Social rule Human Pornographic movie Man Gamete Tsetse fly Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Hermaphrodite Civil unions in the United Kingdom Sex Male reproductive system (human) Natural family planning Premature ejaculation Terry Nichols Doomsday argument Pregnancy test Life expectancy Edward's syndrome Drosophila melanogaster Chimera (genetics) Marchantiophyta Ovarian cyst Death Human cloning Adoption Spermatozoon Mountain Gorilla Religion and sexuality Epididymis Sexual dysfunction X chromosome American lobster Nile crocodile Testicle Alternation of generations Endometriosis Foreskin Luck Pachypodium bicolor Flower Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Breastfeeding Non-human animal sexuality Infantilism Ra (board game) Chicken Fertilizer Masturbation

any input on how to keep pregnancy cravings and appetite under control my whole theory is that cravings are your bodys way of telling you what you need take your vitamins this helps but if your craving somthing like chocolate try fruit if it doesn't work try cerial sometimes it seemed i would crave chocolate just because i wanted milk it's weird but as far as controlling them eating well and taking vitamins help but your still going to crave things good luck  Folic acid Vitamin C Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding Vitamin Nutrition Guinea pig Kit Kat Coeliac disease Chocolate Food Veganism Anorexia nervosa Atkins Nutritional Approach Fruitarianism Like Water for Chocolate EastEnders Brain Piccolo Junior Saga Garlic Gautama Buddha Vegetarianism Cuisine of the Philippines Tocopherol Morning sickness Alcoholics Anonymous Conker's Bad Fur Day Yoghurt Vitamin D Herpes simplex virus Omega-3 fatty acid Linus Pauling Dieting Retinol Human skin color Drug addiction Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Gastroesophageal reflux disease Rat Park Mango "Weird Al" Yankovic Marilyn Monroe Soul Anemia Flavonoid Stomach cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breakfast Original sin Cake Old wives' tale Milk Antioxidant Carpal tunnel syndrome Buddhism Janet Jackson Ron Weasley Rickets Multiple sclerosis Acne Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Hunger Hamster Breast milk Osteoporosis Economics Addiction Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Riboflavin Cookie Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Forrest Gump Hey Arnold!

i'm just curious about the chances a woman would have to become pregnant if she had unprotected sex and then started her period a day later as usual with no changes to her normal flow and if she was pregnant would she already show signs less than two weeks later me and my friend were debating this and i'm on the side that she couldn't be pregnant and less than weeks is way too early to have morning sickness or what not unless it's a phantom pregnancy d the chances she could be pregnant are extremely slim if she had a normal period following the sex if it was a light or an abnormal period then the chances are even higher because it may have not been a period at all it may have been spotting which can occur with ovulation or break though bleeding two weeks after sex is not to early to experiance pregnancy symptoms even morning sickness have her take a test to be sure hth  Pregnancy Obstetrics Fertility awareness Turner syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Premature birth Cephalic disorder In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Stroke Ovarian cancer Diabetic retinopathy Pregnancy test Endometrial cancer Infertility Emergency contraception Abortion Twin Prolactinoma Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Anemia Morning sickness Psoriasis Estrus cycle Cytomegalovirus Pelvic inflammatory disease Ectopic pregnancy Cancer Prenatal diagnosis Folic acid Ovulation Birth control Stillbirth Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Urinary incontinence Thalidomide Hyperemesis gravidarum Schizophrenia Multiple sclerosis Anal sex Traumatic brain injury Gynecologic hemorrhage Radiation poisoning Von Willebrand disease Neighbours Acute myelogenous leukemia Ovarian cyst Androgen insensitivity syndrome Atrial septal defect Oral sex Stomach cancer AIDS Hepatitis C Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Diabetes mellitus Progesterone Big Brother UK series 6 Haloperidol Coeliac disease Ebola Vitamin C Autism Duchenne muscular dystrophy Hypoglycemia Seizure Spina bifida Cardiac arrhythmia Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Hearing impairment Sexual dysfunction EastEnders Breastfeeding Decompression sickness Friends Malaria Breech birth Sex assignment Sex Pistols Narcolepsy Sex and the City Psychosis Anencephaly Intelligence quotient Human height Sex education Chlamydia First aid Teenage pregnancy Knots Landing Placental abruption

basal thermometer where can i buy one and what it supposed to be my body temperature how do i know i'm ovulating you can get a basal body temperature thermometer at any drugstore cvs walgreens etc or even wal mart of target they read to the hundredth degree and usually have very brief instructions on charting your cycle a great website to check out is www fertilityfriend com they have a charting course to help you learn about your cycle if you have time and want to know more about how everything works a great book is taking charge of your fertility by toni weschler she explains everything basically you start temping on the first day of your period and you also check the cervical fluid that is present at your vaginal opening each day you need to take your temp at the same time everyday to be consistent and it needs to be taken first thing up on waking up before you go to the restroom and after a solid block of at least hours of sleep if possible you don't have a normal body temperature every woman varies but you will find what is normal for you then as ovulation draws near your fluid will become stretchier and resemble raw eggwhites and you won't know you ovulated until after it happens the day after you ovulate your temp will be degrees higher than the previous temp or could be even more the temps each day after that will stay at a higher range than the temps before ovulation then when your period starts you'll see the temp drop back down to pre ovulation range charting helps you pinpoint when you ovulate so that the next month you'll know when to start trying your cervical fluid is a big key to when you'll ovulate also try picking up ovulation predictors at the drugstore which you pee on they look for a certain hormone in your urine called lh which indicates ovulation is about to happen you can use this in conjunction with charting good luck  Menstrual cycle Ovulation Temperature Puberty Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Thermoregulation Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Ovarian cyst Birth control Emergency contraception Pregnancy STS-62 Tide Prostate cancer Dialysis Estrus cycle Progesterone Superconductivity CPU cache Infertility Niddah Medical prescription Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovarian cancer Water (molecule) Social rule Carpel Pregnancy test Estradiol Flowering plant Flower Endometriosis Gynaecology Androgen insensitivity syndrome Carburetor Obstetrics Cervical cancer Thermal power station Toilet Kidney Traumatic brain injury Endometrial cancer Liquid crystal Hypoglycemia HIV test Extreme Programming Human chorionic gonadotropin Conifer cones Menstrual cup Penis BZFlag Human height Degree Fahrenheit Glucocorticoid Testicle The Star Wars Holiday Special Cat Sleep Species In Search of Lost Time Hyperthermia Breastfeeding Solar variation Vacuum Poker jargon Viscosity Fruit Knife Arizona Growth hormone Apollo 13 USS Tunny (SS-282) House Mouse Betting (poker) R.

could i be pregnant is this scenario plausible i have been having what i call mexican jumping beans with my right ovary twitching i have pcos so i dont get reguular periods and it has been difficult getting pregnant my husband and i had sex at about am right before i peed then after wards for the hell of it i took a pregnancy test peeing again within minutes from the last time the first line was clear the second was there but very light so we went and bought another test once again being impatient as soon as i got home i peed and took the new test within no more then from the last time this time the first line was clear but there was no second line i was thinking the because i had peed so close together after peeing normally all day could the pregnancy hormone be so low in my urine that it was able to register in the nd test please only serious answers i peed right before we had sex i know that i am not pregnant from this time im not stupid we have been trying for years i am asking about the hormone level being to low because i had peed so much in such a short amount of time you can't get pregnant that quickly after sex so if you are pregnant it would be from an earlier time the best way to check would be to book an appointment with your doctor whose tests will be more accurate or some chemists will do a test for you with a sample of your pee edit i didn't call you stupid i answer questions with the details i feel others searching for answers may want to know as well as i said asking a doctor or pharmacist is the best way to get an accurate result there is no need for you to be offensive  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Breastfeeding Pregnancy test Endometriosis Human chorionic gonadotropin Puberty Hypoglycemia Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome In vitro fertilisation HIV test Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Tour de France Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Sleep Prenatal diagnosis Marilyn Monroe Chronic fatigue syndrome Biology and sexual orientation Growth hormone treatment Gender identity Turner syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Birth control Penis Lance Armstrong Prolactinoma Coffee Sex assignment Emergency contraception Folic acid Big Brother UK series 6 Caffeine Gamma ray burst Age of the Earth GED Phthalates Sunscreen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Teenage pregnancy Rabbit Diabetes mellitus One Tree Hill (TV series) Insulin History of intersex surgery Transsexuality Sexual differentiation Normal distribution Family Feud Sex education Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Diabetes insipidus Science Singlish Urine Sexual orientation Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Vitamin C Soap opera 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Medicine Cancer Ovary Ovarian cancer Methamphetamine Growth hormone deficiency Ben Johnson (athlete) Satanic ritual abuse Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Hyperprolactinaemia Urinalysis Kidney Spina bifida Sonic the Hedgehog Lou Gehrig Endometrial cancer CPU cache Guinea pig El Chavo del Ocho The Catcher in the Rye The nature of God in Western theology Laura Schlessinger Human skin color Homosexuality and transgender Shit Benzene Software testing

could this be possible an interesting point was put before me today me and my so have been ttc for months now with no luck my daughter was conceived whilst i was on the pill i have a tendancy to forget to take it so my friend told me to go back on the pill to get pregnant as you are most fertile once you stop or forget to take it according to her im sceptical as to whether or not this would work but it is an interesting point anyone else know if this is true could it work i think that's backwards thinking if you are trying to conceive you wouldn't take birth control not everyone is fertile immediately after stopping the pill in fact some women take months to get back on schedule stopping and starting the pill can interfere with your cycles and i wouldn't risk it also remember that no two pregnancies are alike just because you had a happy accident the first time on the pill that doesn't mean it will happen again good luck  Oral contraceptive Birth control Friends Knots Landing Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception EastEnders Childbirth Abortion debate Depo Provera Kodocha Endometriosis Infertility In vitro fertilisation Humphrey Bogart Neighbours Folic acid Theory of conduct Apollo 8 Philosophical skepticism Days of our Lives Miscarriage David Hume Toronto Transit Commission Religion and abortion Marilyn Monroe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Code 46 Psoriasis Good Morning, Vietnam Ectopic pregnancy Eddie Guerrero Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Guinea pig Incarnations of Immortality Reservoir Dogs Sexual abstinence Spina bifida The Death Gate Cycle Caffeine Tocopherol The Star Wars Holiday Special Twin Pok__mon Live!

specific answer aboout mirena birth control ok i get really emotional about a week to days before my period but the dr explained that mirena the iud the bc i'm supposed to get next week will go straight to my uterus and not in my bloodstream at all and eventually i won't even get my period question is will i still get emotional around the time i normally get my period thanks yes this is not going to change your hormones at all the estrogen that it releases will not go past your uterus and will act to stop cramping and lessen your period it's not like any of the pills which work by changing your body levels of hormones you will still be ovulating which will still release the same hormones as it does without the iud which will trigger the hormones that makes you emotional hope this answered your question  Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Endometriosis Birth control Fertility awareness Intrauterine device Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Ovulation Estrus cycle Urinary incontinence Hormone Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Androgen insensitivity syndrome Signal transduction Pregnancy Progesterone Ectopic pregnancy Estradiol Cancer Homosexuality and transgender Ovary Hormone replacement therapy Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual reproduction Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion Glucocorticoid Childbirth Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Growth hormone Morning sickness Obstetrics Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sexual orientation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Testosterone Growth hormone treatment Nutrition Luteinizing hormone Depo Provera Sleep Sex assignment Heterosexuality Dysmenorrhea Intersexuality History of intersex surgery Traumatic brain injury Acne Secondary sex characteristic Endocrinology Gallstone Breast cancer Gynaecology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometrial cancer Breastfeeding Anabolic steroid In vitro fertilisation Endometrium Thyroid Delayed puberty Alanis Morissette Gynecologic hemorrhage Tour de France Sadism and masochism Androgen Orgasm Oxytocin Stomach cancer Chemotherapy Swyer syndrome Dehydroepiandrosterone Baldness Vitamin D Autoimmune diseases Amenorrhoea Turner syndrome Osteoporosis Estrogen Tocopherol Cryptorchidism Panic attack Antidiuretic hormone Female reproductive system (human) Ovarian cancer Pregnancy test Motivation Clinical depression Non-human animal sexuality Uterine fibroids Blood sugar Gynecomastia Cholesterol Niddah

question about conceiving me and my hubby have been trying to conceive for going on months i have had pain in my ovaries and abnormal bleeding so i got checked out and was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and recieved antibotics so now the pain is gone and bleeding is back normal my question is would this have effected me not getting pregnant because i got an ultrasound done to my ovaries and the doctors said everything looks normal and please no rude answers thanks alot hi there bacterial vaginosis is basically a vaginal infection this would have nothing to do with your reproductive organs and being fertile so the fact that you've not gotten pregnant in months has nothing to do with a vaginal infection the average couple can take up to a year to conceive so at months you are still well within the norm you could try an ovulation predictor kit an opk will tell you when you are fertile using one will confirm you ovulate and confirm you are having sex precisely at ovulation i would try it for at least one cycle see how you like it it's good you cleared up your vaginal infection because while it doesn't impede fertility it can cause problems in pregnancy good luck  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Infertility Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Obstetrics Stomach cancer Ovarian cyst Childbirth Gonorrhoea Ectopic pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometrial cancer Gynaecology Ovary Estrus cycle Progesterone Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Sexual intercourse Abortion Ovulation Autism Sex assignment Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chlamydia Anal sex Cancer Guinea pig Female reproductive system (human) Prenatal diagnosis Cervical cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Cephalic disorder AIDS Urinary incontinence Intersexuality Medical analysis of circumcision Carpel Habitual abortion Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Sexual dysfunction Emergency contraception Coeliac disease Premature birth Intersex surgery Flowering plant Amenorrhoea Strap-on dildo Pneumonia Oral sex Multiple sclerosis Leukemia Pregnancy test Depo Provera Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breech birth Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Medicine HIV test Tobacco smoking Placental abruption Herpes simplex virus Human chorionic gonadotropin Estradiol Sexual abstinence Tsetse fly Cirrhosis Human sexuality Intact dilation and extraction Flower Breastfeeding Endocarditis Malaria Gynecologic hemorrhage Hepatitis C HIV Spina bifida Psoriasis History of intersex surgery First aid Diabetes mellitus Crohn's disease Diabetic retinopathy Bipolar disorder Vulvovaginal health

if you concieve the day before your period will it show up on a pregnancy test the next day the box says it will tell you from teh first day of your missed period okay let's start from the beginning ovulation dictates when your period is due if you ovulate on time then yes the box is correct your period would be due as scheduled and yes you would be able to take a test that day and get an accurate result however if you ovulate late your period would then be late too and in that case if you test the day your period would normally be due your test would not be accurate if you ovulate late you would then have to recalculate when your next period is due and then test on that day technically if you conceive the day before your period is anticipated that would mean you ovulated weeks later than expected and therefore you should now test two weeks later for pregnancy for the record a woman's menstruates about days after ovulation give or take a day in some cases good luck  Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Niddah In vitro fertilisation Estrus cycle Emergency contraception Ovulation Ovarian cyst Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive Infertility Gynecologic hemorrhage Abortion Sexual abstinence Birth control Progesterone Multiple birth Miscarriage Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Gonorrhoea Premenstrual stress syndrome Ovarian cancer Drug test Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Obstetrics Female reproductive system (human) HIV test Breastfeeding Estradiol Software testing Soap opera Twin Human chorionic gonadotropin Prenatal diagnosis 2005 English cricket season Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Flowering plant Debugging International cricket in 2005 Turner syndrome Premature birth Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Billboard Hot 100 Puberty Game programming Endometrial cancer History of sex Social rule Cephalic disorder Maya calendar Anemia Gregorian calendar Compiler optimization Reliability engineering Ovary Aortic dissection Medical record Spina bifida MTV2 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Collision detection Hebrew calendar Pearson's chi-square test Quicksort Australian cricket team STS-61 Menstrual cup USS Chicago (CA-136) Gravity Probe B Gynaecology UK Singles Chart Cytomegalovirus Fertilisation Ken Jennings George W.

if you have no cervical mucus around ovulation could u still ovulate i havent had any cervical mucus for the past periods ive been to the doctors and they dont see why i shouldnt be ovulating without the mucus is there a chance ive still been ovulating hi there please do not use raw egg whites as a lubricant raw food carries bacteria such as salmonella and regardless of how salmonella is introduced into your body you run the risk of poisoning robitussin does not produce fertile cervical mucous what it does is thin out hostile cervical mucous mucous that is too thick so that sperm can survive longer some doctor believe this some don't not having cervical mucous does not mean you do not ovulate some women see no changes at all to their cm during their fertile period however plenty of fertile cervical mucous provides an environment for sperm to thrive so that they live longer in your reproductive tract without fertile cm sperm lives anywhere from hours to days with fertile cm sperm can live from days i would recommend buying an ovulation predictor kit and using it for one cycle start having sex every other day on the day you start testing on the day you get a positive have sex that day and every day for days after using an opk will ensure two things you are ovulating and you are having sex during ovulation repeat each cycle to help you conceive if you like how it works if you need more tips on using opks let me know and i can give you more suggestions if you need extra lubricant during your fertile time try pre seed it's a lubricant designed for baby making sex and is sperm friendly do not use other lubricants as they are known to kill sperm good luck  Menstrual cycle Birth control Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Gonorrhoea Oral contraceptive Infertility Pregnancy Emergency contraception Sexual reproduction Cystic fibrosis Cervix Semen Puberty Mucus Earthworm Flowering plant Prostate cancer Oral sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Moss Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate Niddah Cervical cancer Estradiol Seed Fertilisation Ovary Medical analysis of circumcision Menstrual cup Polycystic ovary syndrome Miscarriage Ovum Colorectal cancer Foodborne illness Egg (food) Bird Female reproductive system (human) Coeliac disease Diaphragm (contraceptive) Reproduction Spider Cancer Condom Sexual abstinence Flower American lobster Progesterone Housefly Human papillomavirus Bee Common cold Fruit Estrus cycle Whale Cat Alternation of generations Soil life Biodiesel Twin Safe sex Vagina Strap-on dildo Ploidy Conifer cones Sex Hydrochloric acid Jam (TV series) Endometrial cancer Digenea Vitamin C Edward's syndrome Escherichia coli O157:H7 Man AIDS Urinary incontinence Bacteria Slug Lymphogranuloma venereum Carbon dioxide Chimera (genetics) Anal sex Biodiversity Organic farming Endometriosis Human sexual behavior Ovarian cyst Queen bee Sperm Whale

can i get pregnant can i get pregnant if im infertile i suppose to start my cycle in a day infertile means that you are unable to conceive however in most cases infertility can be treated with some sort of medical intervention making fertility possible it would depend on your specific situation as to whether medical intervention would help you or not go back to the doctor who diagnosed you as infertile and get more information about your case or seek a second opinion good luck  Infertility Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy Endometriosis Roe v.

my husband and i want to have a baby i need to lose a few pounds but what is the point when you will put on weight with a baby anyway anyone else been advised to lose weight before trying to conceive but hasn't and just gotten pregnant any complications they say it is harde to conceive when a woman is over weight but i agree with you about losing weight just to put it back on i was a bit overweight when i got pregant with my second child and i had no complications ecept for it is harder to lose the extra extra weight after giving birth but sometimes different people canhave different problems like oyu could develop diabetes or the child could be born with different health problems too i wouldnt stress too much about it if oyu are just a few pounds overweight i dont think it is a biggie but if your say pounds overweight try a lower calorie diet and eat tons of veggies and fresh fruits doing this will help you lose weight and maintain a steady weight and prepare you for eating right when you do actually become pregnant good luck and bless you  Obesity Breastfeeding Binge eating disorder Atkins Nutritional Approach Premature birth Childbirth Coeliac disease Anorexia nervosa Pregnancy Folic acid Guinea pig Body mass index Vegetarianism Hyperglycemia Low-carbohydrate diet Prenatal diagnosis In vitro fertilisation Birth weight Hamster Milk Diabetes mellitus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Veganism Egg (food) Hypoglycemia Weight training Fecal incontinence Nutrition Weight loss Kodocha Calorie restriction Domestic rabbit Dialysis Hamburger Friends Obstetrics Ton Tocopherol Miscarriage Infertility Oral contraceptive Gastric bypass surgery Hypertension Abortion Raw food diet Car safety Spina bifida Human cloning Birth control Anchor Cytomegalovirus Money Dick Gregory Fasting Equine conformation Romulus and Remus South Beach diet Boston Public Olive oil The Notorious B.I.G.

possible to conceive on cd my menstrual cycle usually lasts around days is it possible to conceive on cd last month menstrual cycle lasts days but this month we did it on cd is it possible i would highly suggest purchasing the clearblue easy digital ovulation kit which can be bought at target for instead of which is at most retail shops this digital kit has tests which you pee on every morning preferrably in the afternoon time and if you're about to ovulate hours it will show you a digital smiley face if you're not about to ovulate then it will just show you a circle the test detects lh surge which is a hormone that is at it's top peak when you're about to ovulate release the egg once you see that smiley face you should have sex within hours sperm can stay in your body anywhere from days obviously this depends on both partners' health also the reason i would suggest this digital test rather than other tests in the market is because the other aren't digital you have to kind of guess yourself by looking at pink lines if you're okay with that then you can purchase the first response ovulation kit it's cheaper and has more tests but it's not digital check out the clearblue easy digital opk http www clearblueeasy com digitalovul also i've read that before you have sex it's good for the male to drink coffee about min because the sperm are more jumpy and can get to the egg faster especially the y sperm boy sperm good luck and baby dust to you  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Puberty Pregnancy Ovulation Infertility Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Prostate cancer Niddah Androgen insensitivity syndrome Emergency contraception Pregnancy test Estrus cycle Sexual intercourse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Drosophila melanogaster Ovum Hard disk Sexual reproduction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma HIV test Urinary incontinence Breast cancer Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia RFID Orgasm Airsoft IPod Gender role Sears Holdings Corporation Endometrium Sea-Monkey The Beach Boys Transsexuality Endometriosis Sexual abstinence Female reproductive system (human) Abortion debate Progesterone Target Corporation Digital photography Wal-Mart History of Test cricket (to 1883) IBM PC compatible Game show Human chorionic gonadotropin Anal sex Coffee Intersexuality German car number plates Social rule The Chemical Brothers Billboard Hot 100 Cannabis cultivation Neopets Octopus card Ovarian cyst Smiley Smile Paragliding Friends Obstetrics Fasting Sterilization (surgical procedure) STS-59 $ale of the Century Commodore 64 UK Singles Chart Oral sex Credit card Laserdisc Collision detection Cheating in Counter-Strike Illegal drug trade Pornographic movie Artificial insemination Miscarriage Sesame Street Daylight saving time Sundial The Amazing Race Cryptorchidism PlayStation Portable Marriage Biodiesel Earthworm Organic food Fertilisation Only Fools and Horses Nintendo DS Hyperinflation Human sexual behavior

i am trying to conceive can i eat sushi i have already quit everything else that is bad during pregnancy someone please tell me that this is ok what do doctors suggest what about tiny pieces of fish like in sushi rolls thanks for any advice it's fine to eat sushi when you're pregnant or trying to conceive as long as any raw fish used to make it has been frozen beforehand this is because occasionally fish contain small worms which could make you ill if they are still alive when you eat the fish freezing kills worms and makes raw fish safe to eat lots of the sushi sold in shops is bought in already made not made at the shop this type of sushi should be fine to eat because if a shop or restaurant buys in ready made sushi the raw fish used to make it must have been frozen at minus c for at least hours but if a shop or restaurant makes its own sushi on the premises the fish might not have been frozen if you're concerned ask the staff if you make your own sushi at home freeze the fish for at least hours before using it you can eat most types of fish when you're pregnant or breastfeeding eating fish is good for your health and the development of your baby but you should avoid some types of fish and limit the amount you eat of some other types when you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant you shouldn't eat shark swordfish or marlin you should also limit the amount of tuna you eat to no more than two tuna steaks or four medium size cans of tuna a week this is because these fish contain more mercury than other types of fish the amount of mercury we get from food isn't harmful for most people but if you take in high levels of mercury when you're pregnant this could affect your baby's developing nervous system when you're breastfeeding you don't need to avoid shark swordfish or marlin or limit the amount of tinned tuna you eat there is no need to limit the amount of white fish you eat when you're pregnant or breastfeeding apart from shark and marlin  Breastfeeding Fishing Swordfish Oily fish Healthy eating Japanese cuisine Pregnancy Conveyor belt sushi Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarianism RuneScape skills Fish and chips Childbirth Cuisine of Denmark Foodborne illness Food Ramen Hamburger Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Egg (food) Angling French cuisine Tofu Folic acid Thimerosal Shark German cuisine Salmon Bento Whaling Vitamin C Birth control Kosher foods Coeliac disease Tsukiji fish market Stomach cancer Guinea pig Escherichia coli O157:H7 Friends Veganism RuneScape locations Tuna Coffee French fries Finding Nemo Abortion debate Tooth Customs and etiquette of Japan Sashimi Charmed Oceanic Whitetip Shark Common Fisheries Policy Pizza Hypoglycemia Hamster EastEnders Insulin Pacific saury Milk Nutrition Economy of Maldives Fugu Health insurance Prolactinoma Fish Jaws (film) Mercury (element) In vitro fertilisation RuneScape economy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuisine of the Philippines Menstrual cycle Anorexia nervosa Wasabi Bottlenose Dolphin Tobacco smoking Raw food diet Great White Shark Albacore Cantonese cuisine Whale Premature birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dairy Taiwanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Sauerkraut Taboo food and drink Urinary incontinence One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish Stuttering Restaurant Boom Town (Doctor Who) GunBound Jackass: The Movie

cbe fertility monitor off on peak dates the cbe fertility monitor gave me a peak on cd and cd i'm sure that i ovulated on cd though i had spotting lots of cm and my temps were low all that day although not until a few hours after i had taken my temp that morning i think that i ovulated that night and i got my peak the following morning in the past when i have done opk's i've gotten a postive on the actual day that i ovulated and the day after maybe it did that again with the monitor and i ovulated late on cd so for some reason it didn't pick up my peak until the next day all the monitor did for me was confirm that i do ovulate late but i know it is not cd and probably not cd sigh my temp did jump up a bit on cd and then this morning it's up real high so i would think that shows that i did in fact already ovulate it is usually on average i would share my ff chart but am not sure how to do it here is a link to my chart http www fertilityfriend com home bdf i was off almost an hour on my temp this morning earlier so not sure how much that affects it if you are using fertilityfriend log into your chart over on the left point to the sharing button and then click home page setup at the top you will see your charting home page web address and it will be something like this this like is to my chart http www fertilityfriend com home c copy and paste your link to send to anyone you want to have your chart i'll check back tomorrow and if you could add additonal details with your chart link that would be great looking at your chart i'm saying you probably o'd on cd  HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Phishing Menstrual cycle Billboard Hot 100 Gmail Tide Web crawler HTTP cookie Common Unix Printing System World Wide Web In vitro fertilisation GameFAQs Ovulation The Emancipation of Mimi Puberty E-mail Blonde on Blonde Emergency contraception Spice Girls Pregnancy Public-key cryptography UK Singles Chart Quarashi Domain Name System Windows XP Web server E-mail spam Plame affair MD5 Ajax (programming) 1957 World Series Backstreet Boys Temperature R.

when is the best time to get pregnant me and my dude has been trying to have a baby for a year and months well its been a challange what do you think i should do even the doctor told him its a chance i guess the first question would be why did the doctor give you a chance i would start by start charting you cycles write down when you start your menstrual cycle and when it ends write down the texture of your cervical mucus egg white looking or stretchy and clear is a good indicator that you are ready to ovulate if you google fertility friends their charting software is free but it costs money to use any of the other features i use it for charting and it is great do that for months and bring it to your obgyn since you have been actively trying for a year plus the months of charting they will be able to run more tests mostly blood work and u s and try to find a better answer as to why you are not pregnant yet always remember there is always hope good luck  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Infertility Stomach cancer Extreme Programming Endometriosis Miscarriage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Polycystic ovary syndrome Estrus cycle $ale of the Century Pelvic inflammatory disease Puberty Gonorrhoea Friends Coeliac disease Wheel of Fortune Childbirth Emergency contraception Boom Town (Doctor Who) Malaria Niddah Jennifer Lopez Software testing Kodocha Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct Pregnancy test Progesterone 2000 Australian Grand Prix GED She Loves You Endometrium Social rule Flowering plant Obstetrics Kakapo Days of our Lives Menstrual cup Cervix The writing of Principia Mathematica CPU cache Press Your Luck Twin Bad Wolf Homosexuality and medical science Microsoft Ken Jennings Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Family Feud Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tsetse fly EastEnders Contract Game show Ashton-Tate UK Singles Chart Jon Secada Maya calendar Human chorionic gonadotropin Dorothy L.

what is a blighted ovum a blighted ovum happens when a fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall but the embryo does not develop cells develop to form the pregnancy sac but not the embryo itself a high level of chromosome abnormalities usually causes a woman s body to naturally miscarry many women assume their pregnancies are on track because their hcg levels are increasing the placenta can continue to grow and support itself without a baby for a short time and pregnancy hormones can continue to rise which would lead a woman to believe she is still pregnant a diagnosis is usually not made until an ultrasound test shows either an empty womb or an empty birth sac under these circumstances the woman will either have a d c done or wait and miscarry naturally hope this helps good luck  Miscarriage Pregnancy Obstetrics In vitro fertilisation Twin Menstrual cycle Ectopic pregnancy Turner syndrome Birth weight Human chorionic gonadotropin Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder Abortion debate Abortion Prenatal diagnosis Sexual reproduction Vanishing twin Childbirth Infertility Flowering plant Endometriosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mammalian embryogenesis Ovulation Cryptorchidism Ovary Placenta Hydatidiform mole Polycystic ovary syndrome Breastfeeding Emergency contraception Progesterone Amniotic sac Embryo transfer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Uterus Spina bifida Prostate cancer Chimera (genetics) Endometrial cancer Stem cell Habitual abortion Pregnancy test Female reproductive system (human) Intact dilation and extraction Meiosis Oral contraceptive Ovarian cancer Human cloning Breech birth Ovarian cyst Congenital disorder Postpartum depression Cytomegalovirus Fetus Multiple birth Morning sickness Drosophila melanogaster Anemia Intersexuality Religion and abortion Prolactinoma Human height Morphogenesis Sexual intercourse Cancer Ploidy Gonorrhoea Premature birth Edward's syndrome Diabetes mellitus Uterine fibroids Prenatal care Biology and sexual orientation Thyroid Marsupial Caesarean section Artificial womb Breast cancer Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Autism Tocopherol Folic acid Androgen Partial-birth abortion Coeliac disease Chlorophyta Acne Gynecologic hemorrhage Vaginal bleeding

how serious is it when only one ovary can be found in a woman can it be corrected or can she still have children and finally what does clinical correlation means having one ovary should have no bearing on fertility providing the remaining ovary ovulates and its corresponding fallopian tube is not blocked or having any other issues while two ovaries will alternate each month when there's two of them if you lose one the other one will take over the duties for both the idea that a woman is only fertile every other month with one ovary is a myth having one ovary cannot be corrected there's no such thing as an ovarian transplant clinical correlation means how one medical condition may relate to another condition for example the clinical correlation between obesity and heart disease would be that obesity can lead to heart disease make sense good luck  Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian cancer Ovary In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Menstrual cycle Ovulation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Intersexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral contraceptive Ectopic pregnancy Bipolar disorder Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Medicine Female reproductive system (human) Fertilisation Folic acid Pelvic inflammatory disease Sexual reproduction Obstetrics Sexual differentiation Ovarian cyst Diabetes mellitus Lupus erythematosus Emergency contraception Cancer Gynaecology Amenorrhoea Stem cell Menopause Endocrinology Carpel Atkins Nutritional Approach Fertility awareness Intersex surgery Cardiovascular disease Stomach cancer Hypercholesterolemia Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Breastfeeding Fruit Spina bifida Human sexuality National Institutes of Health Asthma Alternative medicine Electrocardiogram Autism Flowering plant Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Milk History of sex Breast cancer Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Multiple sclerosis Sterilization (surgical procedure) Organ transplant Hypertension Race in biomedicine Pharmaceutical company Atherosclerosis Delayed puberty Flower Alzheimer's disease AIDS Emphysema History of medicine Low density lipoprotein Homosexuality and transgender Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gonorrhoea Endometrial cancer History of intersex surgery Body mass index Baldness treatments Insulin resistance Homology (biology) Sexual orientation Turner syndrome Bone marrow transplant Psychosis Coronary heart disease Genetic disorder Radiation therapy Cytomegalovirus Colorectal cancer Asteraceae Growth hormone treatment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

i just found out i am pregnant from a guy that could have been using cocaine few days before conception what are the chances of the baby being not ok in panic please give me some feedback they are finding these days that cocaine is very bad obviously in ways we never knew before in some instances it can chemically alter the dna does this mean sperm are effected yes does it mean the baby will be born addicted to crack not necessarily does it mean they may be predisposed to an addictive personality maybe all in all there are so many things that drugs effect that one can just never know until years later bottom line if the sperm is abnormal more then likely the baby will be miscarried does this mean you will miscarry no but the chances of a bad sperm are increased get rid of the guy until he shows he is clean for months then consider letting homing baby's life he must stay clean and yes you could quite honestly demand he give you a drug test at random i would not deal with a guy on drugs no matter how much i loved him babies need stability financially emotionally and physically hang in there and try not to worry good luck  Miscarriage Drug abuse In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Cocaine Addiction Prostate cancer Drug addiction Illegal drug trade Cancer One Tree Hill (TV series) LSD Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alcoholism Boogie Nights Drug test Clinical depression Infantilism Anxiety Arguments for and against drug prohibition Consensual crime Infertility Narcotic Twin Pregnancy Whitney Houston Psychosis Birth control Knots Landing Prenatal diagnosis Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Panic attack Humphrey Bogart Neighbours Urinary incontinence Jam (TV series) Procrastination Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rabies Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Social rule Paroxetine Sleep Rat Park Methamphetamine Bipolar disorder Narcotics Anonymous Puberty Jon Secada Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Schizophrenia Goodness and value theory Poker jargon Androgen insensitivity syndrome Methylphenidate Dopamine Duesberg hypothesis Brave New World Days of our Lives Orgasm Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Hulk (comics) Numerology Fertility awareness Narcissism Meaning of life Equine conformation Origin belief Evil Strong Medicine Convention on Psychotropic Substances Robert Downey Jr. Childbirth Obsessive-compulsive disorder Harlem Stomach cancer Boston Public Acne Grief Charles Lee Ray Scarface (1983 film) Controlled Substances Act Withdrawal Tobacco smoking Genetic disorder Avenue Q Kurt Cobain Slot machine Human sexual behavior Health issues and the effects of cannabis Pete Doherty Health insurance Happiness Extreme Programming

can i still get pregnant okay so this may sound like a completely dumb question but my huband and i want to have a baby we have been married for almost one year and we don't use protection ever my dad physically abused me when i was young and used to punch me in the stomach really hard i am afraid that i won't be able to get prgnant i went to a doctor when i was and he just told me that my ovaries were a little enlarged also i was on birth control for almost years am i just worrying for no reason enlarges ovaries are not that uncommon i believe one of the biggest issues for you is whether or not you get your yearly exam if you don't you need to and if you do and the doc has never noticed a problem that is a good sign it sometimes takes while for bc to fully leave your system and it sometimes takes a while no matter what else to get pregnant i wouldnt say your worrying for no reason but i do recommend that you try to not worrying can hampen your efforts and make the process longer best of luck to you and your hubby and i am sorry your dad is such a jerk  Breastfeeding Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate The Fairly OddParents Piccolo Junior Saga Pregnancy Stomach cancer Kodocha EastEnders Joke Phoebe Halliwell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Back to the Future Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Boom Town (Doctor Who) Cancer Colorectal cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Menstrual cycle Abortion Knots Landing Polycystic ovary syndrome Psoriasis Anxiety Russian joke Trusted computing Ovary Ben Johnson (athlete) Childbirth Hey Arnold!

is taking ibprophen bad for implantation bleeding and cramps that accompany it i took an mg ibprophen about hours ago for the cramps i have been having i thought i started my period days early but then i thought it might be implantation bleeding because its light pink and only on the toilet paper when i wipe my cramps were like period cramps i dont do well with pain and it was also strange that all of my periods have come in the morning and this one came at pm so could this be possible implantation bleeding and if it is will that medication effect the fetus if there is a possibility that you are pregnant stay away from ibuprofen use tylenol if you have to but ibuprofen or motrin isn't safe or suggested as it can cause fetal heart defects and maternal bleeding also stay away from asprin for the same reason what you took shouldn't be a problem because the risk of defects are highest between weeks after conception and you are still rather early especially if you're just implanting if you are pregnant but stay away from it in the future tylenol is considered a safe alternative for pregnant women  Pregnancy Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Paracetamol Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Childbirth Abortion debate Stroke Folic acid Ibuprofen Congenital disorder Emergency contraception Breastfeeding COX-2 inhibitor Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chemical abortion Tocopherol Hearing impairment Urinary incontinence Fetus Premature birth Placental abruption Androgen insensitivity syndrome Migraine Progesterone Endometriosis Prenatal diagnosis Intact dilation and extraction Malaria Oral contraceptive Spina bifida Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Alzheimer's disease Acupuncture Scientology beliefs and practices Placenta praevia Stomach cancer Withdrawal Cephalic disorder Gonorrhoea Prostate cancer Birth control Breast implant Person Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Needle aspiration biopsy In vitro fertilisation Anencephaly Roe v.

advice needed i recently was diagnosed with endometriosis my grandmother had it and it took her years to get pregnant my aunt also had it and it took her years to conceive with the help of fertility drugs my husband and i are both still young he's and i'm i am ready to start trying bc i'm afraid that if i wait too long then it will just be harder how can i explain to him how serious the disease is and that if we want to have babies we need to try now he just doesn't seem to understand and keeps saying we need to wait a couple more years he doesn't seem to understand that there is a big chance it will take years to even get pregnant he expects that it will happen immediatly can anyone give me some advice i am not trying to force him into anything until he is ready but i don't think he understands me please help nice answers only i'm not trying to make him want babies he does want them but he thinks we will be pregnant the first month i'm trying to explain that there is a possibility that it will be years so we don't wait years and then it takes more to have kids i was diagnosed with this disease and i do have symptoms i also have endo i have been suffering for four years luckily i have a wonderful partner who understands that we will probably not have children of our own because i may not be able have them and also because i hesistate to pass the disease along to my kids but if you want to have children it is better to start trying early i would share as many stories with your husband from other woman with endo and also encourage him to understand the disease as much as possible because it will help you both in the long run there are lots of books and other materials to help women understand their condtion and often they have sections devoted to helping explain the conditions to loved one's i would look for those also you could take him with you to gyn and maybe the dr could help him understand also you should keep in mind that you might get pregnant easily so don't start until you are for sure ready for success  Endometriosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Knots Landing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Neighbours Jon Secada Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Schizophrenia Survivor (novel) Friends Marriage Melanie Wilkes Hearing impairment Autism Sant Thakar Singh Medicine Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sex and the City Time Out of Mind Crohn's disease Abortion debate EastEnders Prenatal diagnosis Phoebe Halliwell Shaggy dog story Psoriasis Transactional analysis Asperger syndrome Jam (TV series) Malaria Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clinical depression Humphrey Bogart Miss Saigon Dissociative identity disorder Fertility awareness Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Richard Feynman Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Smoking Room Asthma Social rule Miscarriage Characters of Lost Birth control Theory of conduct Bipolar disorder Anorexia nervosa Expert system In vitro fertilisation Turner syndrome Simone Weil Charmed Cytomegalovirus Cliff Richard John Lennon Pelvic inflammatory disease Traumatic brain injury Pitaten Ludwig Wittgenstein AIDS The Beach Boys Baby Blues Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Human cloning Fibromyalgia Breast cancer Guinea pig Addiction Homosexuality and medical science Multiple sclerosis Carolina Panthers Coming of Age (TNG episode) Moral Politics Horus Narcolepsy A Course In Miracles Generation Y Kimi Finster Infantilism Ayyavazhi mythology The Inside Church of Christ, Scientist Tobacco smoking Eugenics

pregnancy tests confusing i took a pregnancy test that read positive about days before my missed period i am days late and took another one today and it read negative i feel pregnant and am having some of the symptoms how long can you keep testing negative before it shows up positive a negative result can mean that you are not pregnant you took the test too early or you took the test wrong pregnancy tests vary in their sensitivity how soon they can detect the hormone hcg and you may not have given your body enough time to produce enough hcg hormones that will show up on the test also if you let a test sit for too long after the instructions on the box tell you the test is invalid it is best to follow the instructions and wait until you have missed a period before taking the test some women show up accurately on a test the day they miss a period while others may not show up positive until weeks after a missed period we encourage women to test after a missed period if the result is negative they should wait a week and test again if a normal period has not started http www americanpregnancy org gettingpregnant pregnancyfaq htm  Pregnancy Pregnancy test Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Miscarriage Prostate cancer HIV test Obstetrics Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion Breast cancer Coeliac disease Oral contraceptive Human sexual behavior Gonorrhoea Prolactinoma Polycystic ovary syndrome Endometriosis Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder Haloperidol Hypoglycemia Birth control Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spina bifida Diabetes mellitus Psoriasis Guinea pig In vitro fertilisation Clinical depression Anemia Ben Johnson (athlete) Human height Ectopic pregnancy Transsexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone treatment Abortion debate Progesterone Insulin Folic acid Ovarian cancer Chemical abortion Hyperprolactinaemia Ovarian cyst Tocopherol Blood type Twin Aortic dissection Diabetic retinopathy Child sexuality Puberty Hypertension Breech birth Sharon Tate Childbirth Antiphospholipid syndrome Cryptorchidism Postpartum depression False negative Morning sickness Oscilloscope Neighbours Autism CPU cache Endometrial cancer Falsifiability Chronic fatigue syndrome Thyroid SAT Pedophilia Tour de France Debugging Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Group A streptococcal infection Gender role RISC Friends Cardiac stress test Emergency contraception Paget's disease of bone Narcolepsy Pelvic inflammatory disease Acne Sleep Heartworm Stroke STS-62 Pornographic movie Pneumonia Atherosclerosis Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone deficiency

when should i take a hpt i had my last period on july th and took an opk with positive results from the this past cycle was days when should i test a pregnancy test detects the presence of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin hcg in your blood or in your urine hcg is produced in the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining and builds up rapidly in your body in the first few days of pregnancy most doctors recommend that you wait until the first day of your missed period before taking a home pregnancy test a missed period is usually one of the first signs of pregnancy this is usually around two weeks after conception however some tests are more sensitive and more expensive than others and can be taken earlier concentrations of hcg are reported in milliinternational units miu or amounts equal to th of an iu per milliliter a pregnancy test with a sensitivity of iu l is more sensitive than one with iu l a blood test administered by your doctor is more sensitive than the early home tests and can be taken between seven and twelve days after you conceive it is possible that these tests can be done too early and show a false negative result if you receive a negative result and still do not start your period another test should be done home tests are very accurate around when used correctly some kits come with two tests because mistakes do happen if you take a test too early you may get a false negative when the test says you are not pregnant but you are your body needs time for the hormone to rise to a high enough level to be detected in a test if the test comes back negative but you still think you could be pregnant wait a few days and try again false positives when the test says you're pregnant but you're not are possible but rare a positive pregnancy test is a pretty good indication that you are pregnant http www americanpregnancy org gettingpregnant takingapregnancytest html  Menstrual cycle HIV test Fertility awareness Miscarriage Childbirth Drug test Cytomegalovirus Cryptorchidism Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coeliac disease Puberty Prenatal diagnosis Blood type Diabetes mellitus Twin Insulin Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Hyperprolactinaemia Hormone Androgen Oral contraceptive Hypospadias Birth control Turner syndrome Hydatidiform mole Ovulation Breastfeeding Cephalic disorder Amniotic sac False negative Mammalian embryogenesis Tocopherol Thyroid Pregnancy (mammals) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Growth hormone treatment Hypertension Gonorrhoea Placenta False positive Abortion debate Morning sickness Emergency contraception Breast cancer Religion and abortion Cyanide Growth hormone deficiency Cardiac stress test Anemia Diabetes insipidus Estrus cycle Psoriasis Diabetic retinopathy Haloperidol Endometrial cancer Rabies Aortic dissection Chronic fatigue syndrome Ovarian cancer Endometrium Growth hormone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human height Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Guinea pig Infertility Colorectal cancer Blood alcohol content Spina bifida Kidney Pneumonia Breech birth Heartworm D-dimer Oscilloscope Malaria Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Explosive material Nutrition Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Tour de France Cancer Solar variation

if you want to help your wife get pregnant should i keep my self in her after orgasm like snuggle and cuddle while still inside her after sex for maybe to mins actually whether you stay in or pull out as long as the deposit is made she will have the same chance of getting pregnant as otherwise there is a thing called a semen pool that a woman has inside and the semen will stay there until it travels up into the cervix it doesn't matter the position although gravity does take a small toll if she were to stay lying down afterwords it would make a small difference but no matter the case she'll keep sperm inside until it dies in hours gross huh lol but although it is nice to stay inside once orgasm is completed it doesn't help or harm good luck with conceiving  Sexual intercourse Oral sex Semen Strap-on dildo Orgasm Nocturnal emission Abortion debate Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cup Penis Prostate cancer Pornographic movie Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Physical intimacy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Cervix Artificial insemination History of sex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Zoophilia The Inside Ejaculation Katelyn Faber Human sexual response cycle Anal sex Condom Old wives' tale Sexual reproduction Ocean's Twelve Social rule Vagina Poker jargon Obstetrics Oral contraceptive Safe sex Theory of conduct Male reproductive system (human) Heracles Sex toy Gross domestic product Swimming pool Richard Chase Female reproductive system (human) Sperm Whale Origin belief Androgen insensitivity syndrome Knife Gravity Fertilisation Reservoir Dogs Infertility Premature birth Swingout Religion and sexuality Gas metal arc welding Abortion Wilhelm Reich Homunculus EastEnders Sharon Tate Masters and Johnson Intact dilation and extraction Sterilization (surgical procedure) B3ta Textile manufacturing Child sexuality 10cc Human Intersex surgery Sexual abstinence Luck Human sexual behavior Internal ballistics The Amber Spyglass Equine conformation Avalanche Friends Black hole Dog training Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Genetic fingerprinting Bernard Williams Jam (TV series) Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Da Vinci Code Man Faster-than-light John Money Coitus interruptus Deep Throat (film) Microeconomics Marriage Andrei Chikatilo Clint Eastwood

bleeding badly days after misscarage is this normal first off it is not uncommon for heavy bleeding after a miscarrage if there is still tissue to expell however a woman should not saturate a heavy kotex pad in less than hour some physicians think that even this is excessive so call your doctor bleeding in excess of this warrents immediate medical attention best answer is yes there will be heavy bleeding dark with clots for a few days and it should lessen there will be lessening discharge over the next few weeks just as if the woman had delivered a baby it should not be bright red it should not have an odor and the woman should not use tampons as they can lead to serious if not fatal infection if you think that there is too much bleeding you are probably right and you wont feel at ease untill she is seen by appropriate medical personnel it never hurts to have it assessed and may give you peace of mind  Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Bleeding Traumatic brain injury Tampon Cancer Obstetrics Triage Coeliac disease Blood First aid Intravenous therapy Stomach cancer Toxic shock syndrome Menstrual cup Intracranial pressure Paracetamol Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Decompression sickness Alcoholism Pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Medicine Radiation poisoning Medical prescription Wound Gonorrhoea Tobacco smoking Coagulation Medical analysis of circumcision Psoriasis Diabetic retinopathy Rattlesnake Obstetrical hemorrhage Bruise Anemia Emergency Medical Services Aspirin Nosebleed Lung cancer Intact dilation and extraction Subdural hematoma Cirrhosis Glycogen storage disease type I Paget's disease of bone Malaria Needle aspiration biopsy Leukemia Guinea pig Hemorrhoid Myocardial infarction Sanitary towel Vitamin C Abortion Ebola Von Willebrand disease Folic acid Shock Autism Tocopherol Oral contraceptive Migraine Tourniquet Rape Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Premature birth Babe Ruth Group A streptococcal infection Female genital cutting Urine Smallpox Endometriosis Wisdom teeth Homeopathy Colposcopy Tuberculosis Marburg virus Obsessive-compulsive disorder Certified first responder Malignant melanoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Polycystic ovary syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Blood pressure Common cold Warfarin Apoplexy Fertility awareness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Crohn's disease Prolactinoma Epilepsy Acromegaly

someone please clear this ovulation thing up for me ok so i went off b c and some months ago i haven't ever tracked my ovulation cycle and i don't want to be a crazy person and take tests and temperatures every day i just don't want to be addicted to ttc anyway my cm isn't helping me determine when i am ovulating so here is my question when i am having cramps am i ovulating that day and how long from the start of the cramps to i have to have sex is cramps a good sign and about cm egg white consitancy ovulation help hi there i am totally with you on the not trying to ttc and monitoring temps etc i think that puts a strain on your sex life and because you think about babies babies and more babies it just doesn't happen regarding ovulation your most likely to ovulate mid cycle and will feel cramping in the lower abdomen either on the left or right sometimes both sides it is said that this is the likely sign that you're about to ovulate hence it'd be the best time to have sex and then every other day to allow for your mans spern to build up i guess not having enough ewcm won't help ascertain if you really are ovulating but i can give you another tip when you ovulate your cervix should change position to soft high open and wet am afraid u'd have to insert a finger for this one if you start to feel pain it would be a wise idea to keep a close check on your cervix from then onwards best wishes xx  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive Dialysis Obstetrics Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Conifer cones Gonorrhoea Good Morning, Vietnam Niddah Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Toronto Subway and RT Diving Kasparov versus The World Puberty Urinary incontinence Childbirth Anal sex First aid Cervix Kodocha Breastfeeding Estrus cycle Cramp Stomach cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Sydney Riot of 1879 Condom Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Ovarian cyst Social rule Flowering plant Pachypodium brevicaule Milton H.

telling people about pregnancy i have some friends that are having trouble conceiving i am very fortunate to be pregnant with baby and i would like to start sharing the news with people but i don't want to upset anyone is there anyone out there that has been in this situation or maybe has been on the other side of it ttc while another friend does first how should i share the news i actually have different friends that are having fertility problems i struggled with infertility it took years including failed iuis an ivf procedure finally resulted in a pregnancy in that time all of my friends who started trying after i did got pregnant and had their babies it was so hard going to each of their showers visiting them at the hospital holding their babies i was so frustrated that there was something wrong with me and it felt like i failed at something again and again i have other friends who have gone through infertility and this is a common feeling we share the thing is even though i was going through all of that i still was very happy for those who could get pregnant so i congratulated them and was genuinely happy for them i talked to them about their pregnancies and their babies although it was hard at times to do that i cried a lot it seems that because you are asking this question you must be sensitive to what they are going through they must know this and if they are good friends they will be happy for you and share in your joy just be as sensitive as possible when telling them start by saying something like i have something to tell you although i know this might be hard for you emphasize that you are hoping for them praying if you are religious and that you are there for them hoping that they too can share the same news with you someday it would help to do this in person and share hugs and maybe even a few tears if you have good friends they will be so happy for you even if it also brings a little sadness for their own situation  In vitro fertilisation Friends Pregnancy Infertility Pitaten EastEnders Boston Public Melanie Wilkes Knots Landing The Smoking Room Breastfeeding Kodocha Abortion debate Roe v.

way out of control periods am i the only one like this any suggestions why please help okay i've never had a regular period i went from the june till july with a period occasionally about once every two months it would stop for a few days it finally stopped at the end of july my next period was jan this year it lasted for weeks and then had another in march it lasted one week which is really good i finally thought everything was straightening out but i havent had a period since i've been to a couple different doctors and have had two ultrasounds done all of them say that everything came back okay and they all just want to put me on birth control the thing is i have been trying to get pregnant for over a year with no luck obviously i'm not ovualulating now if i want to become pregnant i have to ovulate but if i take birth control then i can't get pregnant besides every birthcontrol i have taken quits working for my irregular periods after a few months of taking them and then i have to switch i have been off the pill for over a year i just went to a new doctor she is much better maybe because its a girl i'm just waiting on all of my blood test and pap to come back i have an appointment in a few weeks for an ultrasound she didnt even ask me if i've took the pill or even suggest it she simply just asked if i was trying to get pregnant first hopefully i'll be baring a child in no time that's great that you found another doctor i think there are medicines out there that can help you regulate your periods and help you ovulate such as clomid and so on while you wait for your appt you can also ask an re fertility specialist you can ask one online for free to see what they recommend as well try www fertilityties com good luck  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Puberty Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cyst Obstetrics Psoriasis Endometriosis Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Folic acid Stomach cancer Tocopherol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma In vitro fertilisation Apollo 8 Prenatal diagnosis Childbirth Medical prescription Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spina bifida Ovulation EastEnders Androgen insensitivity syndrome Knots Landing The Inside Days of our Lives Malaria Medicare (Canada) The Daleks' Master Plan Antidepressant Breastfeeding Infertility Sharon Tate Physician Abortion debate Ben Johnson (athlete) Guinea pig USS Aspro (SSN-648) Gynaecology Maprotiline Alternative medicine USS Chicago (CA-136) Alois Hitler Twin USS Volador (SS-490) History of sex USS Yorktown (CV-10) Heartworm Month Coeliac disease Cryptorchidism Chemical abortion USS Alamo Ovarian cancer Blood on the Tracks Abortion Estrus cycle Neighbours Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual abstinence Pregnancy test Hypertension Spice Girls Big Brother UK series 6 Phoebe Halliwell The Contender (television series) Turner syndrome Boom Town (Doctor Who) USS Wallace L.

pregnancy symptoms hi i got my perido on june with the help of provera and it lasted about days i know that i ovulated in july and i think it couldof possibly been two times if that's possible i did not get my period on july which would have been days since my last period i am technically not too late since i haven't ever had a day cycle is it to early to take a pregnancy test i have taken two tests in the past week of which both have indicated negative however i have weird symptoms yesterday and the day before i have been very very hungry like one hour after i have eaten a breakfast that would normally hold me over my boobs feel a little harder than usual and i have noticed that i have very deep aqua blue veins on my boobs i have also noticed that the sides of my boobs hurt upon the touch my nipples also are very sensitive they seem to be a little darker than usual i dont know if this is just me being crazy or if this could in fact be signs i have a headache today help me would it be possible that the pregnancy test won't indicate pregnancy just yet also the provera was taken to cause my period to come on back in june it is not any form of birth control i had to take provera a few months ago but just because you got your period doesn't mean that you ovulated the following month if you had to take provera obviously you weren't ovulating in the previous months but if you are feeling those symptoms why not go get another test the only thing it hurts is your bank account by paying for the test  Pregnancy Fertility awareness Depo Provera Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovulation Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Childbirth Polycystic ovary syndrome Folic acid Emergency contraception Estrus cycle Psoriasis Clinical depression In vitro fertilisation The Beatles discography Cephalic disorder Breast Ovarian cancer Miscarriage Group A streptococcal infection HIV test Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diabetes mellitus Cytomegalovirus Solar eclipse Postpartum depression Endometriosis Stomach cancer Migraine Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Spina bifida Turner syndrome Progesterone Aortic dissection Elephant Blood on the Tracks EastEnders Infertility Democratic Party (United States) Narcolepsy Fecal incontinence Haloperidol Hipparchus (astronomer) Shaggy dog story Multiple sclerosis Singlish Drug test USS Chicago (CA-136) Infectious mononucleosis Hey Jude Antiphospholipid syndrome Abortion Gonorrhoea Friends Pulmonary embolism Lyme disease Procrastination Blonde on Blonde Insulin Sexual abstinence Adult attention-deficit disorder Prolactinoma Ovarian cyst Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Traumatic incident reduction Isotretinoin Ravi Shastri Nine Inch Nails USS Aspro (SSN-648) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Autism Sharon Tate Prostate cancer Thalidomide Infidels Niddah Sexual reproduction Doxepin Post-traumatic stress disorder Big Brother UK series 6 Carpenters Breast cancer Hangover Philosophical skepticism Hall & Oates Cluster headache Opportunity rover Carpal tunnel syndrome

conceiving a baby boy when are the best days of your cycle to conceive a baby boy is there anything you can do to increase your chances of conceiving a boy i have checked out the chinese gender chart but it's been wrong for previous pregnancies of friends any suggestions right for all you non believers out there there is actually medical proof that there is a way to increase your chances of having a boy if you have less sex and only have it on the day you ovulate you are more likely to have a boy if you are having lots of sex before and after ovulation then it is more likely to be a girl why well the female sperm are slower swimmers but have more stamina and will therefore take longer to get the egg but will get there male sperm are faster swimmers but dont live as long so basically if the male ones get there first but dont get in the female ones will be around longer and will take over the job if the male failes to penetrate the egg  In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cycle Infertility Puberty Pregnancy Ovulation Fertility awareness Birth control Sexual reproduction Emergency contraception Swimming Oral contraceptive Twin Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion debate Intersexuality Multiple birth Ovary Orgasm Miscarriage Sexual intercourse Friends Gender role Spider Sex assignment History of intersex surgery Oral sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Female reproductive system (human) Niddah Sex Fertilisation Infantilism Ovum Gender John Money Flower Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Housefly Dragons (Pern) Sexual abstinence Transsexuality Estrus cycle Semen Urinary incontinence Backstroke History of sex Spice Girls Parthenogenesis Premature birth Prostate cancer Effeminacy Platypus Domestic violence Pregnancy test Sexual differentiation X chromosome Breastfeeding Butterfly stroke Biology and sexual orientation Man Edward's syndrome Breaststroke Heteronormativity Hermaphrodite Atomic Kitten Pederasty Boston Public Pedophilia Transgender EastEnders Ploidy Sexual dimorphism Incest Sperm Whale Safe sex Front crawl Gay slang Conifer cones Charmbracelet Progesterone Boy Non-human animal sexuality God and gender Anal sex Estradiol Human sexual behavior Little Britain Sex and the City Stroke Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Jam (TV series) Rocko's Modern Life Obstetrics Gender-neutral language Masturbation Group sex Artificial insemination

what is the best position to concieve a girl i have two boys and we really want to try for a girl any suggestions we are looking at trying within the next mts check out the shettles method but it is not scientifically proven the method teaches that the girl sperm is slower but lives longer and the boy sperm is faster but doesn't live that long depending on your cervical fluid inside the girl sperm can possible live days so if you have sex few days before ovulation depending on the fluid inside of you the girl sperm can get to the egg if you have sex close to ovulation or on that day the faster boy sperm can get to them faster also if you use lubricant like ky jelly astroglide saliva etc this can kill the sperm i would suggest using preseed which is something like a lubricant but you insert it in your vagina minutes before sex you can check out www preseed com and if you read the posts a lot of ladies have gotten pregnant from it because preseed allows the sperm to live longer in that fluid as mentioned above the shettles method isn't proven but it's very popular so it doesn't hurt to try you can read more about it by google ing it also if you have your spouse bf drink coffee min before sex it makes the sperm swim faster another myth but it's worked for a lot of ladies more myths from the back boy because if you're about to ovulate it gets the sperm closest to the cervix so since the boy sperm are faster they're more than likely to get to the egg faster from the front girl good luck  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Birth control Sexual intercourse Puberty Sexual reproduction In vitro fertilisation Strap-on dildo Sperm Whale Condom Fertilisation Oral contraceptive Personal lubricant Ovulation Menstrual cup Prostate cancer Pornographic movie Emergency contraception Friction Spider Masturbation Pregnancy Vagina Infertility Safe sex Semen Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Niddah Abortion debate Female reproductive system (human) Urinary incontinence Vaginal lubrication Swimming Obstetrics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Child sexuality Action potential Diaphragm (contraceptive) Intact dilation and extraction Friends Human sexual behavior Cat Ovum Drug test Orgasm Sex toy Sex and the City Ovary Housefly Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Artificial insemination Shark Pitaten Spermatozoon Anal sex Intersex surgery Drosophila melanogaster George Costanza Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dialysis Internal ballistics Human Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Theory of conduct Male reproductive system (human) Archery Moss About a Boy Speed of light Electrophysiology Parachuting Little Britain Jam (TV series) Bird Coffee The Catcher in the Rye Twin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Old wives' tale Penis Something Positive Cervical cancer Whaling Earthworm Pregnancy test Freenet Tampon Gonorrhoea The Shining (film) Kurt Cobain Cervical cap Marilyn Monroe Miscarriage Motor oil Heinkel He 100 Grasshopper

how to help my wife my wife and i have been trying to have a baby for a long time and emotionally it is hard on us both what can i say or do to make it a little easier for her only you know your wife and what will help her through this but i have been ttc for years so i can give you some ideas of things that have helped me over the years it helps when my husband has hope for us for example he says things like when we have a baby instead of if we have a baby he talks to me about what he is thinking he attends all the drs appts with me and afterwards he always wants to discuss how things went asks questions and is just a part of the process in general he usually is pretty in tune to when my period is due and when i will be testing for pregnancy and he does nice things for me around that time bringing home dinner asking me to a movie bringing me flowers he doesn't get mad or fight with me when my period does come and i'm feeling crappy he just lets me complain i think you've already shown that you are a caring husband just by taking the time to find ways to help your wife  Theory of conduct Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Jam (TV series) Pregnancy Grandview, U.S.A.

basal body temperature i have just started recording my bbt each morning the instructions say to try and record it at the same time each morning but my sleeping pattern is quite unpredictable so i don't want to set my alarm to get up at each morning to take my temp however if i set it for later that am the chances are that i'll wake up earlier which is what happened yesterday like i am sitting here now wide awake and i probably won't sleep until about am is it necessary to take it around the same time every day or could i base it on how much sleep i have i e if i had hours sleep yesterday and i go to sleep at am today could i then take my temp at am which means i've had hours sleep like yesterday i am really sorry if this sounds confusing thanks for me i see a bigger difference in the number of hours i have been asleep versus the time i take it for example one morning i'll wake up at am and take it after hours of sleep then the next day i'll wake up at am after hours of sleep and the temp will be the same so for me it is the number of hours of sleep not the time of day i also take my temp vaginally to reduce cold readings from my mouth being open during the night that caused more rocky mountain temping then waking up at different times  Fertility awareness Sleep Urinary incontinence Temperature Insomnia Daylight saving time Narcolepsy Out-of-body experience Thermoregulation Shaggy dog story Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March The Amber Spyglass Siesta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Day Dream Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Paul Is Dead Canonical hours Yesterday (song) Delayed sleep phase syndrome STS-62 Lucid dreaming Cliff Richard Jet lag The Beatles discography Milton H.

trying to conceive on meds last month i took provera along with metformin for the last months for pcos and had my period on july th when will i most likely be ovulationg and when can i get a pregnancy test iv been feeling sick lately but it could be the pills and am woundering what to do and when you can figure out when you're ovulating by keeping track of how long your period is because you ovulate days before the first day of your period so if you were to always start your period on the th day of your cycle the day you start your period is considered day then you would have ovulated on day does that make sense it's pretty easy if your period is a bit less predictable like sometimes you start your period on the th day and sometime it's the th then you subtract days from both of those numbers and you get day so you would want to have sex on both of those days good luck and baby dust to you  Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Birth control Maya calendar Oral contraceptive Ovulation Progesterone In vitro fertilisation Depo Provera Estrus cycle Miscarriage Emergency contraception Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Niddah Infertility Ovarian cyst Sexual abstinence Full moon cycle Metformin Folic acid Leap year Computus Abortion debate Insulin resistance Puberty Human chorionic gonadotropin Multiple birth Conifer cones Fertilisation Apollo 8 Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetes mellitus Multiple sclerosis Gregory Goodwin Pincus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Time Napier's bones Ovarian cancer Social rule Month Obstetrics Tsetse fly Solar eclipse Endometriosis Japanese calendar Real number Premenstrual stress syndrome Hebrew calendar Autism Kodocha Calculating the day of the week Charles Darwin's illness Dominical letter Sexual intercourse Julian day Sulfonylurea Ice age Friends Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sexual reproduction Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 2000 Australian Grand Prix Saros cycle Darwin from Orchids to Variation Urinary incontinence HIV Infantilism HIV test Estradiol Ovary Knife The Beatles discography Chagas disease Oral sex EastEnders Epact ENIAC Sunspot Eclipse cycle Binary numeral system Gregorian calendar New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 USS Wahoo (SS-238) Ra (board game) Year Clock of the Long Now Luck Prolactinoma Big Brother UK series 6 IBM 700/7000 series Variable star Sharon Tate Numerology Narcissism Natural family planning

im roughly weks pregnant and everyone says that your boobs will start to hurt im not feeling it is it to early or am i lucky i know with my prior baby i had that around weeks that ended up in a mc though just so you all know i am definately pregnant dr confirmed it i was just curious i just wanted to hide till it was over cause i know it hurts every pregnancy is different i've had a twin pregnancy during which my breasts were never sore and i've had singleton pregnancies during which my breasts were sore heavy tender etc before i even missed my period to clarify weeks pregnant would mean that you ovulated conceived about a week ago as pregnancies are dated in accordance with your last menstrual period or two weeks prior to ovulation if your cycles are long and or it's known when you ovulated so at three weeks pregnant as someone else said you would not yet have missed a period in fact implantation probably would not have occurred yet or would have just occurred and it would be early to have symptoms if it's been three weeks since conception ovulation that would make you five weeks pregnant you may know all this already but i just wanted to clarify a lot of women don't know it and it can create some confusion when talking about how far along you are don't worry about the lack of soreness it means exactly nothing while i worried too at the time i've got two healthy toddlers running around the house who confirm every day that the presence absence of sore breasts means squat best of luck to you  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Obstetrics Ovulation Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Cytomegalovirus Abortion Estrus cycle Progesterone Pregnancy test Birth control Twin Polycystic ovary syndrome Puberty EastEnders Ovarian cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Childbirth Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breast Endometriosis Ovarian cyst Friends One Life to Live Melanie Wilkes Maya calendar Infertility Cephalic disorder Psoriasis Gregorian calendar Human chorionic gonadotropin Ectopic pregnancy Radiation therapy Premenstrual stress syndrome Big Brother UK series 6 Herpes simplex virus Fertilisation Sexual abstinence Niddah Rape Sharon Tate Knots Landing Ovary Breast implant Stomach cancer Breast cancer Prostate cancer Brassiere AIDS Equine conformation Abortion in the United States Gonorrhoea Spina bifida Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stroke Billboard Hot 100 Sexual intercourse Jon Secada Endometrial cancer Britney Spears Pregnancy fetishism Roe v.

big temp drop dpo ok here's what's been going on with me honest opinions only and pls dont be rude lmp day cycles o'ed around bd alot durnig fertile period temps started going up dpo dpo dpo also very tired and sick feeling dpo dpo lots of creamy cm thought this was imp dip dpo temp back up nausea headache lots of creamy cm bfn dpo not so much cm today but still creamy lotiony dpo cried over nothing and crampy but not bad dpo wartery cm it felt like af was coming but id go to br and it was just cm thought id test bfn dpo today big drop in temps taken at the same time as every other day and very sore nips for the first time today dont know why i had two drops in temp but is it common to implant this late anyone else have the same thing serious answers only please nothing different normal night's sleep same blankets same routine j w if it's af or implantation should start on moday i have no clue what my lp is where can i find out remember it is not uncommon to have one temp that is either high or low could be anything causing that do you chart your temps online and have the computer program figure out ovulation for you i don't think that day was ovulation just because your chart wouldn't be biphasic who knows what that dip was for a common misconception is that implantation always happens on dpo when in fact it is a broad range of dpo with most happening on days and here is a chart i found on a website i visit often a person on the message board posted this this table refers to clinical pregnancies progressed past weeks day of implantation dpo dpo dpo dpo dpo dpo dpo dpo chances of loss by day of implantation dpo dpo dpo dpo dpo dpo dpo don't get freaked out by that second table but it makes sense that the later the fertilized egg implants the more likely it is not to take and end in miscarriage back when i conceived my son it was a surprise so i didn't chart or anything but i know when i conceived and i had implantation spotting at like dpo and he was fine but i also heard that blood from implantation can take awhile to come out so you don't actually know when implantation takes place these differences in implantation also account for the differences in days that women are able to get a on a pregnancy test about days after implantation hcg can be detected in the urine usually also keep in mind that you can have what appears to be an implant dip and you aren't pregnant and vice versa we ovulated on the same day so i'll keep my fingers crossed for you baby dust oh and your luteal phase is the number of days from ovulation to the start of your next period you can't figure it out until you've charted a couple of months it won't ever vary by more than a day or so in an individual you need to have a luteal phase of at least days to rule out any luteal phase defect problems  Obstetrics Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Infertility Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Miscarriage Prostate cancer Progesterone Twin Social rule Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends Theory of conduct Birth control Pregnancy test Polycystic ovary syndrome Time Out of Mind Hearing impairment Breastfeeding Abortion Ovarian cancer Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Knots Landing Equine conformation Childbirth Abortion debate Temperature Prolactinoma Stroke Clinical depression Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infantilism HIV test EastEnders Group A streptococcal infection Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psoriasis Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Estrus cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometriosis Debugging Jennifer Lopez Ovarian cyst Tide Embryo transfer Ben Johnson (athlete) Ectopic pregnancy Spina bifida Cancer Big Brother UK series 6 Shaggy dog story The Contender (television series) Insulin Hypnosis The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pitaten Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Medicine Color Soul Sleeping sickness The Inside Coeliac disease Dialysis Sexual abstinence Traumatic brain injury The Beatles discography Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Extreme Programming Pneumonia Journey (band) Year of the Spider The Emancipation of Mimi The Smoking Room Dualism (philosophy of mind) Human cloning Stem cell

bought an ovulation kit and my lh surge is up had intercourse last night and did another strip and it's still up so me and fiancee are going to have relations again nite the thing is knowing this when can i test and what's the difference between ovulating and lh surge thanks hi good questions it took me a few months of playing around with the tests to get it down the lh surge occurs right before you ovulate you can test any time of day as long as you haven't peed for at least hours before sometimes i take one in the am and it is almost positive and then take another one in the afternoon and it will be very positive for example here is what i got this cycle friday darker test line but ot as dark as the control sat super dark test line sun dark test line mon light test line and according to my temps i ovulated monday so my lh surge occur days before remember that an lh surge only tells you are about to ovulate not that you did temping will confirm that so once that test is positive bd for the next couple of days good luck  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Ovulation Day Emergency contraception Conifer cones Hebrew calendar Estrus cycle Temperature Puberty Polycystic ovary syndrome Sydney Riot of 1879 Hurricane Rita Pregnancy National Football League Pregnancy test Monday Night Football Niddah Solar eclipse Birth control Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ron and Fez Tide Oral contraceptive Hurricane Wilma Friday the 13th 2003 North America blackout Daylight saving time Good Friday Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hipparchus (astronomer) STS-59 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina In vitro fertilisation Fasting Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Black Tropical cyclone Test cricket Nintendo Ovarian cyst Neopets Infertility 7 July 2005 London bombings General relativity Dominical letter Holy Week Christmas 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Joy Division (band) Experiment Phoenix, Arizona Second Battle of El Alamein Toonami American and British English differences International Date Line Gregorian calendar 21 July 2005 London bombings Time Out of Mind Operation Market Garden Soap opera The Chemical Brothers Climate of the United Kingdom Time Full moon cycle Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Astronomy on Mars Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Akuma (Street Fighter) STS-61 Ben Johnson (athlete) EastEnders Norwegian Campaign Transit of Venus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone James Hanratty Game show Planet Waves Rugby union Nuclear fallout Extreme Programming Ovarian cancer Emergency preparedness Maya calendar HIV test Drug test Weather lore Season Philosophical skepticism Sunday The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll American comic book Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Mars Samus Aran Storm surge Big Brother UK series 6 Tests of general relativity

a question about pregnancy and ivf my girlfriend and i are trying for a baby but we don't want to take any chances we feel that ivf would offer us the greatest opportunity to get pregnant rather than simply leaving it to chance has anyone had any experiences of ivf i would have thought that it's not available on the nhs but how much does it cost what's involved what are chances of a multiple birth sorry i realise i am very naive on the subject but i would really appreciate your advice thanks i have had ivf icsi cycles and iui treatments and i can tell you it is not an easy option ivf does not offer you any more opportunity to get pregnant in fact it offers at best the same chance as a natural cycle and often the chances of achieving a pregnancy are less the chance of getting pregnant during a natural cycle is approx whereas some ivf treatments only offer a to success rate if there is no medical reason for you and your gf to not be successful in achieving a natural pregnancy then i would urge you not to consider ivf and to keep trying i am one of the fortunate ones in that fertility treatment worked for me and i have a fabulous month old daughter however the emotional cost was huge my life was totally different to now i had no confidence i was miserable all of the time but trying to put on a brave face i lost friends due to my depressed state of mind this nearly cost me my marriage too i put weight on because of the drugs i couldn't face going to certain family events i had no hope at all and i could go on and on about how awful it was even now when i think back to that time in my life i could cry but to answer your questions ivf treatment is very intrusive indeed you sniff drugs for approximately weeks to down regulate you menstrual cycle this means the doctors have control over your cycle during this time you go to the clinic for regular internal scans and blood tests to see how you are responding to the drugs when your body is ready you need to inject drugs to make the ovaries produce more than follicle the sac that holds an egg again you are scanned regularly to see how things are going if you poduce too many follicles it can lead to a condition called ohss which is life threatening when the follicles are the correct size you have to inject a different drug which matures the eggs ready to ovulate hours after this injection the eggs are collected by the clinic you are awake during egg collection but drugged so you don't feel much the doctor uses an ultra sound probe and a needle to aspirate each follicle in the ovaries to find if there is an egg inside the eggs and sperm are left overnight to do the business the next day you have to phone the clinic to see how many if any have fertilised the next day you attend clinic again to have the embryos inserted this is a painless procedure which can be lovely as some clinics will show you the embryos on screen usually only embryos are inserted the next part of the treatment is the worst really you wait for almost weeks analysing every twinge ache and mood durinf this time you support your body into believing it is pregnant by inserting vaginal pessaries daily after the wait you attend clinic for a blood test to see if you have been successful each stage feels like a hurdle you need to overcome and the nurse assigned to me told me to think of treatment in stages if i down regged i could inject if i produced follicles i could have eggs collected if there were eggs they could be put with the sperm if they eggs fertilised then they would put them in me everything was if and the treatment could have quite easily have failed at any hurdle i had cycle abandoned which was horrendous there is a high chance of multiple births as embryos are put back and each one could possibly split in two to make twins at my first scan when i was pregnant was at weeks there were sacs but only one with a heart beat costs range depending on the type of treatment you need but an ivf cycle is about most people with fertility porblems can have at least cycle on the nhs we were lucky and had but it depends on where you live any way if you have got to the end of this post well done

just curious if birth control stops ovulation then why do you still get a period my understanding is that if your ovulating and you don't conceive by the end of your cycle then your uteris lining will shed causing a period but if you don't ovulate then you won't have a period right just wondering because you take pills with hormones for weeks this causes you not to ovulate on the th week you take a placebo or you don't have to take any pills when your body doesn't get the hormones it will shed the uterine lining and you have your period  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Estrus cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Progesterone Pregnancy Birth control Puberty Endometrium Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Endometriosis Infertility Ovarian cyst Acne Baldness treatments Ovarian cancer Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Niddah Human chorionic gonadotropin Childbirth Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Depo Provera Premenstrual stress syndrome Placebo Guinea pig Gynaecology Sleep Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hormone replacement therapy Oxytocin Intrauterine device Fertilisation Hormone Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Gregory Goodwin Pincus Gynecologic hemorrhage Anovulation Anabolic steroid Premature birth Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Intersexuality Nutrition Prostate cancer Luteinizing hormone Obstetrics Homosexuality and transgender Pregnancy test Ectopic pregnancy Amiodarone Cervix Kender Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cancer Gallstone Ovum Herpes simplex virus Miscarriage Carpel Placebo effect Caffeine Sexual abstinence Time Glucocorticoid Endocrinology Follicle-stimulating hormone Baldness Insulin Breech birth Sexual reproduction Syphilis Tsetse fly House Mouse The Death Gate Cycle Female reproductive system (human) Hysterectomy Fruit Red Fox Vaginal bleeding Estradiol Placebo (band) Mammary gland Sexual differentiation Flowering plant Diazepam Antidepressant Transsexuality Organic farming Uterus Moult Breastfeeding Human penis size Ben Johnson (athlete) Anopheles Tour de France

how easy is it to get a sperm count test done my partner had cancer and as a result was told he was sterile he only has one testicle now and the other was radiated as otherwise would have got it there too just the sad hopeful part of me that thinks maybe some of it has recovered or something can you just go to the doctors to get your sperm count tested or a special clinic thanks a fertility doc can do it no problem test results are back in a few days have your husbands sperm morphology tested as well that test is to show how many of the sperm are actually good sperm nicely shaped and are strong enough to break thru the egg to fertilize a normal man has good sperm out of every my hubby has only good sperm out of every so that is an issue for us his sperm count is fine so if we wouldn't have had his morphology tested we still would be looking for a reason why we cant conceive now we are moving on to different ways to help our situation i have also seen tests on the internet and at the drug store that say test sperm count too maybe give those a try good luck to you and your partner  Prostate cancer In vitro fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sterilization (surgical procedure) Testicular cancer Sexual intercourse Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pregnancy Fertility awareness Stomach cancer Strap-on dildo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Abortion debate Emergency contraception Menstrual cycle Radiation therapy Puberty Birth control Theory of conduct Male reproductive system (human) Mesothelioma Jam (TV series) Medicine Alternative medicine Cellular differentiation Normal distribution Miscarriage Malaria Epididymis Drug test Bird Stem cell William Shockley Chimera (genetics) Sperm Whale Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ovarian cancer Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cystic fibrosis Sexual reproduction Lance Armstrong Debugging Fertilisation Albatross Spermatozoon Artificial insemination Spider Oral contraceptive Orgasm Meiosis Theodicy Ploidy Father Ultraviolet Anchor Teen Girl Squad HIV test Prolactinoma Homosexuality and medical science Anxiety Endometriosis Friends Clinical trial General relativity Queen bee Gamete Sunset Beach (soap opera) Clinical depression Ejaculation Tsetse fly Terri Schiavo Butterfly Knots Landing Infantilism Pretty Good Privacy Erythropoietin Colorectal cancer Intersexuality Drosophila melanogaster American lobster Plutonium Crystal methamphetamine and sex Twin Backgammon Piccolo Junior Saga Eugenics Ovum Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kodocha Penis Homophobia Extreme Programming Lung cancer Edward's syndrome

what is the best advice for me to get pregnant quickly besides just to have sex we already do that and i tak i have never seen so many horrible degrading and just plain rude answers to your legitimate and very reasonable question i hope everyone on this board reported them and i'm sorry to the asker of this question to have to be subjected to such remarks to get pregnant i recommend getting a calendar and just mark the first day of your last period if you can not remember then make sure you memoralize the first day of your next period the goal is to track your cycle to find out when you ovulate once you determie this count days forward plan on having intercourse wiht your husband many times to days beore and after this time frame however if you dont' have any issues you could seriously have sex on the th day and most l ikely become preg but everyone is different and if it doesn't work this time try the next month it will happen it's a biological ability unless something is wrong if you continue to have issues reach out to you obgyn have fun trying  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Abortion debate Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Niddah Sexual abstinence Birth control Human sexual behavior Gregorian calendar Time Abortion Social rule Hebrew calendar Chinese calendar Sexual intercourse Maya calendar B3ta Julian day 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ovulation Plame affair Rape Alaga__sia Simon Commission Orgasm Condom EastEnders Days of our Lives Female genital cutting 2003 Invasion of Iraq Teach the Controversy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Roman calendar Ecology Gender-neutral language Strap-on dildo History of sex Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Pelvic inflammatory disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Child sexuality New York Giants Downing Street memo Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Calvin and Hobbes Incest Lawrence v.

how can you know if you are only one week pregnant my husband and i were married a little over a week ago we have been together for years and i have never thought i was pregnant but he has never gone inside me either a little over a week ago he went three times with no protection i know i can't already be having symptoms but i get slightly nausiated when i eat anything my nipples are really sensitive they have never been sensitive before and i feel really bloated where were you in your cycle a week ago when you two had unprotected sex you would have had to be ovulating at the time first of all if you were some women do experience symptoms a week after conception so if they just started it's possible if you've been having the symptoms all week or if you weren't ovulating at the time it could just be in your head because this is the first time you've had sex completely unprotected what you're describing could be pregnancy or pms unfortunately they are similar but without knowing where you are in your cycle it's hard to call it you'll just have to wait it out and see if your period comes good luck  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Ovulation Premenstrual stress syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Oral sex Breastfeeding Abortion Miscarriage Obstetrics AIDS Neighbours Estrus cycle Ovarian cyst Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Emergency contraception Sexual abstinence Guinea pig EastEnders Psoriasis Orgasm Sexual reproduction Methotrexate Abortion debate Niddah Human sexual behavior Borderline personality disorder Turner syndrome Thinks ...

is this spotting the last two days i have had slight lower backache and cramping yesterday morning i had a few drops of light brown discharge and later last night this got darker brown but there was only about a pinch amount now today theres still nothing apart from when i went to the toilet and wiped again this is light brown sorry to be graphic but i need your views me n partner of years want a baby and havent had protected sex for about a month now is this spotting how soon can i take a preg test yes it sounds like spotting we need some more details though like when was the first day of your last period how long are your cycles and when do you think you ovulated implantation spotting usually happens about days before your period is due and lasts no more than a day or and there shouldn't be any bright red blood if it is implantation bleeding then the pregnancy hormone hcg would shop up in first morning urine within about days most likely but you could still get a false negative if you don't have your period when it is due then take another one at that time a lot of women can get a positive pregnancy test at days past ovulation or about days before their period is due just don't get yourself all worked up and overanalyzing every symptom because it will make you really disappointed if your period comes it takes most women months to conceive i had implantation bleeding with my son but the cramps didn't start until a few days later but it wasn't planned so i just felt like my period was coming period and early pregnancy symptoms are very similar also remember that implantation spotting is pretty rare and most women don't experience it good luck  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Pregnancy test Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Obstetrics Puberty Emergency contraception Progesterone Gonorrhoea Ectopic pregnancy Prostate cancer Time Out of Mind HIV test Estrus cycle In vitro fertilisation Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Ovarian cyst Coeliac disease Abortion Childbirth Hypoglycemia Infertility Condom Anemia The Beatles discography Drug test Multiple sclerosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Niddah Ebola Solar eclipse Diabetic retinopathy Sexual abstinence Capercaillie Cytomegalovirus Sexual intercourse Vitamin C Psoriasis Hiberno-English Guinea pig Insulin Stroke Gynecologic hemorrhage Stomach cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blood type Endometrial cancer Cervical cancer Tocopherol Oral sex Turner syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Prolactinoma Toilet humour 2000 Australian Grand Prix Group A streptococcal infection Singlish Herpes simplex virus Premature birth Social rule Transsexuality Dialysis Postpartum depression Shaggy dog story Sleep Chronic fatigue syndrome Infantilism Prenatal diagnosis Gynaecology EastEnders Sharon Tate Traumatic incident reduction Malaria Haloperidol Jon Secada Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cliff Richard Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Menstrual cup The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome

every kind there is ok i know i can google this but it will take forever so i just thought i'd ask what is every single kind of pregnancy symptom i know that every woman does not get all symptoms but i'm just wondering i have pretty much convinced myself that i can't get pregnant but my body is being weird the reason i think i can't get pregnant is because my dr diagnosed me with p c o s polycystic ovarian syndrome i know some women can have kids with this my sister did but i seriously rarely have no periods i just had one last month and so me and my husband did what we needed to do but i dunno thanks for answering i also suffer from pcos and i didn't get periods for years i wasn't diagnosed until last summer after suffering with the disease for a very long time my doctor put me on a drug called metformin aka glucophage which stabilizes insulin levels women with pcos are insulin resistant and kick starts ovulation it's possible to have a period without ovulating so just because you had a period doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get pregnant my husband and i couldn't figure it out long story short went on the metformin in august went in for a check up months later was months pregnant i had no symptoms at all i also hadn't had a period in over a year and that usually is a clear indicator to suspect you're pregnant i lost the baby at months no particular reason other than it most likely had to do with the fact i have pcos and my uterus was blighted at the time i had a d c after the miscarriage waited weeks had normal periods and i'm pregnant again this time i knew i got pregnant the night it happened i knew i was ovulating i missed my period and took a test it was i then started experiencing morning sickness sore breasts frequent urination most of your classic signs please just be aware that women with pcos have a chance of miscarrying at any time during their pregnancy i'm almost months along now and i still worry every day even though everything is going alright pcos is a horrible thing to suffer from but there are ways to manage it and it's the most common reproductive problem in women and it is the most misdiagnosed problem the symptoms are so vague doctors don't think of it most of the time good luck and don't give up if you're not on metformin talk to your doctor about getting on it it's changed my life  Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Insulin resistance Ovarian cancer Coeliac disease Endometriosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Metformin Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia EastEnders Cytomegalovirus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Oral contraceptive Abortion Infertility In vitro fertilisation Folic acid Obesity Milton H.

period question and pregnancy ok soo every since i have been with my husband years ago my periods have been soo messed up i would get it twice a month every month for maybe a week at a time just in january i had a period for months jan march longest ever ever anyway so now i got my period which started july st and its august th who knows how long this one will last but i also have a problem conceiveing years is a long time to not end up preggo so im just wondering what could i have whats going on with me has anyone had these same experiences please help i have a doctors appt at the fertility clinic on the th til then im going to drive myself crazy again helpppp thanks to all in advance hi there i have a totally irregular cycle and i actually have sufferered the opposite of what you're experiencing i've been married for years and we have had trouble ttc pretty much the whole time instead of having super long periods i never got them at all i went to my gp and went back on the pill and i'd get my period regularly but we wanted to have kids so i'd stop and it would never come again i would go back on birth control and it would come back and it was a revolving cycle for the first years i then started having chronic abdominal pain last summer and my gp sent me to a ob gyn that was also a fertility specialist he took one look at me i told him my history of birth control and my irregular cycle and within minutes told me i had all the classic signs of pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome i also had endometriosis lining of the uterus is too thick and doesn't slough off like normal the combination of the two makes it almost impossible to have kids he put me on a drug called metformin which regulates insulin levels and it also stimulates ovulation in women with pcos i went on it and went in for a check up months later and without knowing it i was pregnant i had no symptoms and i still hadn't gotten my period and i found out why unfortunately i lost that baby at months but i had a d c afterwards and the doctor cleaned out my uterus and told me to wait weeks to have sex we did and i also had normal periods after the d c jan and feb i feel pregnant again in march i'm happy to announce i'm weeks pregnant and things are going fine i had been told in the past by doctors and a np that i probably wouldn't be able to have children and i was devestated you can't believe everything that you're told it takes being your own advocate and finding the right doctor to help you i was also told i would most likely have to do ivf and my current doctor was able to get my situation under control with one medication and it just happens to be for diabetics he's my hero and i love him and will always love him for helping me i hope my story can give you some hope i know you're probably not suffering from the same things but i almost gave up and had i not met dr taymour i wouldn't be sitting here pregnant for the second time good luck  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infertility In vitro fertilisation Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Childbirth Obstetrics Diabetes mellitus Miscarriage Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Endometrial cancer Puberty Sexual intercourse Ovulation Friends EastEnders Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Abortion Bipolar disorder Neighbours Obesity Ovarian cyst Guinea pig Prostate cancer Psoriasis Clinical depression Medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Folic acid Hypertension Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spina bifida Hypoglycemia Nutrition Emergency contraception Premature birth Kodocha Stroke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Migraine Marilyn Monroe Knots Landing Coeliac disease Insulin Human cloning Androgen insensitivity syndrome Twin Prenatal diagnosis Multiple sclerosis Antidepressant Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

i'm days late we're trying to conceive and now i'm days late my period is always regular so i was confident that i was pregnant however the test i took this morning was negative i called my doctor who said that it may be that i didn't ovulate last month and therefore skipped a period or maybe i just wasn't far enough along for the test to pick up on the hormones i've been pregnant before and have always been able to test positive the day after i was supposed to start my period about days before and up to about days before i should have started this period i had some clear disharge with a little blood in it i thought of it as implantation bleeding since i've never experienced any bleeding between periods what do you think if you feel you are pregnant i would give a test another try but wait a week i am pregnant with my second child and this pregnancy took negative tests one positive test to get the result i wanted i know it's hard to wait but chances are you'll get your results good luck  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Endometriosis Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion Childbirth 2000 Australian Grand Prix HIV test Infertility Emergency contraception Ovarian cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Ovulation Blood type Stomach cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Puberty Gynecologic hemorrhage Estrus cycle Coeliac disease Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Tocopherol Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Diabetic retinopathy Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends Twin Extreme Programming Knots Landing Drug test Stroke Gonorrhoea Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Premature birth Breastfeeding Progesterone Slow Train Coming The Contender (television series) Ectopic pregnancy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Blood on the Tracks Apollo 8 Alois Hitler Traumatic brain injury Charmed Heinkel He 112 Days of our Lives Sharon Tate Piccolo Junior Saga Bayesian inference Ovary Alcoholism Sami Brady Babe Carey Social rule Psoriasis Anemia Clinical depression Acne Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Folic acid Neighbours Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Humphrey Bogart Operation Market Garden Brian Close Kodocha Niddah Endometrium Hal Trosky Chris Candito Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Schapelle Corby Guinea pig Morning sickness Poker jargon Ovarian cyst Child sexuality Leo Wyatt Transsexuality Endometrial cancer Paget's disease of bone One Life to Live Pitaten Cancer Insulin Alex Ferguson

i want a baby so bad help i want her to have a baby but i dont know if she is it isnt something i can talk to her about she said a few months ago she was ready but i dont know some one help and when is the best time to try i understand you not wanting to talk to her about this for fear of what might happen women can be unpredictable especially when confronted with something they aren't really ready for but if you don't talk to her you could just be setting yourself up for a long sad wait it's nice to hear a man for a change say that he desperately wants a baby most men have to be pushed and prodded into agreeing to it what you need to do first is sit down and write out your feelings on paper and organize your thoughts and what you want to say you can even practice it a few times if you want and then approach her don't try to corner her as she comes in from work or while you're in the middle of making love or something crazy find a time when you guys are both calm and relaxed and gently bring up your desire to have a baby if she hesistates at all then don't push her into it because she will hate you for it  Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

strange period then implantation bleed hubby and i ttc for months know it isnt long but is driving me crazy and feel convinced there is a problem anyway last period was dark dark brown in colour couldnt call it s period really got checked out private gyne and said all ok am now weeks from nex period and had very light light brown spotting past two days and some cramps as well as back pain am convinced i am not pg but wonder if any of you have had implantation bleed and or any other symptoms so early on if you are weeks from your next period then you only ovulated a few days ago it would be really early to have an implantation bleed at this time although not impossible but rare i would wait and see if your periods are late and then do a pregnancy test when they are a few days overdue could it not be that you are stressing yourself out so much over why you are not pregnant that the effects are showing on your cycle stress is the worse thing when trying to get pregnant and as you say months is nothing in reality calm down and try and put it out of your mind i know its hard but i think you are making yourself not get pregnant by being so worried about it if possible go on a holiday forget about calendars ovulation and pregnancy and leave it all to nature you only need to start thinking something might be wrong if you are not pregnant within years the less you think about it the more it is likely to happen and yes i know how obsessive it can become i have a lot of xl tshirts in that area  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Endometriosis Miscarriage Childbirth Ectopic pregnancy Obstetrics Stomach cancer Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hebrew calendar Time Out of Mind Ovulation One Life to Live Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control In vitro fertilisation Diabetic retinopathy Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Year of the Spider Clinical depression Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Anxiety Space opera in Scientology doctrine Infertility Psoriasis Scientology beliefs and practices Daylight saving time Endometrial cancer Emergency contraception Neighbours Kodocha Ovarian cancer Time Milton H.

how to conceive faster i had a month baby and now i want to have another baby we are trying for month now no chance till now if any one know what to do well sorry to say there is no quick way to have a baby but i do have some good advice if you are worrying about not concieving this can cause stress and prevent it from happening if you have a day cycle then count from the first day of your period this must be a day of full flow not spotting days this brings you to a window of days of being possibly fertile the best was to test this is with an ovulation kit which arent that expensive if you really want a baby test yourself mid afternoon as the hormone that shows you are fertile isnt present first thing in the morning i found this out myself if you want to try without the ovulation kits then you should watch your body signs all woman have these signs when you are approaching your most fertile time you will notice a clear strecthy fluid in your underwear or when you wipe yourself this is the fluid sperm use to travel into the womb and up to the fallopian tubes this therefor indicates your most fertile time when you see a thick yellwy coloured fluid this shows that you are not ovulating as this is the fluid that prevents sperm from enetering your womb this clear stretchy fluid is usually present around the days around a day cycle if you cycle is longer by a few days instead of days move forward a couple of days and watch your natural body signs if your cycle is shorter minus a few days again according to your body signs the egg that is released only lives for between hours or less so i would recommend a ovulation kit to maximise your chances if you do not ovulate in any cycle dont panic a woman doesnt ovulate every month just keep trying oh and not to forget the best possible way to concieve a baby is through the missionary position and thats a fact it aids the sperm easier access to flow into the womb when the female fluid is clear and stretchy most people say egg white but i myself i think it looks like slug trail yuk  In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Infertility Emergency contraception Childbirth Puberty Fertilisation Birth control Niddah Female reproductive system (human) Prostate cancer Oral contraceptive Abortion debate Sexual reproduction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) HIV test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Tide Estrus cycle Cryptorchidism Stroke Obstetrics Ovarian cyst Spermatozoon Eye Sperm Whale Abortion Spina bifida Elephant Species Rocky Mountain spotted fever Endometrium Twin Sterilization (surgical procedure) Miscarriage Month Flowering plant Ovarian cancer Time Blood pressure Coeliac disease Menstrual cup Insomnia Orgasm Gonorrhoea Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovum Infantilism Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Pregnancy test Carpal tunnel syndrome Volleyball Drowning Penis M16 (rifle) Fetal development Sexual abstinence Intersexuality Semen Cancer Social rule Premature birth Biology and sexual orientation Solar eclipse Pneumonia Sleep Testicle Uterus Left-handed Jam (TV series) Action potential Sea-Monkey Liger Multiple birth Homosexuality and medical science Exact solutions in general relativity Chronic fatigue syndrome Earthworm Artificial insemination Mattress Weather lore Intact dilation and extraction Gregorian calendar Friends Ectopic pregnancy

ttc do you know if taking tylenol pm wll stop me from pg i have been trying to concieve for months but i dont sleep that good unless i take either tylenol pm or a unisom i usually take it every other day could that stop me from getting pg tylenol pm has no effect on ttc this is my suggestion for you on ttc the only way is getting to truly know your cycle ok i know that sounded so cheesy don't listen to anyone telling you to count this many days or that many anything that's not how it works you have to find out when you ovulate and every cycle of your own can even be different and women with the same number of days in a cycle can ovulate several days apart you can use opks ovulation predictor kits you pee on but they are hard to tell and sometimes confusing and frusterating start charting it takes a little work but you take your morning temp everyday and chart it when you notice your thermal shift is when you ovulate try http www fertilityfriend com i've used that site for years and it's helped me get pregnant several times lol just for an idea of when you might ovulate i'd say counting back from when you are supposed to get your period is ok but this could be way off for many women especially if you have hormone troubles trust me me too and this doesn't work if your cycle is different all the time again me too i could give you sooo many tips but taking charge of your fertiltiy by toni w i have read this is the bible to the site i gave you above use this site it helps and explains a lot and you can compare a lot of other womens charts it's great for obsessing lol  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Ovulation Oral contraceptive Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Puberty Emergency contraception Friends Pregnancy test Estrus cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Electrophysiology Musical mode Ovarian cyst Niddah Social rule Entropy EastEnders Extreme Programming Solar variation Computus Progesterone R.

my white friend said that black men should not try to get redheads pregnant because redheads have a mutated gene thus there red hair and the introdution of black genes would make the child extra frail and would have a short life expectancy he says this is true and non racist but actual genetics i am not sure if he said that because i like this redhead at work or because he is trying to be helpful even though it is hurtful he said black men should have kids with blondes or brunnets does hair color do anything with pregancy in the first place and does it affect interracial relationships with black guys no do not believe that guy there is no truth to that  Red hair Hair color Melanin Human skin color Mendelian inheritance Interracial couple Cheetah Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Color blindness Blond Cat coat genetics Black panther Black (people) Roan (color) Lac operon Genetic disorder Mutation Cordelia Chase Androgen insensitivity syndrome Guinea pig Human X chromosome Evolution Lex Luthor Dragon Booster Lois Griffin Hair Jean Grey Haemophilia Gene Drosophila melanogaster Skinhead Thalassemia The Rasmus One-drop theory Beauty and the Beast (series) Sickle-cell disease Recessive gene Gwen Verdon Noonan syndrome The Wotch Horse Hair (musical) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Double Dragon Queen of Wands Race of Jesus Gaucher's disease Validity of human races Dobermann Waardenburg syndrome White (people) Macroevolution Redhead (duck) Kryptonite Baldness Gray (horse) Afrocentrism Albinism Nature versus nurture The Sims 2 Mary Jane Watson Human variability Eric Cartman Our Gang Usher syndrome KaBlam!

update bfn ugh a few days ago i thought i was pregnant af had not shown week late and i had symptoms i took two hpts and both were negative yesterday i went to the doctor and got another bfn with the urine test they did a blood test and what do you know another bfn so the doctor prescribed provera day pills and said i could take them as soon as i got the blood results in just to make sure i wasn't pregnant and that's when i called today to get the results anyways i go to the restroom and when i wipe there's a tinge of blood sorry if tmi so looks like af is coming on i guess i really did psyche myself out since i really wanted to be pregnant but i'm glad its coming on by itself instead of having to use the provera i really didn't want to take it so now my question does anybody know of any natural remedies to help with ovulation i looked up primrose oil is that good for ovulation by the way i'm already taking prenatal vitamins for follic acid thanks to all bfn big fat negative the doctor prescribed provera just to get me to start af i've always been regular days since i was when i started i did have a miscarriage in may and had a d c so i'm thinking that could have thrown me off even though i got a period weeks after d c and another one weeks after that this is the first one to be off i'm thinking of trying the opks has that helped anybody and how long did it take to get pregnant using that since af was late you probably ovulated later than you thought you had it happens sometimes especially if you were stressed around the time ovulation normally would have been try charting your basal body temp knowing when exactly you ovulated can help a great deal when it keeps you from wondering when your period is going to know after a few months you will be able to tell an exact date from ovulation and it will help because if you are ovulating later than you thought then you may not be trying so much on the days you should be www fertilityfriend com has more info on charting and will explain how to do it right all you really need is a basal thermometer and a place to keep track of the temps  Fertility awareness Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Polycystic ovary syndrome Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Folic acid Pregnancy test Vitamin C Vitamin Ovulation Stomach cancer Coeliac disease EastEnders Antidepressant The Ashlee Simpson Show Neighbours Slow Train Coming Puberty Acne Human chorionic gonadotropin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Premenstrual stress syndrome Post-traumatic stress disorder Blood on the Tracks Ovarian cyst HIV test Anorexia nervosa Insulin Group A streptococcal infection R.

what is the best proven way in conceiving a baby boy serious answers please ok best proven way it worked for you on an individual case i realize this forum is only for suggestions i wouldn't take every single bit of advice to heart chart your ovulation have intercourse the day you ovulate and have him make his deposit right on the cervix stay on your back with hips proped on a pillow for at least an hour male sperm are faster swimmers than female so your egg has to be waiting in the fallopian tubes for the sperm male sperm have a shorter life however so if you have sex too early they will be dead and the female sperm will fertilize the egg not a guarantee but short of spinning down the sperm in a centerfuge a marked increase in your odds of conceiving a boy it worked for me at least and worked for the people that gave me the advice  In vitro fertilisation Infertility Fertility awareness Ovulation Sexual reproduction Female reproductive system (human) Fertilisation Sexual intercourse Ovary Puberty Pregnancy Spider Emergency contraception Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral contraceptive Intersexuality Gonorrhoea Artificial insemination Old wives' tale Fetal development Miscarriage Sex organ Parthenogenesis Sterilization (surgical procedure) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sex Flowering plant Swimming Ectopic pregnancy Sperm Whale Spermatozoon Orgasm Semen Prostate cancer Abortion debate Black widow spider Sexual differentiation Man Endometriosis Hermaphrodite Bird Breastfeeding Ovum Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Edward's syndrome Penis Twin Flower Anal sex American lobster Vagina Human sexuality Platypus Leatherback Sea Turtle Pet Sounds Androgen Grasshopper Earthworm Shark Aphid Ploidy Breaststroke Moss Niddah Obstetrics Pedophilia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Sexual dimorphism Male reproductive system (human) Bedbug Mountain Gorilla 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ejaculation Sexual abstinence Multiple birth Premature birth Breech birth Spice Girls Childbirth Testicle Intersex surgery Monogamy Toad Gender identity Housefly Ovarian cancer Chimera (genetics) Swyer syndrome Gamete Tarantula Backstroke Child sexuality Internal ballistics Cryptorchidism Theory of conduct Fibonacci number

any ttc'ers surprised at bfp i'm just curious if anyone ttc'd for months on end seeing the endless negative hpt's and at one point became such an expert at your own body that you no longer really looked forward to testing day because you knew you weren't pregnant every cycle felt like the last one and then you expected af like every other cycle and it didn't show and you got bfp none of the pg sxs you'd been searcing for in the beginning of the ttc journey and were really surprised to be pregnant yes i was definitely surprised by my this pregnancy even though we had been trying for years when i got pregnant with my first she is now years old we were not trying to conceive but we were not preventing it either i knew i was pregnant when i got out of the shower late one night and there were prominent blue veins under the skin on my breasts it was a week before my period was even due i went to the store we live in a rural area and it was late on a sunday and came home and tested positive i was not surprised really i was happy and scared all at the same time btw ultrasound later confirmed that i was indeed right about my dates when we started ttc again our daughter was about a year and a half old it took about four months but i knew i was pregnant i swear i felt implantation occur i waited until the day my period was due to test because in the months prior i had wasted so much on tests the test seemed unnecessary really because i knew i was pregnant so i tested and it was negative i was devastated i actually had a temper tantrum then after i calmed down i was on the way out the door and i decided to go look again and there was the faintest positive i took it to the pharmacist in a ziplock bag and had him take a look at it too lol but i was not surprised our son is now years old well now i am expecting my third child next month we started trying to conceive again when our son was about a year and a half so it took nearly five years this time i can not tell you how much money i spent on pregnancy tests i have literally taken hundreds we had taken some measures that we were comfortable with but were not willing to go any further as far as infertility treatments were concerned so it started seeming like it would never happen i still hoped however in december of last year my period started it was several days early i remember that with the holidays and everything going on that month we did nothing to ttc except obviously fit some intercourse in there a couple of times but conceiving was not on our minds i did not temp i did not check cervix nothing but for some reason in january on the day before my period should have started i tested habit i was a definite pee on a stick addict i had absolutely no symptoms just thought i should test it was so faint i did not think it was there i was sure i was imaging things i looked at it up close i held it at a distance i looked in dim light and bright i scanned it and used photo editing software to change the contrast i sent it to friends so they could tell me if they saw something i still did not believe it i went to the store and bought more tests because that first one was the last test strip i had in my house faint positives but they certainly could not be real after nearly five years of trying and i tested again and again after approximately three dozen tests of various brands three blood tests and four ultrasounds i was convinced i was pregnant there was a scare in there as the baby was not initially visible on ultrasound and one of the tests i got at a doctor's office was negative after several home tests were positive all of these tests were in a one week period btw yes i was shocked i still am but i sit here feeling her move and it is my own schock and awe i could not be happier  Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness EastEnders Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Friends Prostate cancer Knots Landing Childbirth Abortion Prenatal diagnosis Shaggy dog story Milton H.

what is ok to take for a headache if preg or ttc i have been having really bad headaches and my husband and i are ttc and may be pregnant now does anyone know wheather it is ok to take anything for headaches during pregnancy if not does anyone know anything that can help my headaches without taking a medication it's not unusual to get headaches when you're pregnant especially in the first trimester my wife suffered too she was susceptible to them and pregnancy seemed to make the problem worse experts don't know exactly why carrying a child makes your head ache but good guesses include the hormonal free for all your body is undergoing and changes in the way your blood circulates other potential culprits include fatigue sinus congestion stress and hunger it pays to think twice before taking any medicine while you're pregnant even something as simple as a cold remedy may contain substances which aren't recommended for use during pregnancy if you have any queries about medicines in pregnancy prescribed or over the counter speak to your doctor or pharmacist and always tell the pharmacist that you're pregnant when buying any medicines over the counter you are limited in your choice of pain relief aspirin should be avoided as it has a blood thinning effect however it may be prescribed by your doctor if you've suffered recurrent miscarriage or have pre eclampsia ibuprofen isn't recommended in pregnancy as it may affect your unborn baby and prolong labour paracetamol is considered safe as long as you stick to the recommended dosage and only use it occasionally one study found that expectant mums who took paracetamol on 'most days' or daily in late pregnancy were twice as likely to have a wheezy baby they recommend that pregnant women do not take it more than days per week ' avoid the stronger painkillers which combine one of the above with other analgesics if you continue to suffer from migraine please go and see your doctor for advice on what's safe to take try and work out what's triggering the pain do you get a pounding headache after being cooped up in a hot stuffy office all day then take periodic fresh air breaks are your headaches linked to arguments with your partner or power struggles with the kids then think of ways to defuse these situations or your frustration before they cause you physical pain my wife did not feel comfortable using medication during her pregnancy instead she would soak a flannel in cold water containing a few drops of lavender essential oil and apply this to her forehead and rest in a darkened room alternatively you could apply a warm compress around your eyes and nose for sinus headaches and a cool compress at the base of your neck for tension headaches get your partner to give you a massage if you have the time and money by all means get a full body number from a trained masseuse but if that's only a pipe dream ask your partner to rub your back and head or slip into a salon for a professional shampoo massage works especially well on headaches caused by tension that builds in the neck shoulder and back muscles eat little and often low blood sugar is a common headache culprit eating smaller more frequent meals can help prevent them if you're on the go keep some snacks crackers fruit wholemeal biscuits in your bag exercise frequently some evidence shows that regular exercise can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches and migraines take a cold shower a simple but effective remedy for some migraines it works by constricting the dilated blood vessels often bringing fast if brief relief if you can't take a shower splash some cool water on your face you could try acupuncture needle acupuncture treatment is considered safe and effective for headaches and morning sickness ask your midwife or friends for the name of an acupuncturist or you could contact the british acupuncture council at www acupuncture org uk for details of a registered practitioner near you sniff green apples scientists at the smell and taste treatment center in chicago say the smell of certain foods such as green apples can keep migraine headaches at bay but you have to like the scent for the pain relieving magic to work well it's worth a try best wishes x  Fibromyalgia Osteoarthritis Essential oil Stomach cancer Hypertension Coffee Folic acid Coeliac disease Hay fever Medical prescription Vitamin C Breech birth Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Propranolol Yarrow Repetitive strain injury Insulin AIDS Pain Tocopherol Equine conformation Dog Dieting Insomnia Masturbation Menstrual cycle Aspirin Anorexia nervosa Cephalic disorder Rosacea COX-2 inhibitor Obesity Veganism Decompression sickness Aspartame Chlorpromazine Emergency contraception Hyperthermia Acne Bipolar disorder Turner syndrome Professional wrestling holds Lamotrigine Osteopathy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tai Chi Chuan Mattress Caffeine Homeopathy LSD Anxiety Baldness treatments

cryobank or other options what should i do i am in a committed relationship with another woman we are planning on having a baby within the next year or two i found a doctor close by who specializes in infertilty and people in my situation but she only works with the california cryobank this costs a lot of money for one vial of sperm and she told me she does three inseminations per cycle which adds up to per month just for the sperm not to mention doctor fees and shipping has anyone else out there had success with another method i know some people say if im not willing to spend that money to get pregnant then why have a child which is ridiculous and please no one respond with just go have sex with a man its free i am married that is just wrong i am just concerned that i will spend so much money on trying to get pregnant when there may be a cheaper way to do it does anyone have any suggestions i live in the chicago area i have known a few same sex couples who have used known donors they simply have this man uh perform with a cup and then using a syringe without a needle inject the ejaculate into the vagina trying as much as possible to get it near the cervix however that is only one option and not one that many people are comfortable with i would look into other cryobanks in the us i had a friend whose husband is sterile and she had bought a vial for about and only had one insem and she is due to deliver any day now i have also heard of some women buying frozen sperm and doing it at home the cheapest way the sperm is already washed so there is no chance of infection of the uterus it may be something you would want to research i don't really know much about it on a completely different note insems it sounds like your doctor is trying to milk you for money i really see no need for more than insems in any cycle even in a medicated injections cycle to stimulate the ovaries the doctors only do insems at the most and that's with a husbands sperm something just doesn't seem right with all of that  In vitro fertilisation Infertility Birth control Sexual intercourse Artificial insemination Fertility awareness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Pregnancy Abortion Puberty Oral sex Urinary incontinence Sterilization (surgical procedure) Intact dilation and extraction Orgasm Miscarriage Strap-on dildo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Genital wart Breastfeeding Friends Endometriosis Intravenous therapy Obstetrics Childbirth Fertilisation Menstrual cup Condom EastEnders Gonorrhoea Neighbours Medical analysis of circumcision Sexual reproduction Domestic violence Pornographic movie Safe sex Anal sex Psoriasis Semen Cytomegalovirus Baldness treatments Premature birth Sperm Whale Social rule Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Female genital cutting Days of our Lives Sex toy Tsetse fly Knots Landing Stem cell Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Douche Human sexuality Sex organ Vagina Stomach cancer Intersex surgery Infantilism HIV test Breech birth Folic acid History of intersex surgery Malaria Surrogacy Human sexual behavior Gynaecology Cervical cancer William Shockley Kurt Cobain Religion and sexuality Diaphragm (contraceptive) Blood transfusion Twin Yoko Ono Premature ejaculation Boom Town (Doctor Who) Castration Sexual abstinence Penis Extreme Programming Gay slang

pull out method basically day tomorrow are my most fertile days of the month my boyfriend i had sex today and yesterday we are prepared for a baby if that were to happen we just want to wait a couple months cuz we are gettin married in weeks today he said he would pull out well he did but then he was like i'm going back in he hadn't yet well this happened like times but everytime the tip of his penis was really wet when he went back inside of me how effective is the pull out method really i know we didn't do it right lol we want a baby soon anyways but i was just wonderin i went on this site online where you enter info it said that a single act of unprotected sex on the day we did it was a chance of pregnancy but we pulled out so i wasn't sure ok it looks like i will be the only one to say that the pull out method can be somewhat effective birth control my fiance and i use this and only this as our birth control observed failure rates of withdrawal vary depending on the population being studied studies have found actual failure rates of per year in comparison the pill has an actual use failure rate of while the diaphragm has an actual use failure rate of the condom has an actual use failure rate of for couples that use withdrawal correctly at every act of intercourse the failure rate is per year in comparison the pill has a perfect use failure rate of while the diaphragm has a perfect use failure rate of the condom has a perfect use failure rate of it has been suggested that the pre ejaculate cowper's fluid fluid emitted by the penis prior to ejaculation contains spermatozoa sperm cells which can easily pass into the upper female genital tract in the presence of cervical mucus however several small studies have failed to find any viable sperm in the fluid while no large conclusive studies have been done it is now believed the primary cause of method correct use failure is the pre ejaculate fluid picking up sperm from a previous ejaculation for this reason it is recommended that users of withdrawal have the male partner urinate between ejaculations to clear the urethra of sperm and wash any ejaculate from objects that might come near the woman's vulva e g hands and his penis  Coitus interruptus Penis Safe sex Medical analysis of circumcision Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Masturbation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ejaculation Puberty Prostate cancer Herpes simplex virus Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Male reproductive system (human) Sexual abstinence Semen Strap-on dildo Anal sex Gonorrhoea Menstrual cup Abortion In vitro fertilisation Sterilization (surgical procedure) AIDS Female ejaculation Human penis size Pornographic movie Diaphragm (contraceptive) Human sexual behavior Pre-ejaculate Intersexuality Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human sexual response cycle Intersex surgery Abortion debate Premature ejaculation Endometriosis Urethra Carburetor Vagina Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypospadias Douche Vulva Childbirth Common cold Obstetrics Sperm Whale Spider Cervical cancer Sex toy Pregnancy Human sexuality EastEnders Foreskin Genital wart Twin Circumcision Crystal methamphetamine and sex Human papillomavirus Penis enlargement Sex education Child sexuality Cytomegalovirus Female genital cutting Fertilisation Stomach cancer Biology and sexual orientation Miscarriage Japanese toilet Pornography Cancer Eye Cervical cap History of sex Vulvovaginal health Gender role Domestic violence Sexual dysfunction Erection Jam (TV series) Sex assignment Urination Knots Landing Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Species

feeling pregnant but not you ladies will probaly think i'm stupid for posting this but you never know i had been trying to get pregnant for a while but eventually gave up for a while here comes the stupid part i have not had sex since march i have also been having my periods right on time days long and heavy and have not missed but i feel pregnant you know still the only symptoms i have are a bubbling tummy which everyone tells me is gas tests are all negative am i forcing myself to see things that aren't there is it really possible to feel pregnant without actually being pregnant any advice hi there first of all your question isn't stupid at all what you're feeling is very real whether you are pregnant or not there's a few possibilities here either you have a hormone imbalance which would mimic pregnancy in some cases or you're having a phantom pregnancy a phantom pregnancy is when a women is so convinced she's pregnant that she starts having symptoms some women go so far as to start producing milk and having their bellies protrude the other possibility is that you are pregnant and are one of those women who continue to bleed throughout pregnancy there are also women who just don't show positive on urine tests i'm leaning more towards phantom pregnancy because i feel if you really were pregnant you'd have other symptoms besides an upset stomach especially if you conceived back in march what i strongly suggest is that you have an ultrasound done i don't think any pregnancy test would convince you otherwise have them do an ultrasound of your female parts and believe me if there's a bambino in there growing they will see it especially at this stage if there's no fetus there's no pregnancy you will find out one way or the other when you look at that ultrasound screen good luck  Pregnancy Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal diagnosis Abortion Cytomegalovirus Stomach cancer Friends Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Gonorrhoea Childbirth Breast cancer Birth control Oral contraceptive Abortion debate Coeliac disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Spina bifida Prolactinoma Knots Landing Endometrial cancer Premature birth Guinea pig Stroke Puberty Anemia Cephalic disorder Ovarian cyst Folic acid EastEnders Social rule Haloperidol Kodocha Human chorionic gonadotropin Omega-3 fatty acid Marilyn Monroe Roe v.

hi can clomid help bring back ovulation after depo injection i came off depo ijection after one shot on the th june and still have not had a period and i want to try for my nd child so just wondered if clomid could help first please remember that the depo shot is very powerful even if you have only one some women take months or years to recover could clomid help you to ovulate yes many women get pregnant with clomid but i would suggest you give it more time then a couple of cycles it is totally normal for your body to need some time after coming off depo your body has gone through enough hormonal changes with the depo shot and now you want to do clomid and by the way you need to have a period before you can take clomid so now you're talking about taking provera first to force a period then clomid to stimulate ovulation all two months after stopping depo provera i would give your body a little more time if your period doesn't come in the next two months then talk to your doctor about your options in them meantime at least you would have had more of a break from synthetic hormones good luck  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Depo Provera In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Puberty Infertility Oral contraceptive Anabolic steroid Ovarian cyst Estrogen Phoebe Halliwell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glucocorticoid Growth hormone deficiency Characters of Lost Estrus cycle Growth hormone Pregnancy test Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Emergency contraception Social rule Growth hormone treatment Hypoglycemia Emperor Yuan of Han Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Testosterone Human chorionic gonadotropin Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Gynaecology The Shining (film) The Ark in Space The Inside Hormone Chu-Han contention Chemotherapy The Death Gate Cycle Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Acne Kodocha Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Folic acid Insulin Thyroid Psoriasis Tocopherol Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Endometriosis Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Curse of Fenric Breast cancer Death Comes to Time Human height Erythropoietin Niddah Volleyball Orgasm Cryptorchidism Baldness treatments Androgen insensitivity syndrome Luteinizing hormone Childbirth Strap-on dildo Angel One (TNG episode) Chronic fatigue syndrome Incarnations of Immortality Rabbit Sydney Bristow Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Invisibles Follicle-stimulating hormone USS Yorktown (CV-10) Bedwetting Miscarriage Acromegaly The Dalek Invasion of Earth Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Homosexuality and transgender Sharon Tate Father's Day (Doctor Who) Haven (TNG episode) Prolactinoma The Amber Spyglass Bob and George Ovarian cancer Auxin Cortisol Kill Bill Futurama (TV series - season 3) Endocrinology

has anyone ever takin a hpt and it comes out neg and then a few days later get a positive im just wondering cuz i stopped taking the pill like a month and a ago and had unprotected sex with my husband like practicly everyday sorry and im pretty sure im supose to get my period this week and i think i might be preg but not sure cuz there are really no symptoms i only have a light stomach ache now and then and a headache one day and was light headed another but there are many explinations for why i had them but back to my q i took a hpt clear blue digital and it said not pregnant days ago and i was just wondering if anyone has takin a test and it showed up negative and then a few days later show up posetive how many days between and after your missed period please tell me whatever you know and are willing to share with me and other readers of my q thanks to everyone who answers this and sorry for making this sooo long hey hun apart from the first time i was pregnant which i didn't realise until weeks in i have tested before my period was due and got negatives then tested as my period was due or just before and got weak positives then had confirmation of pregnancy via blood test with my doctor but i seem to always know like a week before my period is due its kinda annoying because i've wasted so much money on hpts over my four pregnancys anyway i really advise waiting until the day your period is due because there is unlikely to be enough hgc hormone in your urine for the test to pick it up its a threshold remember so if you buy a test it might only detect mg or even a mg which you wouldn't get till after your period is late my biggest symptom throughout all was breast tenderness before period was due tiredness and nausea i understand how you feel though my period is due on monday and i'm sure i'm pregnant and of course my hpt is negative so im just going back to my doctor on monday to get a blood test good luck  Pregnancy Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obstetrics Stomach cancer Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Emergency contraception Neighbours Pregnancy test Prolactinoma Endometriosis Drug test Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Cancer Miscarriage Jon Secada Migraine Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Group A streptococcal infection Folic acid Cytomegalovirus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blood on the Tracks Ebola Abortion Haloperidol Ocean's Twelve Hypertension Big Brother UK series 6 Prenatal diagnosis Doxepin Sulfasalazine Marilyn Monroe Trazodone Billboard Hot 100 Gonorrhoea Clomipramine Time Out of Mind Chronic fatigue syndrome Pitaten Cliff Richard Dialysis Futurama (TV series - season 5) Charles Darwin's illness Traumatic brain injury Gastroparesis Tocopherol Cephalic disorder Stroke Pneumonia Diabetes mellitus AIDS Maprotiline Paracetamol Diabetic retinopathy UK Singles Chart Hyperprolactinaemia Morning sickness Puberty Alcoholism Turner syndrome Dehydration Rosa Parks Caffeine Lucille Ball Pornographic movie Hepatitis Malaria Frankie Laine 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Contender (television series) Guinea pig Knots Landing Masturbation Amiodarone Daz Dillinger HIV Multiple sclerosis Married... with Children Human chorionic gonadotropin Vitamin C Sleep Acne Father's Day (Doctor Who)

does anyone have any ideas on how to conceive a boy serious answers only please the reason i am asking it that my friend has girls and hopes to have a boy for her th and is gathering information on how to produce a boy thankyou right for all you non believers out there there is actully medical proof that there is a way to increase your chances of having a boy if you have less sex and only have it on the day you ovulate you are more likely to have a boy if you are having lots of sex before and after ovulation then it is more likely to be a girl why well the female sperm are slower swimmers but have more stamina and will therefore take longer to get the egg but will get there male sperm are faster swimmers but dont live as long so basically if the male ones get there first but dont get in the female ones will be around longer and will take over the job if the male failes to penetrate the egg  Puberty Menstrual cycle Sexual reproduction Infertility In vitro fertilisation Swimming Emergency contraception Flower Fertility awareness Ovulation Flowering plant Ovary Parthenogenesis Intersexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spider Sexual dimorphism Semen Oral sex Fertilisation Birth control History of intersex surgery Pregnancy Ploidy Female reproductive system (human) Dragons (Pern) Oral contraceptive John Money Prostate cancer Sex Housefly Hermaphrodite Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Ovum Sexual intercourse Sperm Whale Sex assignment Multiple birth Abortion debate Conifer cones Strap-on dildo Gender role Twin Backstroke Infantilism Genital integrity Masturbation Orgasm Phaedo Male reproductive system (human) Niddah X chromosome Bird Transsexuality Black widow spider Butterfly stroke Group sex American lobster Breaststroke Rambutan Fruit About a Boy Sexual abstinence Childlove movement Sexual differentiation Spice Girls XYY syndrome Little Britain Non-human animal sexuality Atomic Kitten Carpel Platypus Drosophila melanogaster Man Only Fools and Horses Gender History of sex Spermatozoon Front crawl Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cross-dressing Gamete Miscarriage Effeminacy Doctor Eggman George Costanza Child sexuality Pedophilia Premature ejaculation House Mouse The Catcher in the Rye Mountain Gorilla Interracial couple Polycystic ovary syndrome Grand Theft Auto (game) Central processing unit Estradiol One Tree Hill (TV series) London Congestion Charge

should i get my tubes reversed if i feel this guy is the one well i got my tubes ied when i had my dauhter i left thier father after six years and i met this guy that wants to have a baby and spend the rest of his life to me but i feel so scared but i believe him he is so diffrent and want to take the chance but how would i know if he is true to me plus he want to adopt the kids i have know someone please help me decide if i should get them untied to give him a child first of all i'd get married first before you do something drastic like reversing a tubal ligation i'd also advise to stay married to this man for a few years before doing something like that if it works out and you guys still want to have a baby do it if it's not possible adopt and still have him adopt your kids if you do go through with it and you are successful conceiving awesome but have him get a vasectomy next time those are easier to reverse than a tubal ligation good luck  Sterilization (surgical procedure) Laura Schlessinger Birth control EastEnders Charmed Stump v.

why cant we have a baby we've been trying to have a baby for about years now its crazy how people who dont want to have babies are popping them out left and right maybe we should get divorced and start jumpin out our parents bedrooms windows and see wut happens then can anyone help us well it depends when you're having sex there are only few days in the cycle month that you can get pregnant and that is when you're ovulating releasing the egg do you know when you ovulate have you tried ovulation predictor kits every woman is different and although the web and even the doctors say that you ovulate on day th it's not always true some ladies ovulate on day or even day you start counting from the day you start your period day this cycle stops when you start your next period day again with your new period sperm can live inside your body anywhere from days depending on cervical fluid your wetness inside of you sorry for too much information make sure you're not using ky jelly astroglide saliva or other lubricants because believe it or not this kills the sperm you may want to try out preseed which can be purchased and read more about at www preseed com this type of lubricant is inserted inside your vagina about minutes before sex it doesn't kill the sperm and it's affordable too it's helped a lot of women get pregnant but then again as long as you partner are healthy i would highly suggest purchasing the clearblue easy digital ovulation kit which can be bought at target for instead of which is at most retail shops this digital kit has tests which you pee on every morning preferrably in the afternoon time and if you're about to ovulate hours it will show you a digital smiley face if you're not about to ovulate then it will just show you a circle the test detects lh surge which is a hormone that is at it's top peak when you're about to ovulate release the egg once you see that smiley face you should have sex within hours sperm can stay in your body anywhere from days obviously this depends on both partners' health also the reason i would suggest this digital test rather than other tests in the market is because the other aren't digital you have to kind of guess yourself by looking at pink lines if you're okay with that then you can purchase the first response ovulation kit or answer brand it's cheaper and has more tests tests but it's not digital check out the clearblue easy digital opk http www clearblueeasy com digitalovul also i've read that before you have sex it's good for the male to drink coffee about min because the sperm are more jumpy and can get to the egg faster especially the y sperm boy sperm good luck and baby dust to you  Puberty In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Pregnancy Ovulation Infertility Condom Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Oral sex Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Strap-on dildo Emergency contraception Anal sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Niddah Menstrual cup Sexual reproduction Sperm Whale Pornographic movie Human sexual behavior Personal lubricant HIV test Orgasm Pregnancy test Jam (TV series) Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Spider Friends EastEnders Drug test Transsexuality Child sexuality Sea-Monkey Sex toy Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intact dilation and extraction Drosophila melanogaster Sesame Street Fecal incontinence Gonorrhoea Prenatal diagnosis Egg (food) Cancer Domain Name System Floppy disk Humphrey Bogart Hypoglycemia Safe sex Sento Motorcycle Semen History of Test cricket (to 1883) Masturbation Vagina Sex assignment Jon Secada Penis Cheating in Counter-Strike RFID Gramophone record Theory of conduct Fertilisation Kurt Cobain Hard disk Gender role Herpes simplex virus Cat Intersexuality Stomach cancer Ovary Adoption Growth hormone treatment Shark Ovum Airsoft Gay slang Vaginal lubrication Thermal power station Miscarriage Domestic rabbit Endometriosis Neopets The Amazing Race Wal-Mart

i need some opinons with ovulation ok so i am having painful cramps in the middle of my lower abdominal i had a tiny bit of blood when i checked my cervical mucus it is clear and stretchy does not break does this sound like ovulation my chart says i am not suppose to ovulate until the th also one more question when you ovulate can you have the same symptoms you would if you were about to get your period or being pregnant thank you ovulatory spotting occurs during ovulation when estrogen levels drop suddenly causing blood vessels in the uterus to release small amounts of blood estrogen is high right before ovulation and dips when the egg is released and then within a matter of hours progesterone starts to be secreeted in high amounts but during the couple of hours or so that the estrogen is low and progesterone is just starting to climb a little blood may be released so the spotting should occur immediately after ovulation but for some women it will take a few hours before they see the spotting on their panties or when wiping so by the time you see the spotting you have already ovulated but ewcm mixed with blood is still considered extremely fertile so it's a good time to bd symtpoms of ovulation mild abdominal cramps mittelschmerz breast tenderness bloating increased sex drive increased cervical mucus that is watery or like raw eggwhites cervix is at show soft high open wet  Oral contraceptive Progesterone Ectopic pregnancy Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Obstetrics Endometrial cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cervix Emergency contraception Miscarriage Ovarian cancer Hormone replacement therapy Urinary incontinence Estradiol Abortion Premature birth Cervical cancer Ovarian cyst Estrus cycle Ovary Premenstrual stress syndrome Childbirth Breastfeeding Gonorrhoea Equine conformation Breast cancer Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency First aid Swyer syndrome Spider Turner syndrome Sexual reproduction Decompression sickness Infectious mononucleosis Human chorionic gonadotropin Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breast Uterine fibroids Pregnancy test Infertility Colorectal cancer Cystic fibrosis Dialysis Undergarment Abdominal pain Atherosclerosis Testosterone Aspartame Estrogen Fertilisation Coffee Sexual differentiation Prostate cancer Flowering plant Intracranial pressure Aortic dissection Osteoporosis Physical examination Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Traumatic brain injury Diabetes mellitus Conifer cones Asthma Chiropractic Prolactinoma Married... with Children Herpes simplex virus Common cold Cholesterol Capercaillie Autonomic nervous system Gout Twin Menstrual cup Blood pressure Tsetse fly Tide Non-human animal sexuality

low sperm count well heres the story my sis and her husband have been trying to get prego for years and it hasnt happened shes healthy and already has a daughter from previous marriage but her husband does have a low sperm count the specialist just tells them to keep trying but they have been for years my question is should they do invitro or ai they dont mind paying the money just want it to work anyone have this problem before and if so what did u do if the doctor has checked them both out and says to just keep trying then they have proabably looked at any correctable usses with him such as varicocele vein on the scrotum if after years they still have had no luck they need to get in touch with a reproductive endocrynologist and ask him about having an iui intra unterine inesmination done all they do is clean and concentrate the sperm and then insert them directly into the uterus to give them a head start and increase the chances of conception it is much less invasive and expensive then ivf an iui takes a total of doctor visits and a minute procedure that involves nothing more than a speculum and a catheter an ivf generally requires drugs as well as more involved invasive measures an iui cycle costs about per attempt while ivf costs to per try definitely have them ask the doctor about the iui first  In vitro fertilisation Infertility Prostate cancer Varicocele Dialysis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Publicly funded medicine Divorce Puberty Menstrual cycle Penis Intravenous therapy Cancer Testicle Cryptorchidism Health insurance Myocardial infarction Oral contraceptive Sexual intercourse Embryo transfer Endometriosis Meiosis Eugenics RFID Abortion debate Obstetrics Coronary catheterization Colorectal cancer Traumatic brain injury Blackjack Extreme Programming Gastroparesis Miscarriage Spider Welding Traditional Chinese medicine Apollo 8 The Five Doctors Sterilization (surgical procedure) Orgasm Emergency contraception Inflation Human cloning Theory of conduct Neighbours Male reproductive system (human) Sexual reproduction CPU cache Atrial septal defect Medicare (Canada) Canadian and American health care systems compared Stomach cancer Homeopathy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pregnancy Sex organ Betting (poker) Act of Parliament Computus Corporate finance Graduate school Scientology beliefs and practices Slot machine Space Shuttle program Fertilisation Intact dilation and extraction Labor theory of value Economics Folic acid Blood pressure History of intersex surgery Addiction Normal distribution Intracranial pressure Microeconomics Scientific method Invasive plants Twin Consensual crime Medicine Jam (TV series) Physician Gross domestic product Intersex surgery Secret Intelligence Service Scrotum Hypnosis Linked list Organic farming Productive and unproductive labour Credit card Marriage Terri Schiavo Artificial insemination

endometriosis and trying to conceive i am asking this question on behalf of a goof friend of mine does anyone have any stories about getting pregnant when suffering from endometriosis my friend has had it for quite a few years she is being treated and the last time they had a look inside her she was told that there is no blockage in her tubes she has been ttc for a year but no success blood tests indicated she is not ovulating but a home test indicated she is does anyone out there have personal experience of this condition thanks many women with endo are still able to get pregnant if she has been trying for a year with no luck i would think her dr would start to run some tests personally i would put more faith in the blood test than the home test but i would think her best course of action would be to see a fertility specialist have him run tests and if all looks good with her and her sig other and still no luck i would be looking to blame the endo there are some pretty varied opinions about this and she should choose what's right for her but she may have the choice to have another lap to see if the endo is causing some blockage i know you said that wasn't the case in her previous lap but trust me it is possible for the endo to have grown back especially if she didn't have it excised thereby blocking her tubes now and unfortunately sometimes it can grow back in a matter of months another option that may be given to her is the lupron shot i personally would never take lupron as i believe it carries too much risk but some women have gotten pregnant after their course of treatment if this was something she would consider she should research it very well before trying it as it is a pretty powerful drug i would personally have a lap with a dr who specializes in endo if endo is preventing her from becoming pregnant having surgery with a dr knowledgable enough to excise all of the endo would give her very good chances of conceiving it has for lots of women but the first step should be figuring out what if anything is preventing her from getting pregnant and then choose the option she sees best for her i wish her luck  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infertility Acne Stroke In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Lung cancer Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Cancer Folic acid Oral contraceptive Psoriasis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Medicine Prolactinoma Fertility awareness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep apnea Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Stem cell EastEnders Animal testing Ovarian cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prenatal diagnosis Abortion Spina bifida Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cytomegalovirus Hypoglycemia Blood on the Tracks Abortion debate Roe v.

ttc and wondering about clomid my fiancee and i are ttc andi keep hearing about clomid i am going to ask my doctor about it on august at my next doctors appoint that is if i am not already pregnant so i have a few questions what is clomid and how does it work and the other is i ovulated on the st of june and on the th of august i had a pink color in my bodily fluids could this be implantation bleeding that early on also any other tips people have for us ttc clomid tricks your body into thinking you are not producing estrogen by blocking the estrogen recepters in turn you body make more thus making you ovulate you could release more than one egg i was prescribed clomid this cycle after ttc for months it can have a lot of side effects such as vision problems that can be permanent dizziness upset stomach moodyness sore breasts bloating and the worst one of all it can dry up your cervical mucus that you really need for sperm to travel in that is the only side effect i had but it wasn't that bad i took mg dose once a day for days starting on cycle day some women take it starting on day i think it is just up to the doctors they can increase the dose but i think most doctors will only let you take it months in a row you will ovulate anywhere from to days after you take the last pill so it helps to track ovulation by taking your temperature each day and charting it my doctor recommended only having sex every other day because sperm can live up to days inside a woman plus it gives time for your mans sperm count to build back up also read the book taking charge of your fertility it is a great book your doctor probably won't just prescribe clomid without doing some blood work and having your fiancee do a sperm analysis my doctor also wanted me to chart my cycles for a couple of months first i will find out in about days if clomid was successful for us good luck to you  Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Ovulation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Infertility Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy Progesterone Psoriasis Endometriosis Breast cancer Estradiol Topiramate EastEnders Estrus cycle Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cancer Prolactinoma Sulfasalazine Gonorrhoea Ovarian cyst Hormone replacement therapy Ovary Breastfeeding Sexual intercourse Common cold Breast Migraine Sexual reproduction Cephalexin Paroxetine Maprotiline Boom Town (Doctor Who) Radiation therapy Jam (TV series) Ovarian cancer Oral sex Yarrow Cystic fibrosis Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Anabolic steroid Endometrial cancer Volleyball Chronic fatigue syndrome Antipsychotic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chemotherapy Dietary fiber Bipolar disorder Abortion debate Friends Malaria Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Orgasm Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Chlorpromazine Stroke Cannabis (drug) Spina bifida Cytomegalovirus Omega-3 fatty acid Semen Social rule Estrogen Diabetic retinopathy Niddah Ovum Depo Provera Fecal incontinence Gastroparesis R.

i am due to start my period in days my husband and i have been ttc this last cycle and i am wondering if we did conceive or if my period is coming do the blue veins on your breast usually appear before starting your period or is that a sign of pregnancy i have noticeable changes enlargment of breast more apparant veins on my legs and on my stomach i have child already he is years old and i was so young when i had him i didnt pay much attention to the symptoms so any help would be great i have been searching and searching for some information and i know all the symptoms to expect but i cant find any info that suggests any thing helpful to my situation ok i think that yes it's possible that this could be a sign of pregnancy when a woman gets pregnant her blood vessels start to expand which puts more pressure on your veins this could make the veins in your body become more apparent this is why a lot of pregnant women get nosebleeds it's also a possible reason for increased sex drive i have not read or heard about a similar sign of getting your period i'm going to give you a link to an article about the expanding blood vessels and nose bleeds during pregnancy i haven't read the whole article but if you do there might be something talking about veins becoming more apparent i hope this helps and i hope you're pregnant good luck  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion Bleeding Breastfeeding Turner syndrome Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stroke Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Polycystic ovary syndrome Breast Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Breast cancer Intracranial pressure Autism Blood vessel Stomach cancer Cirrhosis Puberty Blood pressure Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypertension Subdural hematoma Alcoholism Tocopherol Anemia Teenage pregnancy Hemorrhoid Birth control Abortion debate Paget's disease of bone Prenatal diagnosis Premature birth Gonorrhoea Nosebleed Prolactinoma Childbirth EastEnders Coeliac disease Diabetic retinopathy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Androgen insensitivity syndrome Multiple sclerosis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Milton H.

late period negative pregnancy test i am days late i am never late i always start on the exact day i'm due to but i've taken two pregnancy tests that have been negative the first one i took the day after i should have started and i took one this morning i haven't had any cramping or spotting which i always have the week before my period the only thing that feels weird is i feel a tightness in my lower abdomen sometimes and yesterday i had a little lower back pain my lifestyle hasn't changed still normal eating exercising habits and normal stress how long should i wait to test again is it normal to have to wait this long to get a positive result if you are pregnant i'm using the error proof tests it's supposed to have to crossing lines if positive on both of the negative tests just the one line appeared there was a gap in the line i've never seen that before think they're defective or i'm just imagining things it is not normal to not get a pos result if you are that late for your period but it could be that you need to wait a few more days if you still do not have your period or a postitive result you should call you dr there are many things that could effect your being late you could have ovulated late even if you have never had a late period before you still can get a late one you could have implated late and thus you would get a late pos result there are many things that could cause you to not have a pos test yet but after days you should get a pos if you were pregant i did know someone who did not get a until she was dpo and went on to have a healhty baby so it could happen if it were me i would call the dr and ask that they draw blood and test the amount if any of the hcg in your blood  Pregnancy Pregnancy test Obstetrics Fertility awareness Miscarriage Endometriosis HIV test Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Coeliac disease Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human chorionic gonadotropin Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Childbirth Abortion Stomach cancer Breech birth Drug test Anemia Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Insulin Hypertension Ovarian cancer Twin Folic acid Stuttering TGV Angina Spina bifida Vitamin C Friends Tocopherol Cryptorchidism Jon Secada Experiment Operation Market Garden Ovarian cyst Abortion debate Premature birth Milton H.

could i be pregnant hello i have been ttc for a few months now i got pregnant a few months ago and had a miscarriage when i was weeks a long i started keeping track of my cm and cervical position so that i could have an idea of when i am going to ovulate again i had a period on july st my boobs got tender a two weeks after my period so my husband and i had sex on august st i was exspecting to ovulate around the rd th but never did i have been having mild cramps and my boobs are still tender could i be pregnant cervical mucus can be a good indicator but from everything i've read cervical position isn't always the best indicator of ovulation your best bet is to either start charting your basal body temps and or use the ovulation predictor kits it's impossible to tell if you ovulated or not without an ultrasound or bloodwork otherwise with any certainty it is still possible you could be pregnant but save yourself the stress and wait until your period is late to test remember that the more you try the harder it is for your body just try and have fun instead it takes most couples anywhere from months to a year to conceive so hang in there and i hope when it happens it sticks for you best of luck  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Miscarriage Birth control Abortion Pregnancy test Polycystic ovary syndrome Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gynaecology UK Singles Chart Endometriosis EastEnders Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Niddah Premature birth Flowering plant Survivor (novel) Emergency contraception Apollo 8 Endometrial cancer Infectious mononucleosis Autism Neighbours Social rule Childbirth Prenatal diagnosis Premenstrual stress syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Conifer cones 2004 Republican National Convention Health issues and the effects of cannabis Billboard Hot 100 Sharon Tate Drawn Together Madonna (entertainer) Vertebral column Gonorrhoea Cervix Friends Estradiol 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hanging Pitaten HIV test Pelvic inflammatory disease Futurama (TV series - season 5) Blackjack Kodocha Ovarian cyst Marriage Ovarian cancer Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Game show LSD Poker jargon Bulgarian language Civil Marriage Act Acne Weather lore Ben Johnson (athlete) TLC Heartworm The Inside Spina bifida George Costanza Vaginal bleeding Phoebe Halliwell Cervical cancer Fertilisation Craps Fasting Abortion debate Philosophical skepticism Psoriasis Guinea pig Elvis Presley Human height Ectopic pregnancy Human sexual behavior CPU cache Great Teacher Onizuka Sex and the City Kylie Minogue Chiropractic Sexual abstinence Kurt Cobain Cancer

ovulation predictor kits i know that on the leaflet it says not to test whilst pregnant not that i understand why you would because it would give an inaccurate result what i was wondering is if i was pregnant would the line be dark or light surely if i was already pregnant i wouldn't be ovulating just wondering since i am on day and have not had a positive result yet and since we have been actively trying for a baby could this be that i am in early stages of pregnancy thanks usually the kits show a light line for a couple of day before ovulation and then a dark line at ovulation if you get pregnant then they will show up as a continual faint line thorughout the pregnancy i had a miscarriage last pregnancy and so this time the doc suggested i use up my ovulation sticks testing every couple of days to check i was still pregnant that said the cycle that i got pregnant which was a cycle following miscarriage i tested every day from period right through and there was never even a faint line so i assumed i had not ovulated i was also charting my mucas and dates on fertility friend so knew when i was expecting to ovulate the mucas for me was more of an indication as it turned egg white before the date i expected to ovulate however at the end of the cycle i got more egg white mucas and then started getting faint lines on the fertility sticks i did not understand it did a preg test on the off chance and it was positive so i would advise getting to know your cycle and body as the most accurate way of predicting ovulation  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy test Ovulation Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Obstetrics HIV test Twin Birth control Estrus cycle Friends Maya calendar Human chorionic gonadotropin Abortion debate Abortion Multiple birth Coeliac disease Ovarian cancer Ovarian cyst Branch predictor Niddah Tsetse fly Precession Ovum Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Gonorrhoea Flowering plant Fruit Marilyn Monroe Sexual reproduction Religion and abortion Sexual abstinence Prolactinoma Spina bifida Health issues and the effects of cannabis Cytomegalovirus Hipparchus (astronomer) Origin belief Pelvic inflammatory disease Neighbours Gynecologic hemorrhage Prostate cancer Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Female reproductive system (human) Breastfeeding Kasparov versus The World Luminiferous aether Hubble Space Telescope Methotrexate Humphrey Bogart Kodocha ELO rating system EastEnders Normal distribution Junior (film) Milton H.

what exactly is involved with donating your eggs i am considering donating some of my eggs to a couple desperate for their own baby i have had three children of my own yet i know how distressing it is to have trouble conceiving and carrying a baby to full term i'm just wondering what exactly is involved with donating your eggs how invasive is the procedure how long would you be in hospital etc i would love to help this couple out but don't want to jeopardise my chances of having any more of my own children any genuine answers appreciated to hotcakes i actually want to know what is involved with the procedure i know the eggs are 'removed' but you didn't actually say how that is wonderful of you i have thought the same for some friends of ours and here are some of the things i have found donors must undergo a series of hormonal treatments that routinely lead to a month or more of bloating and discomfort and culminate in the moderately painful suctioning of as many as two dozen eggs from their ovaries via a needle inserted through the vagina oocyte donation is invasive physically demanding and often painful donors are required to receive daily injections of drugs that induce ovarian hyperstimulation the ovaries are caused to produce several eggs at a time for three weeks donors must go to the infertility center every morning so that the physician can monitor egg development and take blood samples to ascertain hormone levels indicating egg growth approximately hours before egg extraction donors receive an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin to trigger ovulation and then they begin to take antibiotics to ward off infection several donor related health risks are associated with egg donations which need to be considered seriously fatality has been reported and approximately of those undergoing the procedure are known to suffer from side effects some of the potential health risks associated with egg donation are mentioned below some of the common side effects of the medications include vaginal dryness hot flashes breast tenderness sleep related problems body aches fatigue headache vision related issues respiratory issues mood swings in extreme cases renal failure ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss is another by product of the procedure if it is mild as in most cases it goes away on its own in a few rare cases ohss may be severe and life threatening in some instances all the mature eggs are not retrieved from the donor while in others they may be released early in such cases unprotected intercourse may result in an unwanted pregnancy according to some studies there is an increased risk of ovarian cancer among the donors complications such as infection or bleeding may reduce the chances of pregnancy in the donor in people who suffer from such side effects it is important to understand the factors that promote susceptibility in them these are some of the risks and the site the above answerer gave is also good it can be worth the risk but just be sure it is one you are willing to take good luck in your decision as for us i am and have decided i am going to have one more baby of my own and then do the donation  Turner syndrome Growth hormone Stomach cancer Clinical depression Blood transfusion Hepatitis C Fertility awareness Acne Dialysis Ovarian cyst Paracetamol Ovulation Crohn's disease Progesterone HIV test Intersex surgery Colorectal cancer Insulin Growth hormone deficiency Rocky Mountain spotted fever Breast cancer Folic acid Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Abortion debate Endometrial cancer Coeliac disease Pregnancy Cervical cancer Intravenous therapy Haloperidol Rabies Group A streptococcal infection Emergency contraception Epidural Methamphetamine Ectopic pregnancy Human chorionic gonadotropin Prolactinoma Leukemia Chlorpromazine Obesity Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Glycogen storage disease type I Gonorrhoea Twin Blood donation Acupuncture Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Myocardial infarction Intact dilation and extraction Chemotherapy Stem cell Common cold Ovary

how high are the chances please i really need to know i have a day cycle okay here is the story okay midnight of aug i had sex we used a condom but the condom got stuck inside me and while trying to take it out i think the sperm was squiezed out and from what i calculated on this sit called www mymonthlycycles com i should have been ovulating on the nd or rd i also herd to that sperm can wait around in your body for like up to five days i just want to know what do you think my chances are i'm sche to start my af on the th i'm confused and i don't know what to think thank you guys okay well when i pulled the condom out it was with the end down he tried to take it out didn't work so i tried and when i did the condom had nothing in it we both know he came and the end tip of the condom is what i pulled out first so the end the opening was the last part to come out there is a chance but it's hard to give you a percentage it only takes once you will have to wait for your period to get closer if you are really anxious to know you can buy a first response test days before your missed period i wouldn't worry too much about it until you miss a period you don't want to put that kind of stress on yourself stress can make you not have a period and that makes things really confusing there is a chance you could be pregnant but i'm sorry to say that it's way too soon to tell good luck with everything i hope it turns out the way you're hoping  Condom Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Poker jargon Birth control Oral contraceptive Oral sex Prostate cancer Social rule Pornographic movie Pregnancy Safe sex Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Infertility In vitro fertilisation Sexual intercourse Jackass: The Movie Chris Amon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Peter Shilton Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Time Out of Mind The Inside Extreme Programming Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Niddah Jon Secada Milton H.

if you have egg white cm does mean you are definately ovulating i am just wondering can someone have the egg white like cervical mucus for about days and never be actually releasing an egg ovulating if you weren't ovulating would you not see the egg white cm basically can you have an anovulatory cycle and still see the egg white cm yes you can get ewcm and not actually ovulate alot of women have seen one or two good long patches or ewcm without actually making ovulation sometimes especially if you are under stress like that of ttc for instance you can actually stop ovulation from happening normally your body will retry again but it's still possible that even after the next attempt it doesn't pull off ovulation if you are cahrting your bbt basal body temp you should be able to know without a doubt if you have ovulated because your temps will rise pretty significantly however you still need to chart your cm because by the time your temps rise the egg is long gone just assume that all patches of ewcm are fertile until you have the temp rise to know you've passed your window of fertility for the month  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Emergency contraception Infertility Flowering plant Pregnancy Puberty Progesterone Birth control Oral contraceptive Estrus cycle Temperature In vitro fertilisation Conifer cones Ovum Carpel Sexual reproduction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Kodocha Anovulation Cervix Glossary of partner dance terms Endometrium Female reproductive system (human) Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Niddah Stem cell Eggerland series Fruit Non-human animal sexuality The Star Wars Holiday Special Ovarian cyst Chicken Estradiol Tide Miscarriage Flower Human chorionic gonadotropin Egg (biology) Premenstrual stress syndrome Multiple birth Spider Toronto Transit Commission Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Tobacco Autonomic nervous system Species Sonic the Hedgehog Human cloning Electrophysiology Tsetse fly Shark Twin Dragons (Pern) Egg white Fertilisation Schistosomiasis Human papillomavirus Toronto Subway and RT Blue screen of death Arizona State University Beetle Time Pachypodium brevicaule Compiler optimization Weight training Domain Name System Gynaecology Toronto Streetcar System Theory of conduct Pachypodium baronii In Search of Lost Time Earthworm Pollination Charmed Cellular differentiation Action potential Angling Pachypodium ambongense Coconut crab Arizona Bodybuilding Pachypodium bicolor Social rule Computer virus Pregnancy test God Emperor of Dune Mucus Tuatara NX bit Spore Morphogenesis Extreme Programming G__del's incompleteness theorem Pedophilia Philosophical skepticism

is it true that when a pregnat couple have sex the semen is used to support the unborn baby is it a myth or fact and i mean semen taken in vaginaly not oraly as my question may sound like to some pregnant not pregnat sorry no there is absolutely no truth in that the only role that sperm semen plays in pregnancy is at conception once a woman has conceived the baby develops in the uterus it is within an amniotic sac within the uterus and the mucous plug seals the cervix which is also closed the sperm semen never comes into contact with the baby any sperm that is released into the vagina will drain out of the vagina the only thing that supports the baby is the placenta which is fed by the mother towards the end of pregnancy sperm semen does have the potential to aid in the onset of labor if the conditions are right as it contains prostaglandins cervadil a prostaglandolin gel that is used to induce labor is actually derived from swine aka pig sperm semen  Pregnancy Childbirth Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Artificial insemination Birth control Obstetrics Cervix Oral sex Fertility awareness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual reproduction Menstrual cycle Semen Intact dilation and extraction Breech birth Amniotic sac Premature birth Safe sex Vagina Intersexuality Fertilisation Infertility Fetus Prenatal diagnosis Puberty Human sexual behavior Condom Mammalian embryogenesis Genital wart Orgasm Anal sex Masturbation Twin Marsupial Birth weight Old wives' tale Ectopic pregnancy Spina bifida Progesterone Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Placenta Pornographic movie Sterilization (surgical procedure) Man Sexual abstinence Intersex surgery Diaphragm (contraceptive) Fetal development Adoption Herpes simplex virus Gynaecology Coitus interruptus Pregnancy (mammals) Sexual differentiation Ovary Cervical cancer Roe v.

when you stop using your birth control when do you ovulate next do you still ovulate on the same schedule like days after the first day of your last period or would it be all screwed up from being on bc and then stopping i am trying to figure out when i ovulated i started my period on the th and i should have ovulated arounnd the th right just wondering if stopping bc makes you ovulate later or sooner thanks no stopping b c has messed up my entire menstrual cycle because our cycles tend to be highly irregular just coming off the pill it is often difficult to pinpoint when ovulation has occured most doctors will tell you to wait at least months before trying to conceive not because it can affect the baby but so they can determine with at least a little more certainty when conception may have taken place estimating when conception takes place is difficult enough but it makes it easier when you have had several regular cycles in a row it is important to know that most woman do not ovulate at exactly days every woman is different therefore every woman's menstrual cycle is different sure you can calculate what your estimated fertility window is but again hence the word estimation it is mostly luck and good timing  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Ovulation Ovarian cyst Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Birth control Niddah Estrus cycle Menstrual cup Progesterone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Fertilisation Sexual abstinence Infertility Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Apollo 8 Conifer cones Migraine Anovulation Childbirth Congenital adrenal hyperplasia CPU design Flowering plant Ovary Ovum Hebrew calendar Premenstrual stress syndrome Ovarian cancer Compiler optimization Social rule Endometrium Multiple birth Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual intercourse Chinese calendar End times Inflation Breast cancer Entropy Central processing unit Premature birth Julian day Computus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Depo Provera Dynamic random access memory RISC Biorhythm Abortion debate Malaria Sanitary towel Sleep Carpel Ozone depletion Lancelot Shifting cultivation Tide Pregnancy test Slide rule Time Pelvic inflammatory disease Female reproductive system (human) Ozone hole Computer multitasking Full moon cycle Dominical letter Probability Gamma ray burst Microeconomics Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia The Contender (television series) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Meiosis Hipparchus (astronomer) Numerology Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Fermi paradox Tour de France Sea level rise The Amazing Race Astrology AFI 100 Years series Anorexia nervosa Moss Systems engineering Psoriasis Human chorionic gonadotropin

when can i get pregnant after much research i keep reading that you get pregnant when you are ovulating weeks after your last period can i get pregnant in between that time my appointment with the gyn isn't until the end of the month but i want to get pregnant like yesterday lol please inform me if you are trying to get pregnant you should have sex around the time that you think you are ovulating you can estimate about when you are ovulating by tracking your periods the best estimate of when you are ovulating is acutally before your next period so if you are expecting your period on the th for example you may estimate that you will ovulate on the th this is just an estimate so you may want to try for several days around the th maybe from the th to the th you don't have to have sex at the exact moment or even on the exact day of ovulation sperm remains alive in a woman's body for up to hours and when you ovulate the released egg stays alive for about hours so your best bet for getting pregnant is to have sex every other day or so within a window of days around you ovulation estimate they say it's actually better to have sex every other day instead of every day because the sperm quality is better if it has some time to build up good luck  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Pregnancy test Puberty Oral contraceptive Sexual reproduction Infertility Abortion debate Niddah Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovum EastEnders Twin Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Birth control Fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Social rule Ovary Estrus cycle Miscarriage Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia AIDS Female reproductive system (human) Sexual intercourse Orgasm Drosophila melanogaster Folic acid Sperm Whale Ovarian cyst Day Pornographic movie Big Brother UK series 6 Psoriasis Spermatozoon Blackjack Oral sex Nuclear fallout 10cc Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Jam (TV series) Moss Stem cell Octopus Cytomegalovirus Endometriosis X chromosome Marathon (sport) Whale The 4400 Human The Cursed Videotape Marchantiophyta Prostate cancer Madonna (entertainer) Kurt Cobain Angling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Methotrexate Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Yesterday (song) Gregory Goodwin Pincus Radio Yerevan Sharon Tate Ploidy Have I Got News For You Premenstrual stress syndrome Rosa Parks Sex and the City Humpback Whale Gamete Health issues and the effects of cannabis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Old wives' tale Sexual abstinence Expected value Bee Gees The Beatles discography Estradiol Parthenogenesis Apollo 8 Carpel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hipparchus (astronomer) Herpes simplex virus Shark Death Conifer cones The Children of Men Migraine Friends Whaling Frankie Goes to Hollywood Ocean's Twelve

for anyone who has used ovulation predictor kit what sort of result did it give you we have been ttc for months now and i bought the kit just to make sure that everything is ok with me i have the strips that you put into a sample of wee for seconds and then in minutes it shows a dark line if you are going to ovulate in the next hours i started to test on day as the kit said and it is now day and nothing yet i know that the experts say that ovulation takes place around day if you have a day cycle can anyone tell me what they found out when using these kits ie what day you ovulate especially if it was not around the usual time the reason i am curious was that when my daughter was conceived years ago we started trying the day before my period i remember it well it was the day we decided to try so am wondering if it is possible that i ovulate at a peculiar time thanks for taking time to read my question i am testing mid afternoon as the tests say that anytime between am and pm is best so though i would go between the two thanks for all your answers so far hi people ovulate at different times of the month i'm currently using opks too today is cycle day and i still don't have a positive though i usually ovulate on day so it isn't unusual if you can keep testing daily until you get the positive once you've isolated that window i think you'll greatly increase your chances of conception and you'll know for the next month too good luck  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome HIV test Pregnancy Hebrew calendar Social rule Lance Armstrong Ben Johnson (athlete) Apollo 8 Time Flowering plant Oral contraceptive Tour de France Pregnancy test Birth control Dorama $ale of the Century The nature of God in Western theology Sydney Riot of 1879 Daylight saving time Julian day Law School Admissions Test Year Jeopardy!

do you think that this is odd me and my bf have been together for over years we are currently trying to have a baby we have been using the pull out method before we started trying is it odd that i never once got pregnant in those years using the pull out method by the way i'm he's statistics show that a couple using the pull out method could end up pregnant within a year i would like to say to hottiecj thanks for your rude comment but we are getting married in may hi there i don't think it's as odd as everyone else does people on this board love to say that the pull out method is a sure fire way to get pregnant but its actual failure rates are not that bad with perfect use with typical use says wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki coitus interuptus my partner and i have also used the withdrawl method for three years without a pregnancy he's caused a pregnancy in the past and i miscarried at weeks about five years ago so there doesn't seem to be a problem with our fertilities presuming of couse that the miscarraige was one of the normal one in five fertilized eggs that fails to result in a viable pregnancy i ovulate and have a regular cycle we also avoid having sex when i'm ovulating i've spoken with my ob about it and he agrees that the pull out method can be very effective if the male is good at it my partner is and the other side of the coin of course is that if you are relying on any imperfect birth control you have to be prepared to embrace the consequences we like you are hoping one day for a baby so if we happen to be one of the of couples that will conceive unintentially while using the withdrawl method this year we will be happy to start our family don't stress over being infertile yet if you still haven't become pregnant after a year of keeping track your ovulation and him not pulling out then might be the time to investigate your fertility not now good luck to you  Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Infertility In vitro fertilisation Sexual intercourse Birth control Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Twin Abortion Sexual abstinence Childbirth Knots Landing Multiple birth Abortion debate Coitus interruptus Emergency contraception Obstetrics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Condom Prenatal diagnosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease EastEnders Breastfeeding Marriage Ovulation Days of our Lives Safe sex Ectopic pregnancy History of sex Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Teenage pregnancy Estrus cycle Natural family planning Sexual reproduction Progesterone Neighbours Prolactinoma Coeliac disease Adoption Unemployment Psoriasis Craps Kodocha Theory of conduct Social rule Spina bifida Spanish verbs Childfree Polyamory Infantilism Urinary incontinence Maya calendar Autism Hillary Rodham Clinton Kender Human cloning Flower Elephant Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Famine Endometriosis Anne Boleyn Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breech birth Tocopherol Microeconomics John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Herpes simplex virus Sexual dysfunction Human sexual behavior Intersexuality The Fairly OddParents Fertilisation Ovary Medical analysis of circumcision Drawn Together Health issues and the effects of cannabis Poker jargon Abortion in the United States Charmed Folic acid Laura Schlessinger Causality Satanic ritual abuse Chicken Biology and sexual orientation Inflation Divorce

ok i was wondering if i am still able to get pregnant even though i had two abortions in the past i went through with my first pregnancy and had a little boy he is now and the other is something i dont like to talk about going through an abortion or abortions would not hinder your ability to conceive later unless you had the abortions per se without a doctor present or by your hand in that instance you may have complications you should see your family doctor and explain the circumstances express your concerns and fears about not being about to conceive after the abortions good luck  Abortion Pregnancy Miscarriage Teenage pregnancy Birth control Abortion in the United States Abortion debate Roe v.

what the heck tcoyf related questions i started tracking my cycles recently years on depo year ttc no luck irregular periods which turned into non stop bleeding for two months straight i went to the dr who diagnosed me as insulin resistant pco put me on metformin and clomid i took the meds and the bleeding stopped i tracked my cm on day i had eggwhite then it vanished but then a couple days later i had definate ovulation pain so hubby and i had sex on that day too however my temps have only gone up a little th each day since the day with the ovulation pain did i ovulate or not how do i know if there's no clear shift in the back of the book they talk about a shift by ths of a degree but how do i know if that's what's happening to me am i just overthinking this how long do i have to wait before taking a test i'm also having a luteal phase blood test done soon what will that tell me thank you for all your insights i have read the book twice and am on my third month of charting i think you timed everything correctly i would have intercourse every other day until you see a thermal shift if you are unsure if you have a thermal shift i would still chart this month and then when charting next month see if the same thing happens my doctor said the reason to chart is to see if there is a consistant pattern each month of when you ovulate this was my first cycle of clomid and we timed intercouse starting cycle day day i took the last pill and then every other day until i have a rise in temperature my temperature from about day rose by th each morning but then on day and it went down and stayed lower and today it is just tenths higher than yesterday and it is my cycle day so we are still having intercourse every other day until it rises which i feel will be tomorrow with clomid you will ovulate anywhere from to days after you take the last pill so you may still be fertile remember a major side effect of clomid is drying up the cm so that is why you may have only had one day of eggwhite i would just keep charting and wait to see over a few months if you just have a strair step thermal shift or if this was just a fluke i would also suggest that you have sex every other day until you are sure you ovulated because sperm can live about days inside of you and you want to have it waiting in the f tube where fertilization happens when that egg is released my charting and blood test revealed that i had a luteal phase defect which my dr is hoping the clomid will correct so maybe this is what is wrong with you too just keep at it i know it can be confusing  Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Pregnancy Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Endometriosis Prostate cancer Infertility Progesterone Tide Temperature Stomach cancer Ovarian cyst Sexual abstinence Tocopherol Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Apollo 8 Insulin resistance Niddah Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Chronic fatigue syndrome Ovarian cancer Hypertension Knife Estrus cycle Folic acid Diabetes mellitus Menstrual cup Miscarriage Thermal power station Hebrew calendar Orgasm Oral sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryptorchidism Spacecraft propulsion Sexual reproduction Spider Malaria Abortion debate Depo Provera Electric motor Human sexual behavior Cancer Timekeeping on Mars Bipolar disorder Multiple sclerosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Attic calendar Infantilism Alzheimer's disease Spice Girls Extreme Programming Anal sex Nuclear thermal rocket Strap-on dildo Insulin Acne Polymerase chain reaction Nutrition Musical mode Transsexuality Sea level rise Migraine STS-62 Year of the Spider Thermoregulation Stroke Growth hormone treatment Social rule Fire fighting Dialysis Milton H.

warning tmi but need assistance hi all well yesterday i asked a series of questions concerning ovulation and so forth so i had ordered a package of ovulation and pregnancy strips last week fortunately they were in the mail when i got home so i took two ovulation tests at two separate times between pm and pm both came out positive like really dark and positive not only that but i had the egg white cervical mucous we always look for so of course we ''baby danced'' but today i had bleeding when i went potty like a huge glob of blood and still some egg white cervical mucous it's like a period but way lighter than my normal periods and besides that why would i get a positive ovulation test positives when my period was just around the corner literally what's up is this normal after having sex when ovulating or what i'm so confused all over again thanks in advance ya'll it could be implantation bleeding or you released two eggs this month not uncommon causes fraternal twins or women to get pregnant while on period or it could be just bleeding from sex or i hope not it could be hormones gone haywire i'm sorry you are having problems hope all goes well for you but try to relax at this point and let it have a little more time i have never been where you are at but i do know that is alot easier said than done good luck  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Infertility Ovulation Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Childbirth Progesterone Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Twin Ovarian cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Gonorrhoea Emergency contraception Endometriosis Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Cervical cancer Multiple birth Endometrial cancer Urinary incontinence Puberty Ovary Estrus cycle Cancer Gynecologic hemorrhage Breastfeeding Gynaecology Ovarian cyst Prenatal diagnosis Estradiol Sexual reproduction Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Prostate cancer Human chorionic gonadotropin Stroke Abortion debate Coeliac disease Human cloning Vaginal bleeding Cephalic disorder Diabetic retinopathy Turner syndrome Cervix Anal sex Endometrium Medical analysis of circumcision Niddah Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Premature birth Placenta praevia Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Prolactinoma Transsexuality Anemia Breech birth Autonomic nervous system Oral sex Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Multiple sclerosis HIV test Drug test Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Depo Provera Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bleed Like Me Flowering plant Sex and the City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Insulin AIDS Infantilism Pelvic inflammatory disease Stomach cancer Vertebral column Wheel of Fortune Sleep apnea Genital wart Sexual dysfunction Abduction Phenomenon Homosexuality and transgender Katelyn Faber Gregory Goodwin Pincus Acne Ovum Orgasm Hyperprolactinaemia Sexual intercourse Female reproductive system (human) Pornographic movie Lung cancer Human papillomavirus

does anyone know of any fertility drugs that actually work i want to have a baby but im having a really hard time getting pregnant the thing is i had sex with my friend and he came inside me on my period after my period and before my period and even when i wasnt on my period and i never got pregnant but when he got back with his ex girlfriend she got pregnant with the snap of a finger so honestly im trying to figure out whats wrong with me so does anyone know of any fertility drugs that work or does a doctor have to prescribe them thanks for your help you need some better reproductive information you usually don't ovulate so close to your period usually about halfway through your cycle there are no fertility drugs you can take without a prescription and they are very hard on your system doctors may not prescribe them for someone without a permanent partner having a baby is a serious decision can you support one do you understand that it is a lifetime commitment do you understand that it doesn't stay a baby it grows and requires more and more effort to raise and nurture it into a full grown adult it changes your life forever and there's no going back you give up most of your liesure time and work or school becomes exponentially more difficult please don't get pregnant just because you want something small and cuddly to love that's what kittens are for  Pregnancy Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Polyamory Abortion debate Emergency contraception Jon Secada Prostate cancer One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Sex and the City Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Sex Oral contraceptive Infertility Humphrey Bogart Stomach cancer Sexual intercourse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Psoriasis Sin City Gonorrhoea EastEnders Medicine Transactional analysis Bipolar disorder Days of our Lives Arguments for and against drug prohibition Orgasm Medical prescription Little Britain Homosexuality and Judaism Puberty Homosexuality Daredevil Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Urinary incontinence Reproduction Full House Pitaten The Sims 2 Sexual abstinence Elvis Presley Sex assignment Human cloning Bradley Nowell Treecat The Long Game Conifer cones Pelvic inflammatory disease Neighbours Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Physician Tsetse fly Cannabis (drug) Gender role Prescription drug Avenue Q John Lennon Endometriosis Night and Day (soap opera) Childbirth Survivor (novel) Transsexuality Ovulation Traumatic incident reduction Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Meiosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Paroxetine Sharon Tate Illegal drug trade Strong Medicine Borderline personality disorder Homosexuality and medical science History of sex Milton H.

first morning urine i've read everywhere that you should use first morning urine when taking a pregnancy test but i was wondering what if you don't wake up till sometime in the evening night shift schedule is it the same thing and could a kidney infection mess with your results just curious because i'm almost a week late which is really weird for me i had af like cramps for about days sometime last week but the pass few days haven't had any and my boobs have been sore for a week now which is really weird for me i don't even get sore boobs before af they're kind of swollen and i have a lot of blue veins but i got a negative test days after i was supposed to start my period i don't know i'm just confused maybe i just have my hopes too high since i've been ttc for soo long first morning urine is just a way of getting women to use urine that has been held for at least hours and they didn't drink anything during that time it just ensures that the urine is concentrated so really you can test anytime just hold it and don't drink for at least hours i don't think the kidney infection would interfere with teh results of a home preg test as for your symptoms it really sounds like pregnancy is a possibility make sure you are using a very sensitive test go here to see all the tests and the levels they detect www peeonastick com  Urinary incontinence Kidney Pregnancy Group A streptococcal infection HIV test Gonorrhoea Cytomegalovirus Obstetrics Gout Menstrual cycle Prostate cancer Urinary system Diabetes mellitus Dialysis Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Herpes simplex virus Ben Johnson (athlete) Urine Breastfeeding Kidney stone First aid Diabetes insipidus Insulin Social rule Housebreaking Time Out of Mind Diabetic nephropathy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Marathon (sport) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.

if you have no menstral cycle do you still ovulate i was on the depo injection for about months i bled the whole time i was on it my husband and i decided to ttc and i went off of the injection since then i have stopped bleeding all together and have not had a cycle yet is it possible to conceive while not having a cycle well i know anything is possible but is it likely thanks in advance for any information i need all i can get at this time i think you could probably ovulate and not bleed but i don't think you have a high chance to get pregnant without a period because the reason you have a period each month is because your body anticipates that you will get pregnant and it builds up blood and nutrients in the lining of your uterus and then when an unfertilized egg does not implant to the lining it is shed in what becomes your period so to me it would seem your uterus is not preparing itself for implantation also women can have a period every month and never ovulate i would talk to your doctor because there are medications that can be used to cause your body to have a period  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Fertility awareness Infertility Ovulation Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Endometrium Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Progesterone Ovarian cancer Fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Endometriosis Emergency contraception Birth control Obstetrics Ectopic pregnancy Stomach cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion Intravenous therapy Female reproductive system (human) Gynaecology Niddah Estrus cycle Human cloning Uterus Puberty Tsetse fly Endometrial cancer Erythropoietin Ovary Gynecologic hemorrhage Stroke Prostate cancer Twin Stem cell Menstrual cup Ovum Pregnancy test Premature birth Human chorionic gonadotropin Castration Folic acid Baldness treatments Psoriasis Breast implant Cancer Bleeding Sexual abstinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Depo Provera Intact dilation and extraction Embryo transfer Coeliac disease Blood Multiple birth Sexual intercourse Anovulation Insulin Tocopherol Vaginal bleeding Ovarian cyst Warfarin Pregnancy (mammals) Tourniquet Diabetic retinopathy Borg Friends Prolactinoma Computed tomography Toronto Subway and RT Female genital cutting Lethal injection Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Acne Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Caesarean section Migraine Colorectal cancer Hysterectomy First aid Haemophilia Animal testing Wound Maprotiline Cryptorchidism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Circulatory system Recovery position Subdural hematoma Toronto Transit Commission Methotrexate Boom Town (Doctor Who)

missed period i am ttc month this month i completely skipped my period and obviously thought i was preg not the case the dr prescribed me provera for days to make me get a period anyone had to do this and if so did anyone get preg soon after it thanks for your answers hi it is common for doctors to give hormone pills to regulate your cycle if the doc did this it was for two reasons first to regulate you temporarily and secondly to see if it will stay regular afterwards if it doesn't then the doc may give you pills to take continuously until you get a positive and become pregnant my specialist told me a funny thing he said 'if i hear horses hooves then i look for horses but if i continue to hear horses hooves then i look for zebras' so basically it is a process and just takes time to investigate you will be just fine don't worry but be sure to closely follow the instructions of how to take them pills and what specific day to start a secondary hormone if it was prescribed i did that and by the third month of hormones i got pregnant with my firstborn and as a bonus when she was five months old i got pregnant unexpectedly i had a boy and we are a happy and complete family now  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Birth control Sleep Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Depo Provera Baldness treatments Milton H.

does all the sperm go into the virgina when we have sex as we are trying for a baby i can feel sperm driping down unless thats me vagina sorry i was trying to write and make tea at the same time you don't need all of that sperm to make a baby so i guess that is why some drips or runs out also a small drop of sperm contains thousands of sperm i know this because my husband got a sperm analysis done and we got to look under the microscope there were so many in that one drop you couldn't count them all becareful putting a pillow under your bottom because you can cause the sperm to collect under your cervix which would keep it from entering my doctor says just to lay flat for about minutes and then go pee because you can definately get a uti from not peeing after sex good luck  Fertility awareness Sexual intercourse Sexual reproduction Artificial insemination In vitro fertilisation Birth control Breech birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Pregnancy Orgasm Childbirth Miscarriage Abortion debate Sex organ Strap-on dildo Vagina Genital wart Infertility Jam (TV series) Gonorrhoea Urinary incontinence Fertilisation Semen Female reproductive system (human) The pillows Old wives' tale Anal sex Menstrual cycle Social rule Condom Prostate cancer Pornographic movie Mattress Niddah Penis Human sexual behavior Spider American and British English differences Humphrey Bogart Moss Kurt Cobain Safe sex Spermatozoon The McGuire Sisters Cervical cancer Diaphragm (contraceptive) Obstetrics Intersex surgery Bedbug Male reproductive system (human) Fetal development Medical analysis of circumcision El Chavo del Ocho Menstrual cup EastEnders Toilet humour Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Meiosis Cervix Adoption Masturbation Sperm Whale The Austere Academy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Major League Baseball television contracts Intact dilation and extraction AFI 100 Years series Premature birth Man Intersexuality Poker jargon Gynaecology Boston Public Craps Paul Reubens Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Drawn Together Human sexuality Sex doll Situation comedy Drosophila melanogaster Beetle Sperm whale family Fujian tea ceremony Japanese tea ceremony Urine Parthenogenesis Sex toy Jon Secada Knots Landing American lobster Marchantiophyta Amul Have I Got News For You Professional wrestling match types Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?

prenatal vitamins my mom always insisted that taking prenatal vitamins helped her get pregnant obviously all they contain are vitamins and minerals is it possible that taking them and giving your body the nutrition it needs to function properly actually assists in conception no prenatal vitamins are vitamins not fertility pills they do nothing for fertility itself prenatal vitamins come into play once conception has taken place because you have the peace of mind knowing that your baby is getting valuable nutrients out of the gate but prenatal vitamins have no value in getting women pregnant people are misinterpreting the information they are finding regarding folic acid it does not boost fertility it reduces the incidence of certain birth defects if you have enough of it in your system in early pregnancy good luck  Folic acid Tocopherol Pregnancy Vitamin Spina bifida Nutrition Obstetrics Cystic fibrosis Vitamin C Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Milk Congenital disorder Dietary supplement Fertility awareness Osteoporosis Prenatal care Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Oral contraceptive Anemia Anencephaly Omega-3 fatty acid Alzheimer's disease Isotretinoin Nutrient Postpartum depression Schizophrenia Birth control Abortion debate Retinol Androgen insensitivity syndrome Malnutrition Twin Vegetarian nutrition Carpal tunnel syndrome Human skin color Fertilizer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Emergency contraception Garlic Human height Midwifery Primidone Soybean Sudden infant death syndrome Down syndrome Herpes simplex virus Edward's syndrome Bodybuilding Miscarriage Cerebral palsy Atherosclerosis Vitamin D Hypospadias Cyanocobalamin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Tlingit Childbirth Vitamin K Sexual reproduction Endometriosis Organic food Prostate cancer Soil science Marmite Chronic fatigue syndrome Aloe Genetic counseling Rickets Food Religion and abortion Chlorophyta Coffee Teenage pregnancy Multiple sclerosis Health issues and the effects of cannabis Linus Pauling Turner syndrome Sexual abstinence Scar Breech birth Biology and sexual orientation Chemical abortion Testosterone Osteoarthritis Zinc Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Clinical depression Eutrophication Transsexuality

what could it be my husband and i have been trying to have our nd child for about months now we sorta guesstimated when i was ovulating based simple facts we tried almost every night we were supposed to for about a week my last period started july th then about days ago the th i started to notice some blood when my husband and i were having sex since then for about days i have had some light blood and just tonight i had a brown discharge sorry to be so graphic could this be implantation bleeding or an early period my period isnt due for about days i think i did a home pregnancy test tonight but it still said not pregnant what do you think and when is it a good time to test nurse alexa is my aunt im using her name there is a good possibility that it may be implantation bleeding because people that have experienced it say that it usually lasts around three days and is very very light if i were you i would wait a few more days and take another test and if it is negative wait another week or so and test again because if it is implantation bleeding then that means the egg and the sperm have just met so it may be a while before the test will show positive good luck best wishes and lots and lots of baby dust to you  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Miscarriage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Sexual reproduction Urinary incontinence Niddah Obstetrics Emergency contraception Childbirth EastEnders Ovarian cancer Prostate cancer Ovulation HIV test Endometriosis Gonorrhoea Melanie Wilkes Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blood type Twin Puberty Abortion debate Prenatal diagnosis Gynecologic hemorrhage Neighbours Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stroke Estrus cycle Diabetic retinopathy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Life to Live Abortion Ebola Ovary Friends Fertilisation Soap opera Rod Stewart Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Cytomegalovirus Polycystic ovary syndrome Endometrial cancer Ectopic pregnancy Triage Big Brother UK series 6 Female reproductive system (human) Coeliac disease Premature birth Maya calendar Drug test Sami Brady Social rule Tom Coburn Extreme Programming Piccolo Junior Saga Endometrium Babe Carey Bleed Like Me The Chemical Brothers Sexual intercourse Sperm Whale Cephalic disorder Bringing It All Back Home Clinical depression Timeline of alternative rock Multiple birth Medicine Bleed Like Me (single) The Jazz Singer Stem cell Blood on the Tracks Sam Sheppard Ventricular fibrillation Hiberno-English Victoria of the United Kingdom Psoriasis Fetal development Child sexuality Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Progesterone Lightning UK Singles Chart Billboard Hot 100 All My Children George W.

how long before the pregnancy hormone will show i think i may be pregnant with my second baby i am not due for my period yet some am unable to take a test but i am having all of the signs of pregnancy which i had with my previous is it possible that i could be pregnant definitely possible it really does vary from person to person most women have enough detectable hcg hormone by the date your period is due however some find they are able to detect it eariler like myself days before and some afterwards as some have said you can try using an early test it might work but honestly the longer you can hold out the more accurate the result is likely to be if you opt for a blood pregnancy test they will provide you with a result eariler as the pregnancy hormone shows up in your blood before it shows up in your urine blood tests can be peformed from days past ovulation but you will have to speak with your doctor about getting that done as it is generally only done if you have problems regarding conception  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Human chorionic gonadotropin Pregnancy test Cytomegalovirus Obstetrics Fertility awareness Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Abortion Gonorrhoea Prolactinoma Turner syndrome Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polycystic ovary syndrome Endometriosis Breastfeeding Prenatal diagnosis Emergency contraception Hypoglycemia HIV test Diabetes mellitus Human height Ovulation Coeliac disease Childbirth Spina bifida Abortion debate Anemia Ovarian cyst Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Folic acid Diabetic retinopathy Infertility Gynecologic hemorrhage Hormone replacement therapy Cephalic disorder Teenage pregnancy Birth control Progesterone Diabetes insipidus Hypertension Medical record Cancer Mental retardation Psoriasis Hyperprolactinaemia Insulin Roe v.

how do i conceive a boy its not that i dont want a girl i would just like to have boys first of course i would be happy with a healthy baby no matter what the sex boy sperm swim fast and die fast girl sperm swim slow but live longer basically in a nutshell you need to have sex right when the egg is going to be released so that the boy sperm can get there first if you have sex say days before then the boys will have died and the girls will be waiting for the egg in the uterus i would recommend taking a opk ovulation kit at the pharmacy and do not have unprotected sex after your period untill you get a positive on the opk that means you will soon ovulate and your chances will be higher we are trying for a girl so i have basically given you the opposite all teh best and take care  Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Pregnancy Puberty Infertility Sexual reproduction Fertilisation Birth control Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Oral contraceptive Ovary Abortion debate Ovulation Sex assignment Sexual intercourse Ovum Twin Miscarriage Female reproductive system (human) Ploidy Old wives' tale Cryptorchidism Infantilism Sex Strap-on dildo Anal sex Multiple birth Urinary incontinence Intersexuality Moss Man Sexual abstinence Polycystic ovary syndrome Artificial insemination Sea-Monkey Marchantiophyta Divorce Happiness Transsexuality Atomic Kitten Pornographic movie Swimming Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Spermatozoon History of intersex surgery Breech birth Intrauterine device Jam (TV series) Estrus cycle Masturbation Childbirth Sex and the City Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Fetal development Gay slang Spider Jon Secada Edward's syndrome AIDS Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Neon Genesis Evangelion Male reproductive system (human) American lobster Egg (food) Platypus The Beach Boys in Concert Premature birth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Earthworm Menstrual cup The Beatles discography Hypoglycemia Jellyfish Black widow spider Theory of conduct Child sexuality Beetle Sexual differentiation Pregnancy test Sex and intelligence Chimera (genetics) French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Medical prescription Endometrium Body piercing Spice Girls Great White Shark Sperm Whale About a Boy Human development Sex organ Lindy Basic Friends Halfbeak Rod Stewart

would like to know more about norplants contraceptive and its side effects norplants are contraceptives inserted into the arm for a four to five year period it is said to be safe and can be removed when ever its no longer needed my friend had norplant years ago and she had it in for about years the first year she said it was okay the rods bugged her a lot and her arm would get extremely itchy like an internal itch that couldn't be relieved then around the middle of the second year without her noticing the norplant rods came apart from eachother and one of them drifted and burrowed between her muscle tissue in her lower arm causing extreme pain in her lower back legs and she felt very very sick for months before the doctor noticed that her norplant rods were out of place she got them removed and has horrible scars to show it and it took her almost years to concieve afterwards and yeah she'd also never ever get norplant again even for million dollars if you want a good birth control i suggest getting regular pills that you take every day either that or the shot but it can take up to a year or more to concieve after you've been on the shot for an extended period of time  Birth control Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Endometriosis Emergency contraception Menstrual cup Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acne Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Humerus Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds The Riordans Tocopherol Childbirth Oral contraceptive Condom Depo Provera Pregnancy Intrauterine device Mattress Carpal tunnel syndrome Thermoregulation Puberty Migraine Weight training Breast cancer Mosquito Combine (Half-Life 2) Eye Fox hunting Piccolo Junior Saga Muscle Myocardial infarction Radius (bone) Recumbent bicycle Chronic fatigue syndrome Itch Mandible Spina bifida Occipital bone Scar Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Action potential Androgen insensitivity syndrome Local anesthesia Conjunctivitis EastEnders Days of our Lives Professional wrestling throws Doom enemies Kodocha M16 (rifle) Tyrannosaurus rex Cirrhosis Breech birth Miscarriage Epidural Diazepam Epilepsy Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Hypertension Apollo 8 Sin City Prolactinoma Fast bowling Chernobyl accident Orgasm Pain CGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 Strap-on dildo Soft tissue sarcoma Cystoscopy Insulin Group A streptococcal infection The Inside Aerial (dance move) Decompression sickness Swimming Growth hormone treatment Gonorrhoea Aikido Ectopic pregnancy Human adaptation to space Bruise Multiple sclerosis Folic acid History of intersex surgery Drill bit Scapula Charles Darwin's illness

im trying to conceive ive been off bc for a week just wondering if it can happen right after or a month had sex thursday aug what are the chances im preg this is a complex question and no one on here is going to know this answer for sure and neither will a doctor the reality is that you have a chance at getting pregnant your first month but it is a low chance its something like chance to conceive during each cycle even if you ovulate and everything is perfect i have been ttc for months now and i didnt even ovulate my first month off bc the best thing to start doing is using the ovulation predictor kits and bbt charting as well as examing your cervical mucus for changes i know that sounds gross but your body has a way of telling you that you are ovulating you just have to know what those signs are but dont get frustrated if it doesnt happen right away the statistics are that of couples get pregnant in the first year if you havent had any luck in a year then its time to see the doctor most doctors wont even see u if u havent been trying for a year i hope all this helps good luck to you  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Oral contraceptive Birth control Pregnancy Stomach cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Infertility Atomic Kitten CPU cache Puberty In vitro fertilisation Social rule Game show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Miscarriage Estrus cycle Autism Luck Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Chiropractic Pregnancy test The Five Doctors Progesterone Abortion debate Jennifer Lopez Boom Town (Doctor Who) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Neighbours She Loves You Scarlet Witch Ontological argument Simone Weil Intelligent design Numerology Urinary incontinence Childbirth Phoebe Halliwell Human chorionic gonadotropin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sharon Tate Estradiol Alanis Morissette Friends Fertilisation R.

premarital sex birthcontrol my boyfriend and i had a scare when i was weeks late for my period after that we both decided that we have too much to do before we start a family and neither of us wanted to chance getting pregnant i'm he's and both of us have jobs and are in school its been almost months since our last intercourse and now we are both having nd thoughts on our decision i want to start birth control so that we will both have peace of mind if we resume sex but i'm afraid of the consequences side effects of birth control i need some advice should i start birthcontrol or should we continue our pact of no sex until marriage obviously abstinence is the only sure fire way to not get pregnant every time you have sex even with protection there is a slim possibility of getting pregnant my boyfriend and i had a similar scare at your age right afterward i got on the pill and every time we have sex he uses a condom i have found there's really no downsides to the pill when i first started using it my breasts became just a little bit more tender but my period only lasts days theres absolutely no cramping and my flow is very light of course every woman's body reacts differently to the pill but all of my girlfriends who are on some kind of birth control pill or patch have no severe reactions to it one friend received the monthly shot and got severely sick every time she got it so that's the only one i wouldn't recommend the only real downside is the monetary cost if you're low on money or don't want your parents to know go to your local planned parenthood they'll give you a pelvic exam and prescribe you a pill that you can afford my best friend went that route and it worked out well if you are going to have sex though use a condom and the pill trust me i'm supremely paranoid and having a double defense system really helps good luck  Birth control Oral contraceptive Sexual abstinence Fertility awareness Condom Sex education Knots Landing EastEnders Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Neighbours Endometriosis Prostate cancer Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oral sex Boston Public Urinary incontinence Sexual revolution Teenage pregnancy Religion and sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexually-transmitted infection Herpes simplex virus Breastfeeding Sex and the City Safe sex Kodocha Pelvic inflammatory disease AIDS Gender role One Tree Hill (TV series) Acne Social rule Fasting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Planned Parenthood History of sex Human sexual behavior George Costanza Abortion Radio Yerevan Folic acid Elvis Presley The Catcher in the Rye Puberty Transsexuality Roe v.

can i be pregnant or is it just caused from ovulation my last menstrual period was and my husband and i had intercourse on well this past sunday i noticed that i was starting to spot but it was brownish but i know i am due to be ovulating well depending on how long your cycles usually are you probably have already missed your ovulation window ovulation usually occurs days before your next period happens so if you have a day cycle ovulation usually happens around day if your cycle is more like days long you probably ovulate around day would have been day and unless your cycles are really long you were probably already done with ovulation you are fertile for the days before ovulation and the day after only some women have brown spotting after ovulation and before their next period brown blood is old blood sometimes you might spot before your next period because your progesterone level has dropped the timing is good for this to be implantation bleeding but if you only had sex on then that's probably not what it is if you want to learn more about how to time intercourse better you might try a site like www fertilityfriend com to learn how to chart your cycles i put another site in the resources below that helps you figure out when you are fertile good luck i hope you get your soon  Fertility awareness Ovulation Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy Birth control Estrus cycle Emergency contraception Ovarian cyst Puberty Niddah Sexual intercourse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis In vitro fertilisation Ovarian cancer Obstetrics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovary Endometrium Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pregnancy test Sexual abstinence Gonorrhoea Conifer cones Infertility Premenstrual stress syndrome Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Ectopic pregnancy Miscarriage Orgasm Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Female reproductive system (human) Malaria Menstrual cup Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Urinary incontinence Female genital cutting Pelvic inflammatory disease Breast Hebrew calendar Gynecologic hemorrhage Anovulation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Gynaecology Intrauterine device Flower Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gregory Goodwin Pincus Human sexual response cycle Embryo transfer Astrology Tsetse fly History of sex Sexual reproduction Anal sex Penis Cleveland Browns Endometrial cancer AIDS in Africa Solar variation Marriage Tide Acne Flowering plant The Cursed Videotape Benzene Moss Swyer syndrome Oral sex Breastfeeding Non-human animal sexuality Multiple birth Prostate cancer UK Singles Chart Computus Maya calendar Ovum Human sexual behavior Sex Stroke Religion and sexuality Breast cancer Estradiol Natural family planning Hepatitis Billboard Hot 100 Hyperprolactinaemia Fasting Transit of Venus Rocky Mountain spotted fever Delayed puberty Sexual dysfunction Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Migraine

implantation cramping i had an iui days ago today is dpo i have had light cramping on my right side similar to o cramping however less severe i have been told severe cramping from o is due clomid this was th month took a pt this morning negative could this light pricking in my right lower side be implantation cramping i do not expect af for days it is almost impossible to decipher what the cramping would be right now clomid can cause a lot of symptoms which this could be one of them as for implantation bleeding it is possible but unlikely you would most likely get implantation bleeding with or mostly without the cramping the cramping could be a foreshadow that your period is coming or you could be ovulating later than you expect the biggest possibility is if the cramping is actually gastrointestinal which would be an early pregnancy symptom do you have constipation or dirrhea with it try to keep your mind busy until you can test in days good luck  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Endometriosis Ovarian cancer Ectopic pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Miscarriage Stomach cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Clinical depression Diverticulosis Anemia Urinary incontinence Gastroesophageal reflux disease Fertility awareness Ovulation Hearing impairment Pregnancy test Gonorrhoea Opioid Emergency contraception Premature birth Radiation poisoning Haloperidol Endometrial cancer Cephalic disorder First aid COX-2 inhibitor Coeliac disease HIV test Constipation Cramp Buprenorphine Stroke Prostate cancer Abortion Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriasis Hypoglycemia Oral contraceptive Anthrax Ebola Ovarian cyst Progesterone Von Willebrand disease Hemorrhoid Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dialysis Ayurveda Von Willebrand factor Turner syndrome Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Angiodysplasia Cancer Diabetic retinopathy The Gap Cycle Cystic fibrosis Tocopherol Debugging 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cochlear implant Entamoeba histolytica Charles Darwin's illness Gynecologic hemorrhage Migraine Apoplexy Rat Park Pulmonary embolism Doxepin Group A streptococcal infection Herpes simplex virus Acupuncture Cirrhosis Chlorpromazine Paget's disease of bone Paracetamol Crohn's disease French Defence Adjustable gastric band Tom Coburn Pelvic inflammatory disease Propranolol Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Thalidomide Premenstrual stress syndrome Decompression sickness In vitro fertilisation Diverticulitis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Traumatic brain injury Ehrlichiosis Dietary fiber PlanetSide Mobile phone radiation and health Blood type Xenomorph Sleeper agent

trying to conceive i have always had a day period ever since my menses started at i am now yrs old and my husband and i have been trying to have another baby after months we have not conceived i am wondering if this might be due to the fact that for the past year i have been having such a short period days could this day period be affecting my ability to conceive period length doesn't really have anything to do with conception i would try to pinpoint when you're ovulating and count the number of days between that and when your period starts your luteal phase i read anything less than days means conception will be really tough your body needs that long to deliver a fertilized egg into your uterus and if you start your period sooner than days the fertilized egg might be lost i spent a good amount of money and got the clear plan fertility monitor to help me pinpoint ovulation i was ovulating on day i would never have known that and it would have taken a lot longer than months to conceive had i not purchased it i tried the cheaper ovulation kits but had a hard time interpreting them and never thought to continue using them as long as day anyway try those methods for a few more cycles and then contact your ob for further help good luck  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Puberty Infertility Emergency contraception Maya calendar Fertilisation Birth control Oral contraceptive Endometrium Estrus cycle Childbirth Time Sexual abstinence Tsetse fly Niddah Female reproductive system (human) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Extreme Programming Ovum Microeconomics Progesterone Bipolar disorder Gregorian calendar Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovary Miscarriage Sexual reproduction Conifer cones Human chorionic gonadotropin Hebrew calendar Guinea pig Computus Month The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Galactic Civilizations Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fibonacci number Calendar Flowering plant Twin HIV test Grammatical aspect Central processing unit Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Orgasm Abortion Endometriosis Multiple birth Inflation Labor theory of value Numerology Mountain Gorilla Obstetrics Second Battle of the Atlantic Digital photography Solar variation Leap year Infantilism Gross domestic product Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Friends Labour economics Fermi paradox Octopus Simone Weil Ontological argument EastEnders Hyperinflation Wealth Abortion debate Philo Battle of Kursk Sea-Monkey Chinese calendar Entropy Apollo 8 Astronomy on Mars Julian day Kodocha Sexual differentiation Friedrich Schleiermacher Traumatic incident reduction Rudolf Hermann Lotze Biorhythm Logic Craps Strap-on dildo Scientology beliefs and practices Telephone numbering plan Attic calendar Soil science Monetary policy Lancelot
