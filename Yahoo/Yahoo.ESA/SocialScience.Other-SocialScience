what if someone went to sleep in i wondered about this earlier today i thought about how advanced things are now compared to what my parents and grandparents were used to and i can't imagine life being that much different years from now because we are so advanced then i thought yeah it probably will be way different just look at how much things have changed in the last years suppose you pulled a back to the future and you got the delorean back in time and brought someone back to the present with you or what if someone woke up from a deep sleep or coma right now and the last thing they remembered was the late 's or early 's picture the happy days era what would the reaction be can you picture all the things that would be so different than you remember that it would shock you you should have lived half a century as i have the changes have been amazing i see in movies sometimes an office without computers and i remember those days before computers wow it was truly different then in many ways i remember when my father sent me a strange new device everyone came from miles around off the prairie in an agricultural place to see the device we were all well educated but that device made us giggle like little children people dropped by for a week after it arrived and i let them play with it they would stand outside by their pickup trucks in their coveralls and hold the shiny device in their weathered rough hands and go very quiet they would hand it back to me and stare off across the prairie much as the native americans must have when they saw their first locomotives steaming across that same prairie there was always a strange look in their eyes a little wonder a little worry a little sadness for the changes that the device heralded then they'd smile and shake their heads in acceptance and drive away with their shaken up paradigms i still have that extraordinary device it's one of the first electronic hand calculators  Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Back to the Future Jennifer Parker Milton H.

why do men seem so rude and arrogant in bars clubs i was just wondering why some men seem to be so full of themselves at bars clubs it doesn't happen everytime i go in fact it only ever happens when i haven't paid any particular attention to my looks ie after work to grab a few beers with my girlfriends it's not that it even matters to me as i have a boyfriend and i don't like dancing so i'm rarely within flirting distance when it comes to most of these places but out of curiosity why is it that when i went in all dolled up the guys were acting normal like any other person in a bar but tonight when i was wearing jeans a t shirt no makeup and a ponytail the men didn't just not look to me they had these attitudes like you have no business being here it was such a turnoff and even my friends picked up on the vibes it was even worse the first time i went to a stripclub i realize i haven't spent hours on my looks like the dancers have and that women are rare in those places but the rudeness agh liquid courage is abundant  Homer Simpson Aerial (dance move) Social rule George Costanza Fiddler on the Roof Humphrey Bogart Striptease Recurring South Park characters Ex-gay Beavis and Butt-head Kender Avenue Q Barbie Janet Jackson Shaggy dog story Married... with Children Cliff Richard Turks (Final Fantasy VII) The Smoking Room Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Skinhead Knots Landing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Saved by the Bell Minor characters in Seinfeld Professional wrestling match types Nudity Something Positive Dilbert Good Morning, Vietnam Napoleon Dynamite Kim Possible Sharon Tate Ron and Fez Can't Hardly Wait Dead Like Me The Catcher in the Rye Little Britain RuneScape quests Characters in the Smurfs FoxTrot Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Devil Wears Prada Crazy in Love Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Weebl and Bob Kimi Finster Smallville (Season 4) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boston Public Roxette Haven (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Otaku St. Elmo's Fire (film) Friends Calvin and Hobbes God Emperor of Dune Quarashi Sub-Zero Britney Spears The Shining (film) Paul Is Dead History of subcultures in the 20th century Leo Frank Theory of conduct Minnie Mouse Sex and the City Homestar Runner Japanese grammar EastEnders Mahoraba The Inside The Ashlee Simpson Show For Better or For Worse Dawson's Creek Miss Saigon Sauna Kylie Minogue Piccolo Junior Saga Rod Stewart Philosophical skepticism Scottish country dance Eurotrip Craps Infidels Jennifer Lopez Urusei Yatsura Fight Club Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Appointment in Samarra Coming of Age (TNG episode) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Tupac Shakur ECW One Night Stand Eisner Award The Fairly OddParents

why is my luck so rotten and how can i make it change ok i am trying to reword my question from before to make it more clear i have had bad things happen over and over again some are things that one could attempt to argue that i had some hand in but most are things that i had no hand in whatsoever being in the wrong place at the wrong time etc i want to add that this has affected me in that i have lower self esteem and am afraid of bad things happening so i avoid many circumstances that i really shouldn't so my question is can luck be changed if so how i am going to give an example so that i do not get answers about me changing the way i think one of the many bad things was that someone ran through a red light thereby t boning my car i am since disabled it was one of about car accidents i have been in where i have either not been driving or been hit by someone else not my fault other person ticketed things that are out of my hands out of my control things that i want to stop happening i do not want to think about them differently or learn something from them i want them to stop happening thank you for allowing the clarification you need to unwind at first it seems you are taking things too hard success and failure are parts of life moreover a good patch of time will be followed by a bad one things are never static you must banish negative thoughts gradually replace pessimism by optimism by meditation and by doing things systematically piece by piece can you write a memoir that will help unwind  Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Microeconomics Yoga Sutras of Patanjali 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how do you build up patience wisdom is difficult to communicate you would have to explain you whole life story to someone to get them to understand but then i find my family very ignorant my cousin had a son but he indulges him too much and now my nephew is like a spoiled brat since what i say would sound like gibberish i decided to be patient and wait for their own epiphanies to happen which could take a lifetime i find myself however intolerant to ignorance and misunderstand how can i build up patience all things will be revealed in good time or however the qoute goes i may be much wiser and intelligent and mature than you are but i would not waste my precious time with you fretfully trying to bring you to where i am on the learning curve of life i would instead savor your companionship and appreciate the pleasures of the person you are at the moment that savoring of others that's where we find patience and that's where others around us find the trust to listen to you more often it's not about the compendium of knowledge and wisdom that we obtain privately for ourselves that is important in human relations and love and friendship it is the pleasure of each others company during our daily individual travels of learning that is most satisfying like listening to a great pianist in rapture rather than fretting that i cannot myself play the piano that well or savoring the exquisite moments of discovery that occur among the young the look look i can tie my shoe moments it is in the leisurely pleasures of the meaningful mixed company of others from many places on the learning curve that we rise in wisdom  Nicomachean Ethics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Socrates Happiness Past teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Social psychology Sant Thakar Singh Second language acquisition Storytelling Social rule Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Philo Victor Cousin Religion Friedrich Schleiermacher Love Theory of conduct Rudolf Hermann Lotze Apology (Plato) LaVeyan Satanism Predestination Free will Numerology Meaning of life Joseph Justus Scaliger Pitaten Rule of St Benedict Stoicism Infantilism Bhajan Philosophy of language Horse breaking Duties of the Heart Time Out of Mind Artificial consciousness Utilitarianism Intelligent design Karma in Hinduism Ludwig Wittgenstein Labour economics Geometry Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Classical music era Everwood Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Carl Jung Charles Goodyear Al-Ghazali Earth Girl Arjuna Religious Society of Friends Incarnations of Immortality Goldstein's book Cognitive science Sheikh Abdullah Samuel Pepys Supernatural Pashtunwali Miss Saigon Jewish Messiah God Emperor of Dune Microeconomics Aphasia Time travel Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Paradise Lost Psychology Force (Star Wars) John the Baptist I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue John Howard Yoder Richard Francis Burton About a Boy Vishnu sahasranama Sri Aurobindo Obi-Wan Kenobi Calvin and Hobbes John Cage On the Nature of Things Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S__vign__ Pratitya-samutpada Original sin Consciousness Sadism and masochism Christian eschatology Vulcan (Star Trek) Victor Hugo S__ren Kierkegaard A Course In Miracles Public-key cryptography Creationism Epicureanism John Wycliffe Tiberius Infidels The Death Gate Cycle Eastern Orthodox Church Pysanka

does the concept of dragons prove that dinosaurs and humans lived together i know little about the subject but i believe the concept of dragons is an old one doesn't this basicly show that they knew about dinosaurs i heard a theory that makes alot of sense to me here goes in the past history of primates from which humans evolved large birds talons wings snakes long body venom scales large lizards legs scales again big mouth large teeth were our main predators not dinosaurs per say but a large eagle a large reptile or even a small snake could take out a small monkey put these things together and we get a dragon comprised of the various signals that something was dangerous all in one package why do we have dragons and why do they symbolize danger in one form or another instinct which is genetically encoded memory passed from parent to child regardless if a given person grows up attracted to women or to men everyone as an infant is a 'tit person' that is instinct in action nobody had to teach that to the baby they just know at birth same thing here eating is a survival behavior just like avoiding danger is a survival behavior to me it makes sense that dreams and stories would be a mechanism to help that instinct along there is all sorts of symbolism and ritual connected to boobs and to danger in all sorts of cultures around the world i don't think dragons in history literature or any other realm proves man and dinosaurs walked together at the same time to me it means that the human mind is more complicated that we suppose or want to suppose when the whole creationist we dream of dragons thus we walked with them thus the world is years old thus the bible is literally true want to suppose its just to traumatic to personally established belief systems to be shaken without a fight no matter how irrational or futile the fight happens to be  Human Dinosaur Snake Culture Meaning of life Immortality Free will Animal communication Reincarnation Fictional character Creationism Empathy Human nature Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Brain Apocalypse Meme Supernatural Altruism Nihilism Soul Epistemology Minor Harry Potter Beasts Animism Anorexia nervosa Chinese dragon Sigmund Freud Origin of language Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biology Infantilism European dragon Cognitive science God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate David Hume Young Earth creationism Biped Determinism American Alligator Summa Theologiae Dragon Tyrannosaurus rex Shen Gong Wu Evolutionary creationism Religion Evolutionism Spider Elephant Thermoregulation Creatures in Bionicle Socrates Anthropology Artificial consciousness Emergence Reptile Origin belief Sexual orientation Dog training Karen Horney Philosophical skepticism Scientology beliefs and practices Plesiosaur Philosophy of mathematics Evolution Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist History of creationism Flood geology Science Property (ownership right) Ecology Bird Deluge (mythology) Aquatic ape hypothesis Tetrapod Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Metaphysics Phaedo Breast Music Causality Psychoanalysis Lizard Fauna of Australia Animal Cat Gnosticism Shaggy dog story Intelligent design Toilet humour Buddhism Reptilian humanoid

how do you know who you are inside i can't seem to figure out what i like who i am or anything like that i think i try to please my mom and dad to much they seem so proud and i worry if i change that they won't be as proud of me i just want to know who i am because of the above reasons and because i'm in high school and isn't this supposed to be a time of self discovery self and mental growth i personally believe you don't really know exactly who you are until you reach your late twenties to early thirties there will be constant changes in values and priorities and they will come in stampedes during the years leading up to that i am addressing your comment of pleasing your parents you can certainly start setting your compass in the direction of things that you think you might want to do in life but when you get down to brass tacks in your head you will find at your age that you are farrrr away from the person you will end up being in your late twenties early thirties normal though i think pleasing your parents is important during your hs years you will find whatever it is that pleases your parents probably is a positive thing anyway that you will be glad you stayed focused on while you are living with them you have plenty of time to do your own thing later in life i say all this not knowing what your parents have you doing though lol assuming they are healthy normal things hang in there and soon you will be running your own life and figuring out what pleases you and at times wishing you were back where you are now lol it's something to look forward too  Infantilism Social rule Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RISC EastEnders Theory of conduct Carl Friedrich Gauss Late Night with Conan O'Brien Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Intelligence quotient Objectivist philosophy Fathers' rights Humphrey Bogart Human height The Cure Sailing Friends Normal distribution Milton H.

why are we forced to choose between creation and evolution isn't it both cleo when i mean forced i mean by society it seems that we have to pick once side or the other you are right no one forces us to believe in one but when it comes to debate it seems t that there is no room for joing the two also christians are not the only ones who believe in creation if more people thought like you did things would be alot simpler i think similarly to you a divine being created every thing but things still had to evolve  Intelligent design Creationism Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion History of creationism Theodicy Human nature Occam's Razor Sri Aurobindo Biblical inerrancy Evolutionary creationism Evolution Creation-evolution controversy History of evolutionary thought Free will Phillip E.

bbc neo nazis growing in spain in order to drive out muslims and blacks your thoughts is europe getting to the breaking point of blacks and muslims refusing to assimilate and changing the white culture in spain and the rest in europe how is this different with the mexicans here in america refusing to assimilate is a race war coming i don't think so in america many have integrated themselves into the american culture while retaining much of the traditions and aesthetic preferences which made their native country unique and worth emulating my idea is that a long term solution can be globalization on a grand scale if we can create global opportunities for success irregardless of the point of origin we can begin the first baby steps toward a world economy we need to create job opportunities within one's country of origin so that there is no need for mass emigrations the only drawback to this solution is that many service jobs can only be performed within the first world countries these services cannot be outsourced one idea for a solution to this conundrum is to automate many of these service functions by the use of service bots then we can pay the workers who service and control the bots a wage high enough to induce natives to embrace these jobs an example is to invent and implement service bots that are orders of magnitude more sophisticated and automated than the floor cleaning bots that are now widely available in short i believe that pay equity is the key in the short term  Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Affirmative action Jew Extreme Programming Free trade Immigration to the United States Strategic management Keynesian economics Offshoring Economic inequality Wealth Diaspora IBM Genetic algorithm Capital accumulation Culture Outsourcing Internet Relay Chat MMORPG History of the Jews in the United States Microeconomics Lindy Hop Globalization Generation X Efficiency wages Supply and demand Great Depression Minimum wage Ethnic cleansing Computer CPU design Mexico Kyoto Protocol Call centre Population transfer Ghetto Wall Street White (people) Marshall Plan Roaring Twenties Tourism City World government Mercantilism RISC House of Bourbon Trade Mennonite Information Technology Infrastructure Library Melting pot Microsoft Mach kernel Rational Unified Process History of the European Union American Conservatism Algorithm Ford Motor Company Airline Bosniaks Scientific management Franz Boas Spain African American Soviet Union Capitalism Basque people Labour economics Japanese tea ceremony World Wide Web Nazism Total war Imperialism in Asia Advertising The Holocaust American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Famine Middle Ages Nationalism European Union History of Europe Inflation Sephardi Jews Black Legend Debt Jewish history Immigration reduction Commodity markets English language Classical music era Management information system Deflation (economics) Celtic Tiger Liberalism Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy

how do we see further than cameras even when they are zoomed in if you have a camera in your hand and you zoom in on something you can still see further than it how is this possible when you are holding it further than your eyes and it is zooming in you may be referring to the concept that your field of vision is much wider than most camera lenses however a camera with a zoom lens is capable of capturing object details which cannot be seen by a person who has vision the human eye's visual receptors are not as capable as some of today's highly sophisticated cameras in terms of capturing details of objects which are located at extreme distances  Photographic lens Digital photography Camcorder Eyepiece Single-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Digital camera Leica Stereoscopy Depth of field View camera Binoculars Computer vision Zoom lens Color IMAX Nikon Corporation Photography Amateur astronomy Anamorphic widescreen Machine vision Digital camera back Digital single-lens reflex cameras Binocular vision Light Konica Minolta Autostereogram Computer Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Combine (Half-Life 2) Color vision Lens (optics) Film Map Eyeglass prescription Dolly zoom Visual acuity Visual system Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Canon FD Movie projector Aperture Motion capture The Matrix Retina Thief (computer game) Canon EF lens mount Cinerama Technology in the Stargate universe Aberration in optical systems Motion picture terminology Panavision Blindness Geographic information system Telescope Blender (software) Parallax Unreal Tournament 2004 Contax Fractal Frame rate Video camera tube Black hole Joel and Ethan Coen Bates Method Zooming User Interface Depth perception Rangefinder camera Color blindness Pinhole camera Reflecting telescope Light-emitting diode F-number Spatial disorientation Widescreen Color temperature User interface Diplopia Night vision Vector graphics Voyager program Microscope Street photography Contact lens Telescopic sight Sense Eye contact Cinematographer Perspective projection distortion MS-06 Zaku II Glasses Bullet time Pixelation Schneider Kreuznach Gamma ray burst Laser BloodRayne

smart but unsightly people how much iq would you sacrifice to gain beauty i'm at about the th percentile in iq but maybe the bottom half for looks i'm wondering if i'd do better in life if i could hypothetically give up a small amount of iq for a large gain in beauty like iq point per percentile gain in looks that is too greedy but percentiles isn't enough i feel my iq is so i have some to spare without dropping much on the distribution and i'm wondering if i would have been better off if i had been given a slightly different genetic hand i have a brother who i'm slightly smarter than but he's significantly better looking and has gotten a lot of breaks in life as well as better treatment so it kinda pisses me off i'm not in bad shape or bad hygiene either it's just natural beauty any smart people out there craving more beauty in theory i extend this to hot people craving more smarts as well although i presume they would be less capable of comprehending all of this depending on just how lacking in smarts they are yes i'm banking on the surgery bit even so there is no substitute for natural beauty it's something to be exalted well i've always gotten good marks on iq tests and i'm as ugly as a pig's butt well i think so but then i do have low self esteem yet i have never felt the need to excell and have just spent my life sofar relaxing and entertaining my brain i have almost always managed to find female companionship and they have all been interesting people and pretty although that has never been a requirement for me to be friends with someone i do not care for appearances or status or wealth and have never striven for or attained any of them it has never interested me having said that i do believe that if you want to acquire status and or wealth you would find it much easier to do so with good looks than with a high iq so if i ever decide i want success in the world of money and status damn right i'd sacrifice iq for beauty but only enough to lower me down to above average no use being a moron an iq of would suffice to ensure one could move successfully in the world but it would be the good looks that would open the doors definitely  Microeconomics Social rule Wood carving Poker jargon Crash test dummy Economic inequality Obesity Equine conformation Inflation Capitalism MP3 Love Economy of Russia MMORPG Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Race and intelligence Prisoner's dilemma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Supply and demand Transsexuality Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Drill bit Puberty Physical attractiveness Wealth Cocaine Philip J.

what is the mechanism of retainning and rerival knoledge from our memory cells in brain is our knolege in memory cells is chemical changes or electrical one and how we retrive old events in seconds i think our memory is a series of process which involve both chemical electrical changes to my knowledge scientists still haven't found out the exact mechanism how it work if you find out any relevant materials please tell me but my previous research on the web may be helpful to you part of it is as follows there are three basic questions to ask about memory how are memories formed encoding how are memories retained storage how are memories recalled retrieval encoding is an active process it requires selective attention to the material to be encoded there may be different levels of processing which occur and that some are deeper than others but there is no definition for what is meant by deeper structural encoding emphasis on the physical structural characteristics of the stimulus is a shallow level phonemic encoding emphasis on the sounds of the words is an intermediate level semantic encoding emphasis on the meaning is considered deep processing about storage the most accepted model states that there are three stages of memory storage sensory store short term store and long term store sensory store retains the sensory image for only a small part of a second just long enough to develop a perception short term memory stm lasts for about to seconds without rehearsal of the information with rehearsal short term memory will last as long as rehearsal continues short term memory is also limited in terms of the number of items it can hold see miller capacity is about items can increase capacity by chunking combine similar material into units short term memory allows one to recall something from several seconds to as long as a minute without rehearsal its capacity is also very limited george miller when working at bell laboratories conducted experiments showing that the store of short term memory was items the title of his famous paper the magic number modern estimates of the capacity of short term memory are lower typically on the order of items and we know that memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking for example fb iph dtw aib m vs fbi phd twa ibm beyond finding meaning in the initialisms above herbert simon showed that the ideal size for chunking letters and numbers meaningful or not was three short term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information and to a lesser extent a visual code conrad found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of words that were acoustically similar e g dog fog bog log long term memory has been suggested to be permanent that nothing is forgotten only the means of retrieving it is lost long term memory is believed to work semantically baddeley found that after minutes test subjects had the greatest difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings e g big large great huge memory retrieval is not a random process cues can help with retrieval context cues perhaps it is the process of reinstatement of context cues that accounts for the helpfulness of hypnosis in recall mood state dependent memory refers to the improvement in recall that can occur when the same emotional state is created as was present in the acquisition phase our memory is billions of routes and the ones that are easiest to travel and not inhibited by any other factors will be preferred like the path from the water drop on the book so more activity in certain routes will make it easier for signals to travel in the memorized directions theories of forgetting ineffective initial encoding pseudo forgetting usually occurs because of ineffective attention in the acquisition phase decay forgetting occurs because memory fades with time sort of like the effects of friction but time is in and of itself is not a variable it is only a medium in which processes can happen interference forgetting occurs because of competition from other information retroactive interference new information interferes with what has already been learned proactive interference old information interferes with what is being learned retrieval failure sometimes we can not remember something which at another time we can remember it perhaps this is because of the context cues or retrieval cues present at the time motivated forgetting we may tend to forget things that we do not wish to remember freud  Philosophy of language Short-term memory CPU design Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache Password Human Philosophy of perception Expert system Artificial consciousness Psychology Visual cortex Explosive material Information warfare Iconic memory Color Clinical depression Cognitive psychology Dyslexia Long-term memory Causality RISC Milton H.

being number one in any field hi i was wondering if you can give me some qualities altitude and achievement that the elites of any field eg sports business educator etc have such as discipline waking up earily working harder than anyone desiring that one thing more the any other person and so on because i am fascinated with this subject thank you no doubt disipline is one quality but it's a recipe to a larger reason to wanting to become number one in a certain field take donald trump why is he one of the best disipline commitment this small qualities that make big results are driven by his passion he loves what he does he loves making deals that's why this field he's in is suitable for him at his best to be the best you must be driven by passion and a compelling reason to succeed in that field sometimes we people want to do things beyond our abilties things we have never done before but have now raw talent in that is where compelling reason comes in where as a very powerful reason a powerful benefit for your future will give you the force desire to disipline yourself why many people cannot be number in certain fields is because they don't have a strong enough want to achieve that field what benefits does doing a certain field give you financial freedom acknowledgment depends on the reason many people live in comfort of where they are and never gave a reason so strong that could push them forward to do the uncomfortable and to succeed above all in the field they desire to succeed in if you have a field you want to be the best in then you have to first think with an end in mind it has to be what you truly love and how it can contribute to you and those you care about around you when you succeed you must be able to see feel and smell success in that field before you even attempt that field proactives which is driven by desire to be number which is driven by passion activated by a strong compelling reason to succeed what is your chosen field and how bad you you desire it if you think talk dream about it it is likely that is your passion and a great chance to succeed disipline cannot be forced entirely when you have a reason that is larger then life you will disipline yourself in what needs to be and not be done in order to succeed one must have a dream passion gives you the drive to be number in the field compelling reason gives you the reason to take a step further in becoming even more successful in the field burning desire to want the success of your field fighting day after day without much rest prepared ready fired up and proactive sharpening the saw of your abilities day after day but of course all this is useless if you do not have one important factor how do you know if you have passion or not for this field as stated above when you live dream think talk about it sense of urgency that you wake up in the morning and right away you rush out get ready as fast as you can preparing to continue your life journey towards your goal your dream the fact that you sleep you think about it reflect upon improvements and changes to become better in the field to wake up every morning ready excited and commitmet to face the challenges of your field without holding back without fear that's how successful people of their respective field become number they have a passion compelling reason burning desire and sense of urgency  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jon Secada Spice Girls K' Theory of conduct Phaedo Force (Star Wars) W.I.T.C.H.

why do most people only have friends that look like them would your parents disapprove if u brought home someone different well most younger people grow up in an area where most people are of similar socio economic backgrounds so that can contribute also people may just gravitate towards people that have similar religions so they may be of similar backgrounds or heritages or languages etc for example an immigrant may feel more comfortable speaking in their native tongue and therefore might hang out with a group that speaks that language a poor kid may not be accepted or feel accepted in a group of predominately richer kids  Melting pot Economic inequality Culture of the United States Southeast Asia Standard Cantonese Amish Vietnam Portuguese Creole Black (people) Hindu French people Bosniaks Rastafari movement Mormon Spanish language Indonesian language Indo-European languages Korean adoptee Mexico English people Multilingual Italian language South Africa Hispanic Vietnamese language Southern United States Moldovan language Italy Canada Latin America Hindi Assyrian people Malay people Demographics of the Philippines Religious Society of Friends Catalonia Homophobia Standard Mandarin Russian language Languages of France Jew Irish Newfoundlanders Autistic community Filipino people Esperanto as an international language Turkic peoples Speciesism Hebrew language Madhya Pradesh Charismatic Welsh language Laos Chinese Filipino Scouting Religion Pentecostalism Slavic peoples Indigenous peoples of the Americas Midwestern United States Newfoundland Johannesburg Mission (Christian) Swedish language History of Finland Swami Vivekananda Pashtun Adivasi China Milwaukee, Wisconsin Sexual orientation Palestinian Child Arab Holy Spirit Duala peoples Education George Orwell First language Patriotism Joni Madraiwiwi Demographics of Argentina American Jews Filipino American Kyle Broflovski Taiwanese (linguistics) Swedish people Languages in the United States Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Foreign language Second language acquisition Africa Commonwealth of Nations Third Culture Kid Language demographics of Quebec Colombia Basque people Demographics of Japan Kazan German language Languages of India

why are opera sung in italian why i mean it could be in french or english or german didnt french and austrians write opera themselves mozart was austrian i just saw amadeus and now im curious about some things what is opera or opus anyway when did powdered wig fashion die out and why was salieri really a madman what is don giovanni about what is a requiem why am i an agnostic so interesting in catholicism now anyway for some strange reason im attracted to catholics were the austrians catholic or prostestant i wonder what being a priest is like im takeing confessions when casanova comes to me catholicism sure seems like an outrageous religion to be in the scandals the horror the myths the legends the comedy the romance the satires the drama sometimes i feel left out because i wasnt born a catholic lol but who wants to be a slave to religion its like being in dimensions when you could be in that's quite a lot of questions to be answered here why not take a music appreciation class or a class on catholicism or check out some opera or catholic websites there are plenty of them out there but here's a few answers so you don't feel completely bashed on here operas are written in many languages there are a number of very good operas that are written and performed in english opus is singular opera is plural the literal meaning is a work a creation of music art literature etc a magnun opus means greatest work of art one has created opera is what one calls the form of musical and dramatic work in which singers convey the drama versus a play where the actors speak the words as for whether or not salieri was a madman was anyone's guess he did enjoy success in his time and was something of a mentor rival of mozart if the play movie amadeus is to be believed salieri was intensely jealous of mozart's success and mozart mocked him a lot such things could lead to obsession and eventually mental illness however i think it was more a matter of a friendly rivalry and a bit of office politics within the royal court as it were a requiem is a formal catholic funeral mass or the music written for such a religious service as for austrians and catholicism at the end of the twentieth century about of austria's population were registered as roman catholic while about considered themselves protestants now whether they actually go to church anyone's guess a friend of mine from austria told me they have to pay church taxes so a lot of folks refuse to go to church for that reason who says all catholics are slaves to their religion or anyone else who believes in a higher power people often make their own decision on what parts of a religion to believe and hold onto and what part is useless to them agnosticism doesn't seem to be a matter of being in demensions to me it's a state of doubt but that's ok doubt leads to questioning and seeking the truth and that is what i think you are doing unless you are a very skilled troll but i don't think that's the case well time for you to hit the library or at least the net happy learning  Amadeus Classical music era Antonio Salieri Symphony Requiem (Mozart) Roman Catholic Church Joseph Haydn Religion Franz Schubert Musical works of Mozart Opera Literature Opus Dei Austria History of literature Agnosticism Choir Drama Theology Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Fugue Trombone Atheism Bosniaks Charles Darwin's views on religion Bertrand Russell Separation of church and state History of theater Life and work of Ludwig van Beethoven Beethoven and his contemporaries Giuseppe Verdi Existence of God Baptist Idolatry Fidelio Arthur Machen Novel Ludwig Wittgenstein Religious pluralism Alcoholics Anonymous Sonata (music) Theatre English literature French literature of the 17th century Culture of France Mass (music) Mennonite German language EastEnders Spanish verbs Evolutionary creationism Louis XIV of France Requiem Freemasonry Reactionary Polish theater Funeral Catholicism God Marie Antoinette John Wycliffe History of Europe Fr__d__ric Chopin Theory of conduct Rich Mullins Arnold Schoenberg Church of Christ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Max Weber Pierre Beaumarchais Christianity Sydney Riot of 1879 Baroque music Minor Discworld characters The nature of God in Western theology Church of Scotland House of Bourbon Gioacchino Rossini Eastern Orthodox Church Augustan drama Funeral of Pope John Paul II Protestantism Scientology beliefs and practices Romantic music Justification (theology) Minister of religion Infant baptism Social rule Moli__re Philip II of Spain

is humanity in trouble i believe it is simply because we have no rules to live by and everyone lives for themselves and bases their whole existence on money and devising ways how to get it everyone's life is based on their own work school interests like clothes electronics sex etc and no one thinks or cares about the next guy too much people aren't too educated so they can't see past their immediate surroundings and don't seem to possess higher thought abstract processes for the most part their thought process is i agree i don't agree i do this i do that i don't care with humanity in the state which it is today with everyone almost being a hypocrite and doing things and hiding it for society and trying to outsmart the system and everyone else and genererally being unhappy and lost their purpose in life how can it not be in trouble if people have it good have lots of money etc they try to live it up and ignore the problems but they have no idea what goes on around god and religion aside because that can stir up enough debates on its own too many people focus on little things like their own interests and fields like history writing chemistry etc and devote their whole lives to it and seem to block out anything else i believe this is our downfall we focus too much on our own selves and interests and to hell with everything else and how it happens that's going to lead to a disaster scenario that's why we have beautiful movie theaters out there in la and beautiful chain restaurants and beautiful malls and all these shiney things and gadgets but if you look around you see attitude unhappy people social problems galore and lots of neighborhoods getting trashed up it's because people expend their energy for the dollar and the finished product but to hell with humanity itself it's all about the money products that's how i see the world and it's sad that others are blind to this b c they're too focused on work and anyone who doesn't agree to this question which you're entitled to my opinion is that you're just dreamers or living through rose colored glasses with your hopes and optimistic outlooks on the world and humanity you are idealists you don't really see it how it really is you're seeing it for what it could be that's not wrong but it's also not adressing the problem at hand whatsoever you can have faith that a drug addict will become a wonderful world leader one day but in the mean time they're still drug addicts get it prolly not b c you don't care you're too busy gettting that dollar and caring about yourself the biggest thing is this is all going to bite us at the end more school shootings more violence more bs more of everything nobody is safe when are we going to wake up yes humanity is in trouble we are struggling because our old methods aren't working and we aren't in agreement on what new methods will work regardless of how intelligent we try to be at the end of the day most people just do what the guy next to him or her is doing we are good at identifying threats like a punch on the nose but not good at identifying threats that we can understand clearly only with our intellect and reasoning like greenhouse gases like propaganda like the politics of fear the challenge for the human race is to rise above our biological and psychological limitations i think science is part of the answer i think peace justice and putting people before profits are the priority for me but of course at the end of the day every person must act in accordance with what they believe no life is a waste no conscious mind will go unutilized and hopefully our good intentions will average well on balance with the bad do not despair but you are correct that there are big challenges ahead gonna take a lot of work i recommend that you get politically active you sound like someone who is seeking peers who want to see change real change you are not alone you can do something about it seek and ye shall find  Theory of conduct Soul Goodness and value theory Theodicy Religion Economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sigmund Freud Sexual orientation Simone Weil Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Law of value John Howard Yoder Psychology A Course In Miracles W.

anyone know of any examples of disability discrimination more info to follow need examples to back up a question the question involved a mentally disabled child being refused to participate in a yoga exercise class at a voluntary community centre i was once ordered out of an empty shop with my daughter who is a wheelchair user why their excuse was on the door was a sign no pushchairs allowed in so my argument was this is not a pushchair etc anyway eventually manager come out and said his assistant was right no pushchairs so i said why do you not put on door along side pushchair wheelchair his reply oh that would cause offence so being told to leave shop is not as for your question bit woolly there most fitness classes have guidelines to fill in and questionnaire for all and the yoga teacher may have not understood disability enough to be confident or trained in teaching someone with a disability as they have to be able to understand instructions so they do not get hurt so refusal may have been on those grounds yoga is an exercises you have to be careful in my daughter was once refused to go swimming with day centre they said it was because no one was qualified enough to know what they were doing with her in water and it was for her own safety nothing more nothing less disability discrimination now has a lot of power for instance local authorities have to make all places wheelchair friendly and so do many businesses now when i ran a small playgroup i also had to adear to all the guidlines provide multicultural toys books cooking utensils clothes ect and also to ensure disabled children were accomidated so if a disabled child went to playgroup nursary school the proper equipment has to be provided by law if they have not got it they have to buy it if the do not then that is discrimination not adering to their needs forgot to add this it is only discrimination if the yoga teacher refuses to do anything to assist the disabled child by getting someone in who can or reccommending another place  Yoga Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Japanese tea ceremony Appeal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mental Health Act 1983 Education in the United States Wal-Mart No Child Left Behind Act Learning disability Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Civil rights Swimming pool Hate speech Separation of church and state Sento American and British English differences Acting President of the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Nurse Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Wheelchair Involuntary commitment Disability Social work Little Britain Franklin D.

would it be better to get rid of income tax and just put an extra or pence on the goods and services we buy if you think about it in the uk we actually pay soo much more than the income tax rate i think the standard rate for income tax is however why doesnt national insurance get included in that because it would make an income tax percentage that would make people revolt so the government cleverly hide all these extra taxes on well everything vat already exists on most of the goods we buy so adding a couple of pence wont work as we already pay pence for each pound of value that we spend on these goods tax is everywhere for example if i earned gross less income tax less national ins less per month council tax then if i was to spend all on vat inclusive goods x so from the total tax deductions would be therefore i feel hard done by out of in this instance i would get taxed now this doesnt take into account airport taxes fuel road tax and any other taxes we pay without realising i think it stinks if the government did it all as one deduction from your monthly wage we would all hit the roof as we would realise how much we have stolen from us when it boils down to it the government charge us for living in this country and charge us for the privilege of letting them run mess up our country why should we be charged for a human right last of all i know this is a sermon i believe that income tax was first introduced into the uk during the penninsula war with napoleon and france at the start of the 's it was a costly war as great britain had to use much of the cavalry of saint george golden guineas to bribe other european countries to keep fighting napoleon as this was expensive coupled with the cost of the army in spain income tax was introduced when the tax was abolished i forget the date someone of note loudly proclaimed that parliament should burn all records of the tax so that no one in the future could ever believe that such a propestorous tax ever existed i think they had the right idea  Tax Value added tax Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Flat tax FairTax Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Income tax Social Security (United States) Compensation of employees National Insurance Publicly funded medicine Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Credit card Measures of national income and output Capitalism Money Gold standard Economy of Russia Progressive tax Great Depression in the United Kingdom Pound sterling Insurance Inflation Hyperinflation Surplus value Economy of the Republic of Ireland Tax deduction Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Annuity William Pitt the Younger Sales tax Wal-Mart Productive and unproductive labour Euro Bond 401(k) Member of the European Parliament Health savings account Mutual fund Liberal Democrats (UK) Minimum wage Toll road Capital accumulation U.S. public debt Taxation in the United Kingdom Personal finance Deflation (economics) Property tax History of the United States (1789-1849) Hybrid vehicle Economy of France Economy of the United States Income statement Value product Stamp Act Student loan Postage stamp Margaret Thatcher Franco-Prussian War Social Security debate (United States) Supply-side economics Canadian and American economies compared Income Nuclear power phase-out Value added Tariff Economy of Norway Corporation Trickle down effect Airline Sport utility vehicle Government debt Anarchism and capitalism Labour economics Keynesian economics New Model Army Currency Capital gains tax Economic inequality History of the European Union Efficiency wages Fuel tax Warren Buffett Tax haven Operating surplus Kyoto Protocol Commune in France Mortgage Canadian Pacific Railway Napoleon I of France

what would the world been like in if germany had won the second world war if they had one wwii then it is likely that germany would have continued to expand and would have taken over much of europe many of the countries there england france and smaller european countries as well would probably be speaking german right now instead of their own respective languages the population would be severely down from today they most likely would have continued mass killings of jews and other minorities and they will probably be come 'extinct' in those areas moving instead to places like the us and canada which are only spared due to the distance and logistics of said distance on warfare on the positive side many medical advances came from the holocaust due to the nazi's expermental testings and disregard to human welfare stemcell research is probably out of the research phase and into daily practice and use cloning could very well already be a part of their daily practice as well but thats just my guess  Jew European Theatre of World War II Polish September Campaign Schutzstaffel Expulsion of Germans after World War II Romania during World War II International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement The Holocaust Ethnic cleansing Eugenics Holocaust denial Germany Total war German language History of Europe Nazi Germany Population transfer Jewish population Czechoslovakia World War I France in modern times Jewish languages Kristallnacht Occupation of Denmark Concentration camp Ashkenazi Jews Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Nazi extermination camp Neo-Nazism Military history of France Operation Barbarossa RAF Bomber Command Nation-state Final solution History of the Jews in Poland Canadian Jews History of Lithuania History of the Jews in the United States World War II casualties Eastern Front (World War II) Blitzkrieg Franco-Prussian War Mein Kampf German camps in occupied Poland during World War II End of World War II in Europe Causes of World War II Japanese war crimes Nationalism Europe Cold War History of Poland (1939-1945) Germans Anti-Semitism Latvia Hungary Responses of Germany and Japan to World War II crimes Warsaw Ghetto British Mandate of Palestine Bombing of Dresden in World War II Terrorism Battle of France Nuclear warfare Demographics of France Freedom of speech Sami people Racism Persecution of Jews British Army History of Germany since 1945 Hitler in popular culture Revisionist Zionism World War II atrocities in Poland Consequences of German Nazism World Communist Movement Anti-communism History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union History of Germany World War II evacuation and expulsion Asymmetric warfare Nazi concentration camps Animal testing Vichy France Independent State of Croatia Armoured warfare Haredi Judaism T-4 Euthanasia Program Democracy The Manchester Regiment Aftermath of World War I Messerschmitt Me 262 Irish Guards History of the Jews in China Technology during World War II Max Weber Middle East Campaign Arabs and anti-Semitism History of Latvia Population history of American indigenous peoples Welfare state

why is it that everyone assumes that just because people are blonde that they are dumb i find that stereotype very offending i mean not to boast or anything but i get good grades in school average and everyone always cracks blonde jokes around me and i always get upset why is it this way because most people are very superficial and judge based on first appearances many of the most famous blondes in our culture paris hilton jessica simpson etc aren't exactly known for their impressive intellect so a lot of people tend to base their opinions of blondes on this i can relate to how you feel about offensive stereotypes though i like to dye my hair a different color a few times over the summer usually something like purple blue green etc it seems that people have less respect for me because of this when my hair is a normal color i have to dye it something normal for school usually i go with brown or red i am treated just like any other person but if i was to enter a gas station or something today my hair is purple right now i have no doubt that i'd be treated with some contempt many people assume that because i have a crazy hair color i'm a drug dealer or something this in part might be because i live in a small town purple hair can't exactly be called common unfortunately you can't really do much to change someone else's opinion of you unless you talk to them prove to the people around you that you are intelligent don't shove your report card in their faces or anything like that try to engage them in conversation arguing really it would be more like a debate than an argument is a good way to prove your intelligence show that you have a strong opinion and can back it up with facts and don't forget the golden rule you know treat others the way you would like to be treated stay away from all forms of stereotyping be open to all sorts of ideas and people you'll be much more respected think about it you don't seem to have too much respect for those that stereotype you right sorry for the long answer it's just a topic that i'm passionate about  Blond The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Social rule Joke Totally Spies!

am i the only one am i the only one that never abuses other people but been abused myself there's this saying that people who have been abused abuse other people and animals well i don't abuse other people or animals so am i the only one and i've tasted every type of abuse i totally agree and i hate it when people say that it's so unfair when i was in high school i applied to work at school at the after school day care with elementary children my school was k but i was almost denied the job because my school principal had this bizarre idea that i had been sexually abused as a child and would do the same i have never been abused in that way nor would i do anything of the sort but she contacted my parents with her concerns and my parents set her straight lol i did get the job too by the way but they had everyone who applied go to this anti pedophilia class to make sure that we knew not to abuse kids it could've been protocol or maybe they made it protocol because of my principal's suspicions my principal had absolutely no proof except that i showed signs of having been abused and these signs were being quiet not looking people in the eye avoiding people not talking etc i think it would've been safer to assume that i was merely shy because i was extremely shy when i started at that school in th grade and she never stopped thinking of me in that way btw i did have some issues growing up that may have been considered abuse not sexual abuse though my dad was kind of mean sometimes and he used to be verbally mean to my mom and me and he used to hit me i finally called the police once when i was about and he never hit me again when i was he kicked me out of the house and used physical force to take the key away from me this left a bruise on my arm for several days but just because injustice was done to me doesn't mean that i will do the same to others in fact i see it all as a learning experience when i have kids i will make a point of not carrying on the way my father and his father before him behaved i am kind to people and to animals too i don't think i could ever hurt someone although i consider myself to be a nice person most of the time i do admit that i have explosions once in a long while this scares me but i try to control my anger because i found out early on that acting on my rage will only make the situation much worse  Domestic violence Social rule Theory of conduct Recurring South Park characters Kodocha Infantilism Fathers' rights The nature of God in Western theology Human sexual behavior Transsexuality Anger management Dead Like Me Spanking Abortion debate Rape Kyle Broflovski Adoption EastEnders Boston Public Transactional analysis Education in the United States Child sexual abuse Shaggy dog story Pitaten Childlove movement One Tree Hill (TV series) False memory Capital punishment Dissociative identity disorder Tenshinhan The Marshall Mathers LP The Fairly OddParents Public-key cryptography Child abuse Motion picture rating system Milton H.

i find coins pennies nickels etc on the ground all the time anywhere and everywhere i go on a superstitious level or any for that matter what underlying meaning does this have just curious thanks i think that it means that you 'have an eye' for coins in other words your eye or rather your brain has become attuned to noticing round shiny objects our brains actually process and mostly reject a truly vast amount of information every moment that we have our eyes open it is trained to alert us when it encounters certain things and can be trained for example to detect the slightest difference among lots of the same thing which is why people are often employed to remove faulty objects from a conveyer belt full of goods i knew a man who was actually a botanist who would pick up several flint arrowheads on every field trip he made there was nothing spooky or magic about it his eye had just become accustomed to knowing the difference between an ordinary chipped stone and a man made one you are 'lucky' in the sense that your eyes are attuned to seeing small change save what you find for a week or a month and see how much it is donate your collection to your favourite charity as a thank you  Shen Gong Wu Cognitive science Entropy Numerology Slot machine Social rule Drowning Theory of conduct Cyberspace English plural Poker jargon Combine (Half-Life 2) Microeconomics Sydney Riot of 1879 Knife Dyslexia Meaning Stereoscopy Thief (computer game) Economics Piccolo Junior Saga Supply and demand Metaphor Blood (computer game) Canadian dollar Magic (illusion) Archaeology Capitalism Opportunity rover Eye Philosophy of language Lucid dreaming Color Magnetic resonance imaging Anarchism and capitalism Milton H.

what's good this is such a great question it is essentally the root of all bias in the world good is something that is based upon an individual's beliefs it is as obi wan would say from a certain point of view where good can be found continuing on the star wars theme for a second anakin skywalker became darth vader out of what he believed was a good cause to learn how to help his wife padme avoid a death he was afraid she would suffer do you think any of the generals and commanders and such on the death star thought they were the bad guys no way but this is true in real life while we universally believe hilter was wrong and crazy he truely felt he was right and doing a good thing similarly osama bin laden feels he is doing the right thing by attacking what he sees as the evil power the united states and who is more good the israelis or the palestinians well that depends on a certain point of view doesn't it bias is based on what we percieve to be good if you say are a born again christian than its possible that everyone who isn't just isn't seeing the light that their path isn't good especially those who don't believe in jesus if you grew up with only one race of people around you and move to the big city where there are hundreds of races you might tend to allow those stereotypes take hold and denounce all races but yours to be bad or whatever word you use if you were born blind does that make you bad no you don't know the difference and your sense of touch or smell is probably incredible here's the bottom line we all have our own senses to whatever degree we percieve our world through our eyes and whatever that perception is becomes our reality but yours is different than mine even if we are brothers or bro sis or twins and grew up at the same time with all the same things you're still not me you're different you see things differently it's vital for us all to understand that and don't assume your good is the best good or is good for someone else so do the best you can to make good in the world without stepping all over everyone else's good and you're going to find a world of friends at your doorstep  Obi-Wan Kenobi Darth Vader Force (Star Wars) Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Jedi Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Anakin Solo Princess Leia Nute Gunray Evil Theodicy Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Soul Force powers The nature of God in Western theology Epistemology Notable lines in the Star Wars series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Padm__ Amidala Dates in Star Wars Goodness and value theory Sith Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John Howard Yoder Reality Yoda Galactic Civil War Michel Henry Neuro-linguistic programming God Palpatine Confederacy of Independent Systems Media bias Christian eschatology Count Dooku Lightsaber Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Nicomachean Ethics Fundamentalism Determinism Piccolo Junior Saga Boba Fett Biblical inerrancy New Age Creationism Supernatural Lightsaber combat Qui-Gon Jinn Friends Angel Neofascism and religion Osama bin Laden Deconstruction Sin Jon Secada Alcoholics Anonymous Kyle Broflovski Mace Windu Ontological argument Ranma __ characters Karma Aesthetic Realism Monomyth Jiddu Krishnamurti Friedrich Schleiermacher Bernard Williams Propaganda Philosophy of language Objectivist philosophy Predestination Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The Clone Wars Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Transactional analysis Moral Politics Meaning of life Scientific method Kender Socrates Eric Cartman Gnosticism Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Free will

why did so many early humans live in africa i know that that is their origin but why did they live there and stay there having evolved most likely in mixed forest grassland regions of africa the earliest humans were best suited for that type of environment they would not have expanded explosively and thus needed to move because they were still subject to the dangers of their primate cousins and only minimally advantaged over them in terms of defense as humans diverged from other primates and as homo sapiens sapiens diverged from australopithecus afarensis lucy and intermediate hominid species they may have experienced population pressures that encouraged their territorial expansion also climate changes over the hundreds of thousands of years of early human expansion would have opened up new opportunities and made formerly comfortable areas less habitable both of these led to migration of hominid populations difficulty of movement have you ever gone backpacking for a week and the necessity of intimate knowledge of the local environment slowed human expansion down substantially  Human evolution Human Cradle of Humanity Australopithecus afarensis Australopithecine Olduwan Primate Hominidae Paranthropus Single-origin hypothesis Ape Stone Age Origin of language Human extinction Lower Paleolithic Whale History of South Africa Scientific classification Prehistoric Britain Indigenous peoples Created kind Species Extinction Milford H.

when single mothers take over america what kind of social system do you think we will have right now out of babies are born to single mothers and rising still most are employed about many of the children in america growing up now are seeing women as being responsible for the family do you think we are headed towards a big shift in power over the next years maybe we will be more matriarchal even though women seem to be bearing the burden at the moment do you think maybe something good could come of this in the long run yes a poor situation but i think people will adapt don't you think we always do i am just pondering the possible outcomes it seems that we are heading toward a world where marriage is no longer part of our society we are meandering toward a matriarchal family unit that will embrace roles and activities that are more reactive in nature and tend toward expediency collaboration and conciliation on the other hand we will also tend to proliferate a male dominated segment of society which will focus more on substituting family responsibilities and gratification achieved through the familial bonding mechanism for personal gratification and fulfillment since sex is now considered a commodity which is only a bodily function that results in a few minutes of pleasure rather than a need for any commitment of any kind there is little inducement to form a formal and binding male female family unit so we will tend more toward casual and non binding relationship which can be terminated at the drop of an angry word or a disgruntled look all life will then tend to be considered temporary in nature and focus more on short term pleasure rather than long term goals of course that is only my opinion  Happiness Human sexual behavior Narcissism Sadism and masochism BDSM Goodness and value theory Infantilism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Gender role Bondage (BDSM) Supply and demand Microeconomics Nicomachean Ethics State Feminism Coercion Family Pedophilia Sexual orientation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Marriage Human Same-sex marriage Polyamory Puberty Strategic management Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Milton H.

is the u s media honest with the public c i think you already know the answer to this question most people are truly unaware of the power of the media it has the power to control people's attitudes to a degree that is frightening most folks don't have a clue how much their beliefs about life in general are shaped by television radio and newspapers the secret to their power is subtlety they ever so carefully make innuendos about what attitudes are good and which ones are bad to think that this power is not being directed by monied interests is absurd never in the history of the human race have we been exposed to this kind of mind control sometime set up a large mirror at an angle to your television and sit back some distance so that you are not looking directly at it look just to the side of the mirror so that you can see what the tv is doing in your peripheral vision you will notice that the vast majority of images and messages are flashed at you faster than you have time to think about it these images and thoughts reach your subconscious mind before you have time to critically analyze them this is exactly how hypnosis works every day people sit in front of their tvs and have their attitudes and beliefs shaped by forces that do not have their best interests in mind i tell everyone i know to turn off the tube for good you might think i was asking them to cut off a hand when you see the responses i get this just tells me that i am probably right about all this they have been programmed with the need to continue watching and don't know what to do without their electronic drug just my two cents will  Television Eye Milton H.

atheists am i wrong everyone believes in something no one can endure the stress and cares of life without faith in something that cannot ultimately be proven atheists cannot prove there is no god pantheists cannot prove that everything is god pragmatists cannot prove that what will count for them in the future is what works for them now nor can agnostics prove that it is impossible to know one way or the other faith is unavoidable even if we choose to believe only in ourselves faith or belief is only as good as the object in which we place our trust what or who you place your faith in matters jesus said if you do not believe that i am he savior you will die in your sins john furthermore we are told he that believes on the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for god's wrath remains on him john therefore the bible focuses not as much on the act of belief as on the object of belief god requires man to put his faith in christ alone for salvation nothing else will satisfy him everything has a cause every effect has a cause we do not exist in a vacuum or a bubble where do we come from at some point we all recognize that life had a beginning logic and design eliminate the idea that we just happened to exist by chance the god of the bible is the ultimate answer to the question of our origins for it is understood that as an infinite being and eternally self existent he does not require a cause psalm colossians ii peter evidence of a designer the universe displays a staggering amount of evidence for revealing an intelligent designer this intelligence is observed both in the things one observes and the way these things relate to others outside themselves the intricate order of the universe and it's regularity can fill even the most casual observer with awe it is the norm within nature to observe many different components that work together to produce something valuable it is amazing that there would even be a question whether this intelligible order is the product of chance or of intelligent design this design can only come from the mind of a designer what's even more amazing is that this designer cares about us some people reason that a god great enough to create the universe would be too big to be concerned about us jesus however confirmed what the design and detail of the natural world suggest he showed that god is great enough to care about the smallest details of our lives he spoke of one who not only knows every move we make but also the motives and thoughts of our heart jesus taught that god knows the number of hairs on our head the concerns of our heart and even the condition of a fallen sparrow psalm matthew so what do you think you're not alone if you are open to the existence of god but aren't sure you can accept jesus' claim to be god in the flesh the teacher from nazareth promised help to those who are concerned about doing the will of god he said if anyone chooses to do god's will he will find out whether my teaching comes from god or whether i speak on my own john niv to the first answerer no i can't prove it but i hope everyone will find it i know god exists i know that as a fact but to prove my fact i am unable there is no way i can prove god to you although i have seen in face to face it is amazing that there would even be a question whether this intelligible order is the product of chance or of intelligent design this design can only come from the mind of a designer what makes you think that there is only chance or god randomness is often not random but it does not automatically follow that there is a being behind the universe pressing buttons and pushing events a certain way there are patterns in chaos and man is addicted to finding order in what seems like disorder thus it is inevitable that man would superimpose a humanlike deity onto the order he sees in the universe because it links him with this vast other the idea of god gives man an extension into the heavens instead of groping in the dark raging against order that he cannot understand if man simply assigns what he cannot understand to the hand of god then man does not feel so insecure the idea of god the designer and an interventionist god feels like a security blanket concept man's way of creating a daddy to tuck us in under the frightening canopy of inexplicable stars the scientific atheist connects by seeking the basic physical concepts of the working of the universe by rational experimental inquiry there is no need to anthropomorphize such a search so god does not come into it it is basically mathematical and systematic logical but i am not saying that this way leads to ultimate truth either only that it does not require an intelligent designer to explain basic concepts so i don't see your point about evidence for intelligent design especially since you being by pointing out that no one can prove anything id would be yet another aspect of living by faith would it not no evidence given none required i choose not to believe in that idea but i wouldn't deny you the right to believe it if you choose  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Creation science Atomism
