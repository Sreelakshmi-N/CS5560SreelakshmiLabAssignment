i need rat information as much as possible you can give me a website or info on this site first of all i rats and you need to get at least two they are extremely social and its cruel to keep them alone where to get you new rats humane society take very good care of the animals disease free have been properly handled breeder knows what they are talking about takes care of rats for a living check to make sure the rats living conditions are good although most breeders are in it for the love of rats some are just in it for the money and will keep them in horrible conditions will more than likely know who the parents and grandparents are pet store i would highly recommend petsmart over petco last resort petco and many others dont separate males and females you might come home with a pregnant female petsmart only carries females so no risk of pregnancy mose pet stores sell rats as feeder rats dont get them from here even if you think you are 'saving them' i know you would mean good but they dont have proper socialization and are more than likely interbred watch to make sure they are active and healthy ask to hold them before paying for them when the pet store person opens the cage watch to make sure the rats dont run away or try to bite signs of feeder rats your rats cage rats need larger cages then hamsters square feet per rat need multilevel hammocks and levels are highly reccomended tons of toys wiffle balls pet store toys etc and chew toys dont use cedar bedding use pine shavings as a primary bedding then a thin layer of carefresh they will use that as nesting supplies little houses rats loooove tons of little houses and different sleeping areas cleaned out glass jars pvc pipes 'igloos' from petstores wooden shoeboxes anything big water bottle otherwise be prepared to refill it a lot dont put a wheel in there usually rats wont use it but if they do it can cause serious back problems make sure there isnt a wire bottom its horrible for their little feet always have a full food dish clean it once a week dump out bedding scrub with water let dry and add new bedding play time love time out of cage give them slightly cracked open hard boiled egg they will go nuts rat pinata layer paper towels put treats in the middle and bunch up into a ball and tie it so its hanging from the top of their cage digging box fill with store bought dirt and sprinkle bird food all over it then add another layer of dirt water and let it grow wait till all the seeds sprout and let the rats in it they looove digging around and eating the sprouts randomness box a box full of anything and everything safe for rats recycled paper toilet paper rolls scrunched tissues pencils wash rags anything and hide some treats through out the box rats need time out of the cage for at lease hours a day the more the better handle them every day they will sit on your shoulder and go everywhere around the house with you snacks food get your rats food from a pet store and make sure it says mice and rat food dont get hamster food you can mix in rice chrispies or cheerios save money on expensive stuff both those cereals are good for them no sugary foods chocolate and suff anything thats good for you is a good treat for the rats some rat owners say that rats should have table spoon of fresh fruits a day dont over do it on the nuts to much protein for them no salted sun flower seeds get treats from the pet store my favorites are 'yogies' and 'pretzel sicks' bath time its not nessisary to give your pet rats baths however some rats like baths fill a plastic tub your bath tub with inch of water luke warm put some tupperware in there for rats that dont want to sit in the water put some frozen veggies in there for them to much on no need for soap males vs females males are very lazy tend to smell more dont like to explore as much love to sit and watch tv with you some people claim them to be much more sweet then girls have extremely large 'male parts' get oily backs females love to explore need to know whats going on hate being in the cage love to learn tricks dont smell as much love love love humane interaction very energetic do not do introduce your rats with your hamster or any other small animal let them run free in your house unless they know their name mine do give them chocolate give them a bath when the water is higher than inch put soap in the bath put perfume lotion on them let them need electrical chords or outlets play with them if your hands smell like cat or dog or food stick your fingers through the bars of the cage feed them through the bars of the cage poke them with things dont get them rolly balls cause serious back injury do snuggle with them give the kisses pet them let the out as much as possible teach them a few tricks let them sit on your shoulder while you lounge around the house love them this is probably the longest answer i have ever given lol good luck hope this helped  Tofu Sin City Ferret Tooth Breastfeeding

are ferrets good pets ferrets are good bad pets depending on a lot of different variables it all depends on you what you are looking for in a pet your time commitment etc what is a great pet to one person is not necessarily great pet for another ferrets are extreamly high maintenance pets start up cost for a ferret is around dollars when you first get your ferrets they will need to see a vet not apart of the dollar start up most states require yearly vaccinations for ferrets rabies distemper this can cost upward of dollars they also need monthy heartworm pills it is recommended that you have two ferrets they can sleep together and play in ways that they cannot with you ferret food is expensive they should have at least three high quality food mixed togther marshals food is not a high quality food do not feed the ferret this high quality means first three ingrediants meat and no fish protein and approximately fat and low fiber the high quality food can cost anywhere from dollars to over for a lb bag feeding them low quality food may be cheaper for awhile but will lead to health problems and costly vet bills later young ferrets monthy bills may be fairly reasonable but as ferrets age they are extreamly likely to get adreanal disease you are more likely to have a ferret get health problems when they get older than not and older is only about so expect high vet bills for about half its life ferrets are smelly there is no going around that fact even descented since ferrets are strictly carnivours they have a short digestive tract and need food available all the time therefore they deficate every few hours they also have a musky smell even decented it get into eveything clothes etc cages need to be cleaned daily to minimize the smell if you let it wait the smell will be tremendous even cleaned daily you can still smell the ferrets as soon as you enter my home they can be litter box trained but it is hard and hit or miss no pun intended when they are out of thier cage they will not seek out a litter box and will usually just go anywhere my ferrets never were litter box trained and preffered to go next to the box dig in it rather than use it expect to have your ferret out of its cage for a minimum of hours a day otherwise they will not be happy ferrets have a lot of energy and need to burn it off when they are out they must be supervised as they get into everything climb everywhere etc mine used to love to go on my dvd shelves and knock them all off finally had to replace the shelves with a cabinet style some of them can be mean there is no gaurentee you must be prepared to deal with an agessive ferret do you know what to do with a problem biter i have a formally abused ferret that was a bad biter i took some nastly bites to the hands nerve damage on one hand even friendly babies can have personality changes if not properly socialized and trained ferrets must be nip trained when they are young there are correct and incorrect ways to do this hitting yelling flicking the nose do not work and may lead to an agressive and hand shy ferret all ferrets nip there is no way to completly stop but it should be controled they should know not to bite you too hard often ect that is where having two ferrets comes in handy they can play with eachother the way ferrets naturally play the cage must be fairly large the ferret starter cages sold in pet stores are not large enough a ferret needs a multi floor cage you'll need hammocks ferrets like sleeping away from thier feces and urine get food bowls that lock to the side or else they will throw them off the shelves large water bottles are best oz ferrets need water available all the time if you know all the information and are prepared to make an expensive and long commitment then go for it please be sure you hav emergency vet money set aside it is recommended at least dollars you do not want to end up as one of the kids on here asking my ferret is injured how do i treat it without going to the vet thats not fair to the pet or responsible i have thousands of dollars put aside for emergencies  Rabies Fancy rat Dairy Cat Mattress Japanese tea ceremony Nutrition

how to move baby pigeons from porch i have baby pigeons on my porch and the mother is taking care of them is there a way to move them without disturbing them or can i feed them until they can fly if i call my hoa they will be removed by them steve i can get in trouble for leaving them there because i am in an apartment complex and the droppings are going down to the neighbors porch i want to know if i can feed them becuase the mother won't come back if i clean up and put them on a piece of cardboard or newspaper my whole point in looking into this is to help nature the hoa can and probably will remove them probably with a shovel if i don't do something comprende some people are really quick to jump to the wrong conclusion and they look pretty foolish why do you want to feed them if the mom is taking care of them and why would you want to move them leave them alone and let nature do its thing it's an old wives tale that if you touch them the mom bird will abandon them so you can move them just pick up the whole nest or whatever and move it to another spot  The Inside Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes RuneScape quests Tag Rock Dove Knots Landing Chess strategy and tactics Bird Professional wrestling throws Friends Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Volleyball Hall & Oates Hamster My Name Is Earl American Psycho Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Married... with Children 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chopsticks Chicken Textile manufacturing Social rule Paradox Treehouse of Horror V Family Guy Dead Like Me Dove Mario Babe Ruth's Called Shot Baby Blues The Family from One End Street Jackass: The Movie Kimi Finster Bubble Bobble Snooker Marilyn Monroe Laura Schlessinger Kereru Angelina Jolie The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 2) Joke Have I Got News For You Taikyoku shogi Dai dai shogi Rugrats Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers AFI 100 Years series Kodocha EastEnders My Little Pony Neighbours Cosmo Kramer Kakapo The Fairly OddParents The Birds (film) One Piece minor characters Shogi Tai shogi Kevin and Kell Wood Pigeon The Amber Spyglass Everwood Daddy Cool (band) 613 mitzvot Rocko's Modern Life Macbeth Confidence trick Alfred Hitchcock Wrigley Field Sin City Breastfeeding Cindy Sheehan Seabird Rent (musical) Doonesbury Ko shogi Kurt Cobain New York Giants Full House Backgammon Mr. and Mrs. Turner Wa shogi Surveillance The Apprentice 2 My Life as a Teenage Robot Falconry Denis Law Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Random Harvest

introducing a new rat i adopted two rats from a pet store in april and they seemed relatively healthy the white one however was sneezing and i suspected it had mycoplasma on thursday she seemed a bit lethargic but still active when i checked on her on saturday i was out of town for one day she was dead the brown rat still seemed somewhat active but depressed she has also been sneezing my question is i know it's bad to introduce a new rat if the brown one also has mycoplasma but she seems so sad without her friend and it breaks my heart to see her like that what should i do should i just spend more time with her thanks virtually all domestic rats have the mycoplasma organism in their system our vet says it's relatively unusual for a pet rat not to have least one flare up during his or her lifetime the quarentine period is to make sure that your rats don't have other diseases that they could give each other you might want to bring your girl to the vet to make sure that there aren't any other health problems possibly to start her on medication since her sneezing could indicate a flare up sorry for your loss your other girl most likely is depressed that her friend is gone i've seen this in our own rats it would help if you can give her extra attention it would be wonderful if she could have a new rat friend too just be sure to quarentine the new girl for a few weeks introduce them carefully on neutral ground also be patient it took our hairless about weeks to accept our hooded girl but now they're wonderful friends  Fancy rat Mycoplasma Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Sin City Guinea pig Rabies Ferret Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pneumonia Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pet skunk Rat Tuberculosis Clinical depression Sneeze Folic acid Urinary incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Traumatic brain injury Health insurance Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Common cold Kim Possible Prostate cancer Dead Like Me Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Quarantine Domestic rabbit Blood (computer game) Hypoglycemia AIDS Sleep Tocopherol Billboard Hot 100 Aspartame Brown Rat Bipolar disorder Dog Kender The Suffering (game) Dieting Group A streptococcal infection Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Medicine Jam (TV series) Death Anorexia nervosa Characters in the Smurfs Vigabatrin Disease Drug addiction Philadelphia Eagles House Mouse Frank Sinatra The Beach Boys Kurt Cobain Cat National Football League Rat (zodiac) Cytomegalovirus Hearing impairment Gregorian calendar George W.

mouse or rat my cat brought in a live rodent she had bitten off half its tail so i cannot tell by the length of it it is small about inch brown with a white stomach has very small eyes and ears its body shape is round like a ball really i think it is a mouse but i have never seen a mouse with small eyes i am currently looking after it as it has a broken leg and a gash in its side thanks for any answers i live in a very rural area so it is more likely to be a mouse but there are also quite a few rats on the farm but the ones i have seen are very large it has not even tried to bite me or to escape from its current location shoe box and dont worry i have a better place to put it but its under constant supervision and i thought i would let it get settled and eat something before i moved it after further research i think it is a vole it is just like a round blob of fluff with two little black dots for eyes the ears are barely visible anyone know any information about these creatures i have cleaned up the wound and it has stopped bleeding seems pretty content but is there anything i should bear in mind while i am keeping him her no its definately not a mole and i saw the cat bite the tail and it also finishes very abruptly so it is clear it is missing some tail i have nursed animals before he she is eating happily and is hardly even disturbed when i reach into the container he she has made a little nest with some cotton wool i put in there seems to be doing very well and loves eating clovers update doing well this morning eating lots of clovers i have changed the water and bedding etc i can now see that only legs are working properly the other is present but not functioning thanks for all your help it was probably a shrew or a vole it's pretty uncommon to catch a mouse outside as they usually shelter pretty well  Hamster Cat Fancy rat Vole House Mouse Textile manufacturing YuYu Hakusho The Secret of NIMH Mattress Stoat Shen Gong Wu Brown Rat Fauna of Australia Guinea pig Snake Mouse (computing) Porcupine Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Spider EastEnders Drill bit Horse Cheetah Gray Wolf Equine conformation American Black Bear Tasmanian Devil Rodent Fast bowling Billiards Spidey Super Stories Ferret Tarantula Mountain Beaver Virginia Opossum Creatures in Bionicle Taboo food and drink Puma Chicken Hay First aid Naruto jutsu Piccolo Junior Saga Narnia Elephant Vomiting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eye Bubonic plague Comanche Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Lemming Mammal The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Murinae Mole (animal) Glossary of nautical terms Water Vole Races of Final Fantasy Visual cortex Red Fox Social rule Mouse RuneScape quests Dobermann Sin City Animal testing Violin The Legend of Zelda series enemies Terminal ballistics Mickey Mouse Stomach cancer Felis sapiens Spot the Dog Tenchi Muyo!

ungrateful bunnies i have two male rabbits which i recently put into an enclosure approximately feet x feet x feet x feet and feet high there's a two storey hutch in there too i let them out of the hutch every morning and shut them back in again at about pm so they have free roam all day anyway despite this lovely big run they still try to dig under the gate and fencing to get out there's logs and pipes for them in the run i put fresh grass and dandelions on the ground for them everyday as well as the rabbit food in their hutch and yet all this isn't enough for them but anyway my question is if i bury chicken wire under the ground around the edges of the enclosure will that stop them digging or is there anything else i could do because the enclosure is so large i can go in there and sit with them i even have a chair for myself i rehomed them from someone who was going to kill them if a new home couldn't be found one is black the other is white with a black stripe down it's spine and black dots all over but when it came to me it was dirty yellow and black now that it's moulted it's real colour has come through i don't know how it's previous owners treated it but it's been here about months and it's still a bit wary of people the black one is fine i've had them both neutered and vaccinated and they get the best of everything like all my pets do which is why i'm peeved that they don't want to stay in their own space they'll even try to follow me through the gate when i leave their enclosure the cheeky little critters i know rabbits dig it's just that they try to dig out of the enclosure rather than just dig a hole in the middle of it the only thing you can do to stop them digging through is to have a material on the floor of the enclosure that is un diggable such as concrete your little rabbits are not ungrateful they are just rabbits with a natural instinct to dig afterall they live in burrows in the wild its nice that you have provided such a good home for them rather than letting them rot in a hutch over time as your rabbits get older they will mellow out a little bit and may perhaps stop the digging in the meantime perhaps you could consider having them neutered which will help the raging hormones to settle and get them through the naughty teenage years a little quicker good luck  Domestic rabbit Hamster Rabbit Guinea pig Cat Ferret Shaggy dog story EastEnders Fancy rat Pet skunk Dog training Fox hunting Bugs Bunny Electrical wiring Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Opportunity rover Unreal Dog Rabies Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Loudspeaker Capercaillie Poker jargon The Adventures of Pete & Pete Trapping Livestock The Amber Spyglass Codename: Kids Next Door Professional wrestling match types Milton H.

is my roborovski hamster pregnant and why is she attacking my other female hamster my boyfriend and i bought two robovorski hamsters two days ago one was bigger than the other and had a meaner disposition but they were both sweet overall we were unsure of the sex of the hamsters but we knew they were both either girls or both boys now the bigger one has grown even larger and there are nipples visible on her belly she's torn up the toilet paper i put in the cage and made a bed in the upper compartment and put food underneath it she's also very active and is constantly running in the wheel in the cage from all the websites i've looked at these things seem to indicate a pregnancy but i'm still not sure her bed nest isn't very big and she keeps attacking the other smaller hamster tearing out bits of her fur is it normal for these two to be this territorial in the pet store the bigger one would chase the smaller one around but never actually attack it she sounds pregnant take other hamster out or she will kill it or the babies as they are born she sees the other hamster as a threat to her young  Hamster EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Domestic rabbit Golden Hamster Neighbours Fancy rat Elephant Cat Sex and the City Guinea pig Friends Sears Holdings Corporation The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Knots Landing Pregnancy The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Drawn Together Days of our Lives Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Badly Drawn Kitties House Mouse Poker jargon Married... with Children Kodocha Ranma __ characters Vampire Animal communication Dead Like Me The Empty Child Cheetah Rais massacre Nile crocodile One Tree Hill (TV series) Conker's Bad Fur Day The Catcher in the Rye Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Leopard The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Ron and Fez Comanche Jackass: The Movie Aquemini Internet phenomenon Salad Fingers My Parents are Aliens Humphrey Bogart Masturbation Red Squirrel Prenatal diagnosis Breastfeeding Breath of Fire III Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Canary Chinchilla One Piece minor characters Phoebe Buffay's songs George Costanza Shark About a Boy Condom Dog Eddie Guerrero The Legend of Zelda series enemies Characters of Naruto The Young Ones (TV series) Xiaolin Showdown Hall & Oates Into the West (miniseries) Kirby's Dream Land 2 Mario series enemies Capercaillie Koala W.I.T.C.H.

i got gerbil hamster food instead of rat food by mistake can i still use it for my rat it's essentially the same sort of food mix but the protein fat levels are slightly different by about i think also i checked in the bag and there are pumpkin seeds and dried bananas those weren't in the rat mix is it still ok to substitute for a little while until i can get the right stuff it is fine for them the banana chips are good for the rats since they have a lot of protein in them and them pumpkin seeds are good as well the main difference is the fat and protein content so they may need to eat a bit more of it than their regular rat food also i would recommend giving them a bit of fresh fruit and veggies everyday as well not too much or it can cause diarreah i work as a vet tech and also own boy rats and they eat a variety of foods just make sure that the majority of wha they eat is a good quality commercial food  Hamster Fancy rat Vegetarianism Veganism Tofu Cheese Banana Fruit Milk Ice cream Peanut Nutrition Guinea pig Watermelon Food preservation Yoghurt Pumpkin Genetically modified food Organic food Food Chocolate Date Palm Insulin Domesticated turkey Peruvian cuisine Potato Sugar substitute Dietary fiber Potassium German cuisine Ferret Muesli Dieting Potato chips Jewish cuisine Hemp Ramen Fecal incontinence In-N-Out Burger Bread Vegetarian nutrition Compost Aspartame Soy milk Flour MRE Vitamin C Maize Hypoglycemia Ham Folic acid Fish and chips Bengali cuisine Genetic engineering Plantain Soybean Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of the Southern United States Little Britain Barley Soy protein Comanche Low-carbohydrate diet Tocopherol Cake Kosher foods Raw food diet Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Africa Breastfeeding Warfarin Wheat Tomato Chicken Curry Cuisine of Brazil Apple Fruitarianism Cuisine of Laos Muroidea Hamburger Squash (fruit) Bong Chinese cuisine Cereal Fast food Coffee Cuisine of Malaysia Egg (food) Peanut butter Sewage treatment Japanese cuisine Pet skunk Acorn Blood (computer game) Black pepper

what is the best cage to get a hamster and what should i get with it i've had many gerbils mice and a hamster the best thing to get is an aquarium ten gallons works fine for one there is no chance that the hamster will get out the litter will stay in the cage and you can see in very well also makes sure you get a sturdy cover for the top they can jump out i had one that fit over the top and it was heavy enough that they couldn't push it off i've also had some that sat on top and had locks that slid under the ridge but if you forget to slide them close the hamster can get out i've had this happen get a food dish and a water bottle that hangs from the side i do not reccomened a gravity water bottle get one that has a ball in it they can drink much easier you should also get a shelter for them to sleep in and something for them to chew on i also suggest wood shavings as the litter it prevents smells and it works well and is cheap  Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Equine conformation Bong Plastic Trapping Chinchilla Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Dinghy John Cage Professional wrestling match types Avalanche Door Volleyball Kitchen Mouse (computing) Sailing Coffee Wine Autonomous building Swingout Happy Tree Friends Japanese tea ceremony Cat Gypsy moth Marine aquarium Pinball Canal lock Mattress Snooker Bicycle frame Dundas Square Combine (Half-Life 2) Canoe Animal communication Animal testing Brewery Knife Rugby union positions Nalgene Manual transmission Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cuisine of Malaysia Siphon Weight training B-47 Stratojet Seismic retrofit Glossary of wildland fire terms Japanese cuisine Gaia Online Wine making Golden Hamster Pet Skateboarding trick Homer Simpson Sento Milk Alcoholic beverage Enceladus (moon) Panama Canal Table saw Glossary of climbing terms Piccolo Junior Saga Pok__mon Abilities Nocturnal animal Lock picking Muroidea StarCraft: Uprising Water Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tobacco smoking Tobacco Social rule Flush toilet Steel Cage Match Humphrey Bogart Magic (illusion) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Window Gerbil Professional wrestling holds Jon Secada Tilapia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Amber Spyglass Strap-on dildo Meriones unguiculatus GunZ The Duel Campfire Nestl__ Champagne (beverage) Bottlenose Dolphin Ron and Fez Chair Capercaillie Aquarium

can i keep two male mice together in a ten gallon tank i want to start raising mice and i heard from a bunch of rat and mouse clubs that male mice can live together but i've also heard that they'll fight eventually and it gets really bad so should i keep one male mouse alone or should i keep two and in how large of a tank don't worry about me breeding because its not like they don't have a purpose yes especially if they are brothers kept together since birth most american breeders never try it because they think all male mice are mean but a select few do including myself almost all european breeders and mouse owners keep males together american breeders say its because european mice have better temperments but this is a bunch of bull all male mice have the same chance of getting along or not after breeding they may fight though mostly because you have to seperate them when you use one for breeding  House Mouse Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Guinea pig American Pit Bull Terrier Domestic rabbit Rat Cat Docking Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dog show Mickey Mouse Mouse Discus (fish) Dog breeding German Shepherd Dog Monster Rancher monsters American Kennel Club Breed registry Dog breed Fast breeder Pit bull Jack Russell Terrier Animal testing Mickey Mouse Club Hamster Selective breeding Hybrid Tenterfield Terrier Cattle Livestock Elephant Pet store Ferret Dog Border Terrier Chicken Australian Shepherd Platypus Kakapo Great Dane Mixed-breed dog Domestication Dachshund Modest Mouse Dairy cattle Bird migration Alaskan husky Tasmanian Devil Dobermann Puppy mill Bullfighting Feral cat Breed standard Common Eider Irish Wolfhound Mouse (computing) Game controller Sunday Silence Aquarium Animal husbandry Taboo food and drink Genetically modified organism Havanese Fancy rat Plant breeding Black Pete Best of Breed Fish farming Mike Smith (jockey) Domestic sheep Chocobo Gay slang Rat Terrier Domestic goat Ralph Bunche Griffon Bruxellois Moose Canary Rottweiler Disney's House of Mouse New York-New Jersey English Marine aquarium Tarantula Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Decepticon Labrador Retriever Tennessee Walker Artificial selection Whippet Britney Spears German Shorthaired Pointer Nuclear power Nitrous oxide Inception of Darwin's theory Saga (band) All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival) True Crime: Streets of LA Rabbit Charly Garc__a

escaping hamsters to of my hamsters escaped today i found them though one was under the fridge and the other one was sleeping in the broiler on the oven the reason they keep getting out is because theres this little gap in the cage and i lost the thing that covers it i don't want to use tape though any suggestions i dont want to use tape because it would stick to their fur and dont tell me to bye a new cage because i can't aford one weelllllll you could get a new cage but i know that costs money what you could do i've done this is sew the 'gap' with wire somewhat like you would 'lace' a shoe if it's a cage with metal bars then it's pretty easy to do just loop it around so they hamsters can't squeeze out anymore if it's solid plastic where the gap is it's slightly trickier to 'sew' plastic you need to put 'holes' in it first which is easy to do hold a safety pin or small nail with pliers over a flame gas stove works great until it's 'red hot' then 'poke' a hole in the place you want one make holes opposite one another at intervals smaller than a hamster can fit between then loop some wire through problem solved no more escapees i currently have degus hamster a squirrel as well as other 'un caged' animals believe me i know about 'critters' that go a w o l good luck  Hamster Textile manufacturing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Professional wrestling match types Wire Plastic Earring M16 (rifle) Floppy disk Climbing equipment Glossary of climbing terms Textile manufacturing terminology Electrical wiring RuneScape quests Hand grenade Spark plug Bong Kitchen Violin Knife Screw Salad Fingers Welding Seismic retrofit Internal ballistics Stove Punch card Solar cell Diving regulator Tire Ferret John Cage Lace-making Fancy rat Chinchilla Gas metal arc welding Zipper Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Chopsticks Drill bit Tesla coil Comanche Magic (illusion) The Young Ones (TV series) Guinea pig M60 machine gun Knitting Magnet 2000 Australian Grand Prix Floorball Golf Mattress Wok Casting Barbed wire Transistor Land mine Domestic rabbit Sewing machine 24 Hours of Le Mans Glass Naval mine Fire fighting BS 1363 Microwave oven Fire Thermal power station Shoe Horseshoe Shoelaces Poker jargon Incandescent light bulb Traditional animation Atari 8-bit family Cruising (maritime) Drag racing Rail terminology Pebble bed reactor Portable stove Conker's Bad Fur Day Asbestos Electrophysiology Chess strategy and tactics Electric motor Condom Transformer Rebreather Wire wrap Zhao Yun Inertial guidance system Rail tracks Circuit design Parachute Clarinet Wrench Shotgun Fast bowling

my new rats are biting and drawing blood and i have rats in another cage and this two are in another cage drawing blood as in they bite you or bite each other it sounds like these new ones either weren't socialized well or are very scared or if they're adolescent males it could be aggression caused by too much testosterone which may mean the offender will need to be neutered to hopefully prevent the aggressive behavior if they're just biting you and not each other it's going to take some time to convince them that the big scary hand coming toward them isn't going to hurt them a soft voice and treats may help but some take a long time to come around and some never do if they're biting each other and drawing blood separate them if both bite then both may need to be neutered if they're young males check with the vet if one bites the other you may want to relocate the one that doesn't bite to the cage with the others but do this cautiously introduce the 'new' rat to the others on neutral ground outside the cage and use a bit of vanilla to mask the difference in scent and prevent aggression  Ferret Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kim Possible Castration Gender Bulgarian language Testosterone Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dog Puberty Mosquito House Mouse Alcoholism Blood (computer game) Kakapo Poker jargon Dog training Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Adolescence Breastfeeding Ancient Greek Pedophilia Milton H.

how can i make this equation hamster two dogs fine i have two miniature dogs currently i am thinking about buying a hamster sometime within the next few months it would be kept in my bedroom with the door shut it will be hard for my dogs to get to my door because i keep a baby gate at the bottom of the stairs so the stairs don't mess up my dachshunds' backs i carry my dogs up the stairs whenever the want to be with me up there i'm scared that they will be scratching at the door and ruining it my dogs have been known to eat small animals like squirrels and shrews in the backyard do you think the protection i have put up for the hamster is adequate enough to keep the dogs away from it or should i put up extra precautions be careful those dogs were bred specfically for catching animals of that sort they will smell it and they will know that something is up there try to keep the cage about ft off the ground so that the dogs can't get to it having it on top of a dresser is a good idea to keep your door safe you could buy a piece of plastic to put up in front of the area where your dogs would scratch but if you have a fence at your stairs it should be fine  Hamster Trapping Dog Dachshund RuneScape quests Stairway Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Guinea pig Housebreaking Cat Animal testing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Equine conformation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fox hunting Gray Wolf Humphrey Bogart Devil Fruit Nintendogs The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Floppy disk Ferret Internet phenomenon Garfield Poker jargon Domestic rabbit Medieval fortification Table saw The Shining (film) Dog agility Chinchilla Door Lady and the Tramp Pet store The Brady Bunch The Death Gate Cycle Air-raid shelter Richard Chase Chatsworth House Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Skateboarding trick Squirrel The Time Machine Mixed-breed dog Rose (Doctor Who) The Birds (film) Medieval hunting Reservoir Dogs Dog training American Black Bear Dial M for Murder Piccolo Junior Saga The Perishers Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Scale model Steel Cage Match Krypto Aerial (dance move) Wildfire Pet People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Baseball EastEnders Sin City Hard disk Livestock Hunting Horse Elevator Happy Tree Friends Pet skunk Animal Liberation Front Beetle Miniature Pinscher Softball The Star Wars Holiday Special Cuisine of Denmark Russian space dogs Working animal Kakapo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal communication Tag Kodocha The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Smoking Room 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shit 1957 World Series Italian Greyhound Chicken Mattress Professional wrestling throws Rathfarnham Coprophagia Prisoner (TV series) American football Red Squirrel

my usually sweet month old rat inflicted some serious bites on me last night i have female siamese rats the smallest one appears to be the alpha rat which is fine because her sister dosen't seem to mind too much however last night while out for play time my little alpha rat for no apparent reason nipped my finger and then when i tried to move my hand away she locked onto my finger inflicting a very painful and nasty puncture wound and a bruise from the force of hanging on she then ran up my chest to my face and bit me hard on the lip my husband waited a few minutes while i was bleeding profusely from my lip then picked her up to return her to her cage she then bit him hard on the thumb this is the first time this has happened she is usually a sweet affectionate and spunky little thing but never has she even attempted to hurt either one of us i'm really upset and concerned and would really love to hear from someone who knows about rats how do we handle her and this behavior and what can we do that this dosen't happen again i had a female rat once who did the very same thing she was always very sweet and then one day out of the blue she would run up to me and bite me in my finger and she drew blood it happened very fast and it happened at least once more that she would draw blood from me every since that first incident started she would always go after my hands and fingers very determined and i knew she was out to bite me needless to say i became very scared of her and could hardly handle her i would always hide my hands in my sleeves when picking her up or wearing thick gloves i tried to handle her as little as possible but i wasn't happy and i had no idea why she became so vicious all of a sudden she had female cage mates and was never agressive to them then one day i had enough of this hiding of hands and being scared of her and i figured an aggressive animal might be crying out for lots of loving and attention to turn around i tried to be compassionate for her behavior one day i carefully took her out of the cage hands hiding of course but i would go sit down with her on my lap i carefully started petting her with my hands in my sleeves at first petting her back then her head she would just sit there and soak in the attention then after some time as i was sure she wasn't going to do anything vicious i slowly took out one finger and petted her back her head crawled her ears etc eventually i had my full hands out and was petting her i took a long time with her every day i tried to give her as much one on one attention as i could and guess what the miracle happened because she literally changed over night she ended up being one of my sweetest rats i've ever had she was always eager to see me when i came home waiting by the cage door and whenever i would hold up my hand in front of her instead of biting me she would always very lovingly lick my fingers very gently and she never even so much as tried to nip at me ever again she was such a sweet girl and i ended up loving her very much and had many many nice moments with her until she had to be put asleep from severe respiratory distress at age one and a half i am so glad i took the time to give her the loving and attention she craved so badly and i am glad that i had her she was a pure joy try doing this with your rat chances are she will turn around so long as you show her you love her very much rather than pulling back from her and not handling her your baby is angry she just wants to be loved good luck  Milton H.

hamster question where can buy hamster tunnels in ga for cheap well i'm assuming that georgia has petstores like any other state try a chain store like petco petsmart pet supplies plus if you don't have any of these near you try grocery stores a lot of places like meijer wal mart and k mart have hamster stuff if you still have no luck with any of these places consider making one yourself it is by far the cheapest and most efficient way an empty toilet paper roll works great if your hammy is a bit too big for this try a pringles container that has been washed and the closing cut off hope this helps and good luck  Hamster Wal-Mart Sears Holdings Corporation Hypermarket Eaton's Hydrogen economy ASDA Toilet paper Bank Fry's Electronics Big-box store Pets.com Golden Hamster Supermarket Bikini Bottom Siphon The Ashlee Simpson Show Meijer United Food and Commercial Workers Menstrual cup Craps PETCO Park Dairy Textile manufacturing Target Corporation Jute Energy development Harris Teeter Bridgewater, Nova Scotia Aldi Shit Toilet Plastic Baseball Stars Euphemism Retailer Hash table Ice cream Urinal Revco Hoarding RFID Superstore Fecal incontinence MapleStory Pedro Mart__nez Cruising (maritime) Neopets Kroger Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Pet store Plastic bag Hiberno-English Electronic commerce Flush toilet Buddy Guy Paper Russian joke Tesco Make money fast Pet skunk Great Depression Nuclear power Emergency preparedness Game show Social rule Sid Vicious Minor characters in Morrowind Marshall Field's Disintermediation Zellers UHF - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff Destiny's Child Japanese toilet Money British small press comics Mouse-like hamster Berkshire Hathaway Andes Urinary incontinence Pringles Supply and demand 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blue law Timmy Turner Economy of the United States Rebreather Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty IKEA Fawlty Towers Animal communication CPU cache Vacuum cleaner Bulk vending Nuclear power phase-out Hooper's Store The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Computer J Sainsbury Baroque chess

my dwarf hamster has a tumor we brought our dwarf hamster to the vet two weeks ago with a lump on her stomach the vet said it was a cyst and lanced it and put her on antibiotics we brought her back again this week because it had filled up again and it turns out it is a tumor he took a scalpel to it this time and gave us more antibiotics up until our last visit the lump didn't seem to be bothering her but since she visited the vet she's been sleeping alot and moving around a lot more slowly than normal with her eyes closed i thought it might have been the loss of blood that was making her tired she hasn't been eating either up until about half an hour ago when she took a small amount of broccolli from me her heart also seems to be beating alot faster than normal and this is visible just by looking at her is this the tumor having an effect on her or has anyone got any ideas the vet said that she wouldn't survive an operation to remove the tumor sadly small creatures are prone to tumours my mouse has one now and it's only a matter of time before i have to take him back to the vets to be put to sleep but for the moment he's not too bothered he is sleeping more and his heart seems to be beating faster too but he is still active for a large portion of his daytime the vet has said that the signs to look out for are going off his food water very lethargic the tumour becomes ulcerated the tumour grows to a size that it's getting in the way when any of these happen the kindest thing you can do is to have your pet euthanised though it's not easy decision to make but better that than your little hamster in pain surgery is very risky on such a small animal and it will only be a temporary solution to the problem because another tumor will appear too at the end of the day just do what you feel is right maybe give your vet a call and ask them to clarify what i've said though i am sorry for this difficult time for you but i am going through it myself now too and if i can help you any further please feel free to email me via my profile  Fancy rat Hamster Stomach cancer Radiation therapy Cancer Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tasmanian Devil Ferret Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Mesothelioma Malignant melanoma Garfield Diarrhea Mattress Chemotherapy Brain tumor Breast cancer Traumatic brain injury Puberty Chronic fatigue syndrome Acromegaly Blood on the Tracks Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aspartame Adjustable gastric band Time Out of Mind Oncology Prolactinoma Dialysis Stroke The Death Gate Cycle Poker jargon Neurofibromatosis type II Domestic rabbit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Peptic ulcer The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Soft tissue sarcoma Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Carpal tunnel syndrome Diabetes mellitus Acne Cephalic disorder Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Shock The Amazing Race Spleen Gastroparesis Tuberous sclerosis Hypoglycemia Needle aspiration biopsy Sleep Theory of conduct Folic acid Slayers Hyperprolactinaemia Insulin Testicular cancer The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Metastasis Aortic dissection Nutrition Chicken Tenshinhan Anorexia nervosa Renal cell carcinoma Childbirth Esophageal cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Penis First aid Sun Cindy Sheehan Diabetic retinopathy Growth hormone Pet skunk Ecco the Dolphin Blood Hedgehog Disneyland Tobacco smoking Warm-blooded YuYu Hakusho Deluge (mythology) FoxTrot Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Decompression sickness

my pet rat is sick symptoms doesn't move bloody nose loss of appetite clumsy he was fine a few days ago it came on really fast does anyone know what he might have we had a rat a few years ago who died of a respiratory problem we took our first rat to the vet and gave him shots but still past away we aren't exactly sure how old he is but is at least months but he could be as old as we have had him for about months and was fine we don't want to waste the money if nothing can be done at the vets does anyone know of anything that will help him get better help please the bloody nose you are describing indicates a common nasal or eye discharge called porphyrin a small amount here and there is normal for any rat but if it is increased accompanied by sneezing or noisy breathing the rat needs to be put on baytril if left untreated this can progress into pneumonia and there is no cure for that generally a treatment would be baytril twice a day for days if the symptoms are somewhat more severe or have been going on for a while i would suggest baytril in combination with doxycycline twice a day for days some rats are really prone to those respiratory infections which can be caused by ammonia from their urine so make sure their cage is clean or stress is a common reason to bring it on as well certain types of cage bedding can bring it on as well as the small particles are aspirated by the rat i always use towels instead of bedding most rats are treated once and they will be fine after that some rats are really prone to it and they relapse constantly when taken off the medications i recently had a rat who was very prone she relapsed times every time i took her off the meds every relapse does more damage to their lungs and then i decided to keep her on lifelong meds she was a year and a half old when she all of a sudden developed severe breathing problems and had to be put to sleep but this is all just from my experience i strongly suggest you take your rat to a rat experienced vet asap the not moving and not eating could indicate something else as well good luck and all the best for your squeaker  Pneumonia Fancy rat Common cold Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Asthma Lung cancer Traumatic brain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Cancer Charles Darwin's illness Herpes simplex virus Duchenne muscular dystrophy Decompression sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tuberculosis Narcotic Stroke Group A streptococcal infection Rabies Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Medicine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Malaria Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Stomach cancer Acne Cephalic disorder Cat Liquid breathing Shock Coeliac disease Methamphetamine Conjunctivitis Sleep Hamster Mesothelioma Bipolar disorder Vitamin C Equine conformation Chlorpromazine Obesity Post-traumatic stress disorder Blood Ebola Parkinson's disease Hay fever Cocaine Epilepsy Addiction Hearing impairment AIDS Lyme disease Aspergillosis Allergy Radiation poisoning Obstetrics Doxepin Insomnia Ferret Antidepressant First aid Ulcerative colitis Emphysema Paget's disease of bone Cystic fibrosis Acromegaly Schizophrenia Drowning Gonorrhoea Migraine Electroconvulsive therapy Aspartame Hepatitis C Narcolepsy Multiple myeloma Folic acid Childbirth Chinchilla Babe Ruth Psittacosis Growth hormone deficiency

is there any real difference between rats pet rats street rats other than varying degrees of cleanliness are they biologically all the same i know lab rats are bred for certain qualities but if pet and lab rats were released into the alley wouldnt they become just as filthy as alley rats wild rats are more resistant to disease than pet rats because the rats we have as pets are the same species as the rats used in laboratory testing those rats have been deeply inbred to enhance different qualities coat color health myco resistance temperment mass production breeding for big pet store chains and as food very likely lab rats also get genetically engineered for whatever experimentation is to be done they are much more susceptible to cancer and illnesses due to weakened immune systems while pet rats live an average of years rats in the wild average about a year but many don't even make it that far they usually die from things like starvation and getting caught as dinner before they die of illness  Rat Cat Brown Rat House Mouse Guinea pig Hamster Ferret Medicine Genetically modified food Domestic rabbit Plant breeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myxobolus cerebralis Vitamin C Spanish flu Cannabis (drug) Extinction Sugar substitute Solar cell Insulin Genetic engineering Species Taboo food and drink Norman Borlaug Anorexia nervosa Apple Immune system Methylsulfonylmethane Ecology Virus Rat Park Cytomegalovirus Life extension Black Death Island Fox Multiple sclerosis Tiger Aspartame Duesberg hypothesis Feral cat Nutrition Cheetah HIV Domestication Genetically modified organism Mycosis Introduced species Organic food Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Cancer Wheat Plastic Allergy City of Heroes Agriculture Long-term potentiation Shrimp farm Incest Discus (fish) Chagas disease Mesothelioma Pesticide Black panther Stem cell Homeopathy Tooth enamel Lung cancer Milk Labrador Retriever Hedgehog Gambian pouch rat Dilbert Ebola Animal Liberation Front Gypsy moth Mouse Chicken Factory farming Gray Wolf Zebra Danio AIDS Tomato Honeybee Mixed-breed dog Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Biology Antiretroviral drug Colorectal cancer Prostate cancer Protein Poison Food Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diamond Massachusetts Institute of Technology

am i ready for a ferret i have toys lots water bottle feeders plus food hammock cage collar leash harness carriors litter plus litter box bedding shampoo nail clippers ear cleaning care treats am i all set let me first of all say i love ferrets it sounds like you have everything you need to take care of a ferret now lets see if you have enough knowledge to make an informed decision about getting one are you ready to raise a toddler when i say that i mean ferrets are literally like toddler children they are very cute and very curious they need close supervision when they are not in their cage otherwise like a toddler they can get themselves into trouble and they do need lots of attention and exercise outside of their cage they are very social animals and enjoy lots of interaction with their owners they will always have a slightly musky scent to them but if taken care of properly they should never stink they are a lot like cats and pretty much clean themselves you may have to bathe them two or three times a year at most washing them more frequently than that can actually make that musky scent stronger they are more expensive to take care of than say cats or dogs they need good ferret food which even at walmart can cost for a small box that will last about a week and i use a paper bedding that walmart also carries for a small bag i have a large cage and it takes two bags to fill the bottom i take meticulous care of the cage and completely change the bedding once a week so on average i spent about a week ferrets have a very short digestive system so they poop every two hours so get ready to scoop a lot of poop on the brighter side of the pooping ferrets' poop has very little odor but if you leave it in the cage for days it will start to smell i did a lot of research before i bought my ferret so i could make an informed decision i made the decision to buy mine when he was just weeks old and i've never regretted getting him even once ferrets are a hoot they have such cute personalities and they can be so much fun just one more thing they tend to be little thieves they like to take things from around the house and hide them shoes keys wallets etc pretty much anything laying out so put up what you don't want to search for later lol if you decide to get a ferret i believe you will really enjoy one just be the best ferret owner around because they deserve only the best have a lot of fun  Ferret Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Japanese tea ceremony Dog Social rule Domestic rabbit Dog training Cat Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan Garfield Professional wrestling match types House Mouse Poker jargon Glossary of nautical terms Emergency preparedness Characters in the Smurfs Chinchilla The Apprentice 2 Trapping Kakapo Happy Tree Friends Pitaten Sea-Monkey RuneScape quests Milton H.

select breeding to rat breeders please i've heard of rat breeders breeding brothers and sisters to make certain characteristics stronger which if done wrong can make things weaker too but i also heard that doing that will cause health or temperment problems so i was wondering if its safe to do that and also breeding mother son or father daughter for the rats' health in the case of a good breeder who knows the family lines very well this can be okay inbreeding by itself doesn't cause problems in order for problems to crop up these problems already have to be present in the family lines if a breeder knows that their lines are free of issues doing a close breeding like that shouldn't cause any issues breeding a random male and female rat with no knowledge of their genetic background though is asking for problems  Selective breeding Plant breeding Dog Dog breeding Incest Rat Inbreeding Cat Puppy mill Dobermann Eusociality English Springer Spaniel Docking Guinea pig Agriculture Guns, Germs, and Steel Kakapo Havanese Fancy rat Genetically modified food Show cat Dog breed House Mouse Hamster Black panther Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Arabian horse Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Primate Bernese Mountain Dog Species German Shepherd Dog Abortion debate Chicken Free will Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Horse Domestic rabbit Bird migration Password Dragon Booster Tibetan Mastiff Encantadia Genetically modified organism The Tribe Great Dane Hemp Ferret Dachshund Africanized bee Epistemology Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bene Gesserit Potato Wheat Development of Darwin's theory Order of succession American Pit Bull Terrier Extinction Brown Rat Green Revolution Honeybee Ethics Aladdin (1992 film) Biology and sexual orientation Maine Coon Domestication Beagle Genetic engineering Apple Pitaten Minor Discworld characters Horticulture Family The Origin of Species Fathers' rights Nuclear power Discus (fish) Theodicy Sampling (statistics) The Secret of NIMH Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hanoverian (horse) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Labrador Retriever Sin City Animal testing Pekingese Breed registry Canary Basset Hound Domestic goat Monty Hall problem Salic law F1 hybrid

how do i properly pet my hamster so it feels comfortable n relaxed back when i had hamsters i found the best way to make them feel comfortable is by giving them a place to hide like a baggy pocket they'd go to sleep in there also if you give them a few sunflower seeds while holding them they'll just sit there and eat it or stuff their cheeks making a happy hamster hehe you've got to remember our hands are huge to a hamster so for us to feel like we're petting them it must not feel that great for them imagine having your hair stroked with a sofa cushion  Upholstery Mattress Golden Hamster Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Chair Shaggy dog story Cat Eight ball Mouse-like hamster Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Hypnosis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Billiards The Smoking Room Physical intimacy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Snooker W.I.T.C.H.

how do i tell a fancy mouse from other varieties how can i tell the difference between other varieties and the fancy mice what are the fancy mice there are various mouse species one of which is mus musculus there are various m musculus varieties types each named after their particular coat type or colour or marking to describe one single mouse you need several variety names e g a black and white patched mouse with sort of curly fur would be called a black and white although i believe the white is usually left out broken marked rex some m musculus are wild a k a house mice others are referred to as lab mice or pet mice or feeder mice they're all the same mouse species fancy mice is a confusing term which is used for different groups of mice by different people fancy mice can have any coat colour marking whatsoever for me it's just a term used by petstores to differentiate between mice they've raised to be sold as pets and those they've raised to be sold as feeders both are the same species you just hope they've actually spent some time handling the fancy ones which unfortunately isn't true for every petstore despite the fancy name they give these mice for others however fancy mice is the term used for mice who are bred specifically to be the best example of their variety combination they are often a lot bigger bodied and bigger eared than other mice these are the mice that are taken to shows and judged and win prizes etc as such these mice are sometimes also referred to as show mice which i think is a better clearer term see for example the pic halfway down this article http www fancymice info whymice htm the reason i think show mice is a better term is because if i tell people that i have fancy mice some will think i have very large mice with excellent markings etc but i don't my mice are only fancy mice in the way of not being feeders i e they're pets they're not show mice i hope that answers your question greetz cyzahhe  House Mouse Mouse Fancy rat Cat Labrador Retriever Domestic rabbit Hamster Horse Species Coat (dog) Cheetah Dog Color Blue Whale Monster Rancher monsters Rat Mouse (computing) Brown Rat Taboo food and drink Gene Shetland Sheepdog Ferret Red Fox Gray Wolf Border Collie Black panther Knockout mouse Stoat Human Tortoiseshell cat Cat coat genetics Livestock Tasmanian Devil Domestication Leopard Patent Havanese EastEnders The Secret of NIMH Discus (fish) Pottery Heraldry Dobermann Cultivar Chess opening Pet store Alaskan husky John Steinbeck Island Fox Tiger English plural Great Dane Shen Gong Wu Diamond Griffon Bruxellois Keeshond Senescence Trademark Mink Microsoft Model organism Panthera hybrid Fault (dog) Casting Hiberno-English Live 8 Computer Software testing Chinese language Domestic goat Trapping Diablo II Siberian Husky Elephant European Rabbit Neopets The Joker's Wild Patricia Ford Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Dog show Poodle Tarantula Quotation mark Pet skunk City of Heroes Black (people) Mickey Mouse IMac Common bean AmigaOS Pet Shop Boys Universal Serial Bus MapleStory B-side

my hamster almost everyday when i wake up i look in his lil cage and i c water im wondering if he is sweating or if it is the water that he got on his body giving himself a shower basically can hamsters sweat and if they can what should i do if you have a male hamster you will notice a large dark patch of fur on both sides of the hip area these are called scent glands and every so often your hamster will rub against certain areas of the cage to mark his scent and claim the cage as his own hamsters are fiercly territorial and must be housed seperatly often the oil from the scent glands can give the fur a slightly greasy damp look this could be the cause however if your hamster is defenatly wet like water has splashed over him then get a cloth and dry him immediatly and find out where the wetness is coming from hamsters are dry desert animals and contact with water on their bodies can make them very sick  Hamster Animal communication Sweating Dog Trapping Fancy rat Sento Skunk Hyperthermia Chinchilla Japanese toilet Fur farming Golden Hamster Clothing Jock itch Skin Cat Ferret Hypothermia Territory (animal) Platypus Sauna Hair Domestic rabbit Diving suit Hiking Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Pet skunk Dandruff Sugar Glider Soap Cheetah Earwax Leaf Social aspects of clothing Fire extinguisher Printmaking Leather Survival skills Gland Pottery Mattress House Mouse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Linen Hydrotherapy Spotted Skunk Sexual fetishism Perfume Psoriasis Cruising (maritime) Sulfuric acid Salad Fingers 2003 United States Grand Prix Professional wrestling aerial techniques Humidity Great Basin Textile manufacturing Jam (TV series) Towel Potto Carnivorous plant Tlingit The Young Ones (TV series) Thermoregulation Fecal incontinence Olfaction Desert Beaver Hippopotamus Common cold El Ni__o Sage Epithelium Autonomic nervous system Guinea pig Rebreather American Beaver Upholstery Bottlenose Dolphin Bathing Thermal power station Radiation therapy Utah Dehydration Semen Geography of China Sock Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lake District Horse Mortal Kombat Priestly Code Tanning Mosquito Swamp cooler Yarrow Glossary of partner dance terms

netherland rabbit help i want to get netherland dwarf and i need help on how to care for them here are a few tips i gave to another person on a similar question it is best to keep an indoor rabbit but if your going to keep an outdoor rabbit you should keep the hutch in a shed to protect it from the sun and cold weather this should start in spring to allow your rabbit to get used to the weather rabbits are heat sensitive and get heatstroke easily so keep your bunny out of direct sunlight also if you would like to let your rabbit run around and nibble on fresh grass you should buy a rabbit run make sure and keep the run on grass that has not been treated with weed killer if you cannot afford this it is just as good or even better to let your rabbit run around a bedroom cover all wires with chewproof tubing first and close all doors litter training is helpful if you are going to keep your rabbit indoors you should keep it in a cage and let it run around in an enclosed area such as a room some of the time with whichever cage or hutch you may buy make sure it is big enough for the rabbit that you are going to put in it the bigger cage the better the good thing about netherland dwarves is that they do not require a huge cage even though a big cage would still be good litter training is easier than it may sound spayed or neutered rabbits are more easily litter trained since they dont leave waste in any other areas to mark their territory your rabbit will start to leave most of its waste in one corner of its cage put a litterbox in that corner and fill it with dustfree unscented cat litter then place some of its wast inside the box to show the rabbit what it is for litter training should always begin inside the cage multiple litterboxes are sometimes needed when your letting your rabbit run around in the house unless you are planning on using your rabbit for breeding purposes you should get it spayed or neutered this can help your rabbit to prevent certain diseases but also is expensive make sure and find a good vetrinarian for your pet you will need to take your bunny to the vet for check ups monthly also to get its nails clipped regulary and to neuter spay your rabbit find a vetrinarian who specializes in exotics because they are the ones who will be able to help your rabbit the most pet shops usually sell rabbits but they are often healthier when you buy them from a breeder when you are buying a bunny look for these signs to show you that it is healthy looks attentive unclouded wide open eyes healthy coat with unmatted fur strong equal teeth no stains on the fur around the anal area feed your rabbit pellets but stay away from the cheap department store brands it will also need fresh hay at all times as well as fresh water it is important that you keep a water bowl in its cage as well as a water bottle until you see that your rabbit knows how to drink from the bottle your bunny will also need about a handful of fresh greens each day but don't feed it food that you aren't positive is safe here is a list of plants that are safe to feed your rabbit with a link to a picture to show you what they look like and also of some poisonous plants that you should not feed your rabbit safe to feed dandelion leaves http www hormel com kitchen images refimages seasonedinsight fruit veggies greens greens dandelion jpg parsley http health

jpg plaintain http indianspringherbs com images plantain plantago major jpg grass clippings i'm pretty sure u know what these are so i don't need to provide a link just make sure that it is grass that has not been treated with weedkiller or pesticide fruits apples pears and peaches are favorites of many rabbits these are some plants that are poisonous and should not feed your rabbit buttercup http z about com d healing r r feg buttercup jpg hemlock http www lib ksu edu wildflower wildflower hemlock jpg foxglove http www english country garden com a i flowers foxglove jpg nightshade http www english country garden com a i flowers woody nightshade jpg remember if you are not completely sure whether a food is safe or not dont feed it to your rabbit also don t give your bunny more than a handful a day if you have a small rabbit if you feed to much your rabbit might get a stomach ache you will also need to give your rabbit wooden chews to keep its teeth down since they are constantly growing my rabbits enjoy fresh maple twigs which are safe to give you can also buy wooden chew toys from a pet store rabbits also need to be groomed often especially the longhaired ones grooming helps to remove old dead hairs and helps knew ones to grow this is important because rabbits unlike cats do not have the ability to throw up so the hairballs can sometimes block their breathing path i have a shorthaired rabbit and use a soft baby brush to groom her if ever you think that too much hair has gotten into your bunny s mouth then feed i a laxative such as a dandelion leaf which should help to clear the throat you should probably do some research before buying one to learn how to care for it you can get this from library books here are a few internet sources that i have found http www hsus

caring for guine piggies i need some information on piggies please what gender is better are they really friendly can they live alone there is no difference in either gender some say that males have more personality though in the end it is personal preference if you use the correct introduction techniques when introducing a new guinea pig to an old one all guinea pigs should get along fine guinea pigs are really friendly they are odourless and only bite when they are either scared do not like what you are doing or can smell food on your hands it depends on the personality of the guinea pig but almost all of them love cuddles and enjoy your company they can live alone but in the wild they are herd animals so they do far better in pairs often far more active and happy when in or more you may want to get and spend lot's of time with the guinea pig but really you can not be there like a companion can be sure to get of the same underline and bold sex to prevent babies good luck  Pig Gender Human sexual behavior Livestock Pig (zodiac) Care Bears Dairy Gender role Cat Hamster Invader Zim Grammatical gender Bulgarian language Sexual attraction Gender-neutral language British coinage Pet skunk Pigs is Pigs (1937) Domestication Sexual differentiation Social rule Rei Ayanami Baboon Spanish nouns Animal testing Taboo food and drink Animal husbandry Breastfeeding Transsexuality Bisexuality Lord of the Flies Chinchilla Eric Cartman Sex The Muppet Show Coconut crab Ranma __ characters Gay slang Physical attractiveness Biology and sexual orientation Cuisine of Africa Guns, Germs, and Steel Child sexual abuse Animal Liberation Front American Black Bear Semen Elephant Human Nine Inch Nails Deer Political correctness Happiness Hippopotamus Kangaroo Pet Characters in the Smurfs Coprophagia Morphology (linguistics) Hamton J.

what do pet rats eat my brother got a pet rat and i was wondering what a good diet for him is a good diet to feed your rat is what is called a block diet or as everyone else said the pellets the reason for this is that it provides more nutrition when you give your rat seed it is like a treat for them the rats can choose what they want and leave everything behind so they can loose nutrition that way the block diet also provides a good substance to chew on rats always need things to chew on their teeth always grow making them a part of the rodent family if they get to long it can be really bad for your rat and that can result in the need to get your rats teeth trimmed which isn't very cheap rats do really good with most vegtables don't over feed though again the veggies should be given once a day rats like salty things so anything salty would be a treat for them rats can pretty much eat most human foods but that doesn't mean it is good for them provide veggies like carrots and collard greens stay away from lettuce and such because it is mostly water and not nutritional they also have little treats at the store you can give them but don't go overboard on those either cause that can result in a fat rat things like hamsteroids are a good treat they provide a good chewing surface and a minimal amount of vitamins not enough to supplement anything also rats like bananas and oranges oranges are good to give to rats because of the vitamin c i hope this information helps f y i whatever diet you choose be sure to keep him on it changing his diet all the time can make him sick  Hamster Fancy rat Vitamin C Nutrition Vitamin Domestic rabbit Tocopherol Tooth Vegetarianism Food Genetically modified food Cat Folic acid Breastfeeding Raw food diet Chicken Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Pet skunk Dietary fiber Veganism Antioxidant Dieting Bread Cyanocobalamin Ramen Cheese Egg (food) Rat Anorexia nervosa Tooth enamel Famine Stomach cancer Vegetarian nutrition Chinchilla Milk Healthy eating Organic food Bodybuilding Theory of conduct Hedgehog Soybean Soy milk Coronary heart disease Atkins Nutritional Approach Garlic Kim Possible Taboo food and drink Oily fish Sea-Monkey Brown Rat Tobacco Nutrient South Beach diet Colorectal cancer Dental caries Chronic fatigue syndrome Dog training Fruitarianism Life extension Fecal incontinence Hamburger Dog food Vitamin D House Mouse Rice Food coloring Acorn Rodent Alzheimer's disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Binge eating disorder Maize Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Food guide pyramid Blood (computer game) Textile manufacturing Calorie restriction Trans fat Potato Squirrel Goldfish Potassium Cuisine of the Southern United States Garfield Sauerkraut Coeliac disease Miso Banana Weight training Cirrhosis

i think my russian dwarf hamster has wet tail what can i do if it is can it be passed between cage mates one of the symptoms is that his tail and tummy area is moist and he also has a cage buddy is wet tail bad could he die from it he is also spitting out all his food from his pouches like whole seeds laying on the wheel and keeping his eyes closed while walking thank you every one for your info unfortunately we were too late with a vet appointment for today and my hamster passed away last night it was for sure wet tail i had to medicate animals at petsmart and wet tail was a common thing that we had to treat my advice is that you go to a pet store and try to find something called dritail it's going to give some antibiotics to him you want to find something with probiotics as well probiotics are normally given after administering the antibiotic this is because your animal is loosing the good bacteria in his intestines as a result of the wet tail and the antibiotic if the hamster has no good bacteria in his belly then the wet tail will just keep on and it could kill him you want to separate the two hamsters when you are medicating them its ok to have a small cage so like a travel cage will be ok to keep the sick guy in but just don't keep him in there that won t be good wet tail is normally caused by stress they get so stressed out it makes them sick and the result is the nasty diarrhea or wet tail therefore you might want to start limiting the amount of startling things that he is suffering from anything from a tv to clapping or loud voices can set them off in the beginning it is better to have them in a quieter area the reason for separating is for good measure and to keep track of him it's a quarantine tank if you are medicating an animal and not the other one it is easier to administer the medication when he is alone that way the healthy one doesn't get any unecesary medication once he gets better you can move him back to the other tank you want to give him lots of water he is loosing a lot of water because of the wet tail you want to make sure that he doesn't get dehydrated another thing to try is to give him oats in his food the oats help suck up the extra moisture that shouldn't be there another thing is that you don't want to change their diet suddenly if you just got them from a store then they were most likely on something called block diet if you are just feeding seed after just getting your animals that could cause wet tail too i highly suggest slowly changing them back to the block diet if they are eating seed block is more nutritional and it provides something to chew on but don't go changing up your little hamster s diet now that he has wet tail that would be a bad idea i'll give you some links to the products i recommend be sure to follow the directions of the medication thoroughly this first link is for a product called oasis wet tail plus it comes in tablet form and it has probiotics if you can get your pet to drink water then this one works well however don't try to administer this medication in a water bottle it would be better to place a small dish in his area http www petsmart com global product detail jsp product c eprd id folder c efolder id assortment c east id content c ecnt id bmuid itemno in small pet n ne this second link is to the product i mentioned above it is a liquid that comes with a dropper it could be necesary to do the liquid because your animal is refusing to drink which can happen if this is the case use a dropper to administer water but if they are at this point it probably wouldn't hurt to find a vet and sometimes animals will refuse to drink the water because they can taste the medicine in it for whatever reason this is your other choice http www petsmart com global product detail jsp product c eprd id folder c efolder id assortment c east id content c ecnt id bmuid itemno in small pet n ne be sure to clean out the cage a lot for the sick guy like every other day or as needed and make sure to clean out the healthy guys cage to remove any nastiness and to ensure he stays healthy as i said wet tail more commonly happens when the animal is under stress or has had a change in diet this is the most common reason when the animal becomes stressed it loses some of its good bacteria which causes the other normal microbiota normally found in the intestines to over grow this results in an infection your animal has a whole bunch of bacteria in his intestines but when wet tail occurs it flushes out some of that good bacteria which lowers some of the other bacteria's competition so it makes it easier for the other bacteria to grow this results in an overgrowth the antibacterial will knock down those extra bacteria in the intestines so that the other bacteria have a chance to build back up which is where the probiotic comes into play the antibacterial has lowered the number of bacteria that was causing him to be sick the probiotic will help add that bacteria that should be there i hope that clears up why it happens i had to take a microbiology class in college  Fancy rat Nutrition Stomach cancer Common cold Chicken Crohn's disease Acne

what type of cage do you think is the best to keep a hamster in i suggest getting a wire cage wire cages are easier to clean and last longer cages like critter trails are bad news they are completely made out of plastic so you have to replace the parts often and replacing this and that every so often starts to become a pain hamsters chew on everything including their cage this is dangerous because they could escape from their cage another bad thing about these plastic cages is the lack of ventilation this results in twice the clean up and the clean up is not easy on these cages they are built with tons of little hiding spaces these little hiding spaces are the areas that the hamster likes to go most which means it's where they will go potty most you will have to completely take them apart to get everything in the cage clean and remember cleaning is twice as often as normal normal is about once a week so you can see where i'm going with that cages like critter trails look like loads of fun for your animal and they can be but i would suggest only using these cages as like a playground for them not a habitat you can provide just as much fun for your hamster in a wire cage you can still get the tubes to put inside their cage and you can use bird toys for your hamster i give my rat toys that have wood and bells on them so he can chew on them they like it just make sure that you get a cage that is big enough to fit a house and a wheel inside of it they need their home and exercise to stay healthy be weary though of wire cages with wire mesh on the bottom letting your animal run around on bare wire is dangerous because their toes can get caught in the metal which can result in the lose of a toe they have plastic coverings for just this instance just know that in time almost everything you put in your hamsters cage is going to have to be replaced in time because of your hamsters need to chew so it would be a relief to know that your cage wont have to be part of the replacing which ultimately means the safety of your pet a ten gallon tank is just as problematic as a plastic cage not so much that they can escape from it but that it too can be a hassle to clean and again it does not provide a lot of ventilation so that ammonia stays in their habitat the ammonia build up is bad because it can give you hamster a respiratory infection which brings up another point make sure to use only aspen or products like carefresh for their bedding wood chips of pine and cedar contain aromatic oils in the wood which some people find pleasant but i'm sure it wouldn't be so pleasant if your face was right next to it all day and when your animal defecates on the wood it causes the oils to come up into the hamsters lungs which can result in a respiratory infection  Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling match types Ferret Fire fighting Equine conformation Poker jargon Mattress Drill bit Plastic Wire Welding Seismic retrofit Knife Tobacco Cruising (maritime) Pneumonia Hydrogen economy Animal testing Cocaine Asthma Strap-on dildo Glossary of climbing terms Chair Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide M16 (rifle) Naval mine Fish farming Ammonia Soap Bong John Cage Tire Electrical wiring Social rule Textile manufacturing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bicycle frame Cannabis cultivation Air pollution Sea-Monkey Novelty (locomotive) Lung cancer Brewery Babe Ruth Gas metal arc welding RISC 1957 World Series RuneScape quests Thermal power station Scale model Lionel Corporation Japanese toilet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Door Perfume Asbestos Cat Compact audio cassette Garfield Toilet humour CPU design The Apprentice 2 Solar power Anchor M60 machine gun Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Barbed wire Combine (Half-Life 2) Top-bar hive Autonomous building Hiking Mechanical ventilation Prostate cancer The Young Ones (TV series) Happy Tree Friends Crate training Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Energy development Casting Glossary of firefighting terms Anthrax Haloalkane Tesla coil Dialysis Haibane Renmei Rail terminology Liquid breathing Chicken Dairy

which is beter i am planning on getting a hamster which is beter a female or a male and please state a reason why i disagree i have had many many hamsters in my life have a female now and it seems to me that my females are just a friendly as my males although i did have a favorite male that was mean as fire i loved him even though he bit me and charged the cage and i was kind of scared to put my hand in to feed him i would have to trap him against the wall of his cage in order not to get bit he was a cambell's dwarf i have had a mix of cambell's and syrians at the same time anyway i loved him because of his meanness he had spunk he was the smallest cambell's i've ever seen and he was the meanest animal i have ever seen and i practically raised him i was as gentle and nice to him as i was to every one of my hamster's but he was just vicious i guess i will say though that the males are way lazier than the females my female is almost years old now and she still runs all night long my males would retire from the wheel at just over a year and would instead only force themselves to run when i put them in the ball  Hamster John Cage Monster Rancher monsters Wrigley Field Professional wrestling match types YuYu Hakusho Time Out of Mind Spider Fur farming Eric Cartman Indianapolis 500 Avenue Q Theory of conduct Animal testing Tenshinhan The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Wolfrider Pet skunk CPU cache Jon Secada Stone Cold Steve Austin Monogamy Pinky and the Brain Characters in the Smurfs The Angry Beavers Vegeta Kirby's Dream Land 2 Textile manufacturing Domestic rabbit Internal ballistics Gordon Campbell Trapping Fast bowling Lion The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Kim Possible Guinea pig On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Zhao Yun One Power She Loves You Drag racing W.I.T.C.H.

how much will it cost to euthinize a gerbil one gerbil of my gerbils has a tumor and is losing his fur he sleeps like all day he is still eating and drinks a lot i feel bad for him and can't even look at him he has a large blad spot on his neck and is almost years old i wanted to get his tumor removed but i'm only and don't have money to pay for it he also has a good risk of not making it through will they charge me to put him out of his pain how much please no rude comments i'm already upset about this as it is cowboys you should be ashamed of yourself i would never ever do that to my gerbil hi i can understand your worries about your gerbil's tumor it can be really hard to know the right thing to do when your pets start getting old a vet checkup sounds like it's in order don't worry though vets will not recommend euthanization unless the pet's quality of life is bad like if they're terminally ill or have severe pain or if the tumor is affecting a major organ and your pet can't live comfortably you mentioned that he's sleeping a lot but eating and drinking well years is kinda old for a gerbil some animals can lose hair as they age just like people do and elderly pets do need a lot more sleep than young ones the good news is that if he's able to eat and drink and he does so with enthusiasm the quality of his life is probably ok and he won't need to be euthanized animals that are really sick or hurting will often have no appetite and it'll be obvious that they're in pain once i had an older rat with a big tumor on his leg since he seemed happy enough ate and drank and played the vet said that he'd probably die of old age before the tumor seriously affected his health surgery was also risky for him too because of his age however if your gerbil is having problems getting around or eats drinks much less than normal and is unresponsive when you or the other gerbils play with him he probably is doing badly and the vet may recommend putting him to sleep if the cost is an issue do a search for your local spca they may be able to help you find a vet that you can afford hope this helps good luck  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Cancer Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Cat Fecal incontinence Ferret Pitaten Kodocha Hypoglycemia Babe Ruth Euthanasia Sin City Theory of conduct Grief Colorectal cancer Dog Tuberculosis Binge eating disorder Lung cancer People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Pet skunk Chronic fatigue syndrome Radiation therapy Anorexia nervosa Cancer of the larynx Trapping Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Tooth enamel Social rule Humphrey Bogart Malignant melanoma Pneumonia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Goodness and value theory Breastfeeding Breast cancer Garfield Childbirth Insomnia Poker jargon Obesity Hamster Traumatic brain injury Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs Publicly funded medicine Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Soft tissue sarcoma Sleep EastEnders Animal euthanasia Timon and Pumbaa W.I.T.C.H.

something new for my guinea pig i dont like my guinea pig to be stuck in her cage and shes the only one so i want to give her some more playtime usually i just let her run around the room and i think she likes that but i want to give her more choices any new playtime ideas what do you do for your pig for her to have some fun a toy that i use is cat balls w bells in them you would be surprised at how much they like them they love the sound of the bell inside the ball when they push it around with their noses i figured out that guinea pigs love to crawl around in tight places so sometimes i make a little maze for them w tissue boxes or any other kind of box i think you can also go to a pet store and buy some tubes for guinea pigs to crawl in but whatever you do don't get a ball that some people say they can roll in guinea pigs have bad backs and are not nearly as flexible as other rodents they can really hurt themselves in one of those the balls are only supposed to be made for rats mice hamsters and all of those other little critters before i knew about how bad the balls are for their backs i got a ball for my guinea pigs and i put one of my pigs baby in it and she just sat in there really scared you can also try to teach your guinea pig to walk on a leash some guinea pigs just wont learn because they just don't like it like my guinea pig chester but maybe yours will you can also train your guinea pig to do little tricks i taught my pigs to stand on their hind legs for treats there are tons of things you can do with your guinea pig  Hamster Guinea pig Dog training Domestic rabbit Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) Professional wrestling match types Blonde on Blonde Chinchilla Shaggy dog story Pet RuneScape quests Professional wrestling holds Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Diving Fancy rat Taboo food and drink Sinfest The Sims 2005 ICC Trophy Rodent Glossary of American football Animal testing Milton H.

roborovski dwarf hamsters the pet store i normally shop at is getting young roborovski dwarf hamsters next week they've been quarentining them for a few weeks and they're ready to sell by wednesday in three weeks i'll be going to that pet store to buy one of those hamsters one for me one for my boyfriend for his birthday we both want females and i intend on buying them at the same time and having them live together for a few days before i give it to him we're hoping to have our hamsters be friends even when living at different houses like bring mine over to play with his is this possible or will they just fight even if they've known eachother oh and also is chinchilla dust okay for roborvorski dwarf hamsters i know you need dust for them to bathe in but i'm not sure what kind to buy many normal dwarf hamsters are allergic to it but since they're a different species maybe it will be okay i'm not sure hamsters are extremely territorial so the likelihood of keeping them together whether temporarily or permanent will probably never work sure they are together in the pet store but they are still young and they are siblings but in time the chances of them fighting gets higher and higher they are meant to live alone as they do in the wild if you do choose to let them visit keep an eye on them really this can cause them to become stressed especially if you do it during the day when they are supposed to be sleeping chincilla dust would work fine for a dust bath i've never heard of them being allergic to it but still be careful they really don't need a dust bath since hamsters are naturally always cleaning themselves like a cat good luck  Hamster Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Pet The Ashlee Simpson Show The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pleiades (star cluster) Cat Urinary incontinence Little Britain Pet store Neopets Galaxy Angel Hello Kitty Red Dwarf characters Fancy rat Allergy Menstrual cycle Pet skunk Infantilism The Death Gate Cycle The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Insulin W.I.T.C.H.

giving hamster attention does my hamster need a ton of attention i recently got back to soccer practice and it is hours a day and i also work a couple hours a day and when i get home i don't always feel like getting my hamster out how much does he need held and or petted a small amount of attention each day is better then none at all doing this about the same time is also a good thing i feel that if you do it a regular time combined with a bit of holding and some food it would be best maybe a special tidbit as a reward for being held and fresh food and water upon being returned to his cage is nice if you can keep that routine up at the same time each day and work in additional time when ever you can this should help keep your hamster tame and friendly and looking forward to your companionship be careful on over feeding treats too many could be a bad thing sometimes i sort out the large striped sunflower seeds from the mix and offer these as treats also whole grain cereal like cheerios are good keep it simple and healthy  Hamster Bread Fancy rat Guinea pig Breastfeeding Cheerios Veganism Domestic rabbit Theory of conduct Spider Golden Hamster Dog training Japanese tea ceremony Cat Cereal Domestication Pet Pet skunk Organic farming Health insurance Rice Vegetarianism Omega-3 fatty acid Chicken Breakfast Animal testing Kosher foods Organic food Care Bears Falconry Social rule The Pet Sounds Sessions Urinary incontinence Agriculture Oat Food Current teachings of Prem Rawat Maize Sorghum XML Diarrhea Snake charming Folic acid Stomach cancer The Sims Monogamy Famine Livestock Genetic engineering Mealy Parrot Hemp Dog Scientology beliefs and practices Neopets Garfield Pet Sounds Internal ballistics Tocopherol Textile manufacturing Extreme Programming Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Zinc Zuiderzee Works Upholstery Sea-Monkey BitTorrent Customs and etiquette of Japan The Amazing Race House Mouse Sears Holdings Corporation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Green Day The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Scooby-Doo Alcohol fuel Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sunflower seed Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fecal incontinence Utilitarianism Monster Rancher monsters Gaucho (insecticide) Popeye Vermicompost Fugu The Young Ones (TV series) Sunflower Starfleet ranks and insignia Trapping Rebreather Surveillance Animal communication Neolithic Revolution Medical prescription Ron and Fez Food guide pyramid Vicky (The Fairly OddParents)

i want to breed my hamster i want to breed my hamster in a few month so i want to ask some question i think my male hamster is a syrian because he golden will my hamster kill another syrian right away or is it possible to breed can my syrian breed with a dwarf or any other how can i tell if the mum hamster is pregnet what happen during her pregnet days will i have to do anything during and when it time pregent should i remove the male hamster or let it be i heard the male kills other if remove the male hamster the mother eat the baby how can i reduce mum hamster from eating her babys when can i pick them up what an avarge litters of the mum to give birth if im missing somthing importenent can u answer it too plz answer all and i know if i touch the baby the mum hamster wont renember the scent and eat the baby but inclue that in the list firstly the time has to be right for syrian hamsters to breed because if its not then it will cause death of one hamster mainly the male also if there syrians then they must be kept in separate cages so they will not fight nope the syrian can only breed with a syrian and dwarf with dwarf etc nothing would happen because they are different species of hamsters their gestation period is only days the signs that are female syrian is pregnant are she doesn't not come in to heat days after the mating drinks loads of water stores loads of food makes a nest her abdomen will swell but you cant see this untill about days after the mating her nipples become more pronounced the only things that will happen during the pregnancy is that her abdomen will swell and her behavior might change as well all you need to do is just give her food which is high in protein eg bits of boiled eggs cheese boiled pasta and roast chicken the sandwich chicken she will give birth with in days and she might get very restless a day before she gives birth when she goes in to labour just leave her to do her job because if you don't then she will turn on her babies after the birth try not to disturb her much only to give her clean food and water and you can continue giving her plenty of vegetables and food which is high in protein you should remove the male becasue he will distract the female hamster and they both will eat the babies you can stop the mother from eating her babies by trying not to distrub her often only for certain things you should clean the female hamsters cage out days before she gives birth because you wont be able to clean it again untill weeks and once the babys are weeks they can be held a bit but not to long they should be taking from a drip feeder by days and they should have opened there eyes by now and you should put another food bowl in for the baby hamsters because they do eat loads they should be fully weaned by days and they might also start to fight so you should seperate them into there single sex groups male in one and female in the other you can tell males from females very easy because the females have circle shapes close together and the males have circles which are far away from each other the average litter can vary from to but some hamsters are known to have babies which is a lot just dont touch or distrub the mother and babies while they are in the cage because the mother will see this as a threat and she will attack her babies and eat them just wait untill the handleing age which is weeks at the most good luck hope it helps  Chicken Guinea pig Elephant Platypus Cat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Social rule Kakapo House Mouse Spider Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Obstetrics Abortion debate Golden Hamster Garter snake Dog Tasmanian Devil Domestic goat RuneScape quests Bird Ant Milk Childbirth Mosquito Egg (food) Potato Koala CPU cache Giant Panda Fecal incontinence Menstrual cycle Tarantula Friends EastEnders MRE Anopheles Clownfish American lobster Coconut crab Seabird Coffee Breech birth Monogamy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Premature birth Acorn Animal communication Tofu About a Boy Red Fox Cuisine of Denmark Ostrich Nerpa The Ashlee Simpson Show Snake Livestock Species Kodocha The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fasting Japanese tea ceremony Urinary incontinence Leatherback Sea Turtle Ramen Hamburger Sea Otter Atomic Kitten Kosher foods Lion Baboon Cheese Goldfish Kender Coeliac disease Sharon Tate Hedgehog Nile crocodile American Black Bear Food Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Textile manufacturing Estrus cycle

baby hamsters about days ago my hamster had her babies she has previously had other litters and the male has always been taken away but when i do this she tends to eat the babies around days old this time i decided to see wot would happen if i left dad in the cage with them and he has been really good when i go into the room he tends to be siting with them and doing everything apart from the feeding obviously is this normal for the father to take this role as iv heard that the dad can be nasty to the babies and kill them also when can we start to pick the babies up regarding picking the babies up depends really on the mum and how she is with them when you are around if she is nervous and runs around alot i would leave it as long as possible before handling the babies once the babies have their eyes open and are covered in fur it should be ok to handle them this is usually days old the male hamster does take care of the babies especially dwarf hamsters he will even assist on the actual birth of the babies and clean them up and keep them warm until mum is ready to feed them the only problem being that the mum can get pregnant again hours after giving birth so make sure she has plenty of fruit chopped up cucumber and apple and some boiled egg the babies will also eat these and this will help wean them  Hamster Breastfeeding Social rule Domestic rabbit About a Boy Chicken Pregnancy Elephant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Egg (food) Conker's Bad Fur Day EastEnders The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Nerpa Childbirth Fancy rat Kodocha RuneScape quests Jewish cuisine Toxoplasmosis Koala The Ashlee Simpson Show Cat House Mouse Little Britain Internet phenomenon Days of our Lives Kakapo Premature birth Paintball Golden Hamster Gray Wolf In vitro fertilisation Apple Giant Panda Kitten Vegetarianism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Rutles Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Jon Secada RuneScape Random Events Fecal incontinence Infant Korean cuisine Jam (TV series) Red Squirrel Sharon Tate Paradox Viva La Bam Father's Day (Doctor Who) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Prenatal diagnosis Thermal power station Shark Tasmanian Devil Cerebral palsy Livestock Bat Wonderland (McFly album) Sexual reproduction Capercaillie Boom Town (Doctor Who) Japanese tea ceremony Comanche Hedgehog Dog Happy Tree Friends Cuisine of Singapore Futurama (TV series - season 5) Alois Hitler Friends Soup Charmed American lobster Sea-Monkey Sea Otter Coeliac disease Aphid Vitamin C Spider Domestic goat Foodborne illness Nile crocodile Teenage pregnancy Leo Wyatt Parenting Baseball Spina bifida Hollyoaks John Cage The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kyle Broflovski Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Biological pest control Potato

i want to breed mice or rats well i have a boa constrictor and want to breed some mice or rats both for the experience and hopefully savng on trips to the pet shop i just have a few questions about it where could i keep the cages and if i have them too near my room will my snake freakout because there's food nearby he can't reach is there anything special you need to do with rat mouse babies to keep them fed and everything and is there a cheaper way than the already bagged rat food to give them a balanced diet like are there certain combinations of grocery store bought veggies that would work thanks any help is appreciated but if you're one of those psycho oh no your hurting a poor little mouse you're so mean people could you just hold it to yourself for once i've been feeding him live for about years now and have had no problems while i am fond of mice i do realize they serve a role as snake food so i will do my best to answer your questions keep the cages away from your snake especially when you are feeding your snake mice can sense the predator and it will make them stressed they are also quite adept at smelling the phermones released by the scared mouse dinner of your snake this is especially true if there is blood involved never really watched a snake eat i don't know keeping the mice in a stressed environment would be inhumane and counterproductive to your goal of breeding them there is nothing super special you need to do about the babies themselves i don't recommend just throwing a whole bunch of mice in a cage and waiting for baby city your best bet would be to pair one male with two females and to separate them from her close to birth females can show aggression to another's litter and males have a nasty habit of eating the babies however if you leave the male in with her the night she delivers she will likely get pregnant again immediately because mice go through a postpartum estreous after a day or two it is ok to remove any dead pups from the cage there are almost always dead ones especially with new mothers and old breeders make sure to wean them at weeks so the mother can care for the next litter the lab style rat mouse blocks they sell at the pet stores are really the best easiest cheapest way to feed the critters they look like little beige bricks rats only eat few blocks a day so you can imagine mice eat way less than that if you buy just veggies and such you run the risk of giving them all diarrhea stick with the blocks but feel free to supplement that diet with small amounts of veggies that you probably already have around the house most of what i have said is true for rats too but from my experience its easier to keep rats paired as one male one female rats have larger litters but they take up a lot more space hope this helps add on don't get the cheapy blocks that they sell at like wal mart they come in a box they are not properly nutritionally balanced edit for mrs phas also make sure you are only breeding feeder type rats mice not fancy ones besides from my own experience feeder animals have a better temperament than the fancy ones feeder rats are most generally albino rats that are bred for the sole purpose of feeding predators fancy rats are strictly bred for pet purposes i just suggest feeder boring un biasedly bred for color and coat preference rats because they are easier to handle in my experience  Ferret Dog Pet skunk Livestock Nutrition Brown Rat Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rat Pet store Snake Kakapo Mouse Chinchilla Vegetarianism Elephant Prostate cancer Vitamin C Discus (fish) Tocopherol Gray Wolf Folic acid Animal testing EastEnders Dobermann Taboo food and drink Stomach cancer Wal-Mart Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bird Urinary incontinence Kitten Domestic goat Atkins Nutritional Approach Tasmanian Devil Fugu Albatross Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ron and Fez Garfield Raw food diet Obesity Labrador Retriever Hedgehog Fish farming Japanese tea ceremony Trapping Squirrel Brain Nerpa IBM PC compatible Surveillance RuneScape quests Seabird Red Fox Shark Spider Shaggy dog story Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Veganism Spidey Super Stories Garter snake Peter Singer Kangaroo German Shepherd Dog Hypoglycemia The Secret of NIMH Food Platypus Social rule Domesticated turkey Bat Craps Genetically modified food Fancy Crane Clinical depression Neopets Tobacco smoking Postpartum depression Floppy disk

what are the pros and cons of having a gerbil pros gerbils are low maintenance pets they create less odor and they do not need frequent vet visits as they are not prone to tumors or respiratory problems unlike mice or rats they have a longer life span compared to other small rodents they live for about years their antics can keep you entertained for hours cons since gerbils are highly social animals and do not like being alone at all you must get at least two gerbils lone gerbils have been proven to live shorter and less healthier lives most gerbils are friendly but they can jump quite high this can make handling relatively challenging be sure to handle them above a soft surface so that they won't get injured if they fall to prevent them from escaping they must be placed in aquariums with a mesh wire lid to cover it wire cages are not advised as they will incessantly gnaw on the bars it can be both annoying and harmful for them  Hamster Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Cat Gerbil Ferret Trapping Chinchilla Pet Mouse (computing) Rat Energy development Dog Meriones unguiculatus House Mouse Gerbilling Marine aquarium Muroidea Aspartame Hypoglycemia Drill bit Equine conformation Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Murinae Electric motor Mattress Degu Welding Trench warfare Prostate cancer Brown Rat Seismic retrofit Tooth Barbed wire Nutrition Garfield Professional wrestling match types Animal communication Animal testing Wire Mouse Knife Obesity Pet store Cyanide Lung cancer Fox hunting Sin City Liquid breathing Tooth enamel Naval mine Cannabis cultivation Eddie Guerrero Lemmiwinks Sea-Monkey Gas metal arc welding M60 machine gun Aquarium Tick Cancer Divorce Glossary of climbing terms Lemming Incandescent light bulb Cricetidae Tobacco smoking Manual transmission Narbonic Tuberculosis Recumbent bicycle Mountain Gorilla Colorectal cancer Tesla coil Sleep Blood (computer game) Asthma Medicine Piano Professional wrestling aerial techniques Decompression sickness Car handling Dilbert Textile manufacturing Car safety Nelson Erazo Heinkel He 100 The Sims Breastfeeding Hydrogen economy Menstrual cup Introduced species BASE jumping Animal Liberation Front Eumuroida Space elevator Weight training Kangaroo Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

hamsters if you want babies after how long should u separate the babies from the mom i dont want the mom eating the babies or the babies making more babies ill keep the girls and boys separated and on avrage how much do they make in one litter how can u tell when its a boy or girl penis they dotn have any lol they do but there too hard to see how long are they pregnant ok this is a guide found on my website http www freewebs com hamsterhighway index htm and it was made by me breeding hamsters you generally would breed hamsters according to their specific breed ie breeding only syrian hamsters or breeding only chinese hamsters it is not advisable to breed hamsters of different breed types if you've got a friend who has a hamster of the same breed of the opposite sex you can arrange with him her to breed your hamsters and then share the load of having to find homes for the young this is the case for breeding syrian hamsters as they are more often than not kept in isolation dwarf hamsters are different in that they are sociable and can live in social groups so long as they are introduced to each other after weaning and they 'grow up' together if you have a cage of dwarf hamsters who are not of the same sex they will start to breed when they are ready and they generally will pretty much 'self regulate' their breeding pattern and frequency and you just have to 'watch' it unfold what's the best age to start breeding hamsters generally for female hamsters the ideal age to start breeding is at months any younger and you would risk her having a poor litter she has still to grow herself and also increase the likelihood of cannibalism leave it any longer than months and you run the risk of birth complications for male hamsters they are sexually active from as young as weeks of age but it's probably best to leave them alone till they're about months old before contemplating breeding from them dwarf hamsters kept together will start breeding at months of age how often can i breed my female hamster whilst you can just keep her breeding litter after litter this will greatly shorten her lifespan it's best to wait about months before you breed her again this will give her body time to 'recuperate' and put her in a better condition come mating time if you stick to this regime it will mean that you will probably get litters out of any one breeding female hamster as they often become sterile when they turn months old sometimes you can get a third litter from a female but this is the exception rather than the rule strangely enough this is the self same pattern that dwarf hamsters will adhere to even though they have 'free rein' as to how often they mate and produce offspring litters per breeding female is the norm for dwarf hamsters kept as mating pairs breeding syrian hamsters because syrian hamsters are kept in isolation you usually have to play 'match maker' when it comes to breeding frivolities female hamsters come into 'season' once every days they ovulate during that time and it's only when they are in season that they are 'receptive' to the advances of the male hamster any other times fighting would inevitably occur how do i know when my female hamster is ready to breed or is in season given that they will go into season once every days if you get it wrong the first time there's always the next time generally the female hamster will emit a musky odor just before she comes into season and inevitably it's always around evening time that the 'oestrus period' time when she's fertile and accepting of the male starts and it lasts for anywhere between and hours it is during this 'window of opportunity' that she will be receptive to the male so breeding them has to take place then after the female hamsters finish their season there is a thick white mucous discharge that is excreted from their vagina less experienced hamster breeders will then take that as a starting point count another days after that and then try for a breeding encounter anticipating the next oestrous cycle days later if the weather is cool winter most hamsters will not breed the other tell tale sign that she is in season is that when you stroke her back towards her tail she will freeze on the spot flatten out and lift her tail the hamster breeding protocol okay you've established that the female hamster is ready for breeding what now you have choices you can put her in the male's cage or take them both out and put them in a separate breeding box neutral territory wear protective gloves have an object ready to separate them if any fighting ensues they often aren't very selective about who they nip and will nip you in your efforts to separate them if they choose not to breed if you've picked the right time the female will 'freeze' with her tail in the air and allow the male hamster to mate with her a few times keep them together for anywhere between minutes to an hour when they start to lose interest in the mating ritual then it's time to separate them virgin males can be a bit confused initially and may turn the female hamster off by mounting her from all directions but they will soon learn 'on the job' breeding is generally more successful when both male and female hamsters have had previous mating encounters how can i tell if the mating has been successful that the female hamster is pregnant if the female doesn't come into season again days later she's regarded as being pregnant she will start to become decidedly pregnant her abdomen will swell no she's not getting fat and her nipples will start to become more pronounced gestation lasts days for syrian hamsters days for the russian hamsters days for chinese hamsters and for roborovski hamsters the average litter for syrians is about but can be as great as which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in the uterus campbell's dwarf hamsters tend to have in a litter but can have up to winter white russian dwarf hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters as do chinese and roborovski hamsters hamsters are born hairless and blind in a nest which the mother will have prepared in advance after week they begin to explore outside the nest they are completely weaned after weeks or for roborovski hamsters most breeders will sell the hamsters to shops when the hamsters are anywhere as of about months old what do i do after the mating you return both hamsters to their respective cages female hamsters will need extra food during the pregnancy high protein foods like tofu boiled egg wheat germ to aid in birthing can be added to the diet she can still be handled but it's best to leave her alone when it's closer to the expected birth date clean out her cage at day and take out the exercise wheel provide her with extra nesting material eg shredded paper then put her cage in a warm quiet spot with as little disturbance as possible and wait ooo the babies are here what now let her nurse the babies till they are about weeks old do not disturb the nest during this time as she may decide to turn on them and eat them the cage will smell during this time that's unavoidable any attempts to change the bedding material would increase the likelihood of cannibalism so it's best to just leave it for the moment and put up with the smell sometimes despite all this the female hamster will still cannibalize her young this is common in female hamsters bred under months and in older females who will cull some babies to reduce the numbers in the litter continue with the high protein foods other ideas are bread soaked in milk during this time at about weeks of age the hamsters are ready to be sexed and weaned they are no longer reliant on their mum for nourishment you can keep them in different boxes cages all the male babies in cage and the females in another they can be kept in these groups for a further weeks in the meantime you can find new homes for them and they can go to their new owners at weeks of age it is part of nature that female hamsters may eat their young if this happens to you here are some factors that may or may not have caused it she was stressed out by loud noises or the father the babies were touched by a human and therefore had another scent on them the babies were deformed or had genetic disorders the mother was a first time inexperienced mother mothers may eat the babies for any of these reasons i have found that the second birth is usually much larger and has a much better survival rate because the mother knew what was going on and what to do the first litter was sort of a surprise to her and she had to learn the ropes sometimes the mother never has any trouble with the first litter again it just depends on the hamster if your mother eats her first litter give her plenty of recovery time and try again unless she has problems with her health i can guarantee more of the babies will live the second time around it often takes a little time to get the ball rolling but once it is done you will have plenty of little pups  Tarantula Horse Cephalic disorder Sexual intercourse Red Fox Human Biology and sexual orientation Nutrition Insulin Friends Premature birth Anorexia nervosa Social

why did my mouse do that please click here when i had a mouse named oreo she'd escape every night orsoand get into my rats cage she could eaisily get in and out of my rats cage because the wiring was in the first time she did this i thought they killed her becauce she was curled up in the bedding sleeping i even turned the cage around because the rat's cage was next to her cage so i thought maybe she had a certin spott she got out of but sure enough the next morn she was in there with them she did this up until the day she died about a week after she started my mini poodle killed her not my rats luckily i still have them oreo was housed with another mouse could it be she wanted someone to play with and she didnt like snowflake the other mouse and she liked sugar and buiscut the rats more accualy she died because my mom let my dog in my room when i was cleaning their cage downstairs my dog killed oreo but snoflake was safely hidden in a slim fast can it was probably just curiosity when she got out of her cage she probably followed the rats' scent into their cage just be thankful that the rats didn't attack him and yeah you probably should have gotten another cage but i don't think her death was your fault unlike other people and also you can own more than one pet such as rats and mice anyway that's my two cents  Fancy rat Hamster Ferret Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Garfield House Mouse Trapping Cat Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Secret of NIMH RuneScape quests One Piece minor characters Flea Russian space dogs Mickey Mouse Animal testing Johnny Cage Dog agility Hip hop collaborations Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban EastEnders Steven Wright Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Ron Weasley Brown Rat Domestic rabbit Oreo Sin City Kakapo Dilbert The Shining (film) Palindrome Sid Vicious Dog The Visitation Lady and the Tramp Eminem The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Phoebe Buffay's songs Lauren Bacall Fox hunting Pok__mon Live!

is the growth on my rat something i should worry about i've had a female medium sized fancy rat named tetra for about two years now she shares a cage with two newer rats but we put her in her own cage a few weeks ago because it looked as though she had gotten in a fight with them and lost we also have a ferret and it had a pretty bad flea problem so we took all the animals out bathed them and cleaned their cages when i lifted tetra to wash her i immediately noticed a fairly large swollen growth on her underside it almost looks like she's switched sexes anyone with a male rat knows what those guys are dragging around all day except the swollen area is almost black she doesn't seem to be in pain and i can't afford to take her to the vet just to have them tell me it's nothing so does anyone have any idea what's going on with her tumors are very common with rats and almost every rat experiences a tumor it will keep growing and growing if you dont do anything unspayed female rats are prone to developing mammary tumors pituitary tumors and other estrogen dependent tumors as they age at the time of menopause days mammary tumor incidence increases sharply and pituitary tumors begin to appear a second increase in mammary and pituitary tumors occurs around the end of the second year from days durbin most of the tumor susceptibility research in unspayed rats has been done on different strains of laboratory rats strains and populations differ in how susceptible the females are to developing tumors susceptibility may vary widely  Puberty Fancy rat Acromegaly Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Chemotherapy Breast Ferret Breast cancer Radiation therapy House Mouse Prolactinoma Aspartame Growth hormone treatment Growth hormone Mesothelioma Hypoglycemia Equine conformation Rat Brain tumor Endometrial cancer Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Growth hormone deficiency Mammary gland Pituitary adenoma Bubonic plague Black Death Soft tissue sarcoma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Tumor Animal testing Esophageal cancer Domestic rabbit Sexual differentiation Colorectal cancer Sento Orgasm Cat Breastfeeding Brown Rat Penis Hyperprolactinaemia Sugar substitute Ovulation Kaposi's sarcoma Metastasis Kakapo Welding Ovarian cancer Cryptorchidism Sexual dysfunction Genetically modified food Intersexuality Weight training Rat Park Oncology Ebola Mobile phone radiation and health Gynecomastia Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Babe Ruth Vitamin C Ron Weasley Child sexuality Glaucoma Baldness Turner syndrome Fertility awareness Acne Malignant melanoma Dairy Estrus cycle Methylsulfonylmethane Bioinformatics Obstetrics Osteoporosis Pretty Good Privacy Social rule Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Milk Amenorrhoea Hodgkin's lymphoma Apoptosis Thyroid Stroke Folic acid

im getting a rat and i need some hints how do you hold a rat what do u feed it i go on to lots of rat websites and some of them say that they dont like fruit some are saying they can have human food and i need some help please before anything else please please please do not get a lone rat to get a lone rat is cruelty at the start rats are sociable animals that live in large groups to get a lone rat would be like you living your whole life in solitary confinement amongst aliens with no one to snuggle or cuddle or understand you for your rats' happiness and a longer life get a same sex pair at minimum where to get your rat a breeder is preferable you wil get a well bred fed socialised ratling but will probably have to go onto a waiting list but failing that presuming your in uk there are many ratlings for rehoming here http www fancy rats co uk community viewforum php f and transport can often be arranged to get them to you us based http www goosemoose com component option com smf itemid forum rat board you can get a petshoppie and they are just as deserving of a home as any other rat but do so in the knowledge that petshop rats come from mass breeders who care very little for the welfare of their stock they view them as a commodity much like a clothes shop views cheap t shirts and all rats bred by them not deemed pretty enough for the pet trade go to the reptile trade for food pet shop rats are less socialised so more scared smaller and more prone to illness than breeder rats having said that my two longest lived nearly both came from petshops my last choice for a new to rats owner would be a rescueshelter however this is only because the rats there have often got healthproblems old socialisation probs and can be too much for anyone without experience how to pick up a rat if its small then scoop the whole rat into your cupped hands as it gets bigger put your hand over the shoulders and fingers under armpits lift slightly and put other hand under bum to cradle him when you have picked him her up then cradle them next to your body or pop on shoulder lap and let wander expect squirming expect to have your fingers hands explored once your rat is used to and confident with you he she will happily run onto your hand to come out handle them every day as much freetime as possible mine have an hour morning spot clean time and after pm the door is left open and they come and go til my bedtime but remember rat proof your room first they will chew everything as is their nature and if they can get their head though a gap their body will follow diet well the first thing to remember are that rats are omnivores and can eat pretty much what we do and like us they do get bored with food so although rat nuggets or lab blocks are a complete food full of everything the need its would be like us eating rice crackers everyday pretty boring this is a good site http www fancy rats co uk home go here for diet http www fancy rats co uk community viewforum php f there is a list of good fruit veg and cereal here too or http www ratsrule com diet html if us based huge thing to always remember though is no citrus or mangoes for boys and that a rats food should be dried mix and fresh food daily and that whatever your eating they can have a little off as long as no salt is added for example i cooked spag bog last night and they had their own portion of that as i cook all meals no salt young rats need loads of daily protein for good growth bananas avocadoes boiled scramble egg porridge made with soy milk never ever use dairy chicken wings and thighs with bones tuna in fresh water sardines pilchards mackeral in fresh water or tom sauce top tip feed fish the night before big clean day tinned beans chickpeas a good indicator of good growth and food is the tail is it nice and plump and round near the body or does it have a squareness to it that indicates lack of protein start to cut back the daily protein from about months until you are only feeding protein rich foods aprrox once twice a week habitat largest cage not tank you can afford and use paper litter yesterdays news biocatlet bob martins cardboard squares my preferred hemp carefresh for lining it never ever use sawdust shavings or wood pellet litter rats have delicate resp systems and the phenols released when their pee soaks into wood can scar their lungs fill the cage with tubes hammocks toys http www fancy rats co uk community viewforum php f for ideas us based http www goosemoose com component option com smf itemid forum rat board spot clean every day and even with males youll find you have only to do a deep clean once a week my live in the living room and by spot cleaning and weekly cleaning there is no smell and i have a snobby sister who would soon tell me if their was a smell when she visited rather than looking at many sites i would restrict yourself to one or two with many memebers that way you get the most help from the most people http www

how do i feed my day old hamster the mother escaped i need to know what to do incase she doesnt return where can i find supplies to feed the baby do i have to keep it warm what do i do basically caring for orphans one of the most helpless feelings that a hamster owner experiences is finding a cage of pups and mama has died or played houdini and disappeared but there is hope if the little ones are to days old they will do fine with a little extra tlc and plenty of nourishing food the first step if mama has died is to thoroughly clean the cage make sure there is plenty of bedding since mama isn't around to shred the toilet tissue for a nest roll up the sleeves and have a shredding party place the cage in a warm location with no drafts if the little ones appear to be a little cold young pups sometimes have problems maintaining body heat that's why mom is generally sleeping with them place a heating pad set on low under the cage lower the water bottle so it is easy for them to reach as an added precaution unflavored pedialyte can be placed in the bottle to prevent dehydration fill the food dish with plenty of their normal grain seed mix which can be sprinkled with some powdered milk wheat germ and or quick oats for added protein and sustenance canned dog food beef or chicken mashed well with a fork or boiled egg can be placed in a small saucer one that comes in toy dish sets works well fresh apple will also help with hydration although the list of treats that the pups would enjoy is astronomical the primary consideration should be to maintain a well balanced diet that remains similar to what they have been accustomed to during their short life if mom has just decided to take a little private holiday don't clean the cage the scent should be the same as it was when she left and set some traps for her the commercial live traps work well or place some grain and a special treat in a deep dish or pan and use books or pieces of lumber to build steps up to the rim of the dish mom will fall into the dish attempting to retrieve the goodies and will not be able to get out once mom has returned put fresh food in the cage and a treat place her back in the cage near the food when she is ready she will find the pups unless they find her first care for the pups the same as suggested above until mama returns in the event the pups are days or less adoption needs to be considered since they still need mother's milk to survive and grow into healthy pups there are as many methods of adopting orphans as there are breeders the following is a method that has proven to be extremely successful the pups will undoubtedly be cold when they are discovered clean all residues from the nest off the little ones and wrap them in a clean terry towel rub them gently to stimulate circulation generally the gentle rubbing and warmth of ones hands will have them wiggling in no time it is best to find an adoptive mother that has little ones a day or two older or younger again make sure that all the residue of the orphan's original nest has been removed take some of the nesting material that is around the adoptive mother and her babies and wrap it around the orphans continue holding them and let them wiggle around in the nesting material the goal is to make them smell just like mom's other pups entice the adoptive mom away from her nest with a special treat once she is busy tending to devouring the treat place the orphans in the nest with the other babies make every effort to keep mom busy for as long as possible and give the orphans time to squirm in and around their new siblings and hopefully smell just like them go away and don't disturb mom and the babies and although it is tempting don't look in the nest for at least a week there's no absolute guarantee that this will work sometimes it is hard to fool hammies and they know right away that there strangers in the nest and will eliminate them adoption successes are solely in the paws of the adoptive mother if she believes that there is something wrong with the orphans or if they aren't healthy she will mercifully dispose of them if she can't detect any different smelling kids in the nest and they are all healthy she will probably settle right in and raise them fortunately hammie moms don't count noses so a few more or less doesn't generally affect the quality of care they receive note i have had syrians successfully raise dwarf orphans but so far have not had a dwarf raise a syrian rusty some more orphan advice in the event that you find yourself with a litter of pups and no mom pups days and younger have a better chance of survival if you can find a surrogate mom a surrogate mom is a female who has recently given birth and is nursing her own pups there is a chance that she will accept your abandoned pups as her own but no absolute guarantee if no surrogate mom is available you can try the following but keep in mind this works best for pups over days old you will need kmr which is a milk replacer that is used for kittens but it says right on the package that it can be used for hamsters if kmr is not available you can also use either baby formula or evaporated milk evaporated milk mixed with warm water for pups from birth to approximately days old you have to feed them around the clock with an eyedropper feed them drops of kmr approximately ever hour once they begin eating solid food in addition to nursing you can drop the amount of kmr in the eyedropper to approximately ml and now feed them still around the clock but every hours continue this schedule until they are days when even pups with a mom stop nursing completely an important step that you can't forget is that after each feeding you gotta stimulate each pup to urinate and defacate just like the mom would do to do this gently rub each pup's gential and anal area with a warm moist cloth pups lose body heat real fast without the mom to keep them warm so supply extra nesting material in the form of white unscented toilet paper and place a heating pad under the tank cage keep the temp on a low setting pups also have a tendency to dehydrate rapidly so when you see them start to eat the dry food that is scattered around the tank cage you can also supply them with a piece of peeled apple to prevent dehydration also when the pups are old enough to drink from the hanging water bottle fill it with water and unflavored pedialyte water pedialyte this will also help prevent dehydration gotta add this because it's important when you feed the pups with the eyedropper be real careful and do it gently never forcing the fluid because it's real easy for a pup to inhale the liquid and once it's in the lungs it can kill the pup hopefully you will never have a litter of pups abandoned by the mom but if you do always remember it's possible to hand feed them the way i described and yeah it's hard work but worth the effort to save the little dudes from death take care comrades the rebel is over and out hope

how can i stop my hamster from putting her food in her wheel she continues to take her food from her bowl to her plastic wheel that is attached to her cage when she runs in the wheel the food makes loud sounds and goes all over the place i have emptied the wheel each time she does this and she just doesn't get it well sorry to say that hampsters aren't really able to be trained not to do things they have their habits and i don't think there's a way to help that i think that your only way out of this is to take away her wheel or buy her a new one that the food would fall through at least the small stuff so it doesn't make as much noise once she realizes that her food won't stay there she'll probably stop best of luck  Hamster John Cage Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story The Price Is Right The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breath of Fire III Fecal incontinence Baroque chess Timpani Rail tracks Chopsticks The Hampster Dance Customs and etiquette of Japan Fancy rat Winning Streak Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skateboarding trick Sin City Aerial (dance move) Guinea pig Chicken The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Chinchilla Escapement Professional wrestling match types Pok__mon Live!

i was wondering which would be better to get a mouse or rat i want a gerbil that ca be found in australia either a mouse or rat that i can train and tame which would be better to get i have two mice already but i want to get something that would be easy to teach to go to the litter when on me or to go down to my hand best answer is included i am looking for a spot on answer and a few more details such as where to buy from breeders if in campbeltown nsw i want to know which would be better in training purposes please make your answers clear and easy to understand gerbils i own two gerbil people are very jealous of hamsters hamsters have the popularity that rightfully belongs to gerbils while hamsters have cuter faces and softer fur they are just not as nice or fun as gerbils they are nocturnal so usaully all you see is the back of your hamster sleeping in a ball in one corner they are not ready to play until it's time for you to go to bed then they obsessively run that wheel th th tha thumping all night long hamsters smell up the cage very quickly and will pee on you hamsters are solitary animals so you need to keep one per cage this makes keeping them more expensive and breeding them more difficult than gerbils gerbils are great they are dinural so are awake night and day they get very excited about any new thing you put into the tank for them and will immediately explore it you can make cardboard buildings tunnels for them and they will love crawling into through over and on them then they will gnaw it all up you can house two for a gallon set up they are by far the cleanest of all the small pets so bedding is not a big expense they live in clans and groom nest play together you can house up to seven boys in one tank five gallons of space per gerbil they are easy to breed and both mother and father are great parents gerbils come in about colors and varieties they are not a big commitment as the life span is about years of course more than half the people on here are going to say get a hamster because they have never had or even heard of a gerbil before two years ago i had never heard of gerbil either here is my story i went to the pet store to get specifically a hamster i was almost broke because i had spent like all my money on the cage and supplies i had like bucks and was hoping the hamsters were fairly cheap when i got there i realized that all the hamsters were and above just my luck i was so dissapointed then the store clerk let me know that they had gerbils on sale for i didn't know what it was she showed me them and they were all awake playing together i thought they were super cute and decided i wanted one i picked one out and brought him home i'm so glad that i did'nt have enough money for a hamster that day because happy my gerbil is the best pet i ever had i found out that gerbils like to live in pairs or more so i got him a male gerbil friend its now been two years with him and autumn my second gerbil i really hope you get to experience the joy of owning a pet gerbil they are the best rodents to have in my opinion good luck with your decision this site will help you learn more about them http www abcgerbils com  Guinea pig Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Cat Meriones unguiculatus House Mouse Ferret Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Gerbil Sin City Social rule Rodent About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Chinchilla Gaia Online Rat The Fairly OddParents Knots Landing Friends W.I.T.C.H.

a way of approaching a new guinea pig i adopted two guinea pigs today and i was wondering some good approaches for the new pigs one is very calm and the other is pretty hyper and scared i'm also guessing it's normal for them to hide in their tubes and pigloo's right yes guinea pigs are prey animals by nature in the wild they stay still for up to minutes and hide amongst the long grass when predators are near by but also if they are feeling scared what your guinea pigs are doing is something to the same sort of effect hiding in their tubes and pigloos because they are scared and afraid of predators as they are new they are also getting used to their surroundings the new sounds smells and people this would be making them very skittish the best thing to treat this is time and a whole lot of patience aproach the cage slowly and quitely but at the same time let the guinea pigs know that you are there by talking in a soft voice each movement must be taken slowly as quick movements will scare them and most importantly bring a vegetable parsley romaine lettuce treat each time you go to the cage leave them alone for at least hours i know how hard it is you can see them during this period just do not pick them up after this period you can have your first cuddle start with minutes per piggy and work your way up from there you should also start floor time after this period to start with choose a small room and make it piggy safe after doing floor time in a small room for about week give or take try using a bigger room good luck  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Cat Fancy rat Pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Unreal Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professional wrestling match types John Cage Social rule The Time Machine Coprophagia Coconut crab Blood on the Tracks The League of Gentlemen (comedy) USS Tunny (SS-282) Animal rights The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tyrannosaurus rex Swingout Blonde on Blonde Milton H.

handling a skittish guinea pig i've had my guinea pig for a few months and she is fairly skittish probably because i know she wasn't handled much in the pet store when she was younger but she's gotten to the point where when i'm entering the room i say hi to her and she sticks her head out of her igloo and squeeks at me and when i stick my hand into her cage she walks over and sniffs at it or takes the treat out of my hand she has a sort of small cage and i want her to be able to get out and get more excercise than just doing zoomies around her cage so what is an easy safe way to pick up a guinea pig without them running away i work with exotics and yes guinea pigs are very hard to catch sometimes sometimes if you move in slow and talk to her then grab her real quick with both hands then hold her against your chest and support her legs just pet her and talk to her a lot they usually like this once you have a hold you can have a treat in your hand or ready to grab and offer her as you hold her to help this as well it's just a metter of trust it takes time so just be patient just try not to squeeze her too much when you grab her if your pig is a boy then change every thing i just said to him instead of her and please acccept my apologies  Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling aerial techniques Hamster Chinchilla Professional wrestling match types Fast bowling Mad Money Conspiracy (TNG episode) RuneScape quests Gaia Online Dog training The Inside Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Ed, Edd n Eddy Salad Fingers Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling throws Fancy rat Garfield 2000 Australian Grand Prix Trapping Equine conformation Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blonde on Blonde Floppy disk Swingout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Glossary of climbing terms Sin City Four square Mixed martial arts The League of Gentlemen (comedy) M16 (rifle) Aikido Escape from New York She Loves You Chopsticks Coming of Age (TNG episode) Diving Chicken Rayman Knife Suplex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Super Mario 64 One Piece minor characters Eric Cartman Ashton-Tate Three Little Pigs Care Bears Tenshinhan Parade (military) IBM PC compatible Kasparov versus The World Shawn Michaels Breaststroke Mach kernel Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Reservoir Dogs Ferret Milton H.

i want to get hamsters and i want them have bbys what hamsters live in peace together the others are right if they are talking about syrians but dwarves are a whole different story they are social unlike syrians who need to be kept one per cage and a pair can live together quite comfortably also as a campbell dwarf breeder i know that they will not eat their young unless there is a good reason ie you touched the babies a baby has a defect inadequate cage space ect but a good reason is not because the male is in the cage males can usually be in the cage with the female d but depends totally on the female during the pregnancy the birth and helps with the raising of the pups he won't eat them but if you keep the male in the cage with the female she can become pregnant again right after giving birth which means as soon as the first pups are weaned she'll be having another litter and that is way too soon for her to be pregnant again as an experienced breeder i would suggest that you not breed your hamsters as you know nothing about them or breeding them do alot of research and be prepared to have a lot of cages if your hamsters don't have homes lined up you'll also want to know how to sex them if they are dwarves since they can live in the samec cage if you accidentally put a male in with three females chances are you're going to have three pregnant females all with pups on the way so i ask can you handle that  Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Gray Wolf Breastfeeding Dog Nerpa House Mouse Pregnancy Ferret In vitro fertilisation Domestic goat Pet skunk Monogamy Gun dog Sexual reproduction Elephant Folic acid Fertility awareness Golden Hamster Red Fox Red Squirrel Shark Tigon Platypus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Satanic ritual abuse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sea Otter Prenatal diagnosis Chicken Toxoplasmosis Oral contraceptive Friends Pack (canine) Sex assignment Kitten Childfree Boston Public Abortion Premature birth Antarctic Fur Seal Obstetrics Teenage pregnancy Clinical depression Postpartum depression Harp Seal Oral sex Animal testing Psoriasis Cattle Dobermann Fancy rat Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) John Cage EastEnders Kodocha Norman Borlaug Days of our Lives Equine conformation Tobacco smoking Bird Golden Retriever Gender Monster Rancher monsters Schizophrenia Koala Cat Mountain Gorilla Nuclear power Childbirth Infanticide Miscarriage Condom Cephalic disorder Birth control Apple Bee Cross-dressing Turner syndrome Earless seal Rabbit Manx (cat) Melanie Wilkes Liger Bicycle frame Charmed Sheep husbandry Animal Liberation Front Chinchilla Anencephaly Little Britain Knots Landing Gender identity Fur farming Honeybee

my hamster got out of her cage somehow and i don't know where she is please give me advice on what to do i put her food bowl with food in it of course by the bookshelf next to my room door when we get home i'm at work with my dad we're going to put a cardboard box with food in the bottom where the bowl currently is and then put a ramp next to it leading to the top then when my hamster goes up the ramp and drops into the box she won't be able to get out right right i'm desperate alright i'll listen very carfully when i get home but i broke out in tears when i found out she wasn't in her cage also i always close my door at night but it has this realy big crack in it and she could easily squeeze through the first night we got her she got out and the only reason we founf her was because she got stuck in a really old gluetrap it was covered in dust so she wasn't very stuck first remember to be as quiet as possible so as not to scare your hamster into an area unreachable to you if you have a ten gallon bucket stack books to form a stair case in the area you think she may be in drop her favorite food in the bottom and a little peanut butter it's smelly and will attract it's attention if you know what room your pet was lost in close the door this keeps it confined and protects it from other pets in the home who might find a hamster to be ummm tasty hamsters are nocturnal meaning they are more active at over night so you will have a better chance of seeing catching your hamster at night check the bucket in the morning with any luck it'll be munching happily on peanut butter good luck  Hamster Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling match types New York Giants The Adventures of Pete & Pete Cleveland Browns Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Dalek Invasion of Earth RuneScape quests Plastic Ferret The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Time Machine The Shining (film) RuneScape Mini-Games Trapping Jon Secada Fire fighting Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Equine conformation Pittsburgh Steelers Grandview, U.S.A.

what to look for in a pet rat i am going to petsmart tomorrow to get rats but what should i look for when i buy them and i have searched for rats to adopt but there isnt any in my state and the closet rat breeder is a ways away so this is my only choice so please help me out and tell me what i should look for thanks check the eyes and nose to make sure they're clean make sure their coats are shiny and not matted although male rats tend to have coarser coats so don't worry too much if the males' coats aren't super soft handle them if you can to see if they're aggressive or extremely timid some rats tend to be a little jumpy at first but they shouldn't be leaping out of your hands if you're gentle the rats should be curious and try to sniff you come up to you rather than sit in a corner ignoring you if they nibble your finger a little i wouldn't worry they're still young and my rat did this while she was at the store but hasn't done it since then good luck and have fun with your rats  Hamster Dog Fancy rat Guinea pig Rat Pet skunk Social rule Labrador Retriever Russian joke Cat Domestic rabbit Characters of Naruto Canary Milton H.

is it possiable for a rat to sneeze and not be sick my rats all sniffle around each other sometimes and once in awhile they sneeze but they all don't have discharge from their noses or eyes i also keep their cages really clean and i use rat friendly bedding aspen not pine and i also heard that its okay if they're a little more noisy but i'm not sure all i know is that i can't afford to take them to the vet please help me mycoplasma pulmonis the organism that almost all rats in the general pet population carry is the cause of the majority of respiratory and genital infections in rats the organism is carried in the upper respiratory system and is transmitted by direct contact between mother and babies by sexual transfer through the air over short distances and can even be passed to the babies while going through the birth canal if the mother is infected predisposing factors stress or other illnesses can weaken your rat's immune system and cause your rat to break with an active mycoplasmal infection if left untreated this can lead to pneumonia therefore it is very important to ensure a stress free environment for your pet this includes providing an uncrowded well ventilated clean cage with a safe bedding product in which to live at all times this will eliminate any chance for ammonia buildup from urine and feces or phenols from cedar and pine to damage the respiratory system's own protective capacity it is also very important not to expose your pet to other rats who may be sick since a secondary bacterial or viral infection could allow the mycoplasmal infection to accelerate to pneumonia very quickly possibly causing death some of the bacteria that may accompany mycoplasma pulmonis during respiratory disease and may worsen symptoms include pasteurella pneumotropica streptococcus pneumonia bordetella bronchiseptica car bacillus cilia associated respiratory bacillus and corynebacterium kutscheri viral infections such as sda virus sialodacryoadenitis and sendai virus in combination with mycoplasma may also quickly lead to death sda virus is frequently seen in the pet rat population so be especially careful about quarantining any new rats you bring into your home for a least two weeks symptoms the symptoms of the upper respiratory disease which involve the nasal passages and middle ears can include sneezing sniffling occasional squinting rough hair coat and porphyrin staining around the eyes and nose if the inner ear becomes involved head tilt wry neck and rolling may occur as the disease progresses it will enter the lungs if exacerbated by bacterial infections viral infections or ammonia symptoms may include lethargy rough hair coat hunched posture porphyrin staining chattering weight loss labored breathing and eventually death if the mycoplasmal infection is not complicated by any other bacterial infection or viral infection the terminal stage of the disease can last for weeks or even months there is no cure or vaccine for mycoplasma pulmonis however infection and symptoms can be suppressed with antibiotics in the early stages of the disease but will most likely become a chronic condition requiring periodic or even constant treatment this disease progressively worsens eventually causing consolidation of the lungs and abscesses in the lungs leading to death some antibiotics proven to be effective against mycoplasma are tetracycline tylosin gentamicin amikacin chloramphenicol doxycycline and enrofloxacin baytril doses are as follows tetracycline orally at to mg per pound three times daily for at least days tylosin orally at mg per pound twice daily or mg per litre of water for to days gentamicin best used in combination with cefadroxil at to mg per pound injected twice daily for to days amikacin at mg per pound injected twice daily for to days chloramphenicol at to mg per pound injected twice daily for to days doxycycline orally at mg per pound twice daily for to days enrofloxacin baytril orally at mg per pound twice daily for to days baytril and doxycycline also work extremely well in combination in the advanced stages of the disease or in cases of wry neck and rolling a corticosteroid such as prednisone given in addition to an antibiotic may be helpful in reducing inflammation by reducing inflammation in the infected lungs the rat may breathe easier resulting in less frequent gasping attacks allowing the rat to live an extended life more comfortably in the case of wry neck and rolling reducing inflammation in the inner ear will stop the rolling within a few days prednisone dose to mg per pound once daily normal use of prednisone would be only for a few days but in terminal cases where comfort of a dying rat is the goal it can be used longer another drug helpful in severe cases of pneumonia is aminophylline this drug relaxes and expands bronchial tubes helping the rat to breathe easier dose to mg per pound orally or injected twice or three times daily good husbandry breeding only from mycoplasma resistant rats and early treatment are the only things we can do to fight this deadly disease at this time someday maybe we'll be lucky enough to have a drug company develop an effective vaccine we can only hope and since you said you couldnt afford the vet try a few of these things my rat is sneezing what should i do all pet rats carry mycoplasma this is the bane of all rat fanciers hopefully your rat's immune system will be strong enough to fight it however certain factors in your rats life can significantly lower the immune system and allow the myco to take hold when this happens you'll notice sneezing perhaps some red discharge around the nose this is poryphin not blood it's the normal color of rat tears and nasal discharge if the sneezing is light and dry occasional sneezes are normal we're talking about continual sneezes important we're talking about dry sneezes if the sneezes are wet and there is a lot of the red staining around their nose and or eyes or if you hear congestion in the chest it's important to go ahead and get them to a vet for some antibiotics they can go downhill so very fast you can use children's benedryl read the label and make sure it doesn't contain tylenol you will give cc about drops to an adult rat twice a day liquid echinacea and goldenseal available at health food stores like gnc it has to be liquid form drops twice a day for weeks or you can put drops per oz of water in the water bottle in the water to prevent by mouth if there are symptoms if you have rats and one is sneezing and one isn't i treat the sneezer with meds and put the echinacea in the water to help boost the immune system of both rats try the site below http www rmca org

killing mice give me your thoughts on humane traps hi i killed a mouse this morning i take no pleasure from doing so but they are clearly in the area in large numbers and i find it necessary to lay traps when i find droppings or see one running over the kitchen worktops when i get in from work i've been using sonic alarms for a few months and they seemed to be working but now the mice are ignoring the alarms and are making a nuisance of themselves again prior to buying the alarms i killed and buried mice i am aware that this isn't a particularly pleasant thing to be doing the traps are very powerful ones so should be killing the mice instantaneously i don't hate the mice actually they're quite cute but they are ferrel and carry disease and it's not like i can make pets of them i am aware that there are humane traps but have also read that often mice starve in these traps because they are not immediately released i would have difficulty releasing the mice because i work as a chef the only viable option would be to release them in one of the local parks and my work means i couldn't always make the time to do this immediately i caught one for obvious reasons i don't want to release them in to my own back garden questions i'd like answering then how long can mouse survive without food water if a wild mouse is caught in a humane trap won't it stress itself to death in any case even if it doesn't starve is there an alternative solution i haven't thought of alyssa k and lakely i know that this is the ideal humane traps and i have seen them available in one of the local shops i am just not sure it would work for me because if i get in late and have back to back shifts so that i'm back at work early when can i release the mouse if i am to get sleep to be fit for my days work if i leave it there too long mouse starves i don't actually regard myself as an animal lover saorsie but i admire other creatures and became aware of people's hatred for seagulls and pigeons since i took on my seagull photo for an avatar clearly i have hardened my heart against the mice intruders but still i don't like killing them golden i see where you're coming from but equally i can find it absurd at times that we treat some animals with love and others with loathing vermin is anything that bugs us but some so called vermin are actually really splendid creatures foxes and seagulls being a couple of examples my stance is that i kill mice because i have to and not because i want to and if anyone can convince me that humane traps are viable in my situation then i'll give them a go if they can't then we'll go on as we are doing dragon i do currently use spring loaded traps like the ones you're describing xx cc xx your answer has me pretty well decided to give humane traps a go my first mice were caught over a month period i don't think it's so much the house that's infested as the neighbourhood generally if the mice can wait hours or so to be released then a humane trap is viable liv big open field is all very well but the area i'm in is basically industrial with a few parks fields are miles away and i don't have a car also i would like to know where i stand legally with releasing mice as i have a choice between scrubland surrounding industrial premises or parkland if i got caught releasing mice could i be prosecuted thanks brindle i would wear gloves to release the mice though main concern now is precisely where i could release mice and not be in trouble with law for doing so i think the risk of them dying of shock has to be weighed against otherwise certain death i am pretty well decided to get a couple of these humane traps by now and see if they work out thank you thekikicd i have never used glue traps and wouldn't consider doing so originally very guilty killing mice but then justified it because they were invading my home i'm not a nice person really as i kept a mouse tally of my kills my equivalent of notches on the bedpost when i first got here up to getting the sonic alarms basically it was bravado though cat good answer the house isn't mine it is a house share with two other tennants i suppose it would be an option to ask a professional to advise about mouse proofing the house without them laying poisons for the mice i might try speaking to local police about suitable places to release wild mice locally and the legal implications my concern is that by releasing them they then become someone else's problem that is why i would expect people locally to be unimpressed if they observed me i suppose a town mouse and country mouse are much the same thing i hate to tell you people this but i just heard the trap go snap and another mouse has just snuffed it v sorry also that said mouse can wait till daylight to be buried he she is after all dead and i'm not up for burying mice at am i am wondering if i will let the mice play russian roulette and give them both snap traps and humane traps they would die of stress or dehydration before ever starving you might get by with a few hours or so but overnight or anything would be really pushing it do you have any idea how they're getting inside if you could correct that problem eventually solved i'm stumped too humane traps and releasing is the way to go but if you can't you can't although snap traps and poison are certain death at least they have a chance with humane traps and eventual release you could call in a professional but that won't be kind either eta good point about 'not making it somebody else's problem' it's too bad time doesn't really allow you to free them in time and that there's no field nearby well close enough to be convenient yet far enough away to not become another's problem hopefully you can figure out how they're getting inside and won't have this problem much longer do you have a cat they might think twice about coming inside with one  Poker jargon Abortion debate Social rule RuneScape quests The Death Gate

i need some mice advice what is the largest spacing i can have for mice what is the smallest cage i can have for a expecting pregnant mouse when she has babies should i not fill the water bowl with to much water when they are fuzzies hoppers so they dont drown or should i replace it with a tube waterer if you know any spacious easy to clean mouse cage please give me the link to it please no aquariums bad air ciculation what is the smallest cage for adult female mice i this cage ok for them or is the spacing too large http www coastcages com catalog index php main page product info cpath products id zenid ae a f c e ec dbea c c or this http www coastcages com catalog index php main page product info cpath products id zenid a f a e c fcb b is the blue one ok or only the purple and would this cage be ok for my female ratties if i added a few hammocks and small animal perches here it is http www coastcages com catalog index php main page pro the only thing rat lover is that i'd like somethin with a pull out tray i have this cage for them right now http www coastcages com catalog index php main page product info cpath products id zenid d a f b f e ad a efddf fc but id like it to be larger and have a pull out tray thats why i was thinkin a rabbit hutch with a hanging tube and a few hammocks this is the rabbit cage i was thinkin about or is the spacing to large he is is http www coastcages com catalog index php main page product info cpath products id in addition to the other replies max bar spacing for adult mice according to online research i did before getting mine mm which i've tried to convert to inches for you and seems to be less than inch for a pregnant mouse i'd just use a small aquarium or ferplast type of hamster plastic tank no tunnels with enough space to comfortably make a large nest walk about a bit and eat you don't want a wheel in there because it might hurt the little ones add one once they reach the hopper stage maybe that's eyes fully open and actively exploring their surroundings because of that latter bit i definitely wouldn't use a wire cage for baby mice they might get out you're right about wire cages having better air circulation than aquariums with this idea in mind based on rat care since i had those first i started out with a wire cage for my mice too however i fairly quickly changed my mind tank like cages really do seem to be better suitable for mice also i just could not find a large enough imo wire cage with mm bar spacing for female mice plastic tanks e g for hamsters often also aren't that big and definitely not high i didn't want to get an aquarium because a fairly large one would be too heavy to carry around so i ended up making my own mouse tank out of lexan type of plexiglas i solved both the annoying top access and air circulation problem of aquariums by placing two large doors in the front of my mouse tank consisting of closely spaced wire while daily because of that distinct mouse smell cage cleaning of my mouse cage and later plastic hamster tank was a p i t a i now honestly enjoy cleaning my pretty seethrough mousie tank palace with it's wonderfully easy access i'd show you a pic but yahoo photos has closed down and i haven't had time to sort out my pics and place them online elsewhere sorry it looks a bit like the glass tank in the pic linked to below incl three triangular shelves but then with the top closed except for a small wire covered ventilation opening and the entire front consists of two large wire doors except for a cm high part from the bottom since otherwise all the bedding would fall out through the wire i see you've already been given the link to the fun mouse website fancy mice is another very good mouse website http www fancymice info re the blue and purple cages you link to for mice tank like cages work better for me see above but if a cage works better for you i haven't checked the bar spacing but since the two types low and high have equal floor space i'd go for the high type more total floor space this will probably mean that you will get pee on the wire if they pee on the top shelves my major problem with the wire cage i first used but you owe it to your little mice to get them the absolutely biggest home you can possibly afford both money and space wise since they are going to be spending their entire lives in it and they have huuuge territories in the wild in comparison just something to think about re the rat cages you link to do you have very young i e small female rats perhaps the purple one you say you currently have has a floor space that is what i'd call just do able it's actually fairly similar to what i've used for a few years i use metric units sorry yours is x cm mine was x cm but it always annoyed me how little space i had with which to do something one litter box large enough for an adult female rat one house large enough for two a food bowl and that was it they could barely turn their cute little furry behinds so to speak it made me feel a bit claustrophobic anyway ideal floor space imo x is okay is something more like x cm for your convenience x inch in addition your cage has only very little height most of which is taken up by that wheel meaning you can't do anything with it if you don't have enough space to get your pets a home cage tank whatever with large floor space you need to get the total surface area from the home's height that cage of mine i mention above albeit with a small floor space was as tall high as a young kid well over a meter keep the purple cage as a very handy transport cage though or one level hospital cage if you can remove the levels and wheel that is you never know when it might come in handy as for the possibly new blue gp cage the floor space is a bit better see below for a wire comment though the height imo however is simply unacceptable for rats yes they'll be able to stand up bare lab rat animal welfare requirement but they won't be able to do much more than that please get a cage at least cm high for your convenience cm inch i haven't looked at the bar spacing of this cage so for the rat cage please follow ratlover's suggestion of the super pet type cage for rats it's good to look for gp suitable floor spacing but you need ferret suitable floor spacing cage height the only problem with some ferret cages is that young rats esp females might be able to get out between the bars some good websites for rat cage info http www sophielynette com cage html http www rattycorner com go to cages http www fancy rats co uk resources productreviews category php c personally fyi for rats i prefer cupboard style cages unfortunately you also have to make these yourself do able but a lot of work now that i have experienced the ease of cleaning that i have with my mouse tank with doors though there's no way i'm going back to poking my arm through one of those hideously small doors of most wire rat cages so no more rats for me until i make me a grotto style cage http www dapper com au grotto htm if you really want a pull out tray personally i wouldn't want my ratties walking on that exposed wire above the tray but if you do that's your choice look into getting one of those large i e sufficient floor space and height indoor aviaries a bit more expensive yes but if you decorate it well mostly add shelves somehow you can make your little girls a wonderful home large enough in fact to add a few more ratties if you wish and that should make it well worth the extra cost in conclusion bigger is always better these are lifetime homes for your little pets and the only space they have unless you let them freerange in your house most of the day so always get the biggest cage tank for them you can afford i hope this helps greetz cyzahhe

why does my hamster do this whenever i touch it and put it back in the cage it becomes stiff your hamster is most likely a female who is in heat when you touch her on her back she will go stiff because she is assuming the position essentially she is receptive for mating she will go through this every couple of days you may also notice that she will be especially stinky during this time she's scenting to attract any males that are in the vicinity  Estrus cycle Hamster Animal communication Monogamy Kakapo Sexual reproduction Chess terminology Stiff Little Fingers American lobster Ren and Stimpy Skateboarding trick Candle Balboa (dance) Volleyball Non-human animal sexuality Obedience training Equine conformation Spider The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Flower Hansel und Gretel Ostrich USS Waters (DD-115) Tigon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pet skunk Leatherback Sea Turtle Proprioception Perfume Dog Peppered moth ecology House Mouse USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Corrosion Swinging Joy Division (band) Crinoline USS Vincennes (CL-64) Bicycle frame Tag team Anal sex Glossary of partner dance terms Sexual dimorphism Mixed martial arts Sexual differentiation Tarantula Red Squirrel Salic law USS Augusta (CA-31) Breaststroke Sexual selection Rambutan Fertility awareness Mallard Rugby union Badminton Glossary of American football Menstrual cycle Eddie Guerrero Hey Jude Sexual attraction Softball Gender Liger Dragons (Pern) Anglerfish Sexual intercourse Sonar Socrate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pole vault Chess problem Olfaction Golden Hamster Blood on the Tracks Panthera hybrid Skunk Friends Garter snake Super Bowl XXXI Emu Snooker Codename: Kids Next Door USS Taylor (DD-468) USS Austin (LPD-4) STS-114 Parachuting Professional wrestling match types Swingout Twelve Monkeys Kimono Jerry Herman The Critic Red-back spider Elephant Hall & Oates USS Texas (BB-35) Coconut crab Chess problem terminology Trapping

how to tame a hamster i have a new hamster and i want to tame it could you tell me what to do or any tips thanks wash your hands after holding food they can smell the food on you and will bite you if they think you smell like food do not wear any body spray or colougne when you pick i up or touch her she will not recognize the scent and it may confuse and scare her causing her to bite you if she does bite you go get some bitter apple spray petco or petsmart and put it on the area she bites you in if she is not biting you hard she is just realizing that you are not edible and it will go away if you don't have the bitter apple spray and she bites you tell her no in a deep voice with eye contact and put her back in the cage for a while don't pick her up at first stick your hand in the cage and let her sniff and crawl in it then try to scoop your hand under her belly and pick her up that way or use two hands to scoop her up if you grab her from above she may be startled also when you go to pick her up talk to her in a calm voice if all else fails pick her up with the scoop teqnique lie down on the floor and let her crawl on you for to minutes twice a day for two days it takes much patience and love to get them to trust you completely sometimes it is best to offer food and then while she's eating to pet her this shows her that you ill not hurt her and will train her to trust you  Hamster Social rule Milton H.

how do i help my timid guinea pig to not be so scared we got out piggie about a month ago when we got him he was at least a year old if not older and he stayed in his hut all the time we have been taking him out and he gets about hours of floor time a day sometimes more depending on when we are home during floor time he commonly stays in his hay loft and doesn't run around when i hold him he shivers and he won't come even for his favorite leafy lettuce any ideas if he was that old when you got him i'm thinking he probably came from somewhere other than a petstore or breeder right d if so it's possible that he was abused or not handled by his previous owner it'll take more time than normal to gain his trust unfortunately just be patient and gentle note i'm just guessing here i can't know for sure where he came from  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Social rule EastEnders Milton H.

two female golden hamsters living in the same cage i am probably getting a golden hamster my brother also wants to get one as well and my mom said that was okay i would like to do some more research beforehand though some of the sites i've been looking at say that two females can't live together because they will fight it also said that hamsters are solitary animals and barely ever run into eachother in the wild anyway if this is so then at the pet store why are golden hamsters housed in the same cage at a time with no problem i'm mainly wondering why everything is fine at the pet store with a few hamsters in one cage but you can't have two in a cage when they are yours sorry this sounds kind of confusing are there any experienced hamster owners out there preferibly golden hamster owners that can give me some personal experience thanks so much thanks alot everyone i really appreciate the varied opinions i haven't had the best luck with rats and my mom doesn't want mice so me and my brother have decided on getting one hamster and sharing the fun care and responsibility any other input is highly appreciated hi sara i completely understand why the living conditions at your local pet store may be confusing you and make no mistake they are misleading i currently work at a petsmart and because of the limited amount of space available in the store we generally house a maximum of six syrian hamsters to a cage a majority of the time we get our hamsters in at a young age many of whom are litter mates and they are usually sold before they reach sexual maturity often times though we have hamsters with us long enough that reach sexual maturity and we are no longer able to house them together it is not at all uncommon for us to treat hamsters with fight wounds that range from anything to minor bite wounds to very severe injuries such as a lost eye these animals are removed from our sales floor and placed in our isolation room where they can recover if an animal has permanent injuries i e scars missing toes etc or in the case of a syrian is too old to be safely placed on our sales floor with the other hamsters they are often adopted out free of charge to employees or customers now that you've gotten a glimpse of what it's like behind the scenes at your local pet store i would highly advise you to stick with what you initially read of adult syrian hamsters will fight to the death regardless of whether or not they were raised together if both you and your brother really want hamsters perhaps you should look into a species of dwarf hamster instead as they are social creatures and are more likely to coexist peacefully  Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Dog Fancy rat Cat Pet skunk Golden Hamster Tarantula Infantilism House Mouse Shark Animal communication Chinchilla Pet store RuneScape quests Zoophilia Human Vulcan (Star Trek) Milton H.

why are there so many rude answers in the pets category and are these reportable they range from just feed it to a snake to i think the best breed of animal is a dead one to shoot it with a bb gun seriously it's not freaking funny not only that but it isn't even original i've seen about different people suggesting that mouse rat hamster owners feed their pets to a snake it's getting incredibly annoying my second question is are unhelpful answers like this a reportable offense i have nothing at all against feeding pet snakes it just bugs me when snake owners seem to think that rodent owners should just throw their pet to a reptile i just read a comment saying that snakes were higher than hamsters and that all hamsters deserved to live a life of fear but yeah snakes gotta eat what they gotta eat i have no hatred of them you can try to get an offending answer removed by reporting it i don't know if y answers keeps a running count of how many times the same posters keep doing it but in the pet section i see the same jerks again and again i don't mind differing opinions but i hate the people that are just trying to get a rise out of the others i also kept mice and rats and i think they make good pets too i kept snakes as well i think everything is here for a purpose and everything's gotta eat but there's no reason to deliberately hurt someone's feelings because they care for an animal that you yourself dislike i don't particularly like spiders but i don't suggest to tarantula enthusiasts that they step on them either  Hamster Pet Garfield Shaggy dog story Cat Tarantula Snake Creatures in Bionicle Mickey Mouse Internet phenomenon Animal testing Theory of conduct Rat The Secret of NIMH FoxTrot The Smoking Room Snake charming Taboo food and drink Dilbert The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) House Mouse Fancy rat Internet troll Guinea pig Social rule Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Blood (computer game) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Chicken Fruits Basket Pet skunk Cannibalism Animal Kim Possible Capital punishment The Fairly OddParents Characters of Naruto American Alligator Reptile The Young Ones (TV series) Skunk Dog Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Joke Timon and Pumbaa YuYu Hakusho Little Britain The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fauna of Australia The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Escape from New York Shit Slashdot subculture True Crime: Streets of LA Brown Rat Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Have I Got News For You Plame affair Domestic rabbit Whose Line Is It Anyway?

hamster care i've had a hamster for my son for a couple of months bought as a baby from the pet store he seems to be in perfect health so i've never felt it necessary to take him to the vet however a friend of mine told me that hamsters need to have their teeth trimmed regularly otherwise they won't be able to eat and will starve is this true and if so how often right now he doesn't show any signs of not eating quite the opposite you don't have to take your hamster to the vet to get his teeth trimmed i have teddy bear hamsters and a dwarf hamster and have never had to get there teeth trimmed just put stuff in his cage to chew on like toilet paper rolls or paper towel rolls they love chewing on them you can also go to the pet store and buy hamster toys for him to chew on also you can give hamsters dog biscuits for them to chew on it's good for there teeth  Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Guinea pig Garfield Care Bears Tooth enamel Kodocha Dog training The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Animal testing Codename: Kids Next Door The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Mouse-like hamster Golden Hamster Ferret Dental caries Butters Stotch The Fairly OddParents Dog The McGuire Sisters Neighbours Pet Menstrual cup Salad Fingers Mojave people Canary Brian Griffin The Critic Pet store Liam Gallagher Tooth Internet phenomenon Humphrey Bogart Chinchilla Cat Shaggy dog story The Beach Boys Shit The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Friends Wal-Mart My Parents are Aliens The League of Gentlemen (comedy) RuneScape quests Sears Holdings Corporation Havanese EastEnders Monster Rancher monsters Fecal incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Alfred Korzybski Squidward Tentacles Taboo food and drink RuneScape economy Unclean animals Veterinarian Kurt Angle Teacher's Pet (Disney) Ron Weasley Nile crocodile True Crime: Streets of LA S.N.O.W.I.N.G.

thinking about introducing a new rat to my current one i've heard that rattie pairs tend to do better than single rats and i've been trying to convince my parents to get her a friend but i'm worried about possible aggression she's not too old yet and hasn't grown to full size although i'm not sure exactly how old she is she already has a strong bond with me but i can't play with her constantly and i'd like to get her a cage mate i'm just worried that she'll become territorial or aggressive to the new rat so what do you think should i get a second rat and if so how should i go about introducing them yes absolutely get a second rat maybe a third too a lot more rat keepers are finding it best to have rats in threes especially if there is one resident rat already remember rats are a very social animal and thrive with other rats although i strongly do not recommend single rats as pets it is still possible but requires a great deal of time to keep your pet rat company i would recommend younger rats than your current girl and of course the new rats should also be females mixing males and females makes for a lot more rats than most pet owners are prepared to care for make sure you have a proper quarantine cage and area for the new rats they should be kept separate at first as far as care and cost you are already tending to one rat taking care of one or two more will be very little additional time if they are all living together the cost of feeding one or two more little mouths is not much more than feeding the first one start with your quarantine after you are satisfied with your quarantine period you can start with neutral ground introductions if that goes well put the cages near each other and try a few more neutral ground visits if all continues smoothly try putting all the rats together in the same home keep an eye on the rats the first little while sometimes up to a day to make sure that there are no territorial cage issues there may still be squabbles but that is normal  Hamster Cat Guinea pig House Mouse Animal communication Pet skunk Platypus Ferret Breastfeeding Dog Garfield Divorce Rabies Introduced species Social rule Canary Quarantine RuneScape quests Chicken Animal testing Milton H.

what is wrong with my dwarf hamster's eye my dwarf hamster's right eye is sticking closed every time i take him out of his cage his eye opens up slowly but it has a reddish pink color surrounding it i see his eye sticked together like that after he wakes up could it really be because of old age i had him and his buddy for over a year thanks gerbilfuzz and sarah my dwarf hamster had that too try wiping it gently with a cotton ball soaked in warm water if a hamster has recurring problems with runny or sticky eyes or the eye appears cloudy the hamster could have an eye infection this can be treated by mixing half a cup of sterile boiled and cooled water with a teaspoon of boric acid powder available from a chemist or pharmacy and using an eye dropper to bathe the eye twice or three times a day although rare hamsters can develop cataracts and the symptom is a cloudy eye although the cataract cannot be treated it is worth seeking veterinary confirmation as the symptoms of a treatable eye infection are sometimes similar my hamster developed cataracts the cloudy eye is a sure sign so check for that loss of eyesight doesn't affect them that much though because they rely on other senses more  Hamster Cat Brewery Guinea pig First aid Common cold Urinary incontinence Tofu Glaucoma Diseases of the honeybee Coffee Malaria Domestic rabbit Tocopherol Menstrual cup Fancy rat Conjunctivitis Tattoo Otitis externa Dairy Pet skunk Medical prescription Diabetes mellitus Chicken Diabetic retinopathy Cataract Cephalic disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boric acid Turkish coffee Multiple sclerosis Plastic Blindness Snake Dog Vinegar Shock Dialysis Retinal detachment Garfield Boron Candidiasis Prostate cancer Herpes simplex virus Menstrual cycle Autism Traumatic brain injury Mouth ulcer Sake Cloud Idli Effects of global warming Al-Razi Wound Red Dwarf characters Agar plate Neurofibromatosis type II Cancer Chlorpromazine Manicure Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Elephant Leptospirosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sun Medicine Diazepam Migraine Textile manufacturing First aid kit HIV test Poliomyelitis The Legend of Zelda series enemies Homeopathy Hay fever Internal ballistics Chinchilla Hyperthermia Decompression sickness Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anthrax Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Paint Smallpox Wilson's disease Abortion Eczema Water (molecule) Codename: Kids Next Door Tea Boil Daredevil Havanese Nitrocellulose Little Britain Sterilization (microbiology)

this might be a stupid question but what is wet tail i have heard of hamsters actually dieing from it and i want to know what it is because i have russian dwarf hamsters and has babies here is everything that u need to know wet tail is a disease that is thought to be stress related and often affects young hamsters around the time of weaning as this can be a stressful time therefore it is important when buying a new hamster that its cage is prepared before its arrival home and it is left to become familiar with its new surroundings in peace apart from feeding for a day or two to keep stress to a minimum it is also thought that wet tail can be caused by bad living conditions etc which could also cause stress wet tail is a bacterial infection or an imbalance of the natural bacteria in the hamster's stomach or intestine and is often confused with diarrhoea although a hamster with wet tail has diarrhoea the diarrhoea is so severe that the hamster is wet and or dirty not only around the anus but usually around the top of the tail as well the diarrhoea is accompanied by a strong unpleasant smell droppings are pale in colour and extremely soft and may contain mucus the hamster often walks hunched up is weak and lethargic and may squeal in pain symptoms take days to appear and the disease is often fatal with death occurring as early as hours after the appearance of the symptoms therefore it is vital that veterinary treatment is sought immediately if a hamster shows symptoms of wet tail do not rely on over the counter products such as dri tail to treat wet tail as these are often not effective against severe cases of wet tail these should only be used if it is not possible to get the hamster to a vet immediately and veterinary advice should still be sought at the earliest opportunity but do ensure if you have used any over the counter product that you inform your vet when you visit hamsters suffering from wet tail often die from dehydration rather than from wet tail itself or they simply refuse to eat or drink also because of the severe diarrhoea wet tail can lead to rectal prolapse where the intestine is pushed outside the body through the anus veterinary treatment will consist of a course of antibiotics anti diarrhoeal medication and help with rehydration the hamster should be kept warm and quiet whilst undergoing treatment and be disturbed as little as possible wet tail is contagious to other hamsters and so any hamster suffering from wet tail should be isolated from other hamsters it is also a good idea to wash your hands thoroughly after handling a hamster suffering from wet tail to avoid passing the infection back to the hamster worsening its condition and certainly before handling other hamsters this is best kept to a minimum it is a good idea to remove droppings from the cage at intervals and disinfect the cage with a disinfectant designed for small animal cages when cleaning the cage although it is important to keep stress to a minimum it may help to clean the cage of a hamster suffering from wet tail every or days any equipment occupied or used by a hamster that has died from wet tail should be disinfected thoroughly with a disinfectant designed for small animal cages and left to stand for a few weeks before being used by another hamster wet tail is a disease associated more commonly with the syrian hamster and is not associated with dwarf hamsters dwarf hamsters can suffer severe diarrhoea but it is not clear at present that they actually suffer from 'wet tail' susceptibility to wet tail is also thought to be genetically inherited and so it is best not to breed from any hamster that has suffered from wet tail during its life  Psoriasis Ulcerative colitis First aid Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Dysentery Cancer Fancy rat Guinea pig Clinical depression Gastroenteritis Acne Breastfeeding Anthrax Tuberculosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Animal testing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Asthma Dog Sickle-cell disease Chicken Cystic fibrosis Herpes simplex virus Shrimp farm Parkinson's disease Fecal incontinence Diabetes mellitus Pet skunk Prostate cancer Stroke Osteoarthritis Livestock Myxobolus cerebralis Rabies Rocky Mountain spotted fever Insulin Allergy Cirrhosis Equine conformation Cat Medicine Alcoholism Gonorrhoea Conjunctivitis Nutrition Radiation poisoning Homeopathy Paget's disease of bone Halitosis Sewage treatment Botulism Bipolar disorder Lyme disease Vitamin C Docking Hypoglycemia Hemorrhoid Cholera Multiple sclerosis Syphilis Migraine H5N1 Dairy Drowning Cephalic disorder Antibiotic Psychosis Group A streptococcal infection Ebola Clomipramine Helicobacter pylori Intravenous therapy Tooth enamel Gout Fibromyalgia Anorexia nervosa Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anal sex Clostridium difficile Childbirth House Mouse Traditional Chinese medicine Poliomyelitis

what are the pro's and con's of fleece bedding i'm adopting a guinea pig this weekend and i'm setting up a cage i was thinking about getting a fleece bedding since my friend who owns three of her own pigs suggested it she puts shredded paper on top of the fleece and throws it out and washes the fleece when she puts out her pig for floortime is this a good idea or should i try carefresh any suggestions i use fleece bedding in my c c cage and love it there is no odor either as long as you put something underneath the fleece to soak up the pee like old towels puppy pads newspaper or a combination works best that way the stuff underneath soaks up the moisture and your piggers stay dry then all you have to do is sweep up the poo's and any spilled hay use a dark colored cloth so the poo blends in better and wash it once or twice a week depending on how dirty it gets i find it is much cleaner and better looking and i know my piggies love it carefresh also is good for them but i find it makes the cage look too messy the cons of it are that if you dont get it held down right your piggers could end up burrowing down under it  Textile manufacturing Guinea pig Upholstery Tofu Bacon Menstrual cup Neighbours Vermicompost Ron and Fez Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling match types Dry cleaning Chinchilla Fancy rat Menstrual cycle Hamster Mattress Towel Psoriasis Toilet humour Salad Fingers Dean Koontz Sugarcane Drag racing Sanitary towel Jute The League of Gentlemen (comedy) EastEnders South Park Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Hemp Pig John Cage Holes (book) Days of our Lives Coconut crab Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sento Washing machine Charles Manson Pottery Knots Landing Eddie Guerrero Urticaria Shit Conker's Bad Fur Day Rice Collecting fossils Strap-on dildo Spanish prepositions Boxing Tattoo Tanning Hay Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Cantonese cuisine Iron Roswell UFO incident She Loves You Chris Jericho Scabies The Dalek Invasion of Earth Manicure Chili con carne Customs and etiquette of Japan Ed, Edd n Eddy Lisa the Vegetarian Comanche Lord of the Flies Tina Turner Dog Jennifer Lopez Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sewer Sinfest Jon Secada Fecal incontinence Peruvian cuisine Snowball (Animal Farm) Beachwear Vampire Cashmere wool Sub-Zero Champagne (beverage) Undergarment Miss Piggy The Critic Nintendogs Cleveland Browns About a Boy Laundry detergent Cannabis cultivation Weaving Richard Chase Toilet

please help im very scared my guinea pig my yr old girl guinea pig has sum sort of fly egg on her bak will she be ok wut will happen to her please help im super scared cuz i her ok so its not big so its not a tumor thats wut we think and i cant afford to take her to the vet and im wonderin if anyone knos wut will happen to her please to the vet technician this is sum pics of the bump thank u so much for your help http flickr com photos n http flickr com photos n in photostream http flickr com photos n in photostream sry theyre all crappy but it was hard to get a good shot well i hope that helps determine wut it is please miss linda m come bak and look at my pictures please im scared so my guess would be that it is some type of an absecess honestly if you don't have enough money for a vet than you shouldn't have it but that's not going to help the sitatuation right now if you guinea pig has acess to the out doors check to be sure that it isn't a tick they can be small like a pin point to the size of a quater if you have a hair clipper like what they use at the baber shop shave the hair around it so you can get a better look at it you a baby wipe or alcohol wipe and wipe it off and put neosporin or first aid cream on it if you have any it could also be ring worm that is inflammed if you could take a picture of it at all from a couple of different views and post them then i could help you much more good luck and i'll check back for pic's even if you can't post them on here if you can post them someplace else on the web i can look at them good luck okay so after seeing the pic's i can tell you that it is probably not an absess it looks to me like it is either a tick or a wart it is unlikely that it is a fly egg the fly's are usually present inside the wound with the eggs a wart can be a nusiance but is probably not going to kill her unless you start seeing more of them then it could be a disease the other posibably is that it is a tick but that would only be explainable if she goes out side or if it could have infested her bedding if it turns pale greenish in color almost like a catapillar then it is most likely a tick and will fall off on its own they can carry disease though so that's another reason to take her to the vet but if it is indeed a tick you can try pulling it off if it doesn't come off then leave it alone you don't want to pull off a wart however if it ever falls off then clean the area with rubbing alcohol aka isoproboyl alcohol best of luck if it appears to be getting bigger or other ones start to appear or it you see something coming out of the hole then take her to a vet around me chicago land area a vet visit costs about and you can tell them that you are on a tight budget and tell them how much you can afford and they can usually work within your limit also change her bedding and make sure that her cage is clean and that the bedding that you put into it isn't infested with anything good luck the other thing that i forgot to mention is that it could be a cyst i found a wesite that gives a pretty good explanation and i'll post it below these cysts are most common on the back and down towards the rump but they can occur elsewhere it is a good idea to have a good palpate all over the surface of the guinea pig regularly when the skin checks are being made see skin problems if you come across a soft pea sized lump which is not attached muscle or bone then it is almost certain to be a cyst cyst's are sometimes harmless but other times can cause problems so there is no way of knowing unless you talk to a vet i'll give you a couple of helpful links below  Guinea pig Tick Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Poker jargon Fancy rat Mattress Sin City Skin Shaggy dog story Pitaten Stomach cancer Professional wrestling throws Acne Violin The Inside Aerial (dance move) Social rule Humphrey Bogart EastEnders StarCraft: Uprising The Shining (film) Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet skunk Mario series enemies Sharon Tate Futurama (TV series - season 5) Urinary incontinence Jon Secada Heinkel He 100 Chicken Milton H.

is this normal my rabbit just sit in the back of his cage and will bite if anyone holds him but when i pet him he begs to be held he even follows me around the house i hope this helps people are often shocked the first time they see a rabbit display anger bunnies after all are supposed to be timid and sweet not outspoken and nasty and the sudden appearance of sharp teeth and raking claws can be disarming but whether your rabbit is nipping the hand that feeds him chasing you across the room or latching his teeth into your calf it's not unusual and it's not hopeless in fact working with an aggressive rabbit can be extremely rewarding many house rabbit society members have found that aggressive rabbits are often very intelligent animals who are just trying to express themselves once they're given some respect and some ground rules that expression can turn to boundless energy enthusiasm and affection  Domestic rabbit Cat Rabbit Ferret Dog Fancy rat Unreal Bugs Bunny European Rabbit Poker jargon Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hamster Guinea pig Dog training The Legend of Zelda series enemies Milton H.

experienced guinea pig owners please well i recently got my little pig a new cage the other one was too small for him now he seems really pissed off and depressed he had the other cage for almost years i try to take him out and he runs away from me i feel like he hates me now also he bit my friend and drew blood he doesn't ever ever bite how do i help him adapt to his new home i thought he would like how big it is also totally besides the subject but do they go through puberty so to speak i don't mean to offend anyone but all of a sudden he has these massive balls i feel bad for him it doesnt seem right for his balls to almost be dragging behind him is this normal i have heard that they will grow to the size of their surroudings is that what is happening to him guinea pigs do not grow to the size of their surroundings if so mine would be lbs if you've had the pig in the cage for almost two years then he is waaaay past puberty boars do have large testicles but if they seem abnormally large it could be that he has an infection or abcess there it could also be impaction i don't think the new cage is upsetting him a larger cage always produces a positve reaction the fact that he is suddenly running away from you seems depressed and is biting is more of a concern any drastic change in behavior may be an indication of pain or illness cavies are masters at hiding illness once you determine they are sick they are usually really far gone you have to educate yourself on the signs symptoms so you can catch illness early give your piggie the best chance of recovery this is part of being a responsible pet owner hold your pig under the stomach area and put the other hand under his bum the testicles should feel soft mushy if you feel a hard ball where the testicles are he is impacted it should be removed immediately by a qualified exotics vet if the testicles feel normal he may just have large testicles watch your pig for other signs of illness such as lethargy inadequate water or food intake or decreased pooping if you see any of these please get him to the vet straight away see this site for more information on impaction http www guinealynx info impaction html to find a qualified vet near you http www aracnet com cgi usr seagull vetfinder cgi best of luck  Guinea pig Prostate cancer Babe Ruth Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Traumatic brain injury Psychosis Vitamin C Chicken Equine conformation Stroke Stuttering Milton H.

cage ideas for two female rats i'm planning on getting a second rat fairly soon to accompany my first rat and once she's ready to be moved in with my first rat they'll need a larger cage does anyone have any good ideas what sort of cage should i get how far apart should the wires be and most importantly how large should the cage be links to specific cages would be nice but it isn't necessary thanks in advance i was hoping i wouldn't have to do this but it looks like it serious answers only please thanks don't worry about the introductions i asked about that earlier and got a nice thorough response so i know what i need to do well first of all make sure the space between the wires is less than inch if the new rat your getting is going to be very young i have a pretty big difference in between the wiring on my rat cage that when i first moved my rat in she escaped three times once she was away from her cage for days before we caught her anyway now she can't fit through so as long as the female isn't too small it should be alright she outgrew her escapades in about two weeks make sure to check http sfbay craigslist org just select the area you live and search for what you want rat cages and hopefully you'll find something and if you want there's always ebay although for me i used to have birds and we got our bird cage from a garage sale so it was very cheap when i got a rat i pretty much turned that cage into a rat cage here's a picture of my cage edit old link didn't work http i photobucket com albums x thelognar mycage jpg t kinda hard to see but basically we used a bird cage we got at a garage sale and i sawed two pieces of wood and then sandpapered them for each story on the side then used duct tape thick layers as the bridges or ramps and amazingly it works and my rat loves to run around and climb more than being with me and the duct tape bridges are still holding after a few weeks so if i were you i'd find a garage sale or look in the newspaper for someone selling rat bird cages and build in your own stuff also ferret cages work well though they are very expensive as rats and ferrets typically enjoy the same things in a cage lots of things to run around and play on and lots of room i also hung a pop tart box off the third level and put another little box up there for her to sit in and one on the bottom my rat seems to prefer to store her treats and poop in the hanging box and relax and spy in the one at the top i also heard that you should have two square feet per rat so i'd aim for a cage a little bigger than the one i have but by adding it multiple levels much easier with an electric tools btw they can have lots of room to run around in you could also add tunnels and soft hanging nests like they have in most ferret cages if you have the room d  Hamster Fancy rat Professional wrestling match types Domestic rabbit Trapping Dog agility Gramophone record Radio controlled airplane Blood on the Tracks John Cage Mattress Ferret Violin Guinea pig The Emancipation of Mimi Theory of conduct Floppy disk Textile manufacturing EastEnders Extreme Programming Redundant array of independent disks RuneScape quests Drill bit Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story Woodworking Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bong Japanese tea ceremony CPU design Star Trek Customizable Card Game Bon Jovi Have I Got News For You The Inside Ford Thunderbird Wood Solar cell XML Electrophysiology Pet Sounds Compact audio cassette Magic (illusion) Antenna (radio) The Star Wars Holiday Special RISC Embedded system Taikyoku shogi Bass guitar IBM PC compatible Mozilla Firefox Google Nashville Skyline Milton H.

can i introduce new female rats to the i already have well i actually don't already have mine i'll be getting them next week but i was wondering if in the future i could get some more and they could live together peacefully in the cage i think the cage i have could hold up to females comfortably it's a multi level ferret cage also does the size matter much they will all be fancy rats but my local petco sorts them according to size the that i am going to get are large i think but if i added some in that were small or medium would they be in danger from the larger ratties i have asked this question too but first petco has a bad rep for selling feeder rats as pets this is not ok feeder rats have not been properly handled and usually inter bred here are some things to watch for when getting your rats and some tips watch the rats for a while if they are in active dont get them if they look sick matted fur cloudy eyes red feet discharge of any kind dont get them ask to hold your new rats before you pay for them if they say no or make up some excuse its probably cuz the rats are not social when the pet sore person opens up the cage watch the rats reactions if they run away or try to bite they have not been socialized i would suggest looking at local shelters first before deciding to get rats from petco shelter rats are always properly handled now to get to your question sorry for the delay are you planning on getting females sounds like it when you said 'can fit females comfortably' females accept other females alot more than males to make the new rats feel welcome dont introduce one rat at a time if you want to get more get two or three more that are already familiar with eachother it is very dangerous to introduce your rats to any new rats without quarantining keeping in separate cages in separate rooms to make sure there will be no spread of diseases the new rats for at least two weeks before they go into the new cage try introducing them on neutral territory somewhere such as a bathroom so that you can keep an eye on them to make sure they get along have the two cages next to each other so the rats from each cage can see each other and smell each other every other day swap the rats new rats in the old rats cage and old rats in the new rats cage so they get used to each others smells this step is the most important one continue cleaning out cages once a week continue cage swaps for at least weeks and regular play times with all the rats out of the cages cage prep for new rats make sure there are enough sleeping spots this is one of the main causes of cage mates getting into fights so make sure there are lots of hammocks houses pvc pipes etc and always make sure you have full food and water another main cause of cagemates fights edit from above but really you shouldnt have more than maybe rats in the same cage anyways correction you can have as many rats as you want in one cage as long as there is cubic feet per rat if space is used wisely have fun with your new rat clan d  Hamster Fancy rat Ferret Guinea pig Domestic rabbit House Mouse Pet skunk Cat Trapping RuneScape quests Chinchilla Canary Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Sin City Kakapo Brown Rat Quarantine Equine conformation Rat Fish farming Pet store Rat Park Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Champagne (beverage) Mattress The Shining (film) John Cage Spider Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Kashrut Dog Seabird Mixed martial arts Kitchen Friends Panama Canal PETCO Park Livestock Bong Sea-Monkey Garfield Skinny Puppy Kangaroo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dairy Sleep Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.

is a rat safe to play with a syrian hamster i've just bought a male rat but i've owned a syrian hamster for nearly a year i know syrians are very territorial and will kill any other hamsters that are in their space but what about the cross rodent relationship is it safe to let them both out at the same time to exercise i usually let them out for a run on my bed one at a time but i don't know if they would try and attack each other if i let them both out at the same time can you offer any advice thank you i actually got the rat with another male who was in the cage but they ended up repeatedly fighting during the night so i had to seperate them if your male rat has already been involved in fights then i strongly recommend against excercising them together they could seriously injure each other enjoy the alone time they get to have each with you its certainly nicer for the rat that way  Hamster Fancy rat Yom Kippur War Guinea pig The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Animal testing Rodent Golden Hamster Cat Muroidea Chinchilla Cricetidae The Secret of NIMH Mouse-like hamster Golan Heights The Tribe Six-Day War Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty 1982 Lebanon War Pet Lebanese Civil War New World rats and mice Kakapo Hezbollah Sid Vicious Mesothelioma My Parents are Aliens InuYasha (character) Bob and George Ferret Lebanon House Mouse Kevin and Kell Iraqi insurgency Israeli Air Force Laotian Rock Rat Breath of Fire III RuneScape quests Sin City Geography of China Arab-Israeli conflict Irish Guards State terrorism Eumuroida Aspartame Atrazine Murinae Rat (zodiac) Weight training Gambian pouch rat Plame affair Lady and the Tramp Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Young Ones (TV series) Parliament of Canada Blood (computer game) Sleep Rat Monogamy Flea 2003 Invasion of Iraq Osama bin Laden Lebanese Forces Athrun Zala Canary Rat poison STS-58 Kenneth Bigley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Twelve Monkeys Snake Politics of Canada Ariel Sharon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling slang Vermin Pet skunk Cedar Revolution Professional wrestling match types Gerbil About a Boy Jamar Shipman Fawlty Towers Nocturnal animal Life extension Minor Discworld characters The Sopranos USS Forrestal (CVA-59) Pesticide Wal-Mart Phoebe Buffay's songs Roman Catholic Church Theory of conduct First aid Long-term potentiation Hamato Yoshi Stock History of Lebanon

can guinea pigs have milkbones because i read that somewhere no i read that too a long time ago but it is wrong dog treats always have some kind of meat products in them and a lot of sugar and fat guinea pigs should never have meat or dairy products addition the answers below mine are greatly mistaken calcium is not something that you want supplement they will get enough calcium in their dailt diet more calcium can cause an excess to build up which lead to stones which require surgery to remove all that a pig needs to wear down his teeth are hay and pellets also remember that your pig needs a cup of veggies a day  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Dairy Veganism Milk Iron Tooth Hamster Insulin Calcium Tofu Atkins Nutritional Approach Kidney stone Livestock Chicken Osteoporosis Colorectal cancer Protein Ferret Pig Carbon dioxide Vitamin D Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cheese Sugar Cancer Nutrition Food guide pyramid Taboo food and drink Unclean animals Kosher foods In-N-Out Burger Soybean Factory farming Atherosclerosis Coca-Cola Cuisine of Africa Food preservation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Breastfeeding Little Britain Obesity Ham Tooth enamel Kashrut Acromegaly Soul food Prostate cancer Cat Pork Soap Whaling Bacon Dog food Stone Age Domestication Soy milk Animal rights Chocolate Rice Inca Empire Water purification Low-carbohydrate diet Kangaroo Thyroid Soy protein Crohn's disease Trans fat Vegetarian cuisine Growth hormone treatment Cajun cuisine Coronary heart disease Dog Dairy product Stomach cancer Sugar beet Aztec Edible salt Steel Gout Paget's disease of bone Fecal incontinence Folic acid Organic food Malignant hyperthermia Pasteurization Phosphoric acid Fancy rat Prolactinoma Dietary fiber Agriculture Vegetarian nutrition Ramen Environmental vegetarianism Gastroesophageal reflux disease Economy of Papua New Guinea

guinea pig advice do any guinea pig owners have any personal experiences or advice that guinea pig websites may not be telling me thanks it depends what sites you have been using sites like guineapigcages com guinealynx com and cavyspirit com to name a few all have excellent information in some independent sites that i have seen they state that guinea pigs can be housed in pet store cages which they can't that exercise balls and wheels can be used which they can't and that males can not be housed together which they can there is alot of false information out there but if you stick to the big popular sites like the ones listed above and a few others like aracnet diddly di etc you should be ok guinea pigs are diurnal they do squeak alot but this is there way of communicating addition here i was talking about false information take the post above me for example a carrots do not actually have very much vitamin c at all vegetables like red peppers capsicum parsley spinach kale and broccoli have alot more vitamin c b guinea pigs do not get colds so how you as a person can have a cold and then pass it on to a guinea pig i do not know c do not use ivermectin unless the guinea pig actually has a parasite mites etc overdoses of ivermectin can kill addition jeez talk about bad information if you are having to clean out the cage every day then you must be using newspaper switch to aspen aspen has no aromatic oils is safe and comfy plus it soaks up the urine effectively i would recommend putting newspaper underneath a thick layer of aspen as it makes cleaning easier fleece is also becoming increasingly popular fleece wicks the urine to the bottom of the cage which is way you need either towels matress pads or puppy pads underneath the fleece to soak up the urine guinea pigs are diurnal although they are most active at dusk evening  Hamster Domestic rabbit Vitamin C Thermoregulation Textile manufacturing Chicken Mattress Diseases of the honeybee Chinchilla Dog Sento Cuisine of Denmark Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Garfield Food preservation German cuisine Nutrition Scabies Chile pepper Rice Rabies Jewish cuisine Tofu Peruvian cuisine Antioxidant Ramen Cuisine of Africa Animal Farm Three Little Pigs Chili con carne Hyperthermia Island Fox Tocopherol Skinny Puppy Urine Prostate cancer Vitamin D Cat Toilet Korean cuisine Folic acid Spinach Fecal incontinence Mouse (computing) Housebreaking Retinol Coprophagia Collard greens Malaria Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Sanitary towel Dietary fiber Niacin RuneScape quests Broomball Strap-on dildo Psychedelic music Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Psoriasis Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Canary Yarrow Food Potato Barbecue Water Diaper Pet Coconut crab Dairy Professional wrestling match types Roman eating and drinking Drug test Common cold Japanese cuisine Insulin Kale Asthma Pesticide Menstrual cycle Vegeta Taboo food and drink Agriculture in Hong Kong Parsley Magic (illusion) Heartworm Governor-General of Australia House Mouse Russian cuisine Soul food Ed, Edd n Eddy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Brewery Degu Animal Liberation Front Beltway sniper attacks

hamsters when a female hamster gets pregent do they have a healthy birth like will she live and will she still live long after the birth and how long do u have to keep the babies before selling them tell me everything you know about it thxx nicegirl i have already seen that movie so it won't scare me and why would you send me that anyways to help me with hamsters breeding hamsters you generally would breed hamsters according to their specific breed ie breeding only syrian hamsters or breeding only chinese hamsters it is not advisable to breed hamsters of different breed types if you've got a friend who has a hamster of the same breed of the opposite sex you can arrange with him her to breed your hamsters and then share the load of having to find homes for the young this is the case for breeding syrian hamsters as they are more often than not kept in isolation dwarf hamsters are different in that they are sociable and can live in social groups so long as they are introduced to each other after weaning and they 'grow up' together if you have a cage of dwarf hamsters who are not of the same sex they will start to breed when they are ready and they generally will pretty much 'self regulate' their breeding pattern and frequency and you just have to 'watch' it unfold what's the best age to start breeding hamsters generally for female hamsters the ideal age to start breeding is at months any younger and you would risk her having a poor litter she has still to grow herself and also increase the likelihood of cannibalism leave it any longer than months and you run the risk of birth complications for male hamsters they are sexually active from as young as weeks of age but it's probably best to leave them alone till they're about months old before contemplating breeding from them dwarf hamsters kept together will start breeding at months of age how often can i breed my female hamster whilst you can just keep her breeding litter after litter this will greatly shorten her lifespan it's best to wait about months before you breed her again this will give her body time to 'recuperate' and put her in a better condition come mating time if you stick to this regime it will mean that you will probably get litters out of any one breeding female hamster as they often become sterile when they turn months old sometimes you can get a third litter from a female but this is the exception rather than the rule strangely enough this is the self same pattern that dwarf hamsters will adhere to even though they have 'free rein' as to how often they mate and produce offspring litters per breeding female is the norm for dwarf hamsters kept as mating pairs breeding syrian hamsters because syrian hamsters are kept in isolation you usually have to play 'match maker' when it comes to breeding frivolities female hamsters come into 'season' once every days they ovulate during that time and it's only when they are in season that they are 'receptive' to the advances of the male hamster any other times fighting would inevitably occur how do i know when my female hamster is ready to breed or is in season given that they will go into season once every days if you get it wrong the first time there's always the next time generally the female hamster will emit a musky odor just before she comes into season and inevitably it's always around evening time that the 'oestrus period' time when she's fertile and accepting of the male starts and it lasts for anywhere between and hours it is during this 'window of opportunity' that she will be receptive to the male so breeding them has to take place then after the female hamsters finish their season there is a thick white mucous discharge that is excreted from their vagina less experienced hamster breeders will then take that as a starting point count another days after that and then try for a breeding encounter anticipating the next oestrous cycle days later if the weather is cool winter most hamsters will not breed the other tell tale sign that she is in season is that when you stroke her back towards her tail she will freeze on the spot flatten out and lift her tail the hamster breeding protocol okay you've established that the female hamster is ready for breeding what now you have choices you can put her in the male's cage or take them both out and put them in a separate breeding box neutral territory wear protective gloves have an object ready to separate them if any fighting ensues they often aren't very selective about who they nip and will nip you in your efforts to separate them if they choose not to breed if you've picked the right time the female will 'freeze' with her tail in the air and allow the male hamster to mate with her a few times keep them together for anywhere between minutes to an hour when they start to lose interest in the mating ritual then it's time to separate them virgin males can be a bit confused initially and may turn the female hamster off by mounting her from all directions but they will soon learn 'on the job' breeding is generally more successful when both male and female hamsters have had previous mating encounters how can i tell if the mating has been successful that the female hamster is pregnant if the female doesn't come into season again days later she's regarded as being pregnant she will start to become decidedly pregnant her abdomen will swell no she's not getting fat and her nipples will start to become more pronounced gestation lasts days for syrian hamsters days for the russian hamsters days for chinese hamsters and for roborovski hamsters the average litter for syrians is about but can be as great as which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in the uterus campbell's dwarf hamsters tend to have in a litter but can have up to winter white russian dwarf hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters as do chinese and roborovski hamsters hamsters are born hairless and blind in a nest which the mother will have prepared in advance after week they begin to explore outside the nest they are completely weaned after weeks or for roborovski hamsters most breeders will sell the hamsters to shops when the hamsters are anywhere as of about months old what do i do after the mating you return both hamsters to their respective cages female hamsters will need extra food during the pregnancy high protein foods like tofu boiled egg wheat germ to aid in birthing can be added to the diet she can still be handled but it's best to leave her alone when it's closer to the expected birth date clean out her cage at day and take out the exercise wheel provide her with extra nesting material eg shredded paper then put her cage in a warm quiet spot with as little disturbance as possible and wait ooo the babies are here what now let her nurse the babies till they are about weeks old do not disturb the nest during this time as she may decide to turn on them and eat them the cage will smell during this time that's unavoidable any attempts to change the bedding material would increase the likelihood of cannibalism so it's best to just leave it for the moment and put up with the smell sometimes despite all this the female hamster will still cannibalize her young this is common in female hamsters bred under months and in older females who will cull some babies to reduce the numbers in the litter continue with the high protein foods other ideas are bread soaked in milk during this time at about weeks of age the hamsters are ready to be sexed and weaned they are no longer reliant on their mum for nourishment you can keep them in different boxes cages all the male babies in cage and the females in another they can be kept in these groups for a further weeks in the meantime you can find new homes for them and they can go to their new owners at weeks of age it is part of nature that female hamsters may eat their young if this happens to you here are some factors that may or may not have caused it she was stressed out by loud noises or the father the babies were touched by a human and therefore had another scent on them the babies were deformed or had genetic disorders the mother was a first time inexperienced mother mothers may eat the babies for any of these reasons i have found that the second birth is usually much larger and has a much better survival rate because the mother knew what was going on and what to do the first litter was sort of a surprise to her and she had to learn the ropes sometimes the mother never has any trouble with the first litter again it just depends on the hamster if your mother eats her first litter give her plenty of recovery time and try again unless she has problems with her health i can guarantee more of the babies will live the second time around it often takes a little time to get the ball rolling but once it is done you will have plenty of little pups good luck sabby  Brewery Tarantula Cephalic disorder Human

favorite rodent and why just wondering by the way everyone i have two favorites guinea pigs and rats i love them both to pieces rats why because they remind me a little of dogs and a little of cats they'll lick you and let you scratch their ears like a dog and will 'purr' and groom themselves like a cat a bit like a bird too i guess 'cause they'll perch on your shoulder and sit there for a while they're also more intelligent than any other rodent and extremely playful and fun to watch they never bite too unless you get a rat that wasn't hand raised a note to people bunnies aren't rodents they're lagomorphs their teeth grow constantly like rodents and they used to be considered rodents but they're different enough to have their own classification along with pikas  Hamster Lagomorpha Mammal Rabbit Fancy rat Kim Possible Pig Meat Domestic rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dog Mickey Mouse Taboo food and drink The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Ferret Flea Invader Zim Pet Fauna of Australia Felis sapiens Chinchilla Bird European Rabbit Kevin and Kell Tooth enamel Garfield Sinfest Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Rat Pet skunk Gray Wolf Mammal classification Shaggy dog story Onomatopoeia Arthur (TV series) Tooth Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Kakapo Bat Kangaroo Creatures in Bionicle Humphrey Bogart Murinae Vomiting Chicken Minor Discworld characters Ren and Stimpy Chinese astrology New World rats and mice Island restoration Blesmol Snake Theory of conduct Rocko's Modern Life Dean Koontz Harry Nilsson Vole Taikyoku shogi Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass Treecat Domestication Porcupine Tiny Toon Adventures Leopard Academy Award for Animated Short Film Porky Pig Care Bears Chuck Jones Eric Cartman Wood carving Looney Tunes: Back In Action Rat (zodiac) Dog training German Shepherd Dog Squirrel Oceania ecozone Samurai Pizza Cats Hunting Pliocene Feral cat Woodworking "Weird Al" Yankovic Oddworld Exotic pet Cajun cuisine Brown Rat The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Pikachu Egyptian Ratscrew Feral Colugo Narnia Late Night with Conan O'Brien Red Fox Aspartame Gaia Online

what is the proper name of a black eyed white syrian hamster also what characteristics do they have in terms of personality all help appreciated you only have to answer on of the questions but whoever answers both first gets my vote for 'best answer' alright i looked it up and it seems that the correct name for that colour is simply black eyed white there's also black eyed ivory but their fur is slightly different differently coloured hamsters don't have much difference in personality it's more about their actual breed syrian hamsters are the standard for pets but aren't as social as dwarf hamsters for example but dwarfs can be quite feisty too  Hamster Golden Hamster Color Meriones unguiculatus Cheetah Shetland Sheepdog White (people) The Young Ones (TV series) Species Dog Mouse-like hamster Horse Pleiades (star cluster) Animal communication Black (people) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Asperger syndrome Border Collie Havanese Theory of conduct Social rule Monster Rancher monsters Floppy disk Monty Python and the Holy Grail Domestic rabbit African American Labrador Retriever Philosophy of language Joke Iris (anatomy) Vehicle registration plate English plural GED Kender Eyepiece Function (mathematics) Hamtaro African American Vernacular English Crossword Human German Shepherd Dog Griffon Bruxellois Pet skunk Lionhead Studios Dangermouse A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poodle Tincture (heraldry) Siberian Husky Eye contact Computer role-playing game Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs Lie Plame affair Parallax Fault (dog) Jennifer Lopez The Hobbit Chess variant Password Chess opening Races of Final Fantasy Makoto Kino Objectivist philosophy Arabic alphabet Shaggy dog story Turkish Van Jack Russell Terrier Elderberry Friedrich Schleiermacher NTSC Coloured The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Tortoiseshell cat Human sexual behavior The nature of God in Western theology Pet store Flag of Denmark Gray Wolf Standardized testing Equal Protection Clause Fawlty Towers Indian English Black panther Pekingese Pigment Atheism Hair color Alan Keyes Philosophical Investigations Father Ted Game show Red Dwarf Bart Gets an Elephant Color temperature American Cocker Spaniel Hiberno-English Richard Allen (reverend) Felis sapiens

how can i get my rat more handle able they are pretty young right now but when ever i try to pick them up they always squirm out of my hand even before i can get them out of the cage what do i do try just placing your hand in their cage and letting them sniff you and get used to your smell also if the cage top is able to come off take it off and scoop up the rats with two hands it's easier then let them run around on a sofa bed etc and sit near them with a blanket thrown over you and the rats if you wish they tend to like dark places gradually they'll start to like you try giving them treats like cheerios too so they associate you with yummy food animal girl you clearly aren't an animal girl if you're so prejudiced against rats  Hamster Fancy rat Guinea pig Sin City Rat Domestic rabbit Aerial (dance move) Dog training Cat Japanese tea ceremony Theory of conduct Trapping Ferret Professional wrestling throws Cheerios Upholstery The Visitation Joke RuneScape quests Anime Rat Park Fear Factor Salad Fingers Gambian pouch rat Professional wrestling match types Comanche Milton H.

best method for exterminating mice rats poison mouse rat trap or trap them alive and drown them poison is extremely dangerous because it is a non specific killer if the poison is found by a pet or a child they could likely die further if the mouse consumes the poison and it's then consumed by another animal like a pet cat or a fox or hawk the animal will also likely die i have found that good old mouse traps work really well and they have new ones designed so you can remove the dead mouse and reset it all without touching the mouse the key to catching rodents is putting the trap in a good location rodents like to be within a few inches of the wall so look for locations that follow a wall to place the trap also live traps are handy and i've had good luck catching rodents with them as well keep in mind that natural predators like snakes and raptors can be helpful in controlling rodent numbers along with a good mouser cat i've found a combination of live traps and a cat worked the best for me you may have to try several options to find what works best in your area one additional note if you decide to opt for poison as we did in our attic where the poison could not be carried out you would do best to advise your nearest neighbors that you're using poison so that they can take steps to ensure that no children or pets are affected  Hamster Fancy rat Cat Rat The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Ferret Mouse Fox hunting Island restoration Mouse (computing) Dai dai shogi Brown Rat Pet Tai shogi Snake Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hunting Trapping House Mouse Tom and Jerry (MGM) Rodent Capital punishment Gray Wolf Laotian Rock Rat Rabies Gypsy moth Bat Fugu Vole Aladdin (1992 film) Dog Drowning Rat poison Cube (film) Creatures in Bionicle Kim Possible Minnie Mouse Fauna of Australia The Dalek Invasion of Earth Taikyoku shogi Parkinson's disease Pesticide Shaggy dog story Porcupine Diablo II Aspartame Animal testing The Deadly Assassin Tooth enamel Naruto jutsu Mousetrap Europe Pet skunk Tag Feral Spidey Super Stories First aid Bubonic plague Skunk Hedgehog Tlingit Kenny McCormick Sewage treatment Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Patent Beaver Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rebreather Minor Discworld characters Organic farming Toilet-related injury Shen Gong Wu Microchip implant (animal) Kangaroo Gal__pagos Islands Chicken Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Chinchilla Kain (Legacy of Kain) IMac Blood (computer game) Island Fox The Suffering (game) Tasmanian Devil Digimon Team Rocket Ninja Scroll Pikmin Password Black Death Death (personification) Windows 2000 The Subtle Knife The Tribe Falconry

rats can gnaw their top teeth but can they gnaw their bottom reason is this i try and try to check my rats teeth but you know how hard it is to keep hold onto a protesting squiggle so i'm wondering i can see the top teeth are fine i have a chew toy in there for them but how can i know the bottom teeth aren't too long is there anything that can be done about it if they are what should i do my rats are clean and domesticated people need to show more respect i adress this question to fellow rat lovers or vets who know the ins and outs of rat health care rats are a part of our ecosystem if you can't love them respect their existence and please refrain from being rude to those of us who do rats top and bottom teeth slide naturally over each other as they eat gnaw this process naturally keeps their teeth i trim the only problems occur when malaclusion occurs and then either top or bottom can over grow the first sign of obvious malaclusion would be drooling and off the food malaclusion is a vet only job as the teeth need to be burred never nipped off as splitting will occur on a reguilar basis if your rats are eating well and maintaining gaining weight then i would imagine there is absolutely nothing to worry about instead of wooden chew toys try them with baked beef bones often available in butchers for dogs or cooked thigh wing of chicken with the meat still on chop bones with meat scraps attached large dog biscuits its the sign of a good owner that your worried though just a note rats teeth move slightly apart and within their jaws naturally so if you notice a slight wobble dont panic  Hamster Tooth Domestic rabbit Equine conformation Dog Cat Taboo food and drink Guinea pig Tooth enamel Trapping Barbecue Hamburger Gray Wolf Pet skunk Garfield Kosher foods Livestock Ferret Olduwan Domesticated turkey Veganism Sugar substitute Cannibalism Raw food diet Snake Japanese cuisine Happy Tree Friends Hot dog Vegetarianism Woodworking Tyrannosaurus rex Dental caries Foodborne illness Strap-on dildo Chocolate Jewish cuisine Comanche Meat Tofu Rodent Cuisine of Denmark Homer Simpson Sin City Kangaroo Escherichia coli O157:H7 Blood (computer game) Chili con carne French cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Maxilla Domestication Hun-Apu Japanese tea ceremony Tetrapod Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Soul food Dentures Chinese astrology Menstrual cup Unclean animals 613 mitzvot Dog training Cocaine Carnivore Philosophical skepticism Tasmanian Devil Aztec Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an German Shepherd Dog Fried chicken Vitamin C Sperm Whale Havanese McDonald's Mandible Kodocha Anorexia nervosa Korean cuisine Fugu Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Professional wrestling throws Insulin Aspartame French fries Tobacco Cuisine of Africa Oral sex Poker jargon Physical attractiveness Plastic Evidence of evolution

both of my dwarf hamsters itch all the time and chew on the cage bars do they have mites they are in different cages because one is taking care of four day old babies do all hamsters itch like this not to worry its pretty normal they like to brush on things to leave their smell just like cats not to worry as for the biting i would not suggest a aquarium cage as it does not give enough ventilation for the hamsters but i would suggest you have a cage that has bars but in order for it to stop biting introduce a chew toy for it to chew on so it will now chew on the bars also hamsters also chew on the bars to let you know it is hungry and it is time for you to feed them not to worry hamsters do not overeat so it is okay to give a little extra good luck sabby  Fancy rat Domestic rabbit AFI 100 Years series Ferret Care Bears Social rule John Cage Animal testing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Canary RuneScape quests Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Marilyn Monroe 2000 Australian Grand Prix Guinea pig Pet The Star Wars Holiday Special Chicken Mange Galaxy Angel Tobacco smoking Diseases of the honeybee The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dog training Halitosis Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Kodocha Breastfeeding Kim Possible Pok__mon Live!

are their any experts on russian dwarf hamsters and their babies i got to russian dwarf hamsters three days ago and one had babies days ago how can i tell if she is taking good care of them any good websites hi i would suggest you to remove the male hamster if you find him disturbing the babies dont worry about the babies just give them privacy cover the cage with a cloth for xtra privacy give her plenty of water and food and do not touch the babies til they about weeks the reason why mothers eat their babies is that they feelthat the babies will not live long so instead of prolonging their suffering they eat them and why i suggest not to touch the babies is that the mother can pick up new smells and may think the baby will not be healthy try not to change the hamster's bedding only till the babies are older good luck sabby  Golden Hamster Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Elephant Surveillance Jon Secada Guinea pig Comanche American Black Bear Melanie Wilkes Childbirth Domestic rabbit Social rule Internet phenomenon Insulin Pet skunk Kurt Cobain Hygiene Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Roy Meadow The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Urinary incontinence Rammstein Egg (food) Giant Panda The Family from One End Street Androgen insensitivity syndrome RuneScape quests Stomach cancer Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Customs and etiquette of Japan Abortion in the United States Hyperthermia Joke Platypus Hypoglycemia Characters in the Smurfs Common cold Animal testing RuneScape Mini-Games The Hobbit Shark Mattress Escherichia coli O157:H7 Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Kakapo Le Malade imaginaire Menstrual cycle Breech birth AFI 100 Years series Jam (TV series) Cytomegalovirus Fecal incontinence Sin City Nile crocodile Dieting Health insurance Fancy rat Dog Discworld gods Tofu Dead Like Me Pig (zodiac) Fasting The Wack Pack Father's Day (Doctor Who) Domestic goat The Ashlee Simpson Show Sauna Tooth Khatushyamji Hemp Felis sapiens Garter snake Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Diarrhea Saint Nicholas Snowball Earth Migraine The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Caesarean section Apple Vegetarianism Situation comedy Macbeth Crohn's disease Mary Jane Kelly Great White Shark Sudden infant death syndrome Mario Two Treatises of Government Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Satanic ritual abuse

hamster cage paint so i got this amazing cage the bars are colorful and my hamster loves to chew on the cage no matter how many toys she gets so now the paint is comin off is there any kind of paint that will be safe my little scumm ball most cages use a non toxic water based enamel paint the reason being all caged animals will chew on the bars i highly recommend chrome cages they cost a tad more but hold up a lot better especially with the critters that love to chew a lot another thing that can be done to help keep a painted cage looking better is places a inch high skirt on the inside of the cage made of plexiglas they will still chew on it but it does keep them away from the bars just so you know it won't hurt them  Hamster Animal testing Professional wrestling match types Plastic Tooth enamel Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Paint Chewing gum Chinchilla John Cage Ferret Chromium Trapping Tooth Magic (illusion) Lionel Corporation Monkey Island Steel Cage Match M16 (rifle) RuneScape quests Bulk vending The Apprentice 2 Billiards Trail blazing Salad Fingers Garfield The Fairly OddParents Leather Paintball Mealy Parrot Rebreather Bicycle frame In Your House RuneScape locations Blood on the Tracks Menstrual cup Scale model Mojave people Dodge Charger Babe Ruth Textile manufacturing Fugu Care Bears Factory farming Slot machine RuneScape economy Smoking ban Fish farming Maximum Exposure Unclean animals Dog training Dental caries Bullet Theory of conduct Monster Rancher monsters Kosher foods Rich Mullins Pet skunk Kirby Lead paint Compact audio cassette Sake USS Chew (DD-106) The Cage The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Lacquer Pinky and the Brain The Apprentice 3 Dog agility Vitreous enamel Jon Secada Anchor Canary Bondage (BDSM) Dodge Neon Color Polymethyl methacrylate Strap-on dildo Dental fillings Titanium Traditional animation United States Postal Service Buick Skylark Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Heraldry Fur farming Tetrapod Ammonia Thermal power station Illegal drug trade Fire extinguisher Chastity belt Transformer Fluoride Codename: Kids Next Door Tag Art of Ancient Egypt

i need tips for getting a rat i want to get a rat but all i've had my whole life is a dog a cat and two birds i've never dealed with rodents so any tips for beginers first of all i rats and you need to get at least two they are extremely social and its cruel to keep them alone where to get you new rats humane society take very good care of the animals disease free have been properly handled breeder knows what they are talking about takes care of rats for a living check to make sure the rats living conditions are good although most breeders are in it for the love of rats some are just in it for the money and will keep them in horrible conditions will more than likely know who the parents and grandparents are pet store i would highly recommend petsmart over petco last resort petco and many others dont separate males and females you might come home with a pregnant female petsmart only carries females so no risk of pregnancy mose pet stores sell rats as feeder rats dont get them from here even if you think you are 'saving them' i know you would mean good but they dont have proper socialization and are more than likely interbred watch to make sure they are active and healthy ask to hold them before paying for them when the pet store person opens the cage watch to make sure the rats dont run away or try to bite signs of feeder rats your rats cage rats need larger cages then hamsters square feet per rat need multilevel hammocks and levels are highly reccomended tons of toys wiffle balls pet store toys etc and chew toys dont use cedar bedding use pine shavings as a primary bedding then a thin layer of carefresh they will use that as nesting supplies little houses rats loooove tons of little houses and different sleeping areas cleaned out glass jars pvc pipes 'igloos' from petstores wooden shoeboxes anything big water bottle otherwise be prepared to refill it a lot dont put a wheel in there usually rats wont use it but if they do it can cause serious back problems make sure there isnt a wire bottom its horrible for their little feet always have a full food dish clean it once a week dump out bedding scrub with water let dry and add new bedding play time love time out of cage give them slightly cracked open hard boiled egg they will go nuts rat pinata layer paper towels put treats in the middle and bunch up into a ball and tie it so its hanging from the top of their cage digging box fill with store bought dirt and sprinkle bird food all over it then add another layer of dirt water and let it grow wait till all the seeds sprout and let the rats in it they looove digging around and eating the sprouts randomness box a box full of anything and everything safe for rats recycled paper toilet paper rolls scrunched tissues pencils wash rags anything and hide some treats through out the box rats need time out of the cage for at lease hours a day the more the better handle them every day they will sit on your shoulder and go everywhere around the house with you snacks food get your rats food from a pet store and make sure it says mice and rat food dont get hamster food you can mix in rice chrispies or cheerios save money on expensive stuff both those cereals are good for them no sugary foods chocolate and suff anything thats good for you is a good treat for the rats some rat owners say that rats should have table spoon of fresh fruits a day dont over do it on the nuts to much protein for them no salted sun flower seeds get treats from the pet store my favorites are 'yogies' and 'pretzel sicks' bath time its not nessisary to give your pet rats baths however some rats like baths fill a plastic tub your bath tub with inch of water luke warm put some tupperware in there for rats that dont want to sit in the water put some frozen veggies in there for them to much on no need for soap males vs females males are very lazy tend to smell more dont like to explore as much love to sit and watch tv with you some people claim them to be much more sweet then girls have extremely large 'male parts' get oily backs females love to explore need to know whats going on hate being in the cage love to learn tricks dont smell as much love love love humane interaction very energetic do not do introduce your rats with your hamster or any other small animal let them run free in your house unless they know their name mine do give them chocolate give them a bath when the water is higher than inch put soap in the bath put perfume lotion on them let them need electrical chords or outlets play with them if your hands smell like cat or dog or food stick your fingers through the bars of the cage feed them through the bars of the cage poke them with things dont get them rolly balls cause serious back injury do snuggle with them give the kisses pet them let the out as much as possible teach them a few tricks let them sit on your shoulder while you lounge around the house love them this is probably the longest answer i have ever given lol good luck with your new ratties love them much and have fun  Tooth Tofu Chicken Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Menstrual cup RuneScape quests Bread Water Canary Urinary

allergic reaction about month ago i used dog and cat shampoo on my guinea pig my friend has guinea pigs and she used before so i thought it was alright after putting shampoo on my guinea pig he started wheezing and sneezing until i rinsed the shampoo off and dried him did he have an allergic reaction he's fine now but i'm just wondering and even though he's seems healthy and happy is there still something wrong with him he eats and drinks normally someone please answer if your guinea pig had an allergic reaction to that shampoo he would most likely be dead as their immune systems are not that strong the best explanation i can think of for this is the fact that he got wet which resulted in a body temperature drop causing him to sneeze and wheeze which is what anyone does as a natural reaction to keep the body warm the same as shivering and getting goosebumps once you got him dry and he got warmed up again the problem resolved itself hope this helps  Hay fever Allergy Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Guinea pig Asthma Domestic rabbit Shampoo Common cold Pig Dandruff Insulin Taboo food and drink Eczema Fancy rat Sauna Cat Hamster Sento Vitamin C Breastfeeding Thermoregulation Dog Shaggy dog story El Ni__o Urticaria Old wives' tale Weather lore Influenza Chocolate First aid Happy Tree Friends Climate of the United Kingdom Dry cleaning Tattoo Carbon dioxide Water (molecule) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Russian joke Antihistamine Multiple chemical sensitivity Nasal congestion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Flood geology Chimera (genetics) Rocko's Modern Life Chinchilla Characters of Naruto 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Blood transfusion Coprophagia Aspergillosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sea level rise Water Global warming Climate change Tooth enamel Pliocene Autoimmune diseases Sneeze Futurama (TV series - season 5) Oceania ecozone Nuclear weapon design Lisa the Vegetarian Lycanthropy Stuttering Quang Ninh Province Shark Weather front Hypothermia Drowning Dairy Dean Koontz Richard Lindzen Iron Raw food diet Theory of conduct Negima Nine Inch Nails Myxobolus cerebralis Ecology Toilet humour The Ashlee Simpson Show Multiple sclerosis Conjunctivitis AFI 100 Years series Warm-blooded Basic English Toxic mold Rodney McKay Dead Like Me Guns, Germs, and Steel Diabetes mellitus Ceramics Food Coeliac disease

can i freeze baytril for my rat so that i can reuse it when his myco flares up again i find myself returning to the vet's every month or so to get more baytril for my rat who has myco flareups now i was given a lot of zithromax and told i could freeze it to use later can i do the same with baytril the next time i get some seems like this is going to be a lifelong thing with splinter he always did have the weakest immune system of the brothers help appreciated wait wait wait are you sure spazrats i value your info highly but my instructions are to refrigerate currently i should add both the baytril and zithromax are in liquid solutions flavored and both are to be kept refrigerated per my vet's orders no do not freeze baytril do not put it in the fridge it will crystallize rendering it useless for future use just keep it on the shelf in a cool dark place and use before the expiry date i buy my baytril from global pigeon huge bottle lasts forever anyone who keeps rats as pets should be aware of the illnesses that rats get and the drugs that are safe for them http ratguide com edit ok change of instructions your vet has given you a solution a mix of baytril and a flavoring agent banana is a ratty fav to make it pallitable unfortuneately solutions do not last very long your vet probably expects you to continue the doses until it is all gone you can put it in the fridge not the freezer and this is what will prevent the flavoring agent from going rancid but by rights the vet should have put an expiry date on it since i have a zillion rats and myco is common i want a baytril that i can have on hand and use when i need it that's where straight baytril injectable given orally comes in and i mix it myself with strawberry syrup e mail me at spazrats yahoo ca for more info on this type of baytril and how to use it it can save you a lot of money in the long run if you decide that you will continue to have rats as pets for a long time to come spazrats my life has gone to the rats  Refrigerator Fancy rat Food preservation Ice cream Domain Name System Brewery Rum Bone marrow transplant Tofu Refrigerator car Blood (computer game) Guinea pig Bread Alcoholic beverage Option Milkshake Methamphetamine Fanta Cannabis (drug) Sin City Gatorade Hydrogen peroxide Condom Life extension Organic food Tooth enamel Sugar beet Carbon dioxide Mycosis Nitroglycerin Tag Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Animal testing Anthrax Sucralose Vinegar Capitalism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban RuneScape quests Ammonia Asthma Soft drink Paracetamol Sonic the Hedgehog Chocolate Confidence trick Shelf life Beer Cajun cuisine Water Rabies Medical prescription Ketamine Food Futurama (TV series - season 5) Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Genericized trademark Bagel The Pet Sounds Sessions Plutonium The Apprentice 2 Milk Waste management Kain (Legacy of Kain) Hydrochloric acid Mail Electrophysiology Ramen Monetary policy Maple syrup Antiretroviral drug Oplan Bojinka Ice Bong Sant Thakar Singh Autonomous building Insurance Fire extinguisher Haloalkane Opportunity rover Coffee Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus New Coke Breastfeeding Make money fast Philip J.

do you think my hamster is afraid of me please read carefully before answering i have had my hamster for days now everytime i try to take him out of his cage he runs away from my hands and if i do not get to him fast enough he hides in one of his tubes if i block the tube he does the defence thing and rolls on to his back he never bites squeaks or pees though however i only take him out after pm sometimes it is already p i wait until he is fully awake and alert he will sit on my hands in his cage and eat right out of them once out of the cage i can hold him all i want without any issues and he will run all over me in fact we play this game where i cup my hand around him and leave an opening somewhere he runs around in my cupped hand until he finds the way out then we do it over again when we are playing his ears are always up and his little whiskers are moving around tickling me sometimes he tries to run back out when i am putting him back in the cage he never squeaks or bites me so what do you think is he scared of me actually is sounds like he is pretty happy but there can be many dfferent reasons why he is running away from you it may take a little more time for him to trust you more but from what you have told about him it sounds like you two are really close but like i said it may take a little while longer but with what he does now it shouldn't take long for the bond to grow  Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Time Machine Shaggy dog story Social rule John Cage Cat Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Table tennis Milton H.

i stepped on my guinea pig not on purpose but what should i do she seems all right how unfortunate though it happens to the best of us depending on how you stepped on her it may be in her best interest to take her to a veterinarian it's in a guinea pig's nature to hide any signs of illness or distress so thoroughly examine your pig to see if she exhibits any signs of discomfort if you feel she isn't injured let her be but keep an eye on her to make sure she is still eating drinking and expelling waste as per usual any changes whatsoever can be the first sign of something being wrong  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Animal testing Dairy Fancy rat Cat Hamster Pig Hypoglycemia Taboo food and drink Characters of Naruto Foodborne illness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Elephant Stuttering Invader Zim Anorexia nervosa Whaling Urinary incontinence Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Ron Weasley Self-harm Cancer Chocolate Bloat Ranma __ characters 613 mitzvot A Series of Unfortunate Events Pitaten Human sexual behavior Rat Park Sant Thakar Singh Japanese tea ceremony YuYu Hakusho Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Legend of Zelda series enemies Snuff film Mushroom hunting Grief Tort Abortion debate Spirited Away Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Livestock Public domain One Tree Hill (TV series) Roman eating and drinking The Smoking Room Economy of Papua New Guinea Meat Vomiting Anxiety Tetrodotoxin Zoophilia Gender identity disorder Garfield Zoonosis Lisa the Vegetarian Milton H.

can a spider seriously hurt a hamster i woke up this morning and found a large spider in my hamsters cage he was up in his lookout and the spider was below in his main cage i got rid of the spider it was alive for spider lovers out there i did not squish it i released outside where i live we do not really get poisonous spiders my hamster seems fine but it is hard to tell since he is sleeping but sleeping in his usual spot in his usual way would my little guy have killed the spider if it tried to attack bite him i would think that spiders pose the same threat to small animals as they do to us poisonous or not i'd think that your biggest concern would have been spider bites a spider bite can be painful and in some case maybe cause an allergic reaction depending on the temperament of your hamster i'd imagine that he'd probably stay clear of the intruder until you removed it unless the spider openly intruded upon it in which case your hammy probably would either fled or fought overall i'd say just keep an eye out for unwelcome critters in your hammy's cage but don't fret too much about it  Hamster Spider Doom enemies Blood (computer game) Tarantula Unreal Venom (poison) First aid The Legend of Zelda series enemies Garfield Spider-Man (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Donald Neilson Characters of Naruto Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an David Bowie Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sub-Zero Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling match types Shannara creatures Sin City Spider-Man Vegeta Animal Liberation Front Monster Rancher monsters Hobo spider Black widow spider Poison Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Dog One Piece minor characters Shark Monkey Year of the Spider Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mushroom hunting Pok__mon Abilities Anxiety The Big Sleep Pok__mon Live!

rexing gene dominant in rats hiya reading up on ratty genetics with a plan to breed in the distant future particularly interested in rex and dumbo varieties is the rex gene dominant so if you mate a rex rat to a smooth coat then you get hetrozygous rex babies also i've heard the dumbo gene is recessive so if you mate a dumbo with a top ear you get heterozygous top ears then if you mate a heterozygous top ear to a dumbo of the babies will be dumbos and top ears of course nature rarely works to such precise figures but i'm speaking in terms of chance it'd be great to get some insight from a breeder thanks x the rats i have at the minute are all rescues and i will continue to do so whether or not you think i should breed wasn't the question i asked and i believe that is my decision to make when the time comes to really get what you want as a breeder you need to start your breeding with rats of known genetics known lineage this will require you getting your rats from reputable breeders rats from pets stores and rescued rats are a mixed bag of genetic material and some of that genetic material makes rats bred willy nilly prone to diseases rat genetics code http www boardmanweb com rattery geneticbasics htm it's a lot of work reading up on genetics here's an example of a breeder who knows her lines http www pxrats com geneticsnonagouti html rex genetics http www skyclyde com geneticscurlycoats html dumbo genetics http web ukonline co uk spladoosh genetics du html http web ukonline co uk spladoosh stands bod dum html http members aol com ristorat dumbo html can't speak for rex because right now they are still popping up randomly in my lines i'm not a professional breeder and when i do breed i keep all the babies this is what i know from my breedings about dumbo mom looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo and dad looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo all babies will be dumbo and carry dumbo mom looks like a top eared and carries dumbo and dad looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo of babies will be dumbo and some carry dumbo dad looks like a top eared and carries dumbo and mom looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo of babies will be dumbo and some carry dumbo mom and dad both top eared but carry dumbo of the babies will be dumbo but like you said nature rarely works to such precise figures i just had an accidental litter where mom is dumbo and all of the surviving babies are top eared had two still born i don't believe there are any professional breeders here at y a because i basically know all of them from other forums a good forum to join to learn about breeding and genetics would be http groups yahoo com group ratspacnw spazrats my life has gone to the rats  Fancy rat Dog Cat Gene Species Mixed-breed dog Domestic rabbit Cat coat genetics Horse German Shepherd Dog House Mouse Recessive gene Elephant Manx (cat) Dobermann Havanese Labrador Retriever Hamster Pet skunk Gray Wolf Docking Dog breeding Genetics Extinction HTML DNA Black panther Keeshond Biology Reproduction Brown Rat World Wide Web English Springer Spaniel Dominance relationship Gray (horse) Hearing impairment Genetic code Puppy mill Price equation Kakapo Monster Rancher monsters Kevin and Kell Jack Russell Terrier Ferret Cultivar Potato Evolution Dog breed Introduced species HyperText Transfer Protocol Sickle-cell disease Stewie Griffin Nuclear thermal rocket Urinary incontinence Agriculture Virus Polymerase chain reaction Long-term potentiation Molecular evolution Vladimir Peter Tytla Compact disc Rat Terrier Cheetah Discus (fish) Gmail Primate JavaServer Pages Doug Homer Simpson Abortion debate Future energy development Congenital disorder Heterozygote advantage Liger Who Framed Roger Rabbit Chihuahua (dog) Cloning Barbara McClintock Domain Name System Smooth Collie Randomness HTTP cookie Genetic disorder

getting two rats i've convinced my mom to let me get a rat notice how i say a rat she says i can't have more than one rat i tried sending her articles via email about how rats are much happier with company of their own kind and how it's really not much more trouble having two rats as opposed to just one and just in case you're thinking i'm irresponsible don't worry because i have spent hours and hours researching care and handling and the diet of pet rats and cages and i know basically everything about owning one i am ready to make the commitment of being a rat owner also i've proven myself responsible by taking good care of my guinea pigs for years do you have any ideas on what i could tell her in order to convince her to let me get two rats at least sorry this is so long btw rats do get along better with two esp in case you have a really busy day without much time to spend with them i'm guessing she's worried about the smell here are some facts that might help male rats have a body odor females tend not to so if you go with females that will reduce some of the smell another thing is when you have two rats you must clean the cage at least every three days i usually went with two by doing so the rats will be healthier and the cage less stinky i'm not talking about just scooping the bedding out i'm talking about a complete washdown nod also there have been people who say having two rats makes them love you less not true instead of having one happy wiggly rat eager for you to play with it you'll have two and they'll be more upbeat in attitude because they'll have each other when in the cage good luck  Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Theory of conduct Cat House Mouse Philosophical skepticism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Vitamin C Animal Liberation Front Phoebe Buffay's songs Avenue Q Garfield Sin City Ren and Stimpy Rat (zodiac) The Inside Coconut crab Ferret Rat Park Professional wrestling match types Plame affair Infantilism Sleep The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hey Arnold!

guinea pig hamster or neither for christmas i was thinking about getting a hamster because i've always wanted one and my parent's think i might be responsible enough my neighbors once had a hamster and a guinea pig and we got to babysit them one time that's when i really fell in love with hamsters but when i told my brother what i wanted he said guinea pigs are better i didn't agree because i remembered that we got to play with the hamster and the guinea pig slept in it's igloo all day please help me with this which is funner which is easier to take care of which is less expensive which one doesn't stink as much because those are me and my parent's main concerns thanks if you are looking for the best rodent type pet get a rat domestic rats unlike hamsters do not bite are affectionate and have their own personalities they can be let out of their cages to roam around a room at will and left on their own for short periods of time they will also often come to you if you call them because they are highly social creatures they are also very easy to take care of as they can eat just about anything they are also relatively inexpensive available from any pet store for or less however you will want to get one from a pet store and not a feeder store for snakes as the ones from pet stores will be handled and socialized more personally i've had regular and dwarf hamsters as well as rats all were sweet in a way but the hamsters would often bite usually by accident but if you put your hand into their den they would often take a bite out of your finger thinking it was food rats will not do this and in general are much more affectionate than hamsters as for stinking do not get a guinea pig they don't do much besides eat sleep and poop it virtually amazes me when people loose their guinea pigs because it seems as if they have a literal trail of poop following behind them overall rats and hamsters require about the same maintenance as far as cleaning and feeding go although it is also easier to bath rats as they like to swim it is fun to fill up a bathtub and let them play in it provided you give them some dry land to get on too in terms of funny you just can't beat rats get a pair of baby rats and put them in a cage together and you will never see anything more funny or adorable when you watch them play on that note if you get a rat i recommend that you at least get of them they are very social creatures and love the company of another rat around anyway i wish you good luck and whatever pet you get just give it enough love and attention and it will be a good pet no matter what you get  Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Garfield Cat The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pet skunk Pet Rat Chicken Shaggy dog story Customs and etiquette of Japan EastEnders Theory of conduct Social rule Sento Ferret Humphrey Bogart Chinchilla Spidey Super Stories RuneScape quests Textile manufacturing Animal testing Pig The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents The Fairly OddParents Brown Rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet store Creatures in Bionicle Spirited Away Domestication Fruits Basket John the Baptist Taboo food and drink Care Bears Surveillance Internet phenomenon Snake Sinfest The Sims Dog training W.I.T.C.H.

i need to know as much about hamsters as possible my parents are thinking about getting me a hamster but only if i research them could you guys tell mw some stuff please anything is helpfull sure hamsters are great if you've never had one before then you should get a larger breed like a european because they tend to have really good personalities whereas smaller breeds especially any kind of dwarf can be a little meaner and harder to tame you'll need to clean the cage at least twice a week and change all the bedding to keep the hamster happy and healthy and cleaning also helps keep the odor down hamsters require alot of exercise and although you'll see them sleep most of the day they are very active a night so every night before you go to bed you'll want to take them out for some out of the cage exercise a roll a bout ball is good for this and you'll want to get them a quiet wheel so they don't keep you up at night silent spinner is a good wheel now when you first bring your hamster home s he will most likely be scared and stressed out stress in hamsters can cause wet tail or diarrhea which is deadly to prevent wet tail in your new hamster buy a fresh head of cabbage and feed him a chunk of it very day until the whole head is gone buy your hamster from a good pet store you can usually tell if the pet store is a good one when you walk in because the cages will be clean not overcrowded and the workers will have knowledge of hamster care beware of stores that try to sell you a lot of things you don't need and do not trust anyone if they tell you to keep more than one hamster in the same cage you can not keep any hamster in a the same cage with another they do keep multiple hamsters in the same cage at the pet stores however those hamsters are young as soon as they get a little older they'd eat and kill each other if they still shared a cage another thing hamsters need is something to chew on by chewing on cardboard and wood they keep their teeth short so make sure you give your hamster some chew sticks here are some links to hamster products and hamster care sheets that may help you roll a bout ball http www petco com product super pet run about ball aspx silent spinner wheel http www petco com product silent spinner aspx hamster basic care sheet printer friendly http www petco com caresheets small animals hamster pdf now one more thing when you first bring your hamster home s he may be scared of you so you're gonna need to tame your new hamster it's easy to do if you know what you're doing here's how to do it when you first bring your hamster home let them be in their cage alone don't bother them and let them explore their cage alone for the first day the next day put your hand in the cage without touching them put some food or a treat on your palm and just hold your hand still in the cage for a minute do this several times a day for the first two or three days eventually your hamster will be used to smelling your hand in the cage at this point in time you may gently pet your hamsters back with one finger do this several times a day for two or three days and continue to try offering your hamster food or treats from your hand handfeeding your hamster teaches them to trust you after your hamster learns to except food from your hand and to let you pet them then you can try to pick them up with your hand remember to always wash your hands before touching your hamster you do this so that your hands don't smell like anything besides you and soap if your hamster smells food or another animal on you then they are more likely to get scared and bite you and remember to handle your hamster for at least five minutes everyday after the process of taming is over because hamsters need to handled daily congratulations hope this helps and good luck i know i love my hamsters and i'm sure you'll have lots of fun with your new addition  Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Textile manufacturing Guinea pig Dog training Cat Pet skunk Mattress Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Animal testing Tooth Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Knife RuneScape quests Milton H.

perfect pair since purchasing my first piggie male i have been debating getting another but many people believe housing two males together is dangerous others think that male and female combinations aren't that great either is there a perfect pair can i get another male or will my lone piggie do better alone do not listen to anyone who tells you that males can not live together happily in the end it comes down to how you introduce them if you introduce them after the quarantine period properly then everything should be fine it really is nothing more than a myth as for a female companion that is fine but you will have to neuter either the male or the female in terms of the perfect pair the only way you can get a perfect pair is if you make them a perfect pair by first quarinting and secondly introducing you guinea pig will defiantly not do better alone guinea pigs are herd animals by nature they are extremely social thus why they do better in pairs  Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Pig Gender Castration Dog Bulgarian language Grammatical gender Ferret Porky Pig Piggies Domestication Spider Kangaroo Gender role Miss Piggy The Muppets Hamster Cannibalism Glossary of graph theory Hentai Semen Dairy Feral cat Ancient Greek Animal testing Taboo food and drink Chinese calendar Civilization Gender-neutral language Extreme Programming Software engineering Margaret Mead Cat Speaker for the Dead Mating system Grammatical aspect Gray Wolf Daffy Duck Free market Sexual reproduction Shifting cultivation Coprophagia Animal rights Pearls Before Swine (comic strip) Quarantine God and gender Prehistoric Britain Hippopotamus Inca Empire Machinima The Muppet Show House Mouse Royal Assent Sexual selection Introduced species Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Pigs is Pigs (1937) Side Characters (Xenosaga) Piggy Heteronormativity New Guinea Platypus Order of succession Consensus decision-making Catalan grammar Guns, Germs, and Steel Transgender Bird Baboon Cuisine of Africa Sanskrit Predynastic Egypt Economy of Norway Swedish language Artificial selection Herd Music Neolithic WordPerfect The Muppets Take Manhattan H5N1 Albatross Elephant Sexual differentiation Phoneme Crab Gender identity Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire Contract bridge Ogdoad Material properties of diamond Pet Pet skunk Indigenous peoples Power Rangers: Ninja Storm Salic law Invader Zim Protoss Plant sexuality

my hamster is scared of me my hamster suddenly got so scared of me and hid he ran fast into his tunnel and went there why he usually is very social i only put vaseline on my hands but could that be a cause i fed him some sunflower seeds and he calmed down but i dont know whats wrong i often play with him daily and hes used to me if you think it could be a weird smell on your hands try using antibacterial gel or washing your hands thoroughly before trying to hold him again i'm betting the vaseline is what did it if he still seems really scared of you put a tube next to him that he can crawl into then place that on your desk bed or other hand so he can walk out slowly to you it will help him get used to it at his own pace giving him plenty of time to sniff around without letting him run anywhere else  Hamster Aerial (dance move) Bedbug Teen Girl Squad Brown Bear Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Milton H.

please help okay i'm on the phone with my friend right now and we're talking about my new baby guinea pig bella my friend said that her parents are going to get her one but they said that she couldn't take it out of the cage i keep trying to coax my friend out of getting a guinea pig because what kind of life is that for a guinea pig to never get to come out of the cage i even talked to her parents and i said that they are very social animals and they need to be held and showered with love and affection but they still won't listen my friend said that they are going to get this cage http www dkimages com discover previews jpg i told her that it's way too small for a guinea pig they won't listen i know this guinea pig will have a horrible life what can i do to get her to not buy a guinea pig i do not want a guinea pig to suffer from this situation hellppp hi guys thanks for all of your help to hound lover you said something about taking her to a petstore and telling her about buying a big cage and toys and books for a guinea pig's needs her parents have already said that they are getting that cage and if it's a problem then it's no guinea pig at all they're going to get the guinea pig today so i believe i failed i think that teej will be right i'll probably end up with the guinea pig but that's not really a problem because if they keep it for a long time and it's not doing well and the parents don't like it at all i will offer to take the piggie off their hands i'm going to shower it with love and affection and make sure that pig feels some love throughout his life thank you guys your information helped i know how you feel and i wish my answer could help you since i'm also an animal lover and we both have the same dream i think you should tell your friend that its better not to get a guinea pig if they can't provide the animal's basic needs animals are also like humans when it comes to its needs we know that everybody wants to be loved and cared of and its not so nice if your'e inside a room for the whole day without letting you go out even once just like a guinea pig kept inside for its whole life good luck  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Care Bears Social rule Hamster Friends Blonde on Blonde Jon Secada Pitaten Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Garfield Professional wrestling match types Pig John Cage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Animal Liberation Front Salad Fingers Infantilism Little Britain Bon Jovi Pig (zodiac) The Apprentice 2 Fancy Crane Invader Zim Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Transactional analysis Avenue Q Side Characters (Xenosaga) Animal rights Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Roswell UFO incident About a Boy The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) W.I.T.C.H.

ferret cage for a rat i'm going to buy female rats and i want them to have the best cage possible there's a nicely priced one a petco and it looks like the rats would love it but it's a ferret cage the wires are properly spaced and it has levels what i'm worried about is this tunnel thing that the rat would have to climb through to get to the second level would a rat be able to use this it's not very tall so the rat won't have to really climb much but it sorta bends upwards at a near degree angle obviously a ferret could use it so could a rat it will be big enough i don't want anything that would hurt the rat's back or something it would refuse to use thus defeating the whole purpose of the level cage also it comes with one of those hammock things for ferrets will the rat use this mrs phas it is the second cage you posted do you have a link to look at and then i could say pretty much for sure is it this one http www petco com product super pet deluxe multi floor ferret home with stand aspx or this http www petco com product super pet multi floor ferret home aspx details i keep mine in this http www zooplus co uk shop rodents cages ferret cage which is a ferret cage but i have big squishy bucks the one worry i have from the description is the bar spacing for fully grown girls it really needs to be cm inch or less remember if the head can fit through the body will follow you could however slightly adapt it and cover the bars with chicken wireas well for kitten hood then removing it when full grown if they cant fit through your totally right by the way for girls height is an absolute necessity and both those cages are excellent for that the tunnel thing and the hammock are no prob the rats well done for a same sex pair by the way will love them and i would suggest fitting as many as you can especially as your getting girlies look here for ideas http www goosemoose com component option com smf itemid forum rat board hope that helps link please if its not either of those edit thanks for the update this is what i found the black epoxy coated wire is psaced apart sic and by the way its cheaper here but check the shipping http www dog com itemdy asp t srccode dnextag so its less than inch but having asked others and got a resounding thumbs up as a great cage espesh for rats the overall opinion is you may still need to chicken wire for kits just to be on safe side most kits upto about months depending on how well you feed them muchos protein for good sized ones can get through anything bigger than a critter martins cage mesh both are cage types i hate personally none of those cages can compare with this one though its fantastic and your girlies will adore it and you  Ferret Fancy rat Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Guinea pig Sin City Ford Thunderbird HyperText Transfer Protocol Cat Dog agility Solar cell Poker jargon Equine conformation Kim Possible Have I Got News For You Mattress RuneScape economy Uniform Resource Locator Mixed martial arts B-47 Stratojet Eddie Guerrero Shaggy dog story Stairway Aerial (dance move) Steel Cage Match Pet skunk Textile manufacturing Universal Serial Bus Science fiction on television Ford Mustang Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dodge Charger Prostate cancer Diagon Alley Plastic Avenue Q Ajax (programming) Trapping Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma House Mouse Manual transmission Livestock XML Digital photography Internet fraud Violin Tire Milton H.

guinea pig purring noise i adopted a male guinea pig two weeks ago he is months old and adopted it a male friend five days ago who is weeks old when they get together the older guinea makes a purring noise and looks like he is crawling when on the floor he also pee ed on the younger ones face but when i seperate them the older one screams out for him what does this mean will they or wont they get on sounds like typical dominance behavior to me i have four male guinea pigs and i'm always hearing little rumblestruts now and then spraying rumblestrutting teeth chattering chasing and mounting are all normal displays of dominance used by both males and females to assert themselves within their herd my advice would be to read up on how to properly introduce two new guinea pigs to one another you'll want to do it in a neutral area like the floor or the couch it can be hard as the piggy mom to watch the two sort out dominance between them but as long as there aren't any furballs rolling around and bloodshed keep them together  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Cat Dog Pig Sexual differentiation Lisa the Vegetarian Elephant Gender role Peccary Knight Rider Toilet humour Combine (Half-Life 2) Treehouse of Horror V Hearing impairment Stuttering Psychedelic music Nine Inch Nails Tag Meme Ron and Fez The Muppet Show Notable lines in the Star Wars series The Legend of Zelda series enemies Animal Farm RuneScape quests Papua New Guinea Civilization Shifting cultivation Bonus Stage USS Ammen (DD-527) Sperm Whale Poker jargon Money Vitamin C Pink Floyd Kangaroo Little Britain References to Star Trek Salad Fingers Mountain Gorilla Blonde on Blonde Holes (book) Pump It Up The Marshall Mathers LP Kakapo Xiaolin Showdown Indian rebellion of 1857 Hippopotamus Baboon Blood Simple Sleeping Murder Brown Bear Peleliu Ostrich Dinosaur Garfield Giant Panda Animal testing 2004 Republican National Convention Shaggy dog story Eddie Guerrero Charles Darwin's education USS Yorktown (CV-10) Red Squirrel Australasia ecozone Out-of-body experience Coprophagia Eric Cartman Chicken Sin City Gramophone record Scenes from a Memory Manual transmission Friction Spirited Away USS Albacore (SS-218) Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Critic Sound recording Compact audio cassette Pet skunk Bird Sound effect Weighting filter Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Captain Thunderbolt Llama House Mouse Jethro Tull (band) Babe Ruth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prehistoric Britain Miss Piggy Dairy Good Times Laura Schlessinger A Day in the Life Motion picture rating system Cotswold Games

fleece for bedding what are your thoughts on using fleece as bedding for guinea pigs in particular what materials would you recommend to go underneath the fleece to soak up the urine i was thinking either towles or a matress pad any other advice on using fleece would be greatly appreciated as i only started using fleece yesterday newspaper barely absorbs anything fleece is actually very good from what i have heard what it does is wicks the urine to the bottom of the cage which is why you need an underlay towel for eg to soak up the urine it is far better than most beddings available and alot cheaper contrary to what you think fleece does not smell and as for using hay for bedding that is not a recommended bedding due to pieces having the tendency to getting stuck in little eyes fleece is awesome your guinea pigs will love it you can get the rubber mattress protector stuff not sure of the technical name at joann's back in the home decor area you can probably find it at any fabric store this can be used on the very bottom of the cage and then towels between this and the fleece you can also use the super absorbent pads that they use under people in hospitals and nursing homes but they're pretty pricy i have a hand vac that i use to catch up the poos but some people just use a little hand broom and dust pan do you have a c c cage that's what my piggers have and they have an upper x level that is their kitchen their food hay and water are up there along with a litter box but this is where they do most of their potty business therefore this area needs to be switched out every day or two but the bottom floor can go a week between cleanings there's a whole section on fleece in the www guineapigcages com forum http www guineapigcages com forum bedding fleece project study html highlights fleece you might want to check it out o  Mattress Hamster Guinea pig Textile manufacturing Domestic rabbit Menstrual cycle Japanese toilet Chinchilla Fancy rat Upholstery Violin Plastic Urinary incontinence SpongeBob SquarePants Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bong Sanitary towel Medical prescription Dairy Seismic retrofit Undergarment Kitchen The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bacon Ron and Fez Ice core Vermicompost Menstrual cup Cookware and bakeware Prostate cancer Richard Chase Cat Diseases of the honeybee Baseball Wood carving Illegal drug trade About a Boy World Wide Web Mixed martial arts Roswell UFO incident Dance Dance Revolution Passenger car Strap-on dildo Pneumonia Bed (furniture) Chicken Professional wrestling match types The Shining (film) Dialysis Opportunity rover Tattoo Boxing Coconut crab Breastfeeding Pink Floyd Brewery Caving Kurt Cobain Certified Nursing Assistant Belfast blitz Gaia Online Velvet Acid Christ Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Modem Stuttering Customs and etiquette of Japan American lobster Composting toilet Sento Manicure Toilet Floppy disk Drag racing RuneScape economy EastEnders Water Hera Goaltender John Cage Coffee Hazing Glacier Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Sewage treatment Drill bit Trapping Emergency preparedness Magic (illusion) Tofu Coir Urine Wok The Star Wars Holiday Special

how big do pet rats grow i just bought two beautiful boy rex rats i think they are about weeks just wondering how big they will actually grow oh and any negative comments please don't bother i don't care for negativity thx lol not sewer rats pet rats you know the nice ones it really depends on where you keep them and other environmental factors as someone else mentioned boys do grow quite a bit bigger than the females if you keep your rats in a small or medium cage and they do not get much time out then they will stay quite small but if you have a large cage and give them the amount of exercise and outside time that they need then they will be more healthy and will grow larger just like when you have a goldfish in a small tank it will stay relatively the same size but if you then move the same fish into a huge tank you will notice a lot of growth they adapt to the space that they are given basically my girls spend a lot of time in the bathroom and get a digging box bedding food and water in there with them they love this time when they can run around and play i will usually go in and sit and read while they play or watch them run around and laugh at them p you should be giving them at least an hour of exercise time each day and congratulations on your new owners d  Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Goldfish Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment Fish farming Electrophysiology Sin City Brewery Ferret The Shining (film) Ron and Fez Chinchilla Cliff Richard Discus (fish) Billboard Hot 100 Sleep Pet store The Catcher in the Rye Urinary incontinence Social rule Urban sprawl Theory of conduct Autonomous building Capital accumulation Rat Cat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dairy Pet skunk Brown Rat Avenue Q Paul Is Dead Tyrannosaurus rex Shaggy dog story Equine conformation The Ashlee Simpson Show The Brady Bunch Sears Holdings Corporation Coconut crab Pok__mon Live!

how can i show my family that i'm responseible for a pet im nuts about pets but at first my parents didnt let me keep anything but goldfish however i started with plants keep a few nice and easy household plants and try to keep them alive they are one of the closest things to a pet also you could research a lot on the internet before you get a pet you have to anyway if you have a passion for pets you'll find it really fun when i was little i found good reasons why to get a hamster from my research and told mom and dad dad did you know the more you get them interested the more they'll be convinced when they finally get you at least a small pet work your way up i went from plants to goldfish to turtle to finch to hamster to parakeet the size goes bigger as your parents trust you and realize you could really take care of pets few warnings are to make sure you know how much money you're going to invest in buying the pet and supplies you're going to pay every month for bedding food vet check ups etc also make sure you dont get a boring pet it may really excite you at the thought of getting a pet but as soon as you have a few months believe it or not you'll get tired of it some time some pets last a lifetime make sure poor fido doesnt end up in the pound because you stopped loving him be willing to dedicate a lot of time to your pets my mom was disgusted by pets but know she loves them and smoochies them and actually offers to clean the cage its really amazing how parents change their mind d i dont understand them but i dont think your parents arent as strict as mine it doesnt really take much to show that you've got what it takes  Hamster Garfield Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents About a Boy Fancy rat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) The Amazing Race Mr. and Mrs. Turner Neopets W.I.T.C.H.

my guinea pig please help im desperate please help me my almost year old female guinea pig has been acting strange lately for about days i have noticed that she has not been eating or drinking at all i haven't seen any new pellets on the cage floor and she has been sitting in her little plastic igloo and not coming out she also hasn't been reacting to anything like she usually does when i listen to her breathe it sounds a little airy and she has a strange odor coming from her mouth nose please help me i love her so much and this is too much to deal with right now believe me i don't need the stress her nost and eyes look a little crusty too i am going to bring her to the vet tomorrow does anyone know what i should do or have a feeling what it might be there are a lot of things that may be wrong a good exam by a veterinarian is the best place to start not to worry you but a guinea pig who has not eaten in days is one that is dying while that process may be stopped by proper diagnosis and treatment intervention your pet is likely critical her digestive system has quit working no fecal pellets and she is likely to have pneumonia bronchitis both of these things may be secondary to a primary illness or may be complicated by not enough vitamin c gut stasis in an already sick animal can be triggered by feeding 'treats' guinea pig digestive systems were not designed to eat a lot of seeds grains carbohydrates and fruit but that is often what store bought treats contain but a good veterinarian will cover all of the care and management details once they examine and diagnose your pigs current problems  Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Hamster Stomach cancer Fancy rat Hypoglycemia Medicine Cat Cancer Anorexia nervosa Prostate cancer Coprophagia Pneumonia Vomiting Anxiety Vitamin C Pet skunk Chicken Stuttering Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cirrhosis Ferret Insulin Dairy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Garfield Theory of conduct Coeliac disease Veterinarian Nutrition Elephant Schizophrenia Botulism Diarrhea Crohn's disease Cancer of the larynx Kodocha Microchip implant (animal) First aid Flatulence Veganism Asthma Post-traumatic stress disorder Milk Health insurance Dog Extreme Programming Psychiatry Coconut crab Food Traumatic brain injury Foie gras Animal testing Livestock Vermicompost Folic acid Raw food diet Stroke Peanut Decompression sickness Hikikomori Gastrointestinal tract Controversies in autism Urinary incontinence Sin City Alzheimer's disease Drowning Common cold Influenza Sewage treatment House Mouse Treehouse of Horror V Anemia Phoebe Buffay's songs Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Colorectal cancer Breastfeeding Traumatic incident reduction Tobacco smoking Tooth Blood (computer game) Salad Fingers Radiation therapy Binge eating disorder Glycogen storage disease type I People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals

gerbil help please sick gerbil so i have a female gerbil i've always used the same brand of litter food toys etc for her whole life and the past few weeks her face has been swelling off and on at first she lost all hair on her face but it has been growing back very quickly there's a white piece of something in her eye and i can't tell if something is stuck in there or if it's some kind of growth there is also a red mucous or blood that has seeped from her nose and eyes but it clears up fine and looks more like her mucous rather than blood i have taken some pics i just don't know what to do or where to go to email pics for someone to help her appetite is fine the same as it always has been shes alwyas in fresh bedding and with fresh water and she's as active as ever she doesn't seem sluggish or to be sleeping too much she doesn't seem to be in pain at all but i also think she has trouble seeing when it's very swollen any help please we have always and continue to use carefresh bedding we got her probably or months ago and she's only months old i've talked to people in pet stores and they all say they've never heard of this my boyfriends mother also bred and raised the critters years ago and she's never seen this either the only way that i can find medicine for her is to take her to a doctor and that's not in my finances at the moment she's also in a gallon tank so it's not a question of the area being too small or her getting use to a new enviroment it would help to know what kind of food bedding toys ect you are using on her as well as how old she is if you are using cedar or pine bedding this may be causing problems these beddings can cause allergic reactions and upper respiratory infections try switching to aspen carefresh aspen pellets or newspaper pellets you can also use paper towels and change them every other day i would look in the phone book for a vet that treats small animals or ask someone in your area if they can recomend a place in my area a vet check for a gerbil ranges from dollars depending on where you go most medications for gerbils are cheap since they do not need very big doses if she is still eating drinking and acting otherwise normal this is a good sign it usually means that what ever is wrong with her has not progressed very far and is probably not life threatening gerbils live about years my oldest lived to be your gerbil may just be getting old too good luck to you  Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Allergy Common cold Tuberculosis Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tattoo Urinary incontinence Carbon dioxide Pet skunk Meriones unguiculatus Cat Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City First aid Traumatic brain injury Asthma Pneumonia Folic acid Medical prescription Psoriasis Kodocha Cancer Insulin Tarantula Conjunctivitis Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Little Britain Lung cancer Obstetrics Syphilis Medicine Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Malaria Social rule Cephalic disorder Shark Garfield Blood Cirrhosis Dairy Group A streptococcal infection The Shining (film) Milton H.

what kind of extra attention should i give to my anti social rus dwarf hamster out of my two russian dwarf hamsters one of them is quite a bit more anti social than the other i got them from a house with kids and what she does is sort of hunch up on her hind legs then punch out with her front legs to scratch you but she doesn't bite it doesn't hurt at all or anything that's what they both did before i got them but they've calmed down a lot since i took them home with me anyways it's just the one doing this now and i was wondering if i should be spending extra time with it so it calms down and doesn't feel threatened i mean like should i be holding her despite her discomfort or just praising her with treats and petting her in her cage this seems like a dumb question but i feel bad handling it when it's frightened i sort of have been just letting her smell my hand and giving her bits of apple and carrot she's getting better i do give her treats out of my hands so that she has so come near to take them usually i pinch the treat between my fingers and hold it in front of her nose and she'll smell it and take it doing what you're doing now is good keep handing it treats cause just like it took time for them to calm down it'll take time to show the hamster that there's nothing to worry about when it learns that nothing is going to happen it will become more comfortable dwarf hamsters are a little bit meaner that other breeds of hamsters so don't worry about it too much  Hamster Dog training Social rule Aerial (dance move) Cat Equine conformation Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Russian joke Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet skunk Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.

suddenly evil rat i've had my rat for about a month and never has she bitten sure she'd rather run around than be with me but she still has never harmed anyone however just yesterday i tried to pick her up she was not sleeping just sitting on a wooden block in her cage and she bit my finger i thought maybe i just surprised her so i gently placed my finger on her back and she bit me again i didn't want to be hurt anymore so i stopped later that day my brother's girlfriend tried to pick her up and it bit her for the first time as well what's happened any help would be appreciated and she is the only rat in the cage but i usually take her out to play like hours a day also i fed her a peanut today and she was nipping at my finger and also bit the peanut oh and a peanut a day is not her regular diet btw she always has a full food dish xd hmm i must admit it's strange just to be safe i'd wash your hands before handling her to get rid of any food smells how often have you been handling her if she'd rather stay in her cage than be with you then maybe she's just a naturally aggressive rat or you haven't handled her enough edit never mind hours a day should be enough to make her friendly towards people it's also possible that she's sick so look for any signs of listlessness or pain if she were male then neutering him would fix the problem male rats can grow bitey when they hit a certain age unless neutered but i'm pretty sure you're able to tell her gender for certain  Cat Ferret Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Milton H.

how to give a guinea pig a bath this can be quite tricky you can do it in the kitchen sink or in a washing up bowl but we find it easier to do it in the actual bathtub so that they don't jump out use warm not hot or cold water test the temperature with your elbow put the guinea pig in the bowl bath then add a small amount of water an inch or two then use a jug to slowly pour more water over the big's body keeping clear of it's head eyes and ears you should also use a special guinea pig shampoo or a gentle baby shampoo once every few months use a small amount of shampoo and rub it into the fur creating a lather do not get the shampoo on the head in the ears or anywhere near the eyes or nose try to clean the fur as thoroughly as possible it is a good idea on boars to keep the area around the grease gland on its bum clean else the fur can become really greasy and matted a stronger grease cutting cleaner will probably be needed for this once all the fur has been shampooed use a jug and fresh warm water to rinse off the shampoo you may have to do this a couple of times it may be easier to use a showerhead on a warm gentle setting empty the water and allow your pig to drip dry for a few seconds then place it on a towel and thoroughly towel dry it a little food treat often helps as encouragement and so that the guinea pig associates baths with a good thing you can then use a hairdryer on a gentle warm setting to finish the drying have your hand in the air flow against your guinea pig to make sure it is not too hot also lift up the fur so that the inner fur close to the skin gets dried as well if your pig lives outside make sure it is completely and thoroughly dry before putting it back outside else it will get cold and could fall ill hope this has helped good luck and happy bathing ps remember to treat your pig every now and then for encouragement as the whole experience can be quite stressful and scary for them if you're lucky your pig will love baths but most don't  Sento Guinea pig Massage Textile manufacturing Psoriasis Japanese toilet Customs and etiquette of Japan Aerial (dance move) Shampoo Hamster Dandruff Domestic rabbit Sauna Menstrual cup Manicure Common cold Bong Social rule Cat Towel Happy Tree Friends Dry cleaning Fecal incontinence Diving Dialysis Ranma __ characters Comanche Tea Drowning Hand washing Tattoo Plastic Upholstery Chinchilla Rosacea Dairy Japanese tea ceremony Fancy rat Hydrotherapy Care Bears Hard water Carbon dioxide Fujian tea ceremony Thermoregulation Coffee Dishwashing Urinary incontinence Diseases of the honeybee Pet skunk Mattress Fire fighting Carburetor Pig Hyperthermia Casting Characters of Naruto Climate of the United Kingdom Cetacea Elephant Dishwasher Baptism Drag racing Bacon Acne Vacuum cleaner Motor oil Concrete El Ni__o Aloe Soap Breaststroke Otitis externa Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cruising (maritime) Strap-on dildo Diving suit Chronic fatigue syndrome Cannabis cultivation Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Dog Paragliding Shaving Little Britain Sewage treatment Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling attacks Weather front Phoebe Buffay's songs Urticaria Drill bit E85 Yosemite National Park

why does my guinea pig bite me when i handle it i dont handle it wrong we got it months ago and it always runs away from me and straight back to its cage and im not evil if theres a way to disapline it ho do i do that hey you no don't discipline your guinea pig as prey animals they are naturally skittish i've had mine for over a year and although they are quite socialized they always run when its time to be picked up how big is your cage trying to pull a bigass guinea pig out the small door of those little cages is just asking for trouble i'd make sure i had a cage big enough for two pigs about sq feet i would advise you to make the room very quiet when you want to talk to your little guy offer yummy treats and do this and only this for a couple days after that pick him up very carefully you cannot scoop them up with one hand because they are not as robust as they look there bones are very brittle don't show fear of being bit just pick it up with two hands hold your piggie to your chest for about minutes they have very tiny bladders and talk gently to it while holding and pet gently put him back and try it again a few times per day but always speak gently and softly for a second or two before picking up your pig will come around you might also consider getting another guinea pig for a companion guinea pigs are highly social and often get depressed when housed alone  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Hamster Ferret Aerial (dance move) RuneScape quests Chinchilla RuneScape Random Events Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Dog Chicken Unreal Dog training Shark Fancy rat Diving Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swingout Lisa the Vegetarian Bat Pig Fishing Blonde on Blonde Trapping Salad Fingers Professional wrestling match types Timon and Pumbaa Menstrual cup Professional wrestling throws Domestication Customs and etiquette of Japan Eric Cartman Tetrapod Whaling Knife Breath of Fire III Daffy Duck Drill bit Chopsticks Conspiracy (TNG episode) Bladderwort Professional wrestling holds Japanese tea ceremony Billboard Hot 100 Wood carving The Ersatz Elevator Milton H.

biting hamster i have a russian hamster that bites a lot i wash my hands like a billion times so it doesn't smell like food but all she does is bite is there anything i can do to train her not to bite help please unfortunately russian hamsters are known for their mean streak if washing your hands hasn't helped i would suggest that you start wearing gloves and continue to handle her the only way she is going to get to the point you want her to is to continue to handle her do it briefly at first and make sure she gets a special treat at the end of each session lengthen the sessions as you go along and hopefully one day she will be able to sit in your hand without biting you please remember to go slowly with this if you go too fast it will take even longer so go slow start with holding her for seconds give her a treat and put her back in the cage make sure you give her the treat while she is in your hand and not in the cage otherwise she will think that going back to the cage gets her the treat and she may bite just to get back and get the treat do this twice a day and then the next day try seconds and so on good luck with your hammie  Hamster Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Dog training Fecal incontinence 2000 Australian Grand Prix Swingout Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Boxing Japanese tea ceremony Aerial (dance move) Weight training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling match types Drill bit Volleyball Pet skunk Internal ballistics Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Electrophysiology Blood on the Tracks Indianapolis 500 Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist New Morning Fancy rat The Ashlee Simpson Show Trapping The Star Wars Holiday Special Equine conformation The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Salad Fingers Time Out of Mind Massage Traffic light Fencing Winning Streak Slow Train Coming Upholstery First aid Tattoo Ariel (Firefly episode) Goaltender Menstrual cup Warrior (World of Warcraft) Customs and etiquette of Japan Table tennis Modem Milton H.

how do i care for a wild baby bunny my german sheppard rescued this fury little thing and has come to believe it is hers i'm afraid that being taken care and handled by humans is wrong however i can't just let this baby go back out to the woods my son would be devasted and i don't believe that this bunny could make it on it's own any help would be greatly appreciated if the baby has it's eyes open and is moving on it's own it's best to set it free it's a known phenomenon that wild rabbits kept in captivity often fail to thrive for no apparent reason wildlife rehabbers often comment that the rabbits seem to pine for freedom grow listless then die the absolute kindest thing for a wild rabbit is to let it be wild if it's eyes are not open or it appears sick or injured search for your nearest wildlife rehab who can take it and they will care for it until it's ready to be released  Dog Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bugs Bunny The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Care Bears Pet skunk Gray Wolf Characters of Lost Guinea pig Cat Piney Woods Wood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sluggy Freelance European Rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Mickey Mouse Falconry Theory of conduct Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Anthropomorphism Rabbits in Australia Rabbit Who Framed Roger Rabbit Fox hunting Comanche John Sheppard (Stargate) Myxomatosis Tiger FLCL Frankie Laine Ferret Poker jargon Mario Kevin and Kell Theodicy The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Bunnie Rabbot Fictional crossover Extinction Feral cat Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Cindy Sheehan Shaggy dog story Elephant Anarcho-primitivism Livestock Miss Saigon Wile E.

introducing a chinchilla everything i read said keep them seperate for at least weeks i've had the older female for two years and the young one is about months old i kept them seperate for like days then introduced them there hasn't been any fighting and they groom each other and what not the reason that you don't introduce them isn't necessarily so that they don't fight it's an ancillary precaution the new chinchilla may have some virus or bacteria that hasn't shown any symptoms yet if you don't give it time to incubate and show symptoms then there's a possibility that you'll spread that virus or bacteria if it's present to the other chinchilla sometimes seclusion isn't about peace it's about health  Sexually-transmitted infection Common cold Measles Gonorrhoea AIDS Poliomyelitis Rabies Influenza Ebola Group A streptococcal infection Foodborne illness Smallpox Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cytomegalovirus Spanish flu Marburg virus Mumps Echovirus Pneumonia Quarantine Gene therapy Infectious mononucleosis Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Herpes simplex virus Rotavirus Chronic fatigue syndrome Avian influenza HIV Rubella Traditional Chinese medicine Tuberculosis Vaccine Guinea pig Bubonic plague Hepatitis C Sterilization (microbiology) H5N1 Tetanus 28 Days Later HIV test Black Death Conjunctivitis Debugging Psoriasis Virus Philosophical skepticism West Nile virus Stomach cancer Crohn's disease Autism Anopheles Transmission (medicine) Banana Plame affair Singaporean measures against avian influenza Botulism Prostate cancer Domestic rabbit Homeopathy E-mail Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Meme HIV Disease Progression Rates Cellulitis Coeliac disease DNA Antiviral drug Trusted computing Medicine Weebl's cartoons Pandemic Candidiasis Cheese Antibody Multiple sclerosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Syphilis Yellow fever Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Clostridium difficile Trichinosis Tularemia Progress of the SARS outbreak Human sexual behavior Procrastination Endocarditis Genetically modified organism Ferret HIV vaccine Breastfeeding Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Bee Foot-and-mouth disease Shrimp farm FairTax
