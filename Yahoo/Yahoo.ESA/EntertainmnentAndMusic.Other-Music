why do my parents hate it when i practice music i've been learning to play the guitar and they say it's a waste of time if i were them i'd be ecstatic that my child has the passion to learn something new i'm going to college in a couple weeks and i really want to trade my crappy yamaha acoustic and pay the difference for a better one my dad said that i shouldn't waste my time and to focus more on schoolwork but it's not like i'm going to be burying my face in books it's frustrating i don't know what to do i love music and i can't go a day without playing guitar keep playing your guitar having a musical interest is great and i hope you stick with it your parents aren't always going to be in agreement with you since you are going off to college you are old enough to make decisions on your own as long as they are smart ones get a better guitar keep practicing maybe hit some talent shows in the future and then when you visit your mom and dad have something prepared especially for them something they would like to show them it wasn't a waste of time just be sure that your school work still comes first because if your grades start slipping your parents will have a reason to keep telling you it's a waste of time  Kurt Cobain Mr. and Mrs. Turner Blonde on Blonde Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes Time Out of Mind The Marshall Mathers LP Shaggy dog story Spice Girls The Fairly OddParents The Ashlee Simpson Show Hermione Granger The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Education in the United States Back to the Future Delta Goodrem One Tree Hill (TV series) Solomon Keal Roxette Friends Marty McFly Slow Train Coming Double bass Kyle Broflovski Hillary Rodham Clinton Rocko's Modern Life Rod Stewart Fathers' rights Grandview, U.S.A.

a question on my new bass i got my new fender standard jazz bass yesterday but the amp didnt come in till today which i will go and pick up i was playing it without an amp and it had a decent amount of fret buzz on the e and a string is this normal for a new bass i am sure it wont be heard over the amp but i just want to know i bought it from a fender dealer had it checked and everything if you bought the bass from a fender dealer they owe you a free set up it's one of the perks for buying in a real store all new instruments need to have the intonation checked the truss rod adjusted and the bridge height set these things are just set to an approximate standard at the factory but must be dialed in for each individual instrument i've seen instruments come set up perfectly from the factory but those are the exception rather than the rule if you bought it from the internet any reputable guitar shop with an authorized service center will take care of you for around do not attempt to set the bass up yourself an untrained person attempting a truss rod adjustment can permanently damage the neck  Guitar Bass guitar Electric guitar John Myung Double bass Fret Intonation Fender Telecaster Violin Jimi Hendrix Mike Watt Floyd Rose Rickenbacker Rhodes piano Stevie Ray Vaughan Fender Hurdy gurdy Slide guitar Harp Fender Stratocaster Tablature Bassoon Blood on the Tracks Gibson Les Paul Leo Fender Timpani PRS Guitars Instrument amplifier John Deacon Anthony Jackson Trombone Joy Division (band) XML Alexi Laiho Mandolin Authentic performance Musical notation Lute Banjo Classical guitar Jaco Pastorius Music Man (company) John Paul Jones (musician) Fender Precision Bass Cello GURPS Acoustic bass guitar Wheel of Fortune Steinberger Twelve string guitar Sundial Loudspeaker Buddy Guy Trumpet Blackjack Wes Montgomery G&L Saxophone Bass clarinet Microeconomics Betting (poker) Bill Wyman Tuning Adam Jones Poker jargon Fingerboard Contract bridge Alembic Inc Viol Green Day Bitches Brew Chick Corea Musical tuning Grateful Dead Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pedal steel guitar Telephone numbering plan Les Claypool Modem The Beatles' influence Piano Epiphone Autograph Lap steel guitar Blues Brian Jones (musician) Acoustic guitar Clarinet Handloading Bridge (stringed instrument) Resonance Harmonica Operational amplifier Just intonation John Frusciante Dixieland Bluegrass music Truss bridge

what's punk rock song by bad religion about i do not understand it i want to know what the line written for the people who can see something's wrong like ants in a colony we do our share but there's so many other fuckin' insects out there and this is just a punk rock song including with the chorus comes like workers in a factory we do our share but there's so many other f ckin' robots out there my guess is that we are like clones doing things people want us to do but even if we can complete conformity there are still other insects like bees and such that would do the same thing and that the whole world has everyone working as a factory for society the whole song's about rebelling against conformity and trying to understand our problems instead of following whatever everyone else is doing  Punk ideology Insect The Wall Hardcore punk Bee The Used Honeybee Eusociality Ant ISO 9000 Theory of conduct Song Value system Bad Religion American Pie (song) Siouxsie & the Banshees Brave New World Jon Secada Diseases of the honeybee Africanized bee Goodness and value theory Adam Ant H__sker D__ Karl Marx Bad Brains The Clash Anarchism and society Death By Stereo Grunge music The Who Bee learning and communication Refused Sex Rich Mullins Selling out Bee Gees The Wildhearts Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Standing on the Shoulder of Giants Punk rock Sex Pistols Religious Society of Friends Music genre R.E.M.

harder better faster stronger remix theres quite a few different remixes for this song but im looking for one that i heard a while back im not sure how old it is but its pretty much exactly the same as the original version but theres an added breakdown towards the middle with this really evil sounding synth bass pounding along with the beat and the lyrics are cut out does this sound familiar to anyone and do you know what the remix is called or who made it thanks that sounds like a live mix if it was just an added bass riff then it yeah that makes sense the only one i know that makes sense for that description is the jess crabbe remix found on daft club  House music Remix Trance music Music genre Sampling (music) The Emancipation of Mimi Led Zeppelin Pump It Up Drum and bass Shine On You Crazy Diamond 2Step Whip It Eurythmics Daft Punk Hip hop collaborations New Order Propellerheads The Chemical Brothers Time Out of Mind Honey (Mariah Carey song) Thank God I Found You Girls Aloud Jethro Tull (band) Freestyle music Queen (band) Kraftwerk Unreleased Madonna songs Placebo (band) Disco Hip hop music Nine Inch Nails Skinny Puppy Pet Sounds Missy Elliott Napalm Death Tommy My All Disc jockey The Waterboys Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song) Funk Buck Fever Nu metal Empire Burlesque KMFDM Everything Counts Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me) Raw Power The Fall (band) Anytime You Need a Friend Metalcore We Belong Together Aphex Twin Death metal The Long and Winding Road Bass guitar Emotions (Mariah Carey song) The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Van Halen Crazy in Love Rock (music) Bouncy techno Nirvana (band) Vocoder Tangerine Dream Loverboy (Mariah Carey song) Black Sabbath The Marshall Mathers LP Rush (band) Hole (band) Boards of Canada Grateful Dead Red Hot Chili Peppers Music of Jamaica Bohemian Rhapsody RZA Electronic music Roxette Joy Division (band) Blink-182 There's Got to Be a Way Fear Factory The Art of Noise Velvet Acid Christ The Beatles discography Manic Street Preachers In The Groove (game) Dreamlover Please Please Me Sound effect The Beatles A Day in the Life Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme) Focus (album) Oh Mercy Timbaland Quarashi The Who Through the Rain Def Leppard

you have the power to change rock history but you can only choose one of the following elvis or the beatles choose only one way it which the history of rock n roll would be different the beatles never broke up and none of them died in they just released their th album and are preparing for a massive world tour or elvis never died he lost weight got in great shape again and still makes movies and albums to this day i would love to have heard a s version of the beatles and see if they developed and changed the way the rolling stones did in that era at the same time i think elvis could have continued to do great work his best stuff was his later stuff in my opinion i would love to have heard him work with other great rock and country musicians the beatles they were the most influential band of the th century changing the face of music they also changed their style as they went along i would be really interested in whether they would have continued to put out progressive music  Rock and roll American rock The Beatles' influence Cover version Rock (music) Please Please Me The Beatles History of the Beatles The Waterboys Buddy Holly Roy Orbison Led Zeppelin Music genre Paul McCartney Queen (band) Timeline of trends in music (1960-1969) Billboard Hot 100 The Beach Boys Elvis Costello I Want to Hold Your Hand Heavy metal music Britpop King Crimson Music video American Pie (song) Classic rock Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) The Band Bee Gees Beatles for Sale Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Paul Is Dead British rock Tribute band Electric Light Orchestra Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1930-1970) Albums that have been considered the greatest ever Sgt.

can i replace hard guitar chords with easier ones i have a book that has some rareish guitar chords and i heard that you can take a chord like cmaj and just play like a c chord or something and it will sound so similar it doesn't really matter is this true and does anyone know of a site or something where i could find common replacements for difficult chords this is basically true however the song may not sound quite perfect because sometimes a note from the vocal melody is represented in the chord and is the reason for the artist's chord choice being precisely what it is for example your cmaj has a 'd' note in it the th and perhaps that is an important note to make it sound just right the trick to substituting extended chords like ths ths ths etc with simpler ones is to know the chord's basic triad component by that i refer to the root rd and th of the chord and whether the triad that they form is minor major diminished or augmented and if it's appropriate to make the chord a th you'll need to know if it's a major or minor seventh note that's needed and so you can never quite get away without knowing some harmony facts it's not that difficult the cmaj chord you cite is a cmaj chord with an added th or made even simpler its base triad is a c major chord with each simplification you remove an element of the harmony and while it will sound ok because the notes you're playing are in the full chord it will not sound as good as it could if you'd just learn the full chord some common chord families are shown below using c major cmaj cmaj cmaj cmaj cadd cadd minor cm cm cm cm cm cm dominant cmaj c c c c diminished cdim cdim a k a cm b augmented caug a k a c c c suspended chords are neither major nor minor because they have no rd which defines major minor csus c sus csus  Tonality Seventh chord Chord symbol Interval (music) Harmonica Musical mode Diatonic functionality Blues Consonance and dissonance Modulation (music) Music genre Key (music) A Hard Day's Night (song) Tritone Counterpoint Power chord Trance music Chord progression Accordion Jazz Serialism Classical music era Violin Meantone temperament Bass guitar Barbershop music Bebop Neo-classical metal Mathematics of musical scales Music Time Out of Mind Vowel Diminished scale Klezmer Heavy metal music Just intonation Modal jazz Baroque music Hangul Sonata (music) Figured bass Blood on the Tracks 10cc XML Ear training Wolf interval Sonata form Trey Anastasio Big band Bohemian Rhapsody Romantic music Circle of fifths Contract bridge Perfect fifth Music theory Central processing unit Sacred Harp Esperanto as an international language Guitar Symmetry Steely Dan Level (music) Electronic organ Songwriter Video game music Eddie Van Halen Gothic rock March (music) Freestyle music Visual Basic Greek language Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Picardy third Twelve-tone technique History of sonata form Herbie Hancock Microeconomics Mouse (computing) Twelve string guitar Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven) Hip hop culture IP (complexity) Metal music Pump It Up Optigan

i need to make a long that is less than minutes long i write my own music i write progressive metal but i try to branch out to other types of music every time i write a song on guitar pro i check the midi to see how long the song i have so far is which at that stage isn't really a song but a mixture of riffs and with about done i've got over minutes of music therefore every time i'm completely done with a song it is up to minutes max but average around minutes i play in a band and write all of the music and with the songs i have fully completed none of them are under minutes i atleast want to make one any tips from fellow song writers yes in essence i'm trying to make a short song that is about minutes no other song writers have gone through this it sounds like you are putting too much into a song the short formula holds listener interest primarily on the radio but also in a live band like the one person said use a simple standard formula to make it shorter if you are putting a bunch of different riffs into songs then maybe you can simplify them that way also then you have more riffs to make more than songs a lot of people think that making longer songs makes them more of an artist less commercial maybe i find my art of any type is better when i put limits on it forces me to make each smaller part more perfect  Heavy metal music Progressive rock Music genre Judas Priest Songwriter Sampling (music) Video game music Rush (band) Nu metal Umphrey's McGee Grunge music Boards of Canada Time Out of Mind Multitrack recording Red Hot Chili Peppers Jethro Tull (band) Peter Gabriel (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Funk Synthesizer Thrash metal Metal music Pantera Led Zeppelin Harmonica Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Quarashi The Wildhearts Pump It Up Disco Rock (music) The Who Doom metal Popular music Tool (band) Pain of Salvation Joy Division (band) Music history of the United States (1980s to the present) Therion (band) Iggy Pop MTV2 Collective Soul Shine On You Crazy Diamond Bluegrass music Roxette Riff Van Halen Musical Instrument Digital Interface Black Sabbath Guitar solo Louie, Louie Beastie Boys Queen (band) Bitches Brew Double bass John Frusciante The Smiths Bon Jovi Jazz Gothic metal Adore Extended play Genesis (band) March (music) Rhythm guitar Hall & Oates Blonde on Blonde Burzum Opeth Sly & the Family Stone Frank Zappa Slide guitar Metallica Art rock Morse Code Planet Waves Indie rock Brian Jones (musician) Leaf Daryl Hall Clarinet Bohemian Rhapsody Bass guitar Bruce Dickinson Fear Factory Hey Jude Ride (band) Oasis (band) Extreme music Dream Theater Britpop KMFDM King Crimson Overkill (band) DrumMania The Beatles The Beatles' influence The Allman Brothers Band Trombone Music of Louisiana

guitar help there is an yr old i know who plays left handed with a right hand guitar although she is right handed is this a major problem jimi took a regular rh guitar and turned it over stringing it lh he couldn't at the time find a lh guitar his big e string was still on the top like most people play mark knoffler of dire straits is lh but plays a normal rh guitar what this does for him is put his dominant hand on the fret board which makes total sense to me since there are more things to do there more notes to hit and more things to do with those notes i think what your friend is doing makes total sense particularly with what knoffler does also if the big strings are on the bottom she then has more power with her fingers to press the strings that will help by not making her spend too much time re interpreting chord diagrams also when she wants to test out a guitar later deciding if she wants to buy it it will already be set up right for her i kind of wish i had started learning that way but i am not going back to ground zero but the advantage knoffler had there is your right hand is more suited for doing rhythm since it is controlled by your left and more analytical brain as i understand the reason for how guitars are normally played if it works for your friend that is great i have often wondered  Tablature Double bass Blood on the Tracks Violin Guitar Bass guitar Pedal steel guitar Slide guitar Jimi Hendrix Fret Mandolin Twelve string guitar Stevie Ray Vaughan Poker jargon Banjo Black Sabbath Musical notation Harmonica Time Out of Mind 1957 World Series Cello Stanley Jordan Fender Telecaster A Hard Day's Night (song) Electric guitar Sitar Blur Oasis (band) Tapping The Shadows Lap steel guitar Shaggy dog story Brian Jones (musician) The Yardbirds Rock (music) Chapman Stick Slow Train Coming Goldberg Variations Acoustic guitar Guqin Jethro Tull (band) Douglas Adams Eric Clapton String theory Dire Straits Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Classical music era Phil Collins Blonde on Blonde I Want to Hold Your Hand Clarinet Sonata (music) Normal distribution Piccolo Junior Saga Another Side of Bob Dylan Cheating in poker Professional wrestling attacks Badminton Django Reinhardt Rhythm guitar Power chord Philosophy of language Slapping She Loves You Tony Iommi Mouse (computing) Fischer Random Chess Guitar/synthesizer Shen Gong Wu Floyd Rose Salad Fingers Year of the Spider Self Portrait Roxette Formal grammar Therion (band) The Beatles 2005 English cricket season Nine Inch Nails Eddie Van Halen Tonality Archery Love and Theft Rules of Go Music of Ireland Chord (music) Musical mode The Time Machine Skateboarding trick Jazz Hurdy gurdy Please Please Me Red Hot Chili Peppers The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sampling (music) The Kinks PRS Guitars

about the video never too late by three days grace does anyone understand what its trying to say like the moral of the vid usually i understand the music videos but just not this one lol help anyone i'm not sure about the moral but to me the girl got molested by the guy in the sweater why not because i'm thinking wrongly but i guess when he touches her you get the idea that the touching was probably a bad thing if she had to go to the hospital for it in the future the parents had stuff over their eyes probably to show that they couldn't see the truth behind the girl's relationship with the guy in the sweater the girl grows up to be crazy and in a hospital and you see a clip where she's being held down by the sweater guy's hands another clip is when you see black handprints everywhere invasion of privacy and loss for self control then you see a black winged angel come along and i realize that angels have white wings but i guess coming from a rock band they wanted black so black it is and fight this guy off when no one else would maybe he was like the girl's guardian angel the girl remembers this and suddenly she's at peace which would be my interpretation but i mean if the girl was never molested in the first place then i'm completely wrong  Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Doors About a Boy Blood on the Tracks Weezer Music video Angel Journey (band) Scenes from a Memory Earth Girl Arjuna Free will Humphrey Bogart Hey Jude Gwen Stefani Child sexuality The Human Stain Limp Bizkit Family Guy Homestar Runner Douglas Adams Sin Hardcore punk Cary Grant End times Buddy Guy Shaggy dog story The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Inside Lana Turner One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Street-Legal Stone Temple Pilots Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban KUKL T.A.T.u.

please explain guitar learning help how do you know how many times to strum each chord and what rythme to use i can play and switch the chords fine i just dont know how many ttimes and when to strum each chord any advice find the meter in the song you're trying to learn if it's then listen for the strong beat and if you hear a total of beats per measure then you can break down the rythm by process of elimination if it's not heard right away in for example you could have quarter notes to equal a measure or eighth notes or sixteenth notes per measure and just know that you can combine all of these as long as it equals beats per measure also there are dotted notes which represent that note plus half of that note and watch out for rests make sure the note is sustained and if not then there is a rest which represents a note value good luck  Musical notation Musical terminology Chord (music) Time signature March (music) Tonality Blues Notes in__gales Musical mode Time Out of Mind Trance music Sampling (music) Olivier Messiaen Interval (music) Violin Rhythm Harmonica Music theory Guqin Trey Anastasio Video game music Hey Jude Bass guitar Authentic performance Banjo Echoes (1971 song) Metre (music) Double bass Twelve string guitar Shine On You Crazy Diamond Musical analysis Jazz Mouse (computing) Consonance and dissonance Music genre Power chord Royal Assent A Day in the Life Arab music Audiophile I Want to Hold Your Hand Music Electronic organ Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Trigonometric function Accordion United States dollar Hearing impairment Ear training Equal temperament Songwriter Eddie Van Halen Mandolin Tristan chord Consensus decision-making A Hard Day's Night (song) Guitar Counterpoint Bluegrass music Goldberg Variations Quarashi Bossa nova Poker jargon Electric guitar Slide guitar Big band Pop punk Electronic countermeasures Focus (album) Timpani Key (music) Mass Opportunity rover 10cc Hipparchus (astronomer) Acoustic guitar Blood on the Tracks Brian Jones (musician) Explosive material Herbie Hancock Freestyle music (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Beat (music) Inversion (music) Slapping A Tonic For The Troops Stanley Jordan SAT Layla Optigan United States Senate Modulation (music) Lebesgue integration Diatonic functionality Tempo Finale notation program

what musical styles that we still have today origininated from the medieval and renaissance period thank you very much lol i meant originated what i really want to know is would a cappella be an acceptable answer i read it had its roots in gregorian chanting this has got to be a homework question right i guess medieval music saw the introduction of polyphony several voices overlayed singing harmonic tunes maybe with a drone in the background lots of devotional songs about god lots of story songs about winning battles with gods help lots of songs about my lady's beauty and lots of christmas carols much of the written music was created by monks and nuns like hildegarde von bingen a lot of the non religious music secular was not written down so it's difficult to assess its influence it was passed on orally and originated spontaneously as a reaction to events sometimes under the influence of ale if i had to pick something i'd say christmas carols choral and folk music renaissance music saw the introduction of more instrumentation like viols and lutes orchestral music and towards the end early operas see monteverdi who verged on the baroque a lot of music was written to amuse the court solo or a small group of singers with a lute singing secular music about love disdained love consummated beauty and death this sort of music and lyric translates easily into modern lovelorn ballads and even folk music try looking at people like thomas campion and john dowland admittedly at the latter end of the renaissance but stylistically belonging you could easily write an entire thesis on this as a lot of people have already i hope it gets you off to a start c  Choir Medieval music Renaissance music Lute Baroque music History of music Figured bass Song Folk music Music genre Orlande de Lassus Timeline of trends in music to 1799 Music of the United States Music history of the United States during the colonial era Johann Sebastian Bach Opera Authentic performance Music of China Gregorian chant Hildegard of Bingen A cappella Claudio Monteverdi Giulio Caccini Motet Viol Music of Japan Music of Iran Trombone Music of England European classical music Metrical psalter Music history of France Music of Spain Music of Germany Music of Albania Blues Native American music Guillaume Dufay Music of Italy Music of Greece Gospel music Musical notation Christmas carol Igor Stravinsky Sacred Harp Mass (music) Benjamin Britten Music of Brittany High Middle Ages Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity John Dowland Jazz Ballad Tonality Classical music era Violin American popular music Roots revival Music of Hungary Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias Italian Renaissance Music of France Philip Glass Psalms Music of Scotland Music of Nigeria Medieval literature Medieval poetry Music history of the United States Baroque Claudin de Sermisy Anglo-Saxon literature Fugue Heinrich Sch__tz Country music Old-time music Hymn Madrigal (music) Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) Music of Croatia Bohemian Rhapsody Mandolin Jewish music Monody Double bass Christian music Music history of the United States (1940s and 50s) Leonard Cohen Guitar Henry Purcell The Velvet Underground Hurdy gurdy Gramophone Awards Renaissance

what's your favourite neil young song i can't really decide it might be 'don't let it bring you down' or 'broken arrow' or 'only love can break your heart' there's one thing that neil young does better than almost any songwriter alive bittersweet just that voice a guitar and his idiosyncratic lyrics can create a unique mood as seen on songs like the needle and the damage done birds very underrated song one of the best break up songs ever recorded in my opinion tired eyes helpless expecting to fly harvest some of his real classics are better live powderfinger from live rust messy but still incredible version harvest moon from unplugged overall a poor album but this was a highlight  Neil Young Powderfinger Rod Stewart Queen (band) 10cc Bon Jovi Crazy Horse (band) Bee Gees Bryan Adams Roxette R.E.M.

attention people who have given into band fan clubs i know the whole concept of fan clubs for bands is a bit lame especially how nowa days you have to pay for a year's membership etc but some of my favorite bands save the sellout speech thanks have them and they offer oppurtunities for meet and greets i was thinking of paying the for the boys like girls' heroes heroines club only because of the meet and greet chance is this a good idea do you think i'd actually get the oppurtunity to meet the band or what psh meet greet honey you shouldn't have to pay money for something that you could make happen yourself with enough persistence you can meet any band and it's a bit cooler if its not one of those busy meet greets but of course if you really really are fond of the band go for it  Therion (band) Selling out Queen (band) Miss Saigon Kurt Cobain A-ha Brian Jones (musician) The Beatles ABBA Hardcore punk The Beach Boys Yoko Ono Legion of Super-Heroes The Libertines Good Charlotte Theory of conduct Red Hot Chili Peppers Duran Duran The Chemical Brothers Scouting John Frusciante Butters Stotch Jim Morrison Anime Milton H.

in afi's hit song love like winter i have asked many many different people this question and every one of them has been as confused as i am about the answer maybe you have an idea in the chorus of the song davey sings i met my love before i was born he wanted love i taste of blood he bit my lip he sings the chorus three times in the song and although in the second of the three he uses the word she instead of he the first and last are sung with the word he they aren't gay so why would he sing about his first love being a man and having him bit his lip dont try to tell me that he is singing that line on behalf of the females listening to the song because we all know that rockstars dont pretend they are a girl singing about their male lover wow i cant believe that of you so far are sitting there trying to explain it with hes gay davey havok is not gay nor is he bi sexual and any internet site that you mave have read this rumor is simply a rumor he has never said this not in an interview not on stage not in a book not in a magazine not on a website he's not gay and neither is the rest of the band please try to come up with a better guess than that in the website songmeanings net someboy posted his theory and by the site it's the most accurate one so far first verse is told from the girl's pov she is telling this guy who is in love with her that he should stay even though she is not available all the winter references you know emptiness blah blah because she's dating someone else but in the first chorus she says that it's something inevitable that they'll be together it's in the blood i met my love before i was born second verse is this guy's pov 'i barely dreamt her yesterday' i'm supposing refers to the surrealness that this person just pops into your life and you are so in love with them note that he refers to himself as 'i me ' etc but then there's a 'his ' ''she said it seems you're somewhere far away' to his face' means that she's speaking to someone else and i think that someone else is the other guy she's seeing basically she leaves him  Avenue Q Little Britain AFI (band) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
