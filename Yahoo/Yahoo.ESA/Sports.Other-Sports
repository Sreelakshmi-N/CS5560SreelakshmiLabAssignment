aggressive inline skating skate size help i just started getting into aggressive inline skating but i'm not sure what size skate i need im a size in shoes so i don't know if the sizes run different like if i would need a bigger or smaller size there are no shops around me so i'm pretty much forced to buy them online thanks alot nick unfortunately every skate fits different the good news is that if you call most any online skate shop they'll be able to tell you how the sizing of a particular skate runs in fact on aggressivemall com's website they indicate right on the skates page how the sizing runs true to shoe size narrow small etc i've included a link to their site below for you to check out some skates like remz have very thick liners and padding so though they may fit tight at first they will actually form to your feet over time somewhat like a snowboard or ski boot others don't have much in the way of padding so how they fit when you first try them on will be how they fit for the long run and if worse comes to worse most places are good about exchanging skates for the right size best of luck in your search  Roller skating Shoe Inline skates Roller hockey Snowboarding Snowboard Boot Inline speed skating Aggressive skating Figure skating Triathlon Winter Olympic Games Cross-country skiing Artistic roller skating Ski Ice skating Quicksort Compulsory figures Speed skating HTML element Michelle Kwan Inline expansion Winter Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Ice hockey Craps Neopets Poker jargon Skiing Floppy disk File Allocation Table Footwear Knife Horseshoe Skate punk Sin City Paper size Yosemite National Park Skateboarding C programming language Bicycle brake systems Cascading Style Sheets Rink hockey Wakeboarding 2000 Australian Grand Prix USS Tunny (SS-282) Betting (poker) 2010 Winter Olympics Undergarment Upholstery Wood Stairway Computer virus Straight-4 Skinhead Paintball Legal research Heinkel He 100 Kandersteg International Scout Centre Bicycle helmet Punk fashion Badminton Hamster Rocket Power P-38 Lightning Nottingham Sock Kimi Finster Tonya Harding CPU cache "Weird Al" Yankovic Roller derby Compiler optimization Inspector Gadget Rugby union positions Tesco 2006 Winter Olympics Short track speed skating Brassiere Mach kernel High-heeled shoe Website Amazon.com IBM PC compatible Grand Forks, North Dakota Toyota Camry Fast bowling Mattress Auto-free zone Axel jump Second Battle of the Atlantic Climbing equipment Gramophone record X Games Sport Internet fraud Audio tape length and thickness Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

i dont know if i should play football this season girls question for you too ok i really dont know if i want to play football im not sure i dont want to go to the pratices and sometimes i dont even know what they are doing half the times on the plays i never get them down the only reasons i want to play is because ill miss going into prep rallys wiht the football teams and jv teams dont play on friday nights we play on mondays when nobody is there also we do go to friday nights games we just stand there on the bench to make the varisity team look bigger and everyone is friday games and the girls i liked i told them that i played football and now if they dont see me with the uniform this girl idk what they will think of me im so indesicive and im really going to miss the events and all that but at the same time i dont want to go to pratcies everyday and saturdays i got so many other things i can do instead of playing it my heart is really not into the game i dont know what to do please any advice also if you girls like a guy would u stop talking ot him because he doesnt play football also does it matter what sport the guy you like plays too you what sport do u girls like best for guys in your school football or high school wrestling i think that you just answered your own question when you indicated that your heart is not in to it it seems that the only reason that you are staying with the sport is simply for the parties ya sure it's great to be part of the center of attention but if all you are is a bench warmer and you're not in to it then give it up let someone else who really loves the game and who really wants to play your playing time i'm kinda in the same boat as you are the only difference is that i play on a womens professional team and i love the game problem is that i can hold my own on the field but i don't get that much playing time it's the off season for us and i'm debating on if i should play next season or 'hang up my cleates' i love the game i'm just not being played and to just ride the bench is not worth it to me so i have just as much soul searching to do as you do good luck  National Football League Football (soccer) American football Cincinnati Bengals Major League Baseball television contracts Atomic Kitten New York Giants Baseball Sport Lynbrook High School Bowl Championship Series Canadian football Al Michaels Cleveland Browns 1957 World Series Babe Ruth New York Jets Canadian Football League Clemson University College football Quizbowl 2005 NFL season National Football League Lore Rugby union Sydney Riot of 1879 Brett Favre Rugby football Jennifer Lopez Playoff St. Louis Cardinals Comparison of Canadian and American football Carolina Panthers World Football League New York Knicks American Football League Torquay United F.C.

should steroid use be legal one of the greatest and worst moments in canadian sport was in seoul south korea in when ben johnson blew away carl lewis and the rest of the field to run an amazing in the m for days the entire country was on an amazing high until news of the positive test hit us with so much money involved in pro sport and size strength and speed playing such a key role in how well one performs why not just legalize and let those who wish to take the risk take it i think that users are much more educated now about what harm is being done to their bodies and the risk of being significantly harmed is lowered greatly with education i can't think of a better way to completely and utterly rape the game when it comes to sports we shouldn't be so eager to evolve the game if we are to fully appreciate it before you know it everyone will be using steroids and it will become a necessity if you are to win and compete with the rest of the crowd then there are those fans who see it as a 'cheat code' for sports for example the whole bonds thing now with steroid allegations rampant in the media and amongst fans and non fans alike not many people are excited for his record breaking homeruns infact many like me are happy that it's out and done with if it was someone who i was confident wasn't on steroids then i would actually be happy about it instead of indifferent the only thing i can say i'm happy about now is that with bonds breaking the record finally baseball is no longer taken hostage and we can move on to bigger and better sports news but i digress i'd much rather see a highschooler go to college get recruited learn all the proper skills and be a motivated player than some dullard who's looking for an easy way to get recruited finally it will only be beneficial while people still dont take roids but as everyone starts to get encouraged to so they can keep up it will be balanced again and completely unnecessary just my take on it though  Barry Bonds Ben Johnson (athlete) Major League Baseball Babe Ruth Professional wrestling slang Baseball History of baseball in the United States American football Australian rules football Weight training Cincinnati Bengals 1957 World Series Boston Red Sox Jos__ Canseco Olympic Games Summer Olympic Games Volleyball Andr__s Galarraga Toronto Blue Jays Los Angeles Dodgers Home run English cricket team 2000 Summer Olympics New York Yankees Microeconomics Plame affair Ty Cobb Norway national football team Lou Gehrig Baltimore Orioles Gary Sheffield Queen (band) Chicago White Sox Extreme Programming Sumo Illegal drug trade MMORPG Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Tour de France Hulk Hogan GoldenEye 007 Hikaru no Go America's Cup Toronto Raptors Sandy Koufax Tennis Golf The Ashes Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cricket Counter-Strike Seventh Sea (collectible card game) St. Louis Cardinals ESPN25 Badminton Competition History of rugby league Affirmative action Carolina Panthers Michael Jordan StarCraft 24 Hours of Le Mans Troy Glaus Rugby union Free trade Ted Williams Satchel Paige Anabolic steroid San Francisco 49ers Seattle Mariners Marching band Tris Speaker Kansas City Chiefs Sports timeline Brian Close Vince McMahon Fanny Blankers-Koen New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Asian financial crisis Miguel Tejada NBA Finals Confidence trick Dog agility Jason Giambi Mike Tyson

why is there no playoffs system for college football like they have in college basketball but college basketball seedings rankings are kinda weird too with the ncaa tournament considered the strength of schedule or whatever why can't both of these sports especially college football have a normal playoff system the official line from the ncaa is that the kids would miss too much class time but we all know that is bogus since every other level of football has a playoff system and those kids actually have to go to class since they are not there on academic scholarship the real answer to your question is they don't have a d i playoff because too much money is divvied out via the bowl system that nobody wants to change the lesser teams get a bowl payout and would miss out on that if they went to a team playoff format  Playoff Playoff format National Football League Atlantic Coast Conference Ivy League University of Houston Bowl Championship Series World Football League College basketball National Collegiate Athletic Association Quizbowl Baylor University West Virginia University Joe Paterno National Basketball Association Georgia Institute of Technology Division I NFL playoffs Sudden death NCAA Division I-A national football champions Michigan State University Tulane University University of Maryland, College Park Boston College Athletics University of Central Florida Basketball University of Michigan Western Kentucky University Syracuse University Orange American football University of Denver Duke University North Carolina State University American Football League Single-elimination tournament Virginia Commonwealth University NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Purdue University University of Texas at El Paso Middle Tennessee State University National Hockey League University of California, Los Angeles March 2005 in sports Auburn University New York Giants National Football League Lore University of Connecticut NCAA Philippines Basketball Championship Williams College Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women Boise State University Washington State University Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Football (soccer) Florida State University The Catholic University of America EA Sports University of Virginia Sports betting University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Jerry Lucas Chinese Basketball Association University of Tennessee Comparison of Canadian and American football University of Texas at Austin New Mexico Lobo Basketball San Diego State University Stanford University Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXV University of South Carolina Clemson University Michael Jordan Columbia University University of Arkansas Oklahoma State University - Stillwater University of Kentucky Lebanon Valley College Carolina Panthers Pennsylvania State University University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Nevada, Las Vegas Utah State University University of Florida University of Washington New York Knicks Oklahoma Sooners Canadian Interuniversity Sport Tim Floyd Tournament Luther Head

why don't left handed hitters bunt or slap the ball near the rd base side when a shift is placed on them i see shifts being put on bonds big papi and hafner i know that a lot of times they have success hitting the ball up the middle or pull the middle and try to middle the ball on the bat but during critical junctures of the games why won't these guys bunt near the rd base line or slap the shot near the rd base this could disrupt the defense and runners on base could move up the hitter could get on base and maybe an error might be commited are they not skilled enough and can't handle the bat to hit the ball the other way in the infield or what pitchers are pitching them away so why won't these guys do it i mean look at hafner his team could be running away with first place in the al central if theywon more close games if he could come thru and play smart like that when a shift is placed on him in critical close games he's having a bad year not hitting for power or average why can't he do this and contribute to his team why can't lefties like him and others do that i think that's one of the subtleties of the game if lefties were able to do that that would cause the fielding side to make another adjustment but you have to take whatever is your best chance of getting a hit if you're currently not good enough to hit the other way for whatever reason grip stance etc then maybe the best chance of getting a hit is to keep on pull hitting even when the shift is on other possibility is that while it definitely seems like something that a good hitter would do if you're a power hitter and the team's best chance of getting runs is off your bat i'm not sure poking it down the line for a single and leaving the hitting to one of your less able teammates is necessarily the way to go  1957 World Series Softball Babe Ruth Baseball scorekeeping Fast bowling Tris Speaker Home run Robin Ventura Batting average Bunt Ty Cobb Pete Rose 2005 World Series Andr__s Galarraga 2004 World Series Hank Aaron Manny Ram__rez Fielding (cricket) Baseball Stars World Series First baseman Boston Red Sox Box score (baseball) St. Louis Cardinals Batting (cricket) Cricket Satchel Paige Sandy Koufax Chicago White Sox Toronto Blue Jays Los Angeles Dodgers Laws of cricket Baseball positions 1986 World Series Ted Williams BASEketball Interference (baseball) Mike Scioscia Barry Bonds 2004 American League Championship Series Table tennis English cricket team Designated hitter 1986 National League Championship Series Hal Trosky Stolen base Baserunning San Francisco Giants Pittsburgh Pirates New York Yankees David Ortiz Gary Sheffield Sammy Sosa Ravi Shastri Out (baseball) Luke Appling Chicago Cubs No-hitter Water polo Reggie Jackson Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pedro Mart__nez Shoeless Joe Jackson Pitcher Snooker Babe Ruth's Called Shot Lou Gehrig Bert Campaneris Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 October 9 in baseball American football Seattle Mariners Moe Berg Tag Leg before wicket Batting order (baseball) Marius Russo October 20 in baseball Earned run average Rugby union positions Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers Ichiro Suzuki Mike Schmidt October 10 in baseball Shortstop Cincinnati Reds New York Mets Casey Stengel

question regarding a smart parts epiphany read description ok so i'm interested in getting a smart parts epiphany and before i by it i want to make sure i get a bang for my buck and not some piece of trash so what im looking for is someone who can relate to the gun by either owning it or working with them on a regular basis i want your feedback so i can make the best possible purchase if you dont have any clue what your talking about dont bother posting anything the smart parts epiphany marker is basically an upgraded version of the sp ion marker and shares looks and many part with the ion i have shot a few epiphanies and they are out of the box better than the ion out of the box but you do pay a good bit more for them the trigger is not nearly as good as many of the after market triggers that are made for the ion and the body looks tacky to me now when i first saw it i thought that it looked pretty cool but that wore off it's barrel system is way better than the stock ion and the reg isn't the same as the ion's reg i am pretty sure about this but i know wome people will swear that it is the same either way it doesn't matter cause the stock ion reg isn't as bad as most people say it is i would say that if you just want to buy something and leave it the way you bought it the epiphany is a pretty good choice i would chose the invert mini cause it is better and around the same price range or i would look at the proto matrix rail pmr is what it is commonly referred to around most places and i don't know as much about this gun and it may be a fair bit higher but i liked the one that a guy at the field let me use a little on the target range if you want a gun that you can keep tinkering with i would get the ion and purchase a trigger and some sort of drop along with a barrel and a qev helps with efficiency and then go online to a forum like pbnation com and look at some of the other thing that are available also there are very many body kits available for the ion and if you really don't like the looks of it there is everything from different colored sp style ones to milsim style bodies to crazy custom anodized milled aluminum ones and they come on every budget line too i will say this as well if you don't like the feel of the gun don't get it you probably wont like it any more if your in a uncomfortable position with more weight on the marker get the most comfortable marker you can find and if it doesn't perform they way you want there are always lots of things you can to that will improve any mid level marker's performance but there isn't a whole lot to fix discomfort  Paintball marker Theory of conduct M60 machine gun Paintball Economics Microeconomics Airsoft Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Extreme Programming Social rule Equine conformation Surveillance Monopoly (game) The Amazing Race Plastic Blood (computer game) Supply and demand Neopets Singlish Beretta 92F/FS Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Toyota Prius Mattress Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Firearm Humphrey Bogart Mac OS X Advanced Squad Leader Drill bit Corporate governance Heckler & Koch G3 GunBound Bass guitar RuneScape High-voltage direct current Short selling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pump It Up PE ratio Atari 8-bit family Publicly funded medicine Shit Internet fraud Floppy disk Computer role-playing game Apple Macintosh Capitalism RuneScape economy Xbox 360 Nuclear weapon design Nintendo Carbine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ford Motor Company Team Fortress Classic M82 (rifle) M240 Public Eye Kodocha Porsche 993 Internal ballistics United States Postal Service Keynesian economics RuneScape quests BZFlag Shotgun Diode Ion Particle accelerator Mutual fund MAME Opera (web browser) Gross domestic product Gas metal arc welding IBM PC compatible Passenger car Hiberno-English Carburetor Motion capture System/36 Rifle The Apprentice 2 Supply-side economics Milton H.

flipping ledges and stairs and stuff i can do flip trix pretty well but what i really struggle on is flipping down high ledges and stairs it either over rotates or underrotates any help the key trick is to learn how to catch the board in air with your feet and to always watch the flip on the deck to know when to stop the rotation and catch it and you really need to be consitant with tricks to throw them down stairs so if you can land a tre flip on flat out of times it will normaly take to throw them down a good set of stairs becouse of the hight drop and the fact your nervouse and throw your board most of the time when you could have landed it already  Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding Poker jargon Suplex Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling throws The McGuire Sisters Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Coin flipping Dial M for Murder Windsurfing Figure skating Shaggy dog story USS Wake Island (CVE-65) Kitesurfing Fast bowling Glossary of climbing terms Contract bridge Snowboarding Professional wrestling attacks Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Boomerang Mattress Laserdisc Flip jump Diving Gambler's fallacy Whitewater American football Battlebots Glossary of American football Worms weapons and tools Hot air balloon Botch (professional wrestling) Water polo Dice Four square Guilty Gear Halo: Combat Evolved IP (complexity) Stairway Hearts (game) Toe loop jump Skat Charles Whitman Floppy disk Shen Gong Wu Baseball Stereoscopy Slide Mountain (New York) GunZ The Duel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Parkour G-Man (Half-Life) USS Wasp (CV-7) Powerbomb Piledriver (professional wrestling) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters The Star Wars Holiday Special Yohoho!

choosing the right griptape what is the difference between a single sheet and a twenty box of grip tape which is the better buy single sheet is just one sheet of griptape a sheet only big enough for your standard skateboard x roughly a twenty box is a bulk package of griptape either individual single size sheets of griptape or a huge roll that can cover up to decks technically the box will be the better buy because it is in bulk however if you dont plan on going through skateboards in the near future you should just get a single sheet  Skateboard Skateboarding trick Skateboarding Laptop Cascading Style Sheets Cardboard UK Singles Chart Cable television Mattress Public Image Ltd.

what's a good gun for a beginner that's trying to learn to shoot is desert eagle good okay i know nothing about guns and got the name desert eagle from one of my co workers i am planning on going to a shooting range to learn all the basics and everything and i was wondering what's a good first gun to own for a beginner i swear i am not going to rob murder pistolwhip or do anything other than defend myself if need be with the gun so please don't think you are giving answers or advice to a psychopath lol i had no idea where to post this but the sports section came up and i went with it sorry if its' the wrong category that sort of depends on your size and your weight and your physical condition among other things i am ' and weigh around or so and i have been shooting since i was very small and i wouldn't use a desert eagle unless i wanted to defend myself against bears with a semi auto and by the way i have some of the largest mits of anyone i know and the desert eagle fills my hands quite well if you want to only purchase one gun then go to some of the gun stores or even better if there are any ranges that rent firearms near you go to one of them then look at smaller caliber firearms like mm and if you are brave or are able too go shooting with someone you know then you could consider something wit more power like a or but if you don't know stick with the mm it will kill a human at a reasonable range with minimal felt recoil and although it doesn't have the stopping power of the larger commonly used self defense calibers it will hold more rounds there are rare occurrences where people survive multiple shots with the mm the rapper cent being the most notable with shot being taken at close range but the majority of his wounds were sustained to the hand arm and legs with some others hitting the torso and one hitting his left cheek but he doesn't say that he didn't feel anything and i bet that really ruined his day if you are accurate and hit vitals with multiple shots it will put anyone down you need to know what you are going to use the gun for what i mean by this is that you need to know if you will be using with a concealed carry permit or if it will sit in the drawer of your night stand beside your bed you don't really need to worry about weight or size if you don't plan on carrying and you shouldn't carry if your not sure you will shoot when it is necessary also you need to stay familiar with the weapon if you are carrying but that is something you can get into with an instructor if you want to learn to use a handgun as a self defense tool then you should first learn to shoot or at least find an instructor that will be able to help you find something that will work well for you the number one rule in choosing a self defense firearm is that you need to be able to fire it competently and accurately for your own safety and for the safety of those around you other than the assailant in other words it needs to fit you and help you i will tell you that you should stick with the more major brands and they are generally easier to find holsters and accessories for and though they cost more they generally have a proven product and will stand behind their warranty if their product does malfunction for some reason i personally am looking to get the springfield xd due to the way it seems to fit my hand like a glove but the model as well as the browning hi power its mm brother are both good guns i am fond of the glocks are good but seem to keep getting more expensive and the sig p is good along with some of their other offerings i can't shoot the sig p very well do to my hand covering the grip so completely that i depress the magazine release a problem that makes follow up shots difficult i also like the taurus millenium which is offered in mm as well as other calibers and makes a good concealed carry weapon if you have the necessary permit and it is legal where you live but my mother who's hands are quite smaller than my own has the same problem with the magazine release on it although i do not like i said before your weapon needs to work with you otherwise you will not be comfortable and therefore will endanger those around you when you fire  GLOCK Machine gun Terminal ballistics Internal ballistics Semi-automatic self-loading pistol M1911 Ammunition M60 machine gun Stopping power

how do you play fantasy football my friend just asked me to play fanstasy football and i dont care for football i am completely lost when it comes to this what do i do i heard something like a draft please help points for best answer if you don't care for football don't spend too much on the league if you don't care for it at all you may want to turn down your friend you can play a lot of fantasy leagues with minimum effort but most people who play are enthusiasts who love that their fantasy teams force them to watch teams they never cared about before basically each owner in the league takes turns picking players from across the nfl and puts together the best team they can the exact makeup of a team varies from league to league as do the actual rules on scoring but it would be something like qb rb wr te defense and kicker starting each week and your roster will be twice that size each week you play one of the other teams in your fantasy league based on those players' individual performances you will score points exactly how many and for what accomplishments vary from league to league and hopefully score more points than your opponent and win the game since the draft is the most important part of fantasy football you could do all right by grabbing a fantasy magazine and checking the news to read up on the last minute injuries holdouts criminal problems etc once you have drafted the team and know who your best starters are you only need to make adjustments when one of your regular starters has a bye week or gets injured part of the fun of fantasy is checking the free agents trading with other owners and watching the games to see how your guys did but you can get by without making that much effort  National Football League New England Patriots American football Football (soccer) Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills Kansas City Chiefs Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns New York Jets Super Bowl IX Baltimore Ravens American Football League Baseball Chicago Bulls San Francisco 49ers Canadian football Yao Ming Indianapolis Colts Glossary of American football Toronto Raptors Ultimate (sport) Terrell Owens Orlando Magic Miami Dolphins 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XVII New York Knicks Super Bowl XXV Minnesota Vikings Rugby union Ice hockey Los Angeles Clippers Donovan McNabb Arena football Super Bowl XXVI Reserve clause Super Bowl III Toronto Blue Jays NFL Draft Fantasy baseball Detroit Tigers Playoff Rugby league Detroit Red Wings Dan Marino Bundesliga (football) Football Jacksonville Jaguars Canadian Football League Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXXIV New Jersey Nets Super Bowl XIII Paintball The Football League Volleyball Super Bowl XXXVI Minor league baseball Dallas Cowboys Sudden death Chicago White Sox Philadelphia Eagles Softball Super Bowl X National Basketball Association FA Cup Brett Favre Los Angeles Kings 2005 World Series Major League Baseball Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXI National Rugby League Major League Soccer World Football League Damon Allen Alex Ferguson Ra (board game) Gaelic football Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXIV Steve Nash Oakland Athletics

for experienced gymnasts or coaches about a month ago i hurt my hand i went to the doctor they said to lay off it for awhile i start gymnastics team i made it august and i am going to fight the pain if it still hurts by then but what i wanted to know in your opinion do you think tumbling on a floor puts a lot more pressure on your hand than tumbling on a trampoline i know a trampoline is bouncy so when you tumble it isn't as hard but how much more pressure do you think it takes on your hand if you are comparing tamp with floor a lot or a little i am a pretty hard tumbler back handsprings doing tucks and stuff i know this question is a little confusing but if you do understand what i am asking your answer is appreciated thanks i think the floor will hurt a little more but they will both probably hurt a little bit if you start off doing just back tucks and front tucks and aerials then it won't hurt your hand since you are not putting it down try taking like some ibprofen before you go to gymnastics when you tumble your hands shouldn't be on the ground for that long anyway since you are blocking off the floor fast on most things i hope you understand what i mean i hope this helps congrats on making the team good luck have fun and do your best gymgirlexox  Gymnastics Aerial (dance move) Diving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carly Patterson Theory of conduct Cheerleading Trampolining Badminton Milton H.

girls lacrosse team hi i'd like to play lacrosse next year i'm very small which posistion do you think i could do i'm getting in shape i don't have much experience though i have an old stick though i'd love to make the team but what do you do for tryouts thanks don't worry for a second about your size the best player i know who captained a national championship college team and just toured europe with the us lacrosse team is ' she was a defensive star at point in high school and led the offense as an attack wing in college i'm a goalie and i'm ' i know my size intimidates shooters but i have seen many a quick smaller goalie and i have no doubt that their size helps them not just in quickness but in their being underestimated by shooters lacrosse is not really about strength or size it's about skill quickness and positioning our field and our game is so large and long that a few inches in reach will not make a huge difference beyond the middle school level try outs will involve a lot of catching and throwing shuttle passes partner passing you'll do some ground balls probably against two or three people there will probably also be some scrimmaging some opportunities to show you defensive skills your attack skills and your ability to see the field and recognize where you need to be to make an impact i might also expect some sprints and distance running all depending on your age level definitely get in shape try to run with a ball in your stick as often as you can there is a real range in how much the different positions run as a goalie i'm pretty much stationary but i need a lot of strength in my thighs to maintain proper stance and movement the close defense point cover point and third man and close offense first second and third homes always stay back behind the restraining line and don't do all that much running the attack and defense wings and the center are all over the field and need to do a lot of sprinting through the mid field lacrosse is a game of quick transitions across a long field followed by slow pretty stationary play if you can really run you can play absolutely anywhere if you aren't a runner look at the close positions but in the end it's really going to be your coach who places you work on your stick skills try to find a brick wall you can throw a ball against try to get catches in a row to either side high above your shoulder and low around hip level being able to switch hands is critical at the high school varsity level and incredibly valuable at the junior varsity level work on ground balls running at the ball at full speed and while it is rolling away from you make sure you get down low that is what makes the difference you can run into a group of four trying to get the ball and if you get lower than they do it's scrape those knuckles on the ground work on getting some quick feet especially if you are thinking about defense you'll need strong thighs to keep yourself low with legs bent jump rope work on lateral movement getting low and move to your sides don't hop and don't cross your feet i've often heard it said by coaches all the way through the college level that if you can run they can teach you lacrosse get in shape watch as much lacrosse as you can if you can show you are an athlete and that you are coordinated a good coach will snatch you up and teach you everything you need to know with hard work your skills will come  Canadian football Aerial (dance move) Fast bowling American football strategy Rugby union positions Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Fielding (cricket) Ice hockey Batting (cricket) New York Giants Swingout Basketball Badminton Comparison of Canadian and American football Dog agility Rugby union Ultimate (sport) Table tennis Billiards Cincinnati Bengals Rugby league positions Professional wrestling throws Cricket Pittsburgh Steelers Professional wrestling attacks Poker jargon Glossary of ballet terms Marching band San Francisco 49ers Football (soccer) positions National Football League Lore Offensive team Boxing Super Bowl IX Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXV Tag Natural Selection (computer game) Tai Chi Chuan Glossary of partner dance terms Field hockey Super Bowl XXVI Athletics Sport rowing Norway national football team Football (soccer) Team Fortress Classic Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Craps English cricket team Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers 1957 World Series Rugby league Wide receiver Super Bowl XXI Blitzball Super Bowl XXXVI Baseball statistics Super Bowl III Golf Naruto jutsu Paintball Mouse (computing) Laws of cricket Four square Goaltender Quake III Arena Defensive team Super Bowl XVII GunBound Mixed martial arts Tris Speaker Professional wrestling aerial techniques Yao Ming Dodgeball Wing Chun Reggie Jackson Internal ballistics Australian rules football Snooker Parade (military) Weight training Paragliding Suplex

stress out watching sports i stress out a lot when watching tennis or basketball some people do too but is it common and is it also really unhealthy also when the person or team i was rooting for loses i just automatically cry not for long though does that happen to you wow that's deep i definitely think that's not normal to cry and stuff especially if its just a casual game i think its okay to stress out when your watching the world series or somethin like that where you've waited a hundred years for your team to win but they blow it you should just try to relax because its like when i'm tired or want to wind down i watch baseball and that does it for me even if i'm up and out of my seat wondering what the heck my guys are doin its still comforting and relaxing  Playoff Tennis Playoff format Sports timeline Wild card Badminton San Francisco Giants Georgia Institute of Technology Sport World Series Say Somethin' National Basketball Association The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Major League Baseball Philadelphia Phillies Chicago White Sox Urinary incontinence Sandy Koufax New York Yankees Al Michaels Major League Baseball television contracts Drag racing Boston Red Sox Bowl Championship Series 2005 World Series Time Out of Mind Atlanta Braves St. Louis Cardinals Andre Agassi Mario Superstar Baseball ELO rating system Sam Barry Reflexology Norway national football team Cranford, New Jersey Tris Speaker Torquay United F.C.

what sport my daughter is entering th grade this fall and we really want her to pick a sport she is short for her age about ' and is very flexible has been doing gymnastics for three years she is a bit of a scaredy cat about falling which is why we need her to choose another sport besides gymnastics and cannot swim which sport should she choose track soccer softball lacrosse tennis basketball ice skating swimming after learning of course etc we're not sure because she's a bit old to be learning an entirely different sport also she was wondering if joining mathletes would be social suicide she loves math but isn't sure yet if she wants to join now i will be biased because i am a tennis player myself but tennis is a great sport for a rising th grader she gets physical activity along with a bunch of fun it's definitely not too late to start either also her height will not affect her too much you meet bunches of new friends through the sport and you control what you do since it isn't a team sport and the equipment is not nearly as expensive as other sports you can easily get a lesson from a coach and start putting her in tournaments to get the ball rolling it's a very enjoyable sport that a rising th grade girl would appreciate and to add on to this tennis is an all year round sport that she can play anytime even if she wants to mix in other sports so i would give the thumbs up to tennis and to answer your second question mathletes would not be a smart decision if she wants to keep a high social status but it is never bad on a resume to say that you were a part of mathletes on any case you should let it be your daughter's decision on what to do she has a good of feel as anybody as to what to do with her life it's her life and therefore she should have the right to choose what she wants to do  Sport Hunter College High School Education in the United States Syracuse University Orange Hopkins School Lacrosse Softball ELO rating system Physical education Texas Longhorn Athletics United States Air Force Academy Tennis University of Denver Sports in Puerto Rico Football (soccer) Playoff format Table tennis Roger Federer Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Four square Stuyvesant High School Fanny Blankers-Koen Volleyball The George Washington University Norway national football team Badminton Sports in Canada Friends Gustavo Kuerten Associated Press Athlete of the Year China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Tag Ice hockey Andre Agassi Cranford, New Jersey Raffles Institution Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics The Championships, Wimbledon Summer Olympic Games Parkour Minnesota Golden Gophers United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics University of Houston Paintball Georgia Institute of Technology Jumpstart 3rd Grade Great Teacher Onizuka Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) Big East Conference Indiana State University Golf Lottie Dod Diving Kender Computer and video game genres Water polo Aerial (dance move) Bowdoin College Punahou School Hamilton College Pitaten Sport in the United Kingdom W.I.T.C.H.

frontflip or backflip i can do them realy good on the tramoline and have been for several years ready to learn on ground now and i was just wondering is it easier to learn a backflip or frontflip on ground i think it probably just depends on the person it is easier for me to do front tumbling then back tumbling i would say a front flip but a back flip could be easier for you i think you should see on the trampoline which one is easier and then do that one unless they are both the same then you can do both lol make sure you use a mat or something incase you mess up the first time have fun be safe and i hope this helps gymgirliexox  Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Moonsault Professional wrestling attacks Gymnastics Trampolining Powerbomb Skateboarding trick Badminton DDT (professional wrestling) Parachuting Breaststroke Piledriver (professional wrestling) Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers IBM PC compatible Social rule Mixed martial arts Trampoline Motocross Dropkick Kitesurfing Cheerleading Marching band 2000 Australian Grand Prix Autogyro The Invisibles Backbreaker Shawn Michaels Paragliding Dog training Backstroke Neckbreaker Textile manufacturing Anchor Table tennis Carbine Floppy disk Shen Gong Wu Pitaten Sento Richard Feynman The Ashlee Simpson Show BASE jumping Peter Cook Wind turbine Bicycle Coin flipping The McGuire Sisters Motorcycle Girls Aloud Golf club (equipment) Car handling VHF omnidirectional range Softball Sant Mat Knife Escape from New York Shooting star press B3ta Alan Arnett McLeod Battle of the Somme (1916) Orange Order Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Atmospheric reentry Skateboarding Mat Hoffman Front crawl Mario Bros.

are most sports boring to watch on tv as opposed to in person it depends on which sport you are talking about for instance tennis is much more exciting to watch in person because the speed of the ball is altered from tv but with a sport such as golf you are better watching on tv because you can see different players hit within seconds as opposed to standing behind rows of people in front of you and walking to each hole football is much more exciting to watch in person because of the general atmosphere and excitement tied around the sport as opposed to baseball which requires much patience to watch in person these are all arguable subjects though but i think you would be safe saving your money and watching at home  Volleyball Softball Tennis Football (soccer) Vin Scully Paintball Batting (cricket) Ty Cobb American football Sudden death World Series Babe Ruth Baseball statistics Sports timeline Sports in Puerto Rico Golf 1919 World Series Football (soccer) positions New York Giants The Championships, Wimbledon September 2004 in sports G-Man (Half-Life) Major League Baseball television contracts Team Fortress Classic GunBound Badminton Water polo Michael Jordan Sport Rugby union positions Reggie Jackson Barry Bonds Tag Glossary of American football Cricket Table tennis St. Louis Cardinals Comparison of Canadian and American football BASEketball Summer Olympic Games Australian rules football Basketball Baseball Stars University of Miami April 2005 in sports National pastime Hank Aaron Pete Rose Texas A&M University Indianapolis 500 Pinball Batting average Chicago Cubs Chicago White Sox Manny Ram__rez Philadelphia Eagles Playoff Boston Red Sox Indiana State University Blackjack Table football Animal Crossing Georgia Institute of Technology Time travel Golf glossary Sports betting University of Houston Culture of France Wrigley Field Major League Baseball English cricket team Marching band Squash (sport) Ball Florida State University ESPN25 Poker jargon Four square Worms weapons and tools June 2005 in sports Mario Superstar Baseball Gary Sheffield 1957 World Series Cincinnati Reds Glider Drag racing Yankee Stadium Home run Michelle Wie Pitcher Rugby union ELO rating system Wario National Football League Beer Pong Baseball scorekeeping Rugby league Caddy

what to you is the most nostalgic sports arena and why you can list more than one but try to do only one for every sport maybe you can have two for a sport but only if you have a really good reason d yeah it's yankee stadium for me too nba boston garden bird russell auerbach the parquet floor a million epic battles and all those championship banners i don't think there is even an argument on this one baseball fenway park i grew up as a brewer fan but i have to give it up to fenway the green monster their history of futility and finally overcoming it colorful players like fisk evans lynn rice tiant clemens pedro schilling there is no denying the aesthetics which is even more amazing when you consider how long ago this park was designed yankee stadium has more history but not the design aspects so if i had to choose one thing to see it would be fenway nfl lambeau field in green bay this has always been a football only venue with unblocked sight lines going back to the ice bowl this stadium represents man overcoming the competition and the elements playing outside in the elements is at the core of this man's game and lambeau is clearly the example along with a colorful and winning history lombardi starr nitschke hornung reggie favre world championships and more than enough ghosts to go around all in a town with about k people unbelievable that it has even survived let alone standing as the best place to see a game in person in the nfl this was a great question and i cannot even believe that i picked boston sites they're so obnoxious  Green Bay Packers National Football League Lore Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Washington Redskins Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry National Football League Super Bowl Fenway Park 1975 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts Cleveland Browns Brett Favre January 2005 in sports New York Giants 2004 American League Championship Series Red Sox Nation Super Bowl I Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams 2004 World Series NBA Finals Minnesota Vikings Chicago White Sox Super Bowl II New York Mets Playoff Hubert H.
