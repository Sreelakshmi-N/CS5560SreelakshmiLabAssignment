sims quick question ok sooo heres the thing my sim is at collage and he got a girl mad at her furious and there is a choice that says buy off with and ill click it and nothing happens it mite be b c i downloaded a cheat where u can bribe the headmaster that comes to visit to enroll your kids in private school with money but i really dont know plz help buying them off only lasts for a short while it's really not worth bothering with it is from the game not from your hack but the action can be cancelled and ignored by the sim he's trying to perform the action on the best option is to ask them to leave and they will if they are not resident on the lot if you want to make them be friendly again get a hot tub and let them chat in there there are no negative actions that can occur so friendships are built faster by the way the best way to win over the headmaster is to cook pork chops level cooking skill i think for when you call them to dinner and have a high scoring tour of the house this can be done by turning on all the house lights for better environment scores this will improve the room score and invest in a expensive picture or statue and wait til the headmaster's close as can be to the art if you can only afford one move it round room to room as you show him round  EXpanded MultiPlayer Paintball Poker jargon GunZ The Duel The Sims Have I Got News For You Machinima Diablo II: Lord of Destruction GED The Sims 2 Big Brother (USA TV series) Cheating in Counter-Strike The Inside SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs MMORPG Neopets Counter-Strike Betting (poker) Wheel of Fortune Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Microeconomics Bristol Grammar School EverQuest The Sims 2: Nightlife Mouse (computing) $ale of the Century Education in Romania Blackjack GunBound Winning Streak Jeopardy!

nintendo roms and emulators i recently came across some websites where your able to download nes and snes roms and emulators this all seems way too good to be true since you can literally download every single nes or snes game on the pc for free it just seems like it wouldn't be legal or legitamate before i download any of these i'm just wondering if downloading these games is legal or what the deal is thanks wrong wrong wrong first of all the one thing that was correct is that the emulator itself is perfectly legal this is because an emulator is something that a person programmed to act like a system since it's created privately and not by the major gaming company the person who created it has every right to offer online for download the roms however are different you have privately made roms which are completely legal however for commercial roms ie anything that was once sold in a store the program is actually taken from the cartridge or disc itself and so originated from the gaming company because of this if you download a rom even for a game you own you are still acquiring information that you did not pay for the only exception would be if you were the one to rip the rom from your own copy which would then be illegal only if you distributed it as for outdated roms don't count on it the original super mario bros has been out for more than years and yet the mario trademark is still nintendo's admittedly it's unlikely that someone will come busting down your door just because you downloaded a more obscure game like burger time but the point is if someone does own the rights to it they legally would have the right to come after you also keep in mind that everything here is just what's legal and what's not it's kind of like driving ten miles over the speed limit it's not necessarily that they will go after you every single time but if for some reason they do you are technically in the wrong  Nintendo ROM image Nintendo Entertainment System Console emulator Nintendo Revolution MAME Video game music Nintendo 64 Read-only memory Game Boy Advance History of computer and video games Nintendo DS Super Mario remake series Rare (video game company) Super Mario Bros.

i can't remember the name of this pc game does anyone know where to download it it was a pinball game for the computer and i don't know when it came out but i played it around it had a blue robot in the center and i think it moved while you played pinball does anyone know where i can download it screenshots are much appreciated i remember this game it's called epic pinball pinball's popularity waned with the growth in popularity of the video game video games are a more dynamic medium for play with limitless possibilities pinball is tied to two flippers a ball and a slanted play field as a result it is unlikely pinball will ever regain its glory days of the s when it peaked just because its popularity waned does not make the game less fun it only forced it into a niche in epic attempted to port pinball to the pc at the time dozens of developers had video game adaptations of pinball available but players lamented the poor physics and deck layouts epic pinball was the first video pinball game to successfully imitate real world pinball physics with challenging deck designs and that afforded replayability epic pinball came as shareware where the player could either download for free of purchase for a small fee a portion of the game to try it out before deciding if they wanted to buy the full version the shareware version came with super android the full version offered thirteen tables including super android the best table of all thirteen was super android without question you were tasked with awakening the android by striking key combinations of table buttons and ramps you would activate an arm a led increase its i q and a variety of other tasks accomplished with only the pinball itself unfortunately ultimate android was one of the few great tables that brought the player back for more the tables were all original designs rather than ports of real machines some of the designs were boring such as the deep sea table deep sea had a variety of interesting ramps and buttons to strike but lacked any goal you leveled up simply by obtaining a certain number of points enigma is gimmicky a table that takes advantage of its video game nature to make various strike buttons and ramps appear such as free floating gems you must hit to score points while interesting in concept in practice it became more of an annoyance than a challenge still many of the tables had that rare mix of table design theme and challenge that kept you coming back the excalibur themed table had an excellent design as did cyborggirl and the 's styled magic table the magic table allowed you to perform tricks such as pulling a rabbit out of a hat through the course of key button strikes and ramps while some tables are better than others epic pinball has enough variety and realistic physics to satiate the pinball wizard looking for an hour's distraction without the cost of a full sized machine  Computer and video games MAME Baseball Nintendo Entertainment System Pok__mon Bubble Bobble Slot machine Spy Hunter History of computer and video games IBM PC compatible Electronic Arts Defender (game) Poker jargon Commodore 64 Computer and video game genres Super Mario 64 First-person shooter RISC Spider-Man (games) MMORPG Double Dragon Beatmania IIDX Stars!

gangsters for pc hey guys i need help for the gangsters in pc im stuck in level which is yorkdale i dont noe how to complete it plzz help me n tell me wat to do to complete it thnx episode yorkdale docks town yorkdale first up start claiming land from the blue gang make a note of all the businesses that receive frequent attacks and place armed guard you should destroy the blue gang before doing anything else from there on it's up to you how you could finish the mission it would be faster to actually take on yellow and wipe him clean the speakeasies aren't really worth setting up as they need booze to generate real income which we don't have at this stage you might want to start on all the other gangs as well if you want to actually make sure that your trucks are able to make a shipment of alcohol out of town you might need to create a safe passage that would probably mean clearing a lot of land you could save money by stealing the brown gangs armoured cars and using them for your cause just remember that you only have one shot at this and what you get in the first snatch is what you get and they will wage war on you soon after the blue gang has a bulletproof car there's a gangster in the newspaper that has lots of good skills but he's absolutely rubbish in all areas hire him her near the end of the level as he'll be invaluable asset to the team when doing your attack into the island bring all gangsters with armoured cars and muscle to attack one of the entrances the key threat in this area are the roaming armoured cars so gang up on them and if none of the cars round the pack can't take pot shots at the armoured car shoot the muscle that comes running down to shoot at you switch targets when your gangster is able to shoot at the armoured car don't drive too deep into enemy territory at the start or you'll be wiped out quite easily if you are able to get to the purple gang leaders office have no regrets to send several armoured cars with full muscle and tommy guns to wipe them clean there are plenty of potential gangsters who could leave the office to take back what you so badly worked for restrict them to guarding their office you could throw a bomb into the office but the rate that they throw out gangsters to guard the office is far too quick to make the task easy do not kill the gang leader until a shipment has been made and all the other objectives are met  Blood (computer game) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Grand Theft Auto (game) Sin City The Untouchables Unreal RuneScape quests Star Wars: Battlefront Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 GunZ The Duel Tank classification Protoss Reservoir Dogs Red Vs.

ps vs pc polycount ok i'm confused and i hope you won't consider this a stupid question and actually shed some light on the subject i read that onimusha warlords's character are built from polygons the game was realeased for ps in and for pc in on the other hand there's doom which had bigger sys reqs but still the characters were made from polygons plus pcs are supposed to be faster than consoles yet lair's character are built from polygons this statements put together make no sence at all am i missing something or are some of the numbers incorrect thank you the number of polygons does not determine what the over all product will look like the major factore is the shading that is done with those polygons example lets say you have a character from doom that is polygons and it used complex shading giving the final look something thats not all blocky then take a character from some random game and give it polygons with not as complex of shading they will look about the same due the the major diffrence of polygons but the one with more polygons will actually require less system resources as the shading is not as complex and less strenuouse in the end shading is going the be more of a key factor on system resources then polygon counts i really hope that helps and you can understand it as i am tired while doing this i would also like to thank you for a really good question nice question in general and nicely asked with detail on what you wanted to know  Geographic information system Normal mapping Expert system Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 First-person shooter System Shock 2 Nintendo Revolution English grammar Super Nintendo Entertainment System Final Fantasy $ale of the Century Large numbers Atari 8-bit family Game programming Clipping (computer graphics) Polygon Nintendo GameCube Password On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Descent (computer game) Shader Binary space partitioning Theory of conduct Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Xbox 360 Xbox Ruler-and-compass construction Computer CPU cache Rendering (computer graphics) System/36 Sega Saturn Doom engine Wheel of Fortune Akuma (Street Fighter) Randomness Quantum computer Windows 2000 Galactic Civilizations Internal ballistics Blue screen of death RISC Free will Complexity classes P and NP Wallpaper group Winning Streak Computer animation GunBound Computer and video game genres Machinima Doom 3 3dfx FIFA Series Probability Traditional animation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Computational complexity theory Quicksort Euler characteristic Debugging Little Britain Grand Theft Auto III Ghost Mortal Kombat System/34 Regular polytope Gouraud shading Interactive proof system Computer graphics Vector graphics NVIDIA Halting problem Chinese character Poker jargon Doom 3 engine Causality Copy protection Python programming language Singlish History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Ashton-Tate Microeconomics Avenue Q Timeline of computing 1990-forward Dominoes ELO rating system You Don't Know Jack New York Giants MAME Sega Dreamcast Typeface Milton H.

my problem is that my game age of empires conq wont install it says empires not installed on my pc man when this program gives problems it really gives problems i'm not sure if i can help but i can give you a generic answer that may help with everything related to programs you have to have a lot of patience you may have to do this for hours on end until you get it you've also got to have a lot of optimism that you can succeed i've lost faith before not realizing that i already had the solution all along if it's already installed but not working uninstall it and re install sometimes it works read the box for hardware requirements if this is a new version of the program it may require a d graphics card and a kajillion gigabytes of ram if you have an older computer and even if you install a bunch of ram it may still not work because of the way your computer handles ram if you have xp but haven't updated your service packs or updated your operating system it may need that you can go to microsoft the the latest updates of course it may not help b google or yahoo the game title to see if anyone else is having the same problem if you have multiple drives and you installed it with dvd drive d but you're trying to play in cd drive e it won't work because it was installed in one drive and your computer will only allow you to play it on that drive only if you're trying to install a dvd on a cd drive it won't work the good news is dvd drives are cheap and easy to install don't buy the cheapest one and do research before you buy one pay attention to all error messages when you're attempting to play or install these sometimes give you the answer if it's not legal software it may not install because they have disabled your install software when you go online the software tries to get a required file from the manufacturer you have to register to get it if you bought an oem version you may have gotten ripped off or the manufacturer received your name from the oem dealer for a price they let you run the software up to a point of addiction and then they disable it so cruel there's more suggestions but i need sleep good luck you can do it  Windows 2000 Windows XP Windows Server 2003 PlayStation 2 Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Spyware Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Copy protection Microsoft Hard disk PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Knoppix DVD USB flash drive Xbox Xbox 360 64-bit Computer virus Amiga ZX Spectrum Blue screen of death Modchip Linux Commodore 64 ATI Technologies IPod Radeon Apple II family PlayStation Portable Computer and video games History of Microsoft Windows Virtual memory Windows 3.x Modem System/36 3dfx Computer software Patch (computing) Nintendo GameCube Atari ST Mac OS X TiVo System 7 (Macintosh) CPU design Timeline of computing 1990-forward MDAC NX bit Motorola 68000 Anti-virus software CPU cache Computer security Steam (content delivery) Amstrad CPC OpenGL Embedded system Gmail PLATO MSN Messenger Laptop Sound Blaster CP/M Thread (computer science) Apple Computer Ethernet IBM PC Apple IIGS NeXT IMac Google Digital rights management PDP-11 RISC Spam (electronic) Expert system Sega Saturn DOS Personal computer Perl Debugging File system Sega Dreamcast Copyright infringement of software Extreme Programming Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis The Sims 2 Sega Portable Document Format Nintendo Entertainment System TurboGrafx 16

can anyone tell me where can i get playstation emulator for my pc hope it's working properly without lag or something that really annoys you thanks the problem with emulating any of the newer systems on a pc is that a console is basically a type of computer set up specifically for gaming even if a pc has better specs than a console because the pc needs to be more versatile it will be behind the console in certain aspects basically to run an emulator effectively the pc needs to be to the point where it only takes a fraction of its resources to do the job of the console otherwise you'll notice things such as lag or choppiness as the system tries to keep up with the demands of the emulator  Emulator Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation 2 Windows 2000 Super Nintendo Entertainment System PowerPC Video game console PlayStation 3 Mouse (computing) Cell (microprocessor) Nintendo Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast Console emulator Computer role-playing game Home computer Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone PaX MIPS architecture Computer virus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis The Sims 2 Final Fantasy Amiga System/36 Handheld game console MAME Computer and video games IBM PC compatible Multiplayer Commodore 64 Mac OS MMORPG History of video games (Sixth generation era) Intellivision Regional lockout BASIC programming language The Sims Bubble Bobble DVD Computer and video game genres Xbox 360 PlayStation Portable CPU design Read-only memory Video game music Wine (software) Modchip Data General Nova Atari 2600 MSX System/360 Microsoft System/34 Atari ST Software engineering Neo-Geo Atari 8-bit family Computer Enhanced remake History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) NX bit Game Boy Advance PlayStation (original) Xbox DOSBox History of computer and video games Game programming Dance Dance Revolution Virtual machine Console game Mainframe computer Counter-Strike Zilog Z80 Mecha Game programmer Timeline of computing 1990-forward Sony Computer Entertainment ZX Spectrum Sun Microsystems C Sharp Game Boy Console wars Nintendo DS Nintendo Virtual Boy Quake III Arena Universal Serial Bus Fan translation Apple Macintosh History of operating systems Visual Basic Kernel (computer science) Sega Computer science OpenGL Video game player Musical Instrument Digital Interface Embedded system Memory card

can i play high quality pc games e g gta counter strike on the internet whithout installing them when you say high quality do you mean graphic wise or how well the game is made if you mean graphic wise then no and game with any amount of decent graphics will require your install something on your computer or else you will be loading packets and graphic information from the game's server all day and all that waiting time would make the game very boring to play indeed if you mean quality of the game content itself there's a limit of how much content you could put into let's say a flash based game for loading purposes so the games that you play exclusively on line will be fairly limited i personally find games at shockwave com and certain text based mudds fairly entertaining but i wouldn't call them high quality  Macromedia Flash Website Xbox Web crawler Counter-Strike Computer MSN Messenger Windows XP Game programmer Computer role-playing game IBM PC compatible MMORPG Final Fantasy XI Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Steam (content delivery) Domain Name System Teletext Embedded system Video game developer Four square Windows 2000 CPU cache Web design PNG Stars!
