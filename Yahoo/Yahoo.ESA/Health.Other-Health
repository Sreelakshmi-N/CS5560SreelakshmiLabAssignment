i have serious sleep problems how can i fall asleep i have a long list of completely stupid fears when it comes to sleep i'm afraid of not sleeping under a comforter no matter how hot it is i need a bright light on otherwise i go insane with fear i can't sleep without piles of junk around me on the bed which causes huge discomfort i'm scared to turn my fan on above a low for reasons unknown even to me i also have a rather serious case of insomnia that occurs every night melatonin pills don't work and my mother flat out refuses to get me sleep pills not beliving i have a serious problem even though i only get to hours of sleep a night i need help see a doctor your fears and phobias are preventing you from sleeping you need to be on an anti anxiety medication you will find that once you are on the correct medication that your sleep will improve taking sleeping pills will only mask the real problem if your mother will not take you to the doctor see your guidance counselor or school nurse tell them what you wrote here and see if they will intervene with your mother you need to improve the quality of your life believe me these fears will not go away as you age they only get worse good luck  Insomnia Sleep Anxiety Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Delayed sleep phase syndrome Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

why did you ask your health questions here i'm just looking for some clarification a lot of the health questions on here seem to be very specific and some people are even asking questions that deal with life and death matters why do you turn to strangers on yahoo rather than a doctor or a nurse in your area is health care costs too expensive just to talk to a doctor do you think you will find a better answer than a professional will give you i'm just so confused i would hate to feel as if this was my only health information option if i were in some dire need of medical attention what do you think i think people sometimes need confirmation that they really do need to see a doctor they might also want to know what to expect so they ask people who have been there before i also think a lot of those life and death situations are written from posers who are just plain bored you have to realize this is a great place for anonymity and people abuse it by making up lives that don't resemble their own in the slightest  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Ethics National Health Service Adult attention-deficit disorder Infantilism Prostate cancer Mental Health Act 1983 Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule National Kidney Foundation Singapore Medicine Health science Drug abuse Life insurance Nurse Stomach cancer Milton H.

diagnostic medical equipment now causing cancer recently i heard a report on how those who have had ct scans mri's and such are at a higher increase of getting cancer the one in particular they spoke about was one that i dealt with where they inject dye into your heart angiogram and get the pictures they concluded that those patients have a higher rate of heart cancer as well as breast cancer today i recieved a call from my drs office wanting me to come in and i have to be honest i am concerned about what i am gonna hear my question is should a person have a ct scan done or mri's when they have now concluded it gives the patient a higher risk for getting cancer when does a person say enough is enough they meaning doctors the report was on the evening news as well as medical journals ct scans are worse than mri basically any kind of medical imaging involves bombarding your body with energy and seeing what happens magnetic resonance imaging works by using strong magnetic fields to temporarily alter the polarity of atomic particles in your body when they revert to their normal polarity they release energy which is then picked up by the imaging system i don't really know the details the major difference is that the technique relies on energy that's reflected back out of the body as things return to normal other types of scans often rely on bombarding your body with energy with you between the source of that energy and some kind of film or sensor then the image is derived from what your body doesn't block so in a vague way you could consider that one technique is done by your body giving off energy and another by your body absorbing energy so go for the mri and with other types of diagnostics get as few doses as possible each day you sit in front of a computer screen there's a teeny teeny tiny chance that you'll get some kind of cancer from a random mutation due to the energy coming off the screen its there with everything and its a lot higher with things like diagnostic radiation but its still a very small chance and its offset by the benefit of possibly diagnosing and preventing certain diseases weigh the risk ps i just read another answer as i posted this there are certainly a lot of bunk studies even within scientific and medical communities however it has been widely accepted in such communities since probably the late s that diagnostic radiation does very slightly increase the chance of genetic mutations that may result in cancers  Breast cancer Radiation therapy Lung cancer Cardiac stress test Radiology Medicine Nuclear medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder X-ray Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Colorectal cancer History of brain imaging Mesothelioma Bipolar disorder Stomach cancer Chiropractic Androgen insensitivity syndrome Brain imaging Computed tomography Functional magnetic resonance imaging Autism Multiple sclerosis Aortic dissection Positron emission tomography Folic acid Oncology Diabetes mellitus Malignant melanoma Radiosurgery Medical imaging Stroke Ovarian cancer Radar Urinary incontinence Gamma ray Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Traumatic brain injury Tocopherol Schizophrenia Growth hormone treatment Hypoglycemia Mobile phone radiation and health Tobacco smoking Nuclear magnetic resonance Medical ultrasonography Abortion Mental illness Medical analysis of circumcision Technetium Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pulmonary embolism Ultraviolet Radiation poisoning Syringomyelia Dieting Acupuncture Ataxia telangiectasia Solar variation Bone marrow transplant Cephalic disorder Traditional Chinese medicine Galileo spacecraft Prolactinoma Vitamin C Post-traumatic stress disorder Obesity Nuclear power Particle accelerator Allergy Plutonium Brain tumor Magnet Nutrition Ozone depletion Cryptorchidism Obstetrics Human brain Loudspeaker Malaria Growth hormone deficiency Transsexuality Chemotherapy Hodgkin's lymphoma Stereoscopy Psychosis Crohn's disease Microscopy Gravitational radiation Hard disk Cystic fibrosis

birth control pill question i'm on the birth control called yasmin i was wondering whether it would make a big diffference if i completely skipped the last pills the sugar pills and jumped straight into the next pack would it completely mess up my cycle or can i control my period that way is it harmful to my body in any way i've never done it i was just curious about it yes you can completely skip your period by skipping the last weeks worth of pills sugar pills and starting a brand new pack in fact some women do this on purpose right before they go on vacation or have something important planned like a wedding this way they can completely skip their period and not have to worry about it till next month and don't worry it won't hurt you or harm you in anyway it's completely fine to do it every now and then there are even birth control pills that are designed to have fewer periods like seasonale i found this article on the mayo clinic website it's possible to prevent your period with continuous use of any birth control pill this means skipping the placebo pills and starting right away on a new pack some evidence suggests an advantage to this type of pill regimen by continuously taking the pill you prevent hormonal fluctuations that are responsible for bleeding cramping headaches and other discomforts associated with getting your period however you're at greater risk of breakthrough bleeding bleeding between periods continuous use of your birth control pills works best if you're taking a monophasic pill with the same hormone dose in the three weeks of active pills if you're taking a triphasic pill with a different hormone dose each week of the active pill phase using them continuously carries a much higher rate of breakthrough bleeding you may find continuous use of birth control pills a convenient way to avoid having your period during an important occasion or trip taking a monthly regimen birth control pill continuously is fine for about three months but then you should plan on taking the placebo pills so that you'll have a menstrual cycle http www mayoclinic com health birth control pill wo good luck  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Birth control Cancer Migraine COX-2 inhibitor Antidepressant Endometriosis Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Tocopherol Baldness treatments Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acne Hypoglycemia Pregnancy Antiretroviral drug Folic acid Clinical depression Bipolar disorder Breast cancer Transsexuality Depo Provera Placebo Growth hormone treatment Atkins Nutritional Approach Polycystic ovary syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Psoriasis Puberty Pharmaceutical company Obesity Bone marrow transplant Radiation therapy Prostate cancer Childbirth St John's wort Vitamin D Stomach cancer Herpes simplex virus Cryptorchidism Hormone replacement therapy Coffee Chemotherapy Dietary fiber Insulin Sleep Guinea pig Nutrition Miscarriage Aspirin Glucocorticoid Hypertension Diazepam Abortion Drug abuse Anabolic steroid Female genital cutting Common cold Stroke Osteoporosis Premature birth Omega-3 fatty acid Chemical abortion Clinical trial Penis enlargement Milk Social rule EastEnders AIDS Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Acupuncture Caffeine Ovulation Cannabis (drug) Intravenous therapy Alzheimer's disease Apollo 8 Electroconvulsive therapy Randomized controlled trial Opioid Hormone Extreme Programming Methamphetamine Chronic fatigue syndrome Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Gregorian calendar Elvis and Me Diabetes mellitus Chlorpromazine Syphilis

how long would you live if shot in the stomach i'm writing a story and need to figure out something a teen is shot in the stomach during a drive by shooting he can't get medical help how long would he have to live until he bled to death i repeat he can not get any medical help hi there in the medical world a person would live if the bullet only penetrated the abdomen thru to the stomach a possible minutes it is a horrible death as we all know that our stomach is filled with hydrochloric acid as the blood begins to intermix with the stomach acid this causes fatal toxemia and extreme blood loss in the individual i would bet that if no one received medical attention and a bullet penetrated stomach with substantial force that the individual would die of blodd loss within fifteen minutes of penetration my guess is just that a guess in healthcare it is hard to determine when someone would die of an injury of this nature as it is an easy easier said than done operation and people do not usually die from this wound because they seek medical attention hope this helps and good luck to you in the future kelly mcbride rdms  Stomach cancer Suicide methods Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Drowning First aid Terminal ballistics Dying declaration Obstetrics Bleeding Myocardial infarction Death Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cancer 3-19 shooting incident Stroke John F.

knuckle cracking is it really bad to crack your knuckles is there any long term effects does this cause arthritis hi there i think we are all guilty of cracking our hips knuckles fingers and other crackable joints healthcare professionals have been debating over this issue for years let me share with you what i know so that this may shed a bit of light on your question when a person cracks their knuckles your joint in not actually cracking depending on the size of the joint you have a large quantity of synovial fluid composed of traces of cells and a thin mucal membrane that help lubricate and ease the movements of joints when you crack your knuckle for example you are shifting the synovial fluid from one end of your knuckle to the other the sudden shift and movement of fluid causes a popping noise i personally do not believe that this puts you at risk for arthritic joint problems you are simply shifting fluid just as we do with our knee joints every step that we take and many people live with no knee or hip joint problems there are no long term effects except for the fact that the more you crack your knuckles the louder they pop once you start shifting synovial fluid around the joint it creates a type of channel that is easier to access thus creating a louder pop as it moves through this channel hope this helps kelly mcbride rdms  Equine conformation Joint Synovial fluid Synovium Knee Gout Chiropractic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Disc jockey Welding Action potential Fast bowling Punch (strike) Motorcycle Glossary of climbing terms Rheumatoid arthritis Cat Shoulder Drill bit Hip replacement Gramophone record Massage Violin Prostate cancer Weight training Eye Reiter's syndrome Music genre Gram staining Glacier Hip (anatomy) Radio controlled airplane Traumatic brain injury Electrophysiology Wood Bass guitar Sonic & Knuckles Aikido Swingout Condom Cell membrane Guitar Fluid dynamics Wrist Humerus Knuckles' Chaotix Normal distribution Arthritis Drug test Pump It Up Pneumonia Orthopedic surgery Chaos Emerald Boxing Abortion Replacement joint Childbirth Divorce Luminiferous aether Spina bifida Shock wave Menstrual cup RISC Casualty lifting Decompression sickness Surveillance Psoriasis Thermal power station Naval mine David Bowie Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling holds Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Hip fracture Cocaine Antibody Intravenous therapy Ice core Popular music Cerebral palsy Septic arthritis Navier-Stokes equations HIV test Strike (attack) Wealth Friction Mach kernel Loudspeaker Signal transduction Undergarment Diabetes mellitus Mesothelioma Autism

yesterday and today i noticed when i went to the bathroom this morning i had poop with blood in it i was wondering what this is that i have could i have ibs lactose intolerance crohn s disease constipation this has never happened to me before i am a year old woman could this be considered severe or not it is most likely nothing to worry about if the blood was bright red and fresh it is pretty much guaranteed to be normal it could be a fissure somewhere around the opening which sometimes you can't even feel if the blood is very dark it could be a cause for concern and you might want to have it checked out i have ibs and i usually don't have blood in my stool if you have been noticing any pains in your lower abdominal area over an extended period of time or flaring up after you eat a certain thing then it is time to go to the doctor if you are normal other than the blood i wouldn't worry  Crohn's disease Irritable bowel syndrome Diarrhea Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Colorectal cancer Dietary fiber Hemorrhoid Stomach cancer Abdominal pain Constipation Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometriosis Feces Cirrhosis Adjustable gastric band Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Anal fissure Endometrial cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lactose intolerance The Shining (film) Autoimmune diseases Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Human adaptation to space Folic acid Cheese Time Out of Mind Charles Darwin's illness Anemia Blood on the Tracks AFI 100 Years series Milton H.

coping question i broke up with my boyfriend today and it went well it was several hours ago yet i still feel bad i'm still kind of shaking i rode my bike miles and i bought an energy drink actually that's probably why i'm shaking lol what do you do to help coping i'd like some kind of instant relief please and thank you the best instant relief that works for me is finding a quiet spot like a beach or nature trail sit down and take in the beauty of the world lay down look at the clouds or stars and just breath relax and think about the excitement you have ahead of you being newly single as for the long term relief you will feel some aches and pains it is never easy breaking up but it is all normal and will fade every time you get sad or uneasy remember you did it for a reason and change is hard sometimes best of luck to you  Social rule Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Shake It Off Guilty Gear Mid-levels Anxiety Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what does is healthy physically there is so much focus on weight smoking bad eating lots of addictions especially if you consider food as an addiction there is lots of focus on how to become heatlhy or how to pervent bad health when are you healthy what defines healthy is it when you can run a mile or a marathon is it the absense of sickness today it seems there is so much focus on heath but it seems to be a focus in the most unhealthy manner driving people headlong into something that they are told will make them happy what is health to you i'm going to give you the nurse answer it is based on the principle of holistic care which looks at the whole person rather than a single part of them in that frame of thought health is defined as whatever the person thinks it is you could have cancer in your entire body but if you wake up one morning and feel good feel healthy then by holistic definition you are healthy to some extent this is a good way of looking at it there are so many people living in the world with underlying conditions but who don't feel as if their health as a person is being burdened this allows nurses to view a patient's health in a way that is relative to the mind set of the patient on the flip side to that the medical model of health is quite strict the absense of disease this encompasses a lot which means a lot of people aren't medically healthy yet they are holistically healthy there are strengths and weaknesses to both views its up to you to determine how you percieve health medically or holistically or like me a mix of both  Health insurance Addiction Medicine Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Cancer Tobacco smoking Drug abuse Bipolar disorder Goodness and value theory Natural health Hypoglycemia Psychology Nursing Traditional Chinese medicine Psychotherapy Homeopathy Mental health Pneumonia Atkins Nutritional Approach Abortion debate Ayurveda Alternative medicine Social rule Chronic fatigue syndrome Reiki Clinical depression Utilitarianism Mental Health Act 1983 Ethics Hypnosis Scientology beliefs and practices Science Tai Chi Chuan Natural Hygiene Publicly funded medicine Anorexia nervosa Folic acid Fasting Alcoholism Health Psychiatry Friedrich Schleiermacher Drug addiction Diarrhea Word of Wisdom Dialysis Organic farming Death Insomnia Breastfeeding Psychosis Tocopherol Nurse Nicomachean Ethics Palliative care Dualism (philosophy of mind) Social justice Myocardial infarction Medical prescription Meaning of life Dieting Logic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) AIDS New Age Nursing theory Sigmund Freud Health science Borderline personality disorder F.

is it really bad for you to crack your knuckles what are the short term and long term effects some people say its ok to do and others say its bad i want to know the truth likely not i'm not saying definitely no because while cracking knuckles is common research on its effects is not we have only a handful of studies on the subject none shows a definite link between knuckle cracking and arthritis however cracking your knuckles is neither harmless nor desirable the arthritis connection may be an old wives' tale but cracking your knuckles can hurt your hand in other ways and there's no benefit to it some students crack their knuckles after writing a great deal but cracking knuckles isn't a solution for writer's cramp instead take a break and bend and stretch out your fingers a few times kids may develop a habit of cracking their knuckles because they like the sound the crack comes because of a change in the synovial fluid the lubricant that bathes the joints when finger bones are suddenly stretched apart the space between the joints widens and an air bubble forms in the synovial fluid the bubble quickly bursts and makes a sharp sound nature did not intend us to repeatedly stretch the ligaments of the finger joints i found two medical articles that talked about patients who had injured their hands from knuckle cracking one over stretched his ligaments and dislocated his fingers another partially tore the ligament in her thumb in a researcher looked at the hand function in adults age and above he didn't find a greater tendency toward arthritis in the habitual knuckle crackers but the knuckle crackers were more likely to have swollen hands and reduced hand strength however an accompanying editorial posed this idea perhaps a person must have looser than average ligaments in order to crack knuckles in the first place and those loose ligaments and joints may set the person up for other sorts of joint damage in another study published back in the researcher visited an old age home and asked patients whether or not they had cracked their knuckles when they were young he found who remembered they had and who remembered they had not when the researcher x rayed their hands and compared the two groups he found no difference in arthritis rates what does cause arthritis there are many kinds of arthritis but the most common osteoarthritis is a function of age and genetic predisposition if you x ray hands of people age percent will have arthritis osteoarthritis tends to be a bit worse in the dominant hand the bottom line while cracking knuckles may not get you arthritis faster it won't win you many fans and might injure those fingers in other ways so it's best not done  Carpal tunnel syndrome Equine conformation Rheumatoid arthritis Knee Arthritis COX-2 inhibitor Prostate cancer Hand Joint Tai Chi Chuan Massage Welding Anterior cruciate ligament Harp Gout First aid Punch (strike) Password Poker jargon Milton H.

whats the difference between hma and ppo for insurance purposes and which one is better when buying a plan i'm guessing you meant hmo usually with an hmo you have to go to the dr that's on their list in their network the benefits are it's cheaper usually only have to pay a co pay for office visits but if you need to see a specialist you have to first go to your primary dr and have him refer you to the specialist this is usally the cheaper plan for most people families drawbacks your stuck with the drs on their list if your current dr isn't on the list too bad i remember when we changed insurance companies at work i ended up losing about good drs because they wouldn't work with our insurance company ppo's are generally good for single people that are fairly healthy you can go to any dr you want without a referral but you'll pay a higher co pay usually per visit you're not as restricted basically that's just been my experience with them either way insurance companies suck  Health insurance Managed care Insurance Health maintenance organization Life insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Preferred provider organization Annuity Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Bond Poker jargon Blackjack Mutual fund Term life insurance Unemployment benefit Pharmaceutical company Airline Adverse selection 401(k) Social Security (United States) Auto insurance Obesity Health care in the United States Microeconomics Price discrimination Professor Medicare (Canada) Apple Computer Primerica Financial Services Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Variable universal life insurance Electrophysiology Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Octopus card National Insurance Gross domestic product Commodity markets Password Sweatshop Philosophical skepticism Medicine Central processing unit Trust (Law) USA CPU cache Arguments for and against drug prohibition Security (finance) Contract CPU design Taxation in Canada Risk management Social justice Citigroup Password cracking Ponzi scheme Compensation of employees Balikpapan Health savings account Anarchism and capitalism Rebreather Labour economics Public policy Wheel of Fortune Mortgage NASDAQ Redundant array of independent disks UK Singles Chart Economics Outsourcing Nuclear power Cable television Social security Lloyd's of London Computer Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation North American Numbering Plan Firefighter Commodore 64 Dividend Tai Chi Chuan Finance Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Universal life insurance General practitioner Social Security debate (United States) Fuel injection Legal aspects of transsexualism Flat tax Employee Retirement Income Security Act Strategic management Trade Homeopathy Freeters Dwarfism Transformer

why is it that some people look at overweight people and seem to hate them they don't even know them but they are willing to make fun of them and tease them unmercifully in the first place it is none of their business some overweight people have fought it for years others have a hard time getting motivated to lose some have health problems that prevent them from exercising and others take medications that cause weight gain i am not trying to make excuses but when you look at that overweight person you don't know what is going on in their lives and you have no right to judge them regardless i think that some people missed the point about it being none of their business and as far as being a burden on society you don't see people teasing and making fun of the drug addict they may be disgusted but they don't make fun of them or how about the alcoholic these people are a burden on societ too they actually kill other people talk about a burden and what about the criminals people may hate what they do but they don't usually make fun of them unless they do something particularly stupid as long as there is someone to point the finger at there is no need to look at yourself many people do not even realize this i try to offset the ignorance of people who do not know any better by making an effort to neutralize the attitude by ingnoring it or by calling attention to a positive in the person being ridiculed but what a nice guy he is or he would do anything for you the world is made up of all kinds of people refreshing isn't it  Obesity Theory of conduct Arguments for and against drug prohibition Peter Griffin Eric Cartman Binge eating disorder Drug addiction Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Undergrads Kyle Broflovski Human sexual behavior Unemployment Alcoholics Anonymous Garfield Alignment (role-playing games) Abortion debate Clinical depression Political correctness Homophobia Rush Limbaugh Kodocha Value system Prohibition (drugs) Transactional analysis Health insurance The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Jim Rome Show Addiction Indian English Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Procrastination Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Tobacco smoking Nicomachean Ethics Fruits Basket Mnemonic Humphrey Bogart South Park American Psycho Tax Libertarianism One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual orientation Utilitarianism Political views of Lyndon LaRouche Recreation Mediation The Beach Boys Fair use The nature of God in Western theology Late Night with Conan O'Brien Criticism of libertarianism Methamphetamine Vernon Schillinger Mothers Against Drunk Driving Little Britain Have I Got News For You The Shining (film) Cocaine Scarface (1983 film) Caffeine Homer Simpson LaVeyan Satanism Tai Chi Chuan Goodness and value theory Migraine Camp Lazlo Anorexia nervosa U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP Characters of Naruto Ron and Fez Platoon (film) Urinary incontinence Social psychology Invader Zim Warez Involuntary commitment Stuttering Physical attractiveness George Costanza Drug policy of the Netherlands Psychiatric hospital Tom the Dancing Bug W.

still possibly need gallbladder out a couple weeks ago i had a gallbladder attack horrible pain for almost days ultrasound showed my gallbladder wall was thickened but no gallstones last friday i had a hida scan done and it was normal while i have not been in nearly as much pain as i was those couple days i still have been having mild pains mainly below my ribs in middle and right side right upper back and middle of back plus i seem to always be nautious and get dizzy spells is it possible that my g b is still inflamed and the hida scan didnt see that does the hida scan even detect that or does it just show the function of your g b if hida scan came out normal is it still possible my gallbladder may need to come out tia for any help lisa frequent trips to the doctor with the same complaints has the potential to get you into a surgeon for an exploratory laparoscopy and when that happens they can take your gb out then if it looks inflamed or irritated or anything like that no stitches you go home the same day mine was adhered to my rib cage so while the us was normal i had two hida scans and one was abnormal and one was normal so they went in to investigate and that's what they found good luck to you also for temporary relief try no fatty foods no fried foods no heavy proteins red meat steak no spicy foods or heavy cream based sauces and very limited dairy products eat very slowly give your saliva time to do some of the work of breaking down the food so that your stomach and gb don't have so much work to do and enjoy simple basic foods that are easier to digest so your gb doesnt have to work that hard to help digest your food the gb only serves to store bile and release it upon food entering the stomach your liver takes over that function when you have your gb removed  Stomach cancer Cholecystitis Cirrhosis Gallstone Liver Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gallbladder Gastroparesis Barbecue Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Gastrointestinal tract Atherosclerosis Hypoglycemia Cholesterol Prostate cancer Cholecystectomy Stroke Chicken Insulin Cheese Fancy rat Psoriasis Tofu Crohn's disease Diarrhea Irritable bowel syndrome Colorectal cancer Obstetrics Abdomen Japanese cuisine Dairy Soul food Acne Gastroesophageal reflux disease Equine conformation Vomiting Guinea pig Heartburn Esophageal cancer Obesity Cancer Hot dog Fugu Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Omega-3 fatty acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Adjustable gastric band Dieting Cuisine of the Philippines Mesothelioma Hamster Acupuncture Appendicitis Radiation therapy Nutrition German cuisine Stuttering Digestion Hepatitis Terran (StarCraft) Breastfeeding Stomach Tooth Cat Peruvian cuisine Glycogen storage disease type I Cocaine Mattress Milk Pancreas Korean cuisine Fish and chips Domestic rabbit French cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Traumatic brain injury Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Food Fasting McDonald's Hamburger Kashrut Paracetamol Cuisine of Malaysia Chili con carne Aspartame Vitamin C Nutmeg Chiropractic Gout Cajun cuisine Spider

i have a lump on my inner elbow i need answers asap open to read why i'm supposed to donate blood tomorrow but what if it's an infection i can't donate if it is as far as the lump its in my left elbow right under the crease and its more easily felt if i lift my arm up which then pulls the skin down ya know gravity and all i dont have one on the right side it's not painful to the touch isn't really hard necessarily but isnt really soft either as far as the size well it's kind of oblong and it's probably the size of a couple of grapes like if you were to uhm smoosh them together i have a cut on my knuckle that has started to look a tiny bit like it might be getting infected just red around it and not really healing like it should for the tiny cut that it was i finally put some neosporin on it tonight and covered it up with a bandage and its looking a little bit better i noticed the lump a couple days ago and it has grown since then help if i have an infection i can't knowingly donate blood i know that i can always call the blood donation center and explain the situation to them and reschedule but i also need to know if this is doctor worthy hmm as i was writing this i had a little twinge of pain in the area and now that i think of it earlier in the evening this elbow sort of spasmed and hurt to extend it and grasp anything but it hurt on the outside of my elbow related idk that was a great answer except that the more i research lymph nodes in the elbow the less it seems possible for this to be what it is oh and i got up today looked at the date and realized that my appointment to donate is tomorrow duh blonde moment thanks for all the answers i'm going to call my doctor today those are most likely infected lymph nodes if the infection spreads next you will notice lumps in your armpit you need systemic oral antibiotic treatment epitrochlear nodes often these nodes are overlooked or inadequate techniques are employed to examine them epitrochlear nodes are best sought with the patient's elbow flexed to about the right epitrochlear area is approached by inserting the examiner's left hand from behind the patient's elbow while the examiner's right hand grasps the right wrist of the patient supporting the forearm as in figure b the fourth and fifth finger should fall just above the medial epicondyle of the humerus and then the other fingers will overlie the area where epitrochlear nodes are usually found examination of the left epitrochlear area is just the reverse of the right epitrochlear nodes are usually enlarged secondary to infections of the hand and forearm occasionally neoplastic processes will present with isolated epitrochlear adenopathy enlarged epitrochlear nodes occur frequently in mononucleosis in the past epitrochlear lymphadenopathy was considered a diagnostically important sign of secondary syphilis but now it is more commonly due to recurrent hand injury or infections in people who do manual labor  Humerus Elbow-joint Stomach cancer Cancer Breast cancer First aid Arm Malignant melanoma Syphilis Group A streptococcal infection Medicine Psoriasis Tuberculosis Lymphogranuloma venereum Colorectal cancer Cytomegalovirus Physical examination Metastasis Infectious mononucleosis Carpal tunnel syndrome Breast Lupus erythematosus Appendicitis Tai Chi Chuan Intravenous therapy Professional wrestling attacks Traumatic brain injury Radiation therapy Traditional Chinese medicine Milton H.

good samaritan law i know the basic idea but i would like to know a little more as far as medical care i am certified in lifeguard first aid cpr for the professional rescuer and emt outside of my training i grew up around emergency situations my mom is a trauma doc my question is for example if i needed to intubate a person assuming that i know how to and that i have the gear to do so but i am not certified to would i be covered by the good samaritan law thanks no you would not be covered by the good samaritan law the good samaritan law only applies to people who stay within a basic level of care if you intubate without the appropriate certifications you are stepping outside that basic level of care and would not only be liable if that person died as a result but also you would be considered practicing medicine without a license basically you can be ok staying at an emt b or first responder level but once you start doing als procedures you become very very liable even a paramedic who's authorized to perform intubations can't do it on his off duty hours because he's not acting under his medical director if he does so hope this helps p s i've seen emt b's get their license revoked for starting iv's while waiting for the paramedics  Emergency Medical Services Paramedic First aid Ambulance Certified first responder Nurse Drowning Lifeguard Terri Schiavo First aid kit Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Scientology beliefs and practices General practitioner Community emergency response team Certified Nursing Assistant Paralegal Good Samaritan law Advanced Life Support Health insurance St. John Ambulance Emergency medicine Death Physician Advanced cardiac life support Physical trauma Medicine Automated external defibrillator Negligence Health profession Podiatrist Vehicle extrication Notary public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Traditional Chinese medicine Good Samaritan Medical emergency Medic One Emergency department Mechanical ventilation Hypnosis Ethics Publicly funded medicine Transsexuality Public health in mainland China Cardiac tamponade Public domain Traumatic brain injury Juris Doctor Altruism Physical therapy Abdominal thrusts Air Force Pararescue Parachuting Supply and demand Shock Chiropractic Euthanasia President of Germany Pretty Good Privacy Naturopathic medicine Chinese University of Hong Kong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pilot certification in the United States Massage Education in Portugal Myocardial infarction Civil rights Copyright law of the United Kingdom Nursing Medical Assistant Medicare (Canada) Electrical engineering Intracranial pressure Basic life support Law of the People's Republic of China Stroke Dentistry Appeal Tort Abortion Psychiatry Dafydd Williams Kashrut Sexual assault Prostate cancer Treaty Midwifery Firefighter SAMU Information Technology Infrastructure Library Golden hour (medicine)

what are the side effect of drinking coffee i drink at least cups of coffee a day i'm almost wut do coffee do to u study by researchers at duke university medical center shows that caffeine taken in the morning has effects on the body that persist until bedtime and amplifies stress consistently throughout the day the caffeine we drink enhances the effects of the stresses we experience so if we have a stressful job drinking coffee makes our body respond more to the ordinary stresses we experience he said the combination of stress and caffeine has a multiplying or synergistically negative effect quitting caffeine could be particularly beneficial for people suffering from high blood pressure just as diet and exercise can help keep blood pressure under control the researchers said that despite the perceived safety of overwhelmingly popular caffeinated beverages such as coffee the drug does show short term negative health effects that if continued over a period of years could increase risk of heart attack and stroke caffeine toxicity is known to cause excitement agitation restlessness shifting states of consciousness and toxic psychosis mimicking amphetamine psychosis allergic individuals may be erroneously diagnosed medicated and lost in a dark disturbed world until death it was also found that regular consumption of caffeinated coffee or tea or total caffeine intake was associated with an incidence of colorectal cancers drinking coffeee makes you jittery and unable to sleep  Sleep Word of Wisdom Coffee Hypertension Psychosis Bipolar disorder Cannabis (drug) Cancer Stroke Yerba mate Insomnia Hypoglycemia Tobacco smoking Drug addiction Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Milk Alcoholism Atkins Nutritional Approach Anxiety Tocopherol Methamphetamine Amphetamine Asthma Alzheimer's disease Folic acid Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Narcolepsy Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Common cold Blood pressure Psoriasis Chocolate Obesity Insulin Dieting Traumatic brain injury Stress (medicine) Coronary heart disease Colorectal cancer Crohn's disease Anorexia nervosa Alcoholic beverage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Post-traumatic stress disorder Antipsychotic Aspartame Hyperthermia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drug abuse Chlorpromazine Coeliac disease Drowning Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Raw food diet Coca-Cola Medical cannabis Epilepsy Carbon dioxide Soft drink Doxepin 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Alcohol consumption and health Animal testing Healthy eating Adult attention-deficit disorder Nutrition LSD Rofecoxib Maprotiline Paracetamol Tea Convention on Psychotropic Substances Cardiac arrhythmia Vomiting Stuttering Sugar substitute Cocaine Abortion Meditation Medicine Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Antidepressant Recreational drug use Adverse effect (medicine) Atrial fibrillation Neurofeedback Vitamin C Psychedelic drug Mental illness

is it bad for my back to keep sleeping on an air mattress we just moved and we're moving again in a year we got rid of my crappy old mattress when we moved so my mom won't get me a regular mattress until next time we move because she doesn't want to have to move extra stuff so she has me sleep on an air mattress in a regular bed frame but the air mattress caves in so i have to put boxes under it but they slide back out to the sides so there is always a trough in the middle that i fall into i usually can't fall asleep for at least an hour and i sometimes wake up with back pain am i permanently damaging myself i'm yes air matresses aren't good for your back if you're just feeling sore my advice is to try sleeping in a different possition or with extra pillows under and or around you if that doesn't work try sleeping somewhere else even a couch would do it's got some support and definitely won't slide out from under you but if you're feeling true back pain and you're lacking necessary sleep my advice is that you ask your parent for a matress yes its extra weight when moving but if you hurt your back badly at your age there very well is a chance that it will cause permanant damage in the future spine's are terribly delecate and back pain is common nowadays if space when you're moving is the problem i'm sure it could be strapped on top of a car your back is important and air matresses were never intended for long time use there's no equal substitute to a real matress but if that truelly isn't an option try getting memory foam there are matress cover ones available that just go over what you already have and it may help your back but i still stick to just pressuring your parent to get a matress  Casualty lifting Equine conformation The Fairly OddParents Upholstery Professional wrestling holds Futurama (TV series - season 5) Vacuum mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Floppy disk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Waterbed Aerial (dance move) First aid Spanking Back pain Strap-on dildo Pillow Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Out-of-body experience Poker jargon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Scuba set Kurt Cobain Insomnia Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amber Spyglass Urinary incontinence The Catcher in the Rye Skateboarding trick Theory of conduct The Shining (film) French Defence Sleep Dream Heinkel He 112 Pitaten Apollo 8 The Critic Knots Landing Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Social rule Jam (TV series) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Massage Bedbug Good Morning, Vietnam Phoebe Halliwell Undergarment Volleyball Sin City Narcolepsy Wheel of Fortune Breastfeeding The Amazing Race Carpal tunnel syndrome Daylight saving time Hip fracture Diving Humphrey Bogart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Movie projector Odysseus Naruto jutsu Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Professional wrestling match types Quicksort Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Pok__mon Live!

i have a question is acid reflux deadly what can i do to make it go away without going to the doctor thank you so much acid reflux is not deadly don't go to a doctor for this their solution is ridiculous and shows their ignorance of how the body works acid reflux is a term the drug companies have coined to put a label on a problem that is generating billion dollars a year to the drug companies the way it is portrayed is a farce and the drug companies know it and are promoting a solution that is not a cure but a perpetual drug solution that leads to many other problems and diseases as well as promoting more and more antacids to be taken on a regular basis once you understand what acid reflux is the solution is simple and can be cured forever it is not complicated but doctors pharmacists and drug companies are promoting antacids as if this is a cure it is not there is a home remedy that will help but you need some additional things that will solve the problem and create a cure for you people are suffering for no reason at all heart burn acid in digestion acid reflux is caused by the lack of stomach acid over of people over are suffering from in medical terms the condition of hypochloridia in simple terms this condition is due to the lack of stomach acid being in the stomach at the right time to digest food in the stomach as we age we produce less and less stomach acid by the time we are we are producing only about of the stomach acid we did when we were at to we are only producing about or less of what we did at this lack of stomach acid is also due to the fact we are eating cooked foods processed foods as well as age our bodies were designed to eat raw uncooked food when we eat cooked and or processed foods we use up the stomach acid at a faster rate in addition to us producing less stomach acid as we age when this lack of stomach acid condition exists the food we eat does not get digested and lactic acid is produced from the rotting fermenting food it is this lactic acid that causes the so called heartburn not stomach acid when anyone takes the advice of a health professional i guess that s why they are practicing medicine or a drug company on this issue and take antacids they are making the problem worse not better when the stomach ph is raised by the antacids the higher ph glob of rotting food then goes into the jejunum top of the small intestine close to the stomach where calcium magnesium and zinc are usually absorbed but the calcium magnesium and zinc can only be absorbed when the food is acidic from the stomach so guess what happens right the person becomes deficient in these minerals the problems that antacids create are loved by drug companies because the constipation diarrhea cramps and other diseases that come from the toxic undigested rotting food cause people to run out and buy more garbage drugs that create even more problems it does not stop there the fact that the rotting food is not acidic as it passes on through the intestines the higher ph does not trigger the alkali to be secreted further down the intestines and other nutrients do not get absorbed people are literally starving themselves of valuable nutrients a direct result of this is the larger waste line people develop this is probably the most blatant shameful example of what is happening to the american public from drug companies in our modern world the solution is so simple and very inexpensive the solution is to take a high quality betaine hcl after each meal and you will get no heartburn because the food is being digested now this process takes about minutes to happen if you also take an activator that contains nutrients like potassium you will remethylate cells and extend your life expectancy i also recommend a good digestive enzyme to be taken with each meal i purchase several bottles of the betaine hcl that will last me many months in relatively small quantities my cost is about for about capsules compare that cost with the drug company s solution the good thing is that it is not a chemical but a nutrient that your body utilizes naturally the home remedy is pink sea salt if you eat about teaspoon per day this will encourage your body to produce more stomach acid as well i strongly suggest you not go out and buy some pills of betaine hcl because those pills contain magnesium stearate and other excipients that keep the product from working well i purchase a dozen bottles at a time from www healthline cc not com because their products do not contain all the toxic tagalongs other pills do and you get the best results from them and i find them very reasonably priced i personally take after each meal to betaine hcl and to activator digestive enzyme during the meal and i never ever get acid indigestion problems everyone yes everyone whom i have suggested this to has solved their problem immediately you will be amazed at how effective this is and wonder why the drug companies doctors and pharmacies do not tell you about this you will also be amazed at how well you are digesting your food the energy you feel and how well you eliminate this is all because you will now be digesting your food and it won t end up as a spare tire around your rib cage good luck to you  Adjustable gastric band H2-receptor antagonist Food Pharmaceutical company Ammonia Fecal

why do mosquitos seem to bite certain people more my husband and older daughter hardly every get bitten but my younger daughter and i get bitten constantly and itch terribly she and i have fairer skin but otherwise i don't know any differences that would account for the big difference first of all you might be interested to know that only femalemosquitos bite people some people are tastier than other people mosquitos are very picky okay now for the serious info what attracts mosquitoes to me why some people seem to be more attractive than others to mosquitoes is the subject of much repellent and attractant for traps research being conducted nationwide carbon dioxide is the most universally recognized mosquito attractant and draws mosquitoes from up to meters when female mosquitoes sense carbon dioxide they usually adopt a zigzagging flight path within the plume to locate its source once in the general vicinity of a potential host other cues predominate including body odors sweat lactic acid etc and heat odors produced by skin microflora also play a part in inducing the mosquito to land over compounds have been isolated from odors produced by human skin either singly or in combination many of these compounds may be attractants and many may be repellents as you can see the situation is complicated and will require many years of testing before it can be sorted out visual stimuli such as movement also factor into host seeking what can be safely stated though is that ingestion of garlic vitamin b and other systemics has been proven in controlled laboratory studies to have no impact on mosquito biting conversely eating bananas did not attract mosquitoes as the myth suggests but wearing perfumes does people drinking beer have been shown to be more attractive to mosquitoes limburger cheese has also been found to be attractive scientists have theorized that this may explain the attractancy some mosquitoes find for human feet http www mosquito org mosquito information faq aspx  Mosquito Malaria Carbon dioxide DDT Explosive material Anopheles Milk Cheese Aspartame Photosynthesis Global warming Psoriasis Psychology Acne Physical attractiveness Biodiesel Skin Gravity Hypoglycemia Biological pest control Zinc Alcohol fuel Hydrogen Cat Omega-3 fatty acid Biochemistry Climate change Fecal incontinence Sewage treatment Bedbug Dog Homeostasis Brain Flatulence Vampire Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Biology and sexual orientation Perfume Sulfur Scientific method Titanium Hard water Renewable energy Volcano Carbon Sweating Cannabinoids Hydrogen economy Solar variation Future energy development Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Abiogenic petroleum origin Crohn's disease Energy development Wind power Fuel injection Methanol Helicobacter pylori Alcohol Cancer DEET First aid Lyme disease Plutonium Sun Acid Genetically modified food Ice core Coal Puberty Yoghurt Breastfeeding Animal testing Abortion debate Welding Organic food LSD Air safety Linus Pauling Science Molybdenum Garlic Water (molecule) Mars Cyanocobalamin House Mouse Ozone depletion Sense Human sexual behavior

why are people so addicted tickling for starters i would like to say that hotfries and giggledude both gave excellent answers there are a number of reasons that people become addicted to tickling the first thing i like to distinguish between is whether the tickling is consensual or non consensual if it is non consensual generally the tickler likes to tickle others or one victim because it is a form of a power trip and he she enjoys having the power to make the other person people laugh without being able to stop it sometime the tickler is just addicted to the laugher in my book non consensual tickling is of the time blatantly disrespectful to the ticklee in a few cases the ticklee does enjoy non consensual tickling but the vast majority of the time the tickler can cause emotional harm to the tickler if they tickle too much or too long many children especially girls were tickle tortured too much as children and they are unable to enjoy the wonderful benefits of consensual tickling now with consensual tickling the tickler and the ticklee usually trust and respect each other and want to keep the tickling fun for both parties for the tickler he she can feel pleasure from making the tickle laugh because they know that the ticklee is enjoying it too the ticklee can still have a feeling of power the tickler cannot stop them from tickling where ever they want to when ever they want to any way that they want to with their fingers or with toys while still respecting the limits concerns desires feelings and boundaries of their tickle partner for the ticklee and frequently the tickler they benefit in a few ways first when you laugh at a joke a comedy movie or even a playful tickling attack or encounter the laughter causes your brain to flood your body with endorphins endorphins reduce stress promote healing and in some cases improves sleeping for a limited time for me tickling is as much a form of affection as a back scratch a massage or a hug if my tickle partner is not having fun with it i can't enjoy the encounter either as other's have stated i really feel refreshed invigorated and happy when i have been given a long playful tickling even when i am tossing and turning in my restraints attempting to escape the wonderful tickling i hope that this answers your question all the best to you  Tickling Sadism and masochism Spidey Super Stories Breastfeeding Infantilism Human sexual behavior Drug addiction BDSM Motivation Reflexology Joke Consensus decision-making Sexual orientation Stuttering Bondage (BDSM) Self-harm 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hypnosis Strap-on dildo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Serial killer Asperger syndrome The Merchant of Venice Goodness and value theory The Dunciad Care Bears Child sexuality Meditation Utilitarianism YuYu Hakusho Avenue Q Domestic violence Physical intimacy Clinical depression Civil rights Nicomachean Ethics Oral sex Abortion debate Masturbation Religion Negima Consensual crime Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Property (ownership right) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drug abuse Milton H.

how do you get rid of bad breathe one of the best and most effective things i've seen is to remove the source of bad breath after all brushing your teeth flossing and rinses only take care of your mouth your breath comes from deeper down often in the stomach try a good dose of chlorophyll it's a natural cleanser and detoxifier that works very well to clean the mouth when used as a rinse the stomach and the digestive tract both when swallowed the main thing to watch out for is that some people have a very cleansing effect from it mostly those that don't have a lot of fiber in their diet or don't have very good digestion because of that you may want to start out with a low dose to see how you respond to it then increase it as you see fit namely as your body can handle it to be on the safe side you may want to check with a doctor that knows about supplements to see how much of a dose would be safe to take daily  Dietary fiber Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Halitosis Stomach cancer Tocopherol Folic acid Oral hygiene First aid Fecal incontinence Foodborne illness Vitamin C Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Omega-3 fatty acid Guinea pig Cyanide Gastrointestinal tract Radiation therapy Nutrition Oral sex Paracetamol Ionizing radiation Antiretroviral drug Antipsychotic Anxiety Digestion Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Autonomic nervous system Diving Vomiting Fluoride therapy Aspirin Insulin Healthy eating Topiramate Gastroparesis Domestic rabbit Glossitis Hamster Dental caries Hyperthermia Cephalexin Epilepsy Chlorpromazine Gingivitis Drowning Tooth enamel Cat Colorectal cancer Hydrogen peroxide Mosquito Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Carnivorous plant Chronic fatigue syndrome Weight training Cancer of the larynx Rebreather Stomach Nuclear fallout Crohn's disease Adjustable gastric band Pneumonia Crocodilia Vitamin D Cystic fibrosis Triage Atkins Nutritional Approach Diverticulosis Hiccup Theory of conduct Urinary incontinence Haloperidol Elephant Raw food diet Dialysis Sewage treatment Mouth ulcer Ulcerative colitis Pig (zodiac) Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Heartburn Maprotiline COX-2 inhibitor Esophagus Dog Botulism Fishing Fancy rat Dieting Diabetes mellitus Snake Cyanocobalamin Ferret Menstrual cup

what are electrolytes and what do they do for you electrolyte is a medical scientific term for salt electrolytes are important because they are what your cells especially nerve heart muscle use to maintain voltages across their cell membranes and to carry electrical impulses nerve impulses muscle contractions across themselves and to other cells your kidneys work to keep the electrolyte concentrations in your blood constant despite changes in your body for example when you exercise heavily you lose electrolytes in your sweat particularly sodium and potassium these electrolytes must be replaced to keep the electrolyte concentrations of your body fluids constant so many sports drinks have sodium chloride or potassium chloride added to them they also have sugar and flavorings to provide your body with extra energy and to make the drink taste better another example where electrolyte drinks are important is when infants children have chronic vomiting or diarrhea perhaps due to intestinal flu viruses when children vomit or have diarrhea they lose electrolytes again these electrolytes and the fluids must be replaced to prevent dehydration and seizures therefore drinks such as pedialyte have sodium and potassium in them like the sports drinks do however pediatricians do not recommend giving sports drinks to a sick child sports drinks have much higher sugar concentrations than pedialyte and the high sugar is not a proper treatment hope this helps  Diarrhea Action potential Diabetes mellitus Rehydration Intravenous therapy Sodium chloride Diabetic ketoacidosis Hypoglycemia Pneumonia Protein-energy malnutrition Potassium Nutrition Potassium chloride Membrane potential Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vomiting Metabolic acidosis Hyperthermia Traumatic brain injury Kidney Alcohol Hydrochloric acid Bodybuilding Edible salt Glycogen storage disease type I Gatorade Diabetes insipidus Water Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aspartame Stomach cancer Insulin Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Potassium bromide Sodium Fecal incontinence Chlorine First aid Urine Muscle Electrophysiology Ion channel Cancer Tocopherol Vitamin C Poison Adrenal gland Gastric acid Hypokalemia Nephron Clinical depression Diabetic coma Blood Gastroenteritis Cyanide Autonomic nervous system Hypomagnesemia Urinary incontinence Cholera Cardiac pacemaker Milk 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Salt NaKATPase Chronic fatigue syndrome Lithium Cirrhosis Folic acid Myasthenia gravis Lupus erythematosus Balance disorder Prostate cancer Renal physiology Atrial fibrillation Chemotherapy Battery (electricity) Hyperkalemia Eye Ebola Current (electricity) Resting potential Cramp Weight training Acute renal failure Hiking Epilepsy Common cold Aspirin Radiation poisoning Cocaine Myocardial infarction Hyponatremia

what are some good ways to build up your self confidence how to build self confidence you want to be confident and feel confident but what if you're starting with little or no confidence how do you get from point a to point b true self confidence isn't an overnight acquisition it takes dedication to realize you are a good human being that is worthy of respect and love steps recognize your insecurities what does that scolding voice in the back of your mind say what makes you ashamed of yourself this could be anything from acne to regrets to emotional abuse past or present from a loved one or friends at school whatever is making you feel unworthy ashamed or inferior identify it give it a name and write it down talk about it with friends and loved ones wear it on your sleeve each day chip away at it wear it down there's no quick fix get to the root of the problem focus on it and understand that you need to resolve each issue before you can move on remember that nobody is perfect even the most confident people have insecurities at some point in any of our lives we may feel we lack something that is reality learn that life is full of bumps down the road identify your successes everyone is good at something so discover the things at which you excel then focus on your talents give yourself permission to take pride in them give yourself credit for your successes inferiority is a state of mind in which you've declared yourself a victim do not allow yourself to be victimized be thankful for what you have a lot of the times at the root of insecurity and lack of confidence is a feeling of not having enough of something whether it's emotional validation good luck money etc by acknowledging and appreciating what you do have you can combat the feeling of being incomplete and unsatisfied finding that inner peace will do wonders for your confidence be positive even if you don't feel positive avoid self pity or the pity and sympathy of others never allow others to make you feel inferior they can only do so if you let them if you continue to loathe and belittle yourself others are going to do and believe likewise instead speak positively about yourself about your future and about your progress do not be afraid to project your strengths and qualities to others by doing so you reinforce those ideas in your mind and encourage your growth in a positive direction look in the mirror and smile studies surrounding what's called the facial feedback theory suggest that the expressions on your face can actually encourage your brain to register certain emotions so by looking in the mirror and smiling every day you might feel happier with yourself and more confident in the long run i am gorgeous huh i am gorgeous huh fake it along the same lines of smiling to make yourself feel happy acting confident might actually make you believe it pretend you're a completely confident version of you go through the motions and see how you feel express yourself whether it's through art music writing etc find something you enjoy everyone is born with talents and strengths you can develop and excel in yours if it's difficult to name two or three things you have some ability in or just plain love to do think about things others do that you would like to do too and take some lessons or join an enthusiasts club when you're following your passion not only will it have a therapeutic effect but you'll feel unique and accomplished all of which can help build your self confidence plus adding a variety of interests to your life will not only make you more confident but it will increase your chances of meeting compatible friends stick to your principles it might be tough but if you don't have something you can believe in you don't have anything no matter what's happened in your life you can always lay claim to the fact that from this day forward you've followed your principles to the best of your ability tips exercise and eat healthy exercise raises adrenaline and makes one feel happier and healthier it is certainly an easy and effective way to boost your self confidence when you're feeling superbly insecure write down a list of things that are good about you then read the list back you'd be surprised at what you can come up with turn feelings of envy or jealousy into a desire to achieve stop wanting what others have just because they have it seek things simply because you want them whether anybody else has them or not don't be afraid to push yourself a bit a little bit of pressure can actually show just how good you are take a wilderness experience course such as those found at outward bound or nols learning how to survive in the wilderness will build your confidence in other areas of life too you can also try taking a martial arts or fitness class course or both this will help build confidence and strength invest in some new clothing and donate some of your old clothing to send a message to yourself that you both look sharp and feel sharp try to make yourself talk positively at all times when you hear yourself saying you can't do something stop and say you can unless you try you will never know whether you are able to or not warnings don't get wrapped up in your mistakes and dwell on bad points they can contrast your good points or even give you something to improve there's no feeling like being good at something you were really bad at don't confuse what you have with who you are people degrade their self worth when comparing possessions surround yourself with nurturing friends not overly critical individuals who make you feel inadequate or insecure this could do great harm and damage to your self confidence do not try to become confident in the interest of finding a partner you will regret creating a false personality

podiatrists orthotics shin splints dear podiatrists are custom orthotics a scam i e are they any better than over the counter do they have any value for a tennis player i have a mildly severe case of shin splints as i apparently have flat feet i read somewhere that orthotics will do little to help out with the shin splints they're intended for long term correction if orthotics won't eliminate my shin splints as caused by tennis or running a lot in a short period what can i do anyone had experience with custom orthotics and shin splints does anyone also play tennis had shin splints and then resolved it through custom orthotics dear patient i'm not a podiatrist i'm a kinesiologist who has custom made orthotics from some people custom made orthotics are the only option and there is no one that won't benefit from them from myself to friends to patients and clients i've seen many people correct many issues with proper orthodics they have value for everyone whose feet have stopped growing flat feet can aggravate shin splints but they are caused by weak soft tissue mostly weak muscles close to your tibia shin bone before shelling out for orthotics do feet exercise for weeks first ice your shins and use braces properly placed type of foam on your shins before during and after running be sure the soles of your shoes are not worn out no old sneakers see if that impacts it first that corrected my shin splints however i still needed orthodics to correct my gait warning your shins calves and feet will be in much pain for the first few weeks of having orthodics and using them this is because of muscles being used that are always used in that way what exercises put a towel under your bare foot flat on floor pull it towards you with your toes repeat often do calf raises off a stair  Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Callus Iliotibial band syndrome Running High-heeled shoe Shoe Flat feet Stress fracture Massage Professional wrestling holds First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

my little toe is bleeding bumped into a metal bar do i have to go to the hospital for that injection it's not very deep i think unless it is a deep gash you probably do not need a tetanus shot or stitches but stitches can only be applied within the first hours of injury clean the area with peroxide solution that is diluted peroxide and water never use just peroxide without diluting it as it will damage the surrounding skin dry carefully and you could apply a little otc antibiotic ointment if you must cover it use a small gauze bandage not a bandaid a bandaid will only make the area moist and you want to keep it clean and dry as bacteria grows in moist mediums leave the toe exposed to air as much as possible to aid in healing if it is broken it might turn purple and even if it isn't it might be painful for a while but there is nothing a hospital will do for a small toe fracture you can elevate it to reduce swelling and pressure to the area but watch it carefully for signs of increased redness swelling or discharge which signals it is infected then you need to see a doctor usually this is more painful than serious  Wound Hydrogen peroxide Acne Intravenous therapy Bruise Dialysis First aid kit Tattoo Body piercing Gout Conjunctivitis Traumatic brain injury Eczema Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mouth ulcer Bone fracture Decompression sickness Sterilization (microbiology) Disinfection Ammonia Diving Urinary incontinence Halitosis Tesla coil Pneumonia Ulcer Otitis externa Aloe Carpal tunnel syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Organic peroxide Cocaine Myocardial infarction Paracetamol Callus Gonorrhoea Wisdom teeth Tuberculosis Mosquito Fire extinguisher Tourniquet Anthrax Intracranial pressure Equine conformation Radiation therapy Casting Skin graft Ultraviolet Osteoarthritis Penis Rebreather Traditional Chinese medicine Chemoluminescence Antiseptic Virus Fancy rat Wound healing phases Battery (electricity) Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Escherichia coli O157:H7 Snakebite (bite) Diabetes mellitus Explosive material Professional wrestling holds Childbirth Mercury (element) Terminal ballistics Chalazion Cancer Allergy Massage Scar Skin Fecal incontinence Electrophysiology Stomach cancer Bacteria Chronic fatigue syndrome Spider Bleeding Gangrene Drill bit Tooth enamel Diabetic retinopathy Sunburn Gilding Rocky Mountain spotted fever Candidiasis Comfrey

what is the efficacy of meditation in reducing stress i have developed simple nonsectarian universal spiritual practices based on my experience and background with various religious and spiritual paths for me the purpose of any spiritual practice is to encourage self reflection internalizing this awareness and to develop wonder gratitude and awareness of the interdependent forces of the universe here are the simple techniques that i have developed for both chanting and silent meditation practice your specific posture does not matter if you are uncomfortable sitting on the floor you can sit on a chair with feet flat on the floor way of oneness chanting practice being more musically inclined i created a nonsectarian alternative to the combination of chanting a rhythmic phrase or mantra to a visual object often a scroll picture or statue this is a more active form of meditation as compared to the silent form of meditation which is discussed below you are more than welcome to use this chanting practice if you think you may find it possibly useful while there are many folks that seem to believe their particular mantra which is a phrase which is repeated as a focusing device has magical power it really is the mindfulness that matters the mantra is just one of the vehicles you can use to get there i recommend be one be love be peace as the chanting and meditation mantra which is appropriate for nonsectarian universal spirituality in the way of oneness this phrase is a reframing and translation of the hindu term satchitananda which means pure being pure consciousness and pure bliss and is another way of referring to the interdependent forces of the universe or the universal divine or brahman or god or goddess or dharmakaya or whatever label you prefer i use two forms be one be peace for those who prefer a four syllable mantra or more often i recommend be one be love be peace for those who prefer the pace of a six syllable mantra as in drumming people who like to chant are attracted to the rhythm and they find it an easy way to center themselves and become mindful the specific chanting practice method that i find helpful in the vein of the way of oneness the realization of interdependence is to chant be one be love be peace in a position of reverence palms together in front of chest with fingers pointing upward a traditional gesture of respect to a picture or photograph of the planet earth which is a wonderful visual representation of the interdependent forces of the universe just chant this phrase loudly or softly in a comfortable pace until you are satisfied silent meditation practice in the way of oneness meditation is simply learning to live in the moment when nothing distracts you and when you are not tied to the past or anxious about the future in meditation you become peacefully aware of your real self the more you use it the more aware you become when you learn to live life for each moment to enjoy and appreciate life to the fullest at that moment you suddenly become impervious to the myraid of doubts and fears that you've lived with all your life there are a couple of simple techniques for silent meditation as well you do not have to sit on the floor you can sit with erect back on a chair many people say try for minutes twice a day i say start with a simpler goal minutes twice per day the benefits include stress management and relaxation benefits which help the body increased mindfulness and focus and increased energy the mindfulness can be a benefit to your spiritual life but meditation also has non spiritual benefits here are two easy techniques breathing meditation check posture close your eyes and relax focus on your breath entering and leaving your body count breaths mentally one to four repeat don't fight a wandering mind but calmly direct it back to task sit for a minute afterwards mantra technique choose a personal calm word or phrase that you will repeat in your meditation i use the nonsectarian be one be love be peace and as above in the breathing meditation listen to your breathing and let it relax you with each breath once you are relaxed mentally hear your calm word or phrase in your mind let it repeat in your mind don't fight a wandering mind but calmly direct it back to task sit for a minute afterwards conclusion that is all there is to these very simple but beneficial silent meditation and chanting techniques many people think that something mystical should happen during meditation or chanting most often nothing happens and nothing should be expected i hope these are helpful be one be love be peace namaste dave  Neuro-linguistic programming Samadhi Vipassana Past teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Stuttering Vishnu sahasranama God Bhajan

yawning me and mom were waching a commercial the other day and on this commercial the pepole were all yawning after it got to the middle we were both yawning whats the deal i v though about this befor and kinda just blew it off so are yawns contagious a yawn is a semi automatic reflex that originates in the brain stem in response to a lower level of oxygen in the brain yawning also occurs when a person loses interest in their surroundings i e gets bored it does not necessarily indicate fatigue although people do tend to yawn when they're sleepy a study was done in which heart rate skin effects and muscle tension were measured in young adults before during and after yawns they found that yawning did increase their level of arousal for a short time yawning is an action that occurs throughout the animal kingdom cats in particular seem to yawn a great deal in the late s several studies were done in rats and it was found that rats yawned more in the early morning before awakening and also when they were very hungry several different brain chemicals seem to be involved in yawning but the mechanisms are still not understood for example yawning seems to be contagious why is that just reading about yawning made me yawn several times in your case i doubt that a lack of oxygen is the main reason you yawn since your yawning spells seem to occur mainly around bedtime or during the middle of the night they probably are related to being sleepy and groggy  Yawn Sleep Narcolepsy Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Brain Eye Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Decompression sickness Drowning Biology and sexual orientation Psychosis Ozone depletion Autism Radiation therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Reflexology Homeostasis Ozone hole Weight training Diazepam Explosive material Muscle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetes mellitus Herpes simplex virus Heart Cephalic disorder Puberty Stopping power Reticular formation Epilepsy Dieting Fibromyalgia Parkinson's disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Clomipramine Welding Rabies Second language acquisition Intelligence quotient Child sexual abuse Cognitive science Wound healing phases Social psychology Nutrition Psoriasis Ozone layer Cat Fire fighting Human brain Tourette syndrome Motivation Cancer Intracranial pressure Vomiting Coma Insomnia Leukemia Clinical depression Asthma Urination Health issues and the effects of cannabis Multiple sclerosis Wood Thermoregulation Methamphetamine Myocardial infarction The Secret of NIMH Stuttering Planetary nebula Aphasia Allergy Functional magnetic resonance imaging 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate DNA repair Stem cell Biofeedback Daylight saving time Baldness Person Ojibwe language Gasoline Ear Mobile phone radiation and health M16 (rifle)

why do people say 'bless you' when you sneeze and not when you cough where did the tradition of saying 'bless you' come from after one sneezes there are many variations as to why we say bless you or god bless you when we sneeze at one time people believed a man's soul could be inadvertently thrust from his body by an explosive sneeze thus bless you was a protective oath uttered to safeguard the temporarily expelled and vulnerable soul from being snatched up by satan who was always lurking nearby the purpose of the oath was to cast a temporary shield over the flung out soul which would protect it just long enough to regain the protection of the corporeal body conversely the sneeze itself was the expulsion of a demon or evil spirit which had taken up residence in a person therefore although the bless you was again a protective charm meant to protect the sneezer from evil in this version it was meant to ward off the re entry of an evil spirit which a tormented soul had just rid itself of another one is the heart was believed to momentarily stop during a sneeze it doesn't thus the bless you was uttered either as a supplication for life to return or as a congratulation upon its successful restart other than that i do not know anymore good question  Demon Hell Charmed Sneeze Exorcism Reincarnation Ayyavazhi mythology Incarnations of Immortality Angel Original sin Phoebe Halliwell Holy Spirit Phaedo Sola fide Ten Commandments Immortality Ayya Vaikundar Heaven Animism Paige Matthews Amulet Soul Devil Kain (Legacy of Kain) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Adam and Eve Daedra Naraku Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Anointing Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Evil Amidah Magic (paranormal) Matthew 5 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Blood (computer game) Mortification of the flesh Summa Theologiae YuYu Hakusho Death (personification) Common cold Perseverance of the saints Legend of Mana Demonic possession Cathar Michael (archangel) Demonology Oh My Goddess!

how long would a person have to continue on taking the drug before he becomes addicted i'm just wondering whether a person can try a drug and not get addicted to it or if there are stages that a person has to go through before he gets addicted how quickly a person will get addicted to a drug depends upon a lot of factors including his genes and the biology of his body differences among persons may cause one to take a drug and not be harmed by it at first but it could also cause another person to overdose on the first use and face severe consequences there are also stages that a person will go through before he is considered an addict the first would be the stage of experimenting if a person takes a drug once and never does so again then the stage of experimenting would be just that and the person will not turn into an addict however when the person has come to terms with the feeling of euphoria and keeps on taking the drug again and again until he becomes dependent upon it then that's when he has become addicted to the drug  Drug addiction Addiction Drug abuse Methamphetamine Narcotic Opioid Alcoholism Bipolar disorder Cocaine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Illegal drug trade Cannabis (drug) Diazepam Rat Park Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Motivation Clinical depression Psychedelic drug Substance abuse Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Amphetamine Hypoglycemia Anxiety Sexual orientation Prostate cancer LSD Withdrawal Red Hot Chili Peppers Cancer Paracetamol Consensual crime Tobacco smoking Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs The Hasheesh Eater Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Antidepressant Biology Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Grief Alprazolam Suicide Controlled Substances Act Borderline personality disorder Harm reduction Drug overdose Sexual addiction Paroxetine Bradley Nowell Doxepin Traumatic brain injury Pharmaceutical company Medicine Sleep Obsessive-compulsive disorder Buprenorphine Lorazepam Human sexual behavior Urinary incontinence Orgasm Drug test Sid Vicious Psychosis Bene Gesserit Traditional Chinese medicine Hydrocodone Physician Daredevil John Holmes (actor) Speedball (drug) Transsexuality Abortion debate Suicide methods Arguments for and against drug prohibition Biology and sexual orientation Responsible drug use Amineptine Iggy Pop AIDS Hard drug Phil Anselmo Hepatitis C Psychology of religion Adverse effect (medicine) Dopamine Epilepsy Crystal methamphetamine and sex Twin Hypnosis Death Kurt Cobain Fitz Hugh Ludlow Anorexia nervosa Barbiturate Methadone Morphine Human Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Duesberg hypothesis Narcissism Domestic violence

for addiction treatment to work does the person have to really want it i am amazed at the number of persons i know who are off to rehab but don't seem to want to go wouldn't forcing them to go be futile well the two of the common reasons why people are in drug rehabs are because the court mandated them to do so or because their loved ones convinced them to go and get themselves treated a lot of research has shown that those who enter drug treatment programs because of pressure can benefit from treatment despite the fact that they were forced to do so in the first place treatment programs that offer continuing care may be better for these people  Drug addiction Health care in the United States Health insurance Alcoholism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Addiction Psychiatry Kurt Cobain Stomach cancer Buprenorphine Alternative medicine Involuntary commitment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Duesberg hypothesis Prostate cancer Controlled Substances Act Whitney Houston Cancer AIDS in Africa Antidepressant Antiretroviral drug Growth hormone treatment Traumatic brain injury Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Drug abuse Bradley Nowell Hearsay Clinical depression Arguments for and against drug prohibition Obsessive-compulsive disorder Affirmative action National Institutes of Health Red Hot Chili Peppers Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Theory of conduct Acne Randomized controlled trial Palliative care Harm reduction Common cold The O.C.

is marijuana a threat or a menace please explain your answer no you legalize the drug you remove the bad things price goes down demand goes down because it's less cool the seedy element is replaced by corporate brands it's like prohibition you legalize the booze the gangsters go away also it removes the gateway effect because the next step is illegal cause the individual to consider whether its worth the risk or not the reason medicinal marijuana is outlawed is because it's so cheap drug companies can't overprice the hell out of it and it's benefits can't be isolated extracted and inflated in price so the lobbies get the competition out of the game it's whole prohibition is a tale of companies controlling the legality of a benign substance  Cannabis (drug) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Illegal drug trade Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Medical cannabis Legal issues of cannabis Prohibition Controlled Substances Act Prohibition (drugs) Free trade Cocaine Food and Drug Administration Cancer Intellectual property Consensual crime Microeconomics Drug policy of the Netherlands Addiction Health insurance Alcoholic beverage Cigarette Drug test Breastfeeding Black market Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Conspiracy Drug addiction Economic shortage Gonzales v.

what are the benefits of substance abuse treatment i mean aside from the fact that it would get to treat an individual and make him sober again it's just that addiction treatments cost so much that i was just wondering if it's really worth it look at it this way when you enter a person into a substance abuse treatment program you would be giving that one person another chance to better his life if he does succeed in recovering from his substance abuse problem that's one person that will be able to resume his productivity and be of help to society besides think of the money that an addict spends for the drugs he consumes there are times wherein an addict is so desperate to get drugs that he is practically forced to steal just so he could appease his craving if that addict is then treated for his addiction then he wouldn't have to spend so much on drugs and there would also be less violence though treatment programs for substance abusers may be costly i think it's all worth it  Alcoholism Drug addiction Addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Drug abuse Alcoholics Anonymous Health care in the United States Cocaine Controlled Substances Act Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Anxiety Schizophrenia Methylphenidate Borderline personality disorder Antiretroviral drug Convention on Psychotropic Substances Consensual crime Publicly funded medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Drug policy of the Netherlands Narcotic Cancer Pharmaceutical company Harm reduction Illegal drug trade Rat Park Diazepam Prohibition (drugs) Methamphetamine Tax Food and Drug Administration Traditional Chinese medicine Clinical depression Ibogaine Drug test Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Psychiatry Animal testing Obsessive-compulsive disorder Migraine Medicine Sexual addiction Domestic violence Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Narcotics Anonymous Microeconomics Methadone Anti-psychiatry Babylon 5 Bradley Nowell Veganism Duesberg hypothesis Folic acid National Institutes of Health Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Antidepressant Neurofeedback War on Drugs Word of Wisdom Waste management John Holmes (actor) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Mental illness United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Withdrawal LSD Dissociative identity disorder Inflation Barbara Hutton Lorazepam Narcissism Inhalant Malaria Theory of conduct Pornography addiction Rape Psoriasis Medical prescription AIDS in Africa Oxycodone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Capitalism Homelessness Property (ownership right) Buprenorphine Obesity Goodness and value theory Food irradiation Transsexuality Involuntary commitment Post-traumatic stress disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Chemotherapy

what can i do i've felt sick for over hours now i think it's because of a medicine i took but not sure but it won't go away and i'm just really tired and can't get to sleep b c i feel sick plus i'm really really afraid of throwing up so you can imagine this is causing me great distress so my question is how can i get rid of this sick feeling so i can go to sleep please help did you overdose accidently if you think you overdosed then you need to get to an emergency room right away not all overdoses are intentional i work in trauma icu so believe me i know if not then you are going to just have to let the meds run their course and let your body flush it out of your system for now rest as much as possible in a cool comfortable room place a cool washcloth on your forehead and make sure you have something cold to drink nearby water or gatorade take small frequent sips to avoid throwing up you can try eating something light such as saltine crackers or dry toast this will help reduce your nausea throwing up is your body's way of removing things out of your system that are making you ill although not pleasant it is necessary to remove things from your stomach that are causing upset the most important thing to remember is to keep yourself hydrated so you don't become dehydratd and end up in the emergency room having to get iv fluids if you have someone to do it or feel up to it yourself you can go to the nearest drugstore and pick up some pedialyte it's an electrolyte solution made for children who are vomiting or have diarrhea this helps keep electrolytes in your system to prevent dehydration adults can use it too this could just be a hour stomach bug and could have nothing to do with your medication just rest as much as possible and make sure to drink i wouldn't take anything that would make you sleepy b c if you're feeling sick and have to get up in the nite to vomit the meds to help you sleep could slow down your response time hope you feel better soon  Dehydration Stomach cancer Diarrhea Hyperthermia Rehydration Electrolyte First aid Drowning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Pneumonia Charles Darwin's illness Paracetamol Vomiting Traumatic brain injury Foodborne illness Sulfasalazine Decompression sickness Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Sleep Common cold Diabetic coma Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Motion sickness Radiation poisoning Caffeine Gastroparesis 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Insomnia Malaria Glycogen storage disease type I Cholera Gout Psoriasis Ekadasi Nutrition Balance disorder Gastroenteritis Dialysis Topiramate Medicine Aspirin Chemotherapy Acute respiratory distress syndrome Sauna Intravenous therapy Protein-energy malnutrition Customs and etiquette of Japan Gatorade Diabetes insipidus Drug overdose One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Suicide methods Cocaine Clinical depression Diabetic ketoacidosis Botulism Sleep apnea Milton H.

what is the efficacy of mediation in reducing stress meditation my bad from observation i am not sure of medication's efficacy in reducing stress rather they say that physical exercise and good diet plus rest will help to alleviate stress more than pumping medication into your body even having a notebook to enter all your thoughts to see it on paper can unjumble things in your mind's consideration a brisk walk in the sunshine in the middle of the day maybe during your work lunch hour taking a few mins to break away they say that there are feel good hormones that get stimulated in your brain that come from exposing yourself to some sunlight medications can help some but our bodies are made fearfully and wonderfully and has many self healing properties i know of friends who personally got stressed out over their medication concerned if they would become slaves to its usage or do if meds will do gradual damage to their liver hopefully more people under stress would evaluate their lives and opt to get out there and get active rather than pop a pill of some sort good question sandy  Clinical depression Prostate cancer Folic acid Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep Medicine Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Hypoglycemia Obesity Stress (medicine) Carpal tunnel syndrome Tocopherol Insomnia Pneumonia Post-traumatic stress disorder Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Cancer Autism Tobacco smoking Alzheimer's disease Multiple sclerosis Acne Dieting Panic attack Psoriasis Prayer Infantilism Vitamin D Reparative therapy Alexander Technique Psychology of religion Herpes simplex virus Hypertension Borderline personality disorder Glucocorticoid Scientology beliefs and practices Cannabis (drug) Alternative medicine Sunlight Bipolar disorder Epilepsy Patent medicine Caffeine Puberty Decompression sickness Vitamin C Anthroposophy Immortality Chlorpromazine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychosurgery Stomach cancer Diazepam Oral sex Menstrual cycle Malaria Blood pressure Paget's disease of bone Chiropractic Fasting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone treatment Drug addiction Migraine Weight training Glucokinase Hearing impairment Out-of-body experience Neurofeedback Obsessive-compulsive disorder Fibromyalgia Asthma Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis Falun Gong Sigmund Freud Stuttering Nutrition Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Dualism (philosophy of mind) Aikido A Course In Miracles Philosophy of mind Cocaine Tai Chi Chuan Acupuncture Growth hormone deficiency Anger management Post Polio syndrome Abortion debate

i honestly think it might be a panic attack or something along those lines one day i went to school in your average black and white converse stupidly forgetting the school rules when i get to the door the security guard stops me and tells me to go and stand in the corner with the other kids who broke the uniform policy at first i was okay but cursing at myself then they took all of us to the cafiteria where i start to think the dreaded what ifs about what they were going to do with me if i was going to get in trouble and worsely what my parents were going to say as soon as they told us to sit i went to the front empty table then it was starting to get hard for me to breath i started crying hard my vision getting blurry then i was hardly able to breath the security guard took me to the bathroom and i had the feeling i had to vomit when i tried to nothing happened just me coughing heavily something similar happened month later when i got my first detention just not as bad nothing else has happened since march okay so it's pretty much a panic attack right as if my heart beat faster yes it does but does the fact that i have asthma sp have to do anything with this and if anyone is wondering no i don't use an inhaler i just have the petty kind of asthma but still it is asthma i finally got back to class when st period was half way done i didn't completely calm down till second period was complete also when i went to the rapids water park i suddenly had some chest pains my dad was worried but it happens once in a blue moon for me when i have chest pains well arn't i some peice of work p yeah that's a panic attack welcome to the club i feel you there i used to flip out when i got in trouble too now that i'm older i just have other things to flip out about i can't get through it without medication you may want to see your school counsellor or talk with your parents about it if they'll be available for you the best non medicine cure for a panic attack is distraction talk with a friend about something you or they like and try to do as much of the talking as possible it helps regulate your breathing and lie down if you feel dizzy or at least sit with your head on a desk or table passing out probably wouldn't make you feel any better p  Columbine High School massacre Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Asthma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Panic attack 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind God Emperor of Dune Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.

when you throw up are you throwing up the calories that you just ate for example if someone with bulimia just ate calories and went and threw them up are they throwing up all the calories along with the food that they just ate or do the calories get absorbed no i'm not think of becoming bulimic i'm very happy with my weight it was just a random question that i was curious about some of the calories they just ate would probably be absorbed it takes minutes for the stomach to process food and put it into the small intestine where the actual absorption process occurs if the food is still in the stomach then unless it's alcohol the body hasn't had a chance to absorb any calories yet  Anorexia nervosa Bulimia nervosa Gastric bypass surgery Stomach cancer Energy Stomach Vomiting Dietary fiber Aspartame Obesity Dieting Healthy eating Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Nutrition Weight loss Digestion Adjustable gastric band Small intestine Calorie Gastrointestinal tract Alcoholic beverage Diarrhea Veganism Hyperglycemia Low-carbohydrate diet Folic acid Glucose Tocopherol Foodborne illness Gastroparesis Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Chocolate Standard enthalpy change of fusion Egg (food) Orders of magnitude (energy) Blood alcohol content Milk Super Size Me Chicken Explosive material Tofu Bodybuilding Crohn's disease Omega-3 fatty acid Glycogen storage disease type I Fugu Maltitol Suicide methods Ton Eating South Beach diet Professional wrestling throws Hangover Hamburger Eating disorder Life extension Sucralose Binge eating disorder Raw food diet Cancer Overeaters Anonymous Pancreas Sushi Coeliac disease Olestra Drowning Naruto jutsu Spider Esophageal cancer Nuclear fission Glycerin Calorie restriction Polyols Ruminant Earthworm Malnutrition Lymphatic system Gastric acid Cheese Kashrut Food Peanut Happy Tree Friends Cassava Sleep Calorimeter Retinol Hydrochloric acid Pomegranate Opium YuYu Hakusho Laxative Protein-energy malnutrition Fasting Urinary incontinence Autonomic nervous system Fluoride

can certain vaccinations cause weight gain has there been thorough research on all vaccines more than enough research on vaccines i haven't heard of weigh gain caused by any vaccine especially since there isn't much besides bacteria dead or weakened viruses most often it's just small useless fragments that can't possibly cause disease or a toxin it's always just a small part of the molecule it can't act as a toxin in fact it often can help the body neutralize the actual toxin there might be swelling which i guess could cause water retention leading to weight gain i'm talking grams not pounds here  Vaccine Louis Pasteur Bioterrorism Anthrax Pneumonia AIDS HIV vaccine Smallpox Antiviral drug Virus H5N1 Vitamin C Antibody Diphtheria Diarrhea Poliomyelitis Tuberculosis Ebola Common cold Rabies Immune system Herpes simplex virus Spanish flu Foot-and-mouth disease Homeopathy Biological warfare Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Thimerosal Foodborne illness Vaccination Cancer Mumps Hepatitis Autism epidemic Jonas Salk Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Atkins Nutritional Approach Poison Tetanus Eutrophication MMR vaccine Cirrhosis Andrew Wakefield Genetically modified food Alzheimer's disease Meningitis Hand grenade Hepatitis C Autism Virulence Allergy Pathogen Hormesis Influenza Conjunctivitis Vaccine controversy Dieting Cystic fibrosis Botulin toxin Pasteur Institute Heat shock protein Controversies in autism Malaria Tyrannosaurus rex Yellow fever HIV The Curse of Fenric Algal bloom Medicine Chlorophyta Multiple sclerosis Syphon Filter HIV structure and genome Inflammation Cholera Pulmonary alveolus Rotavirus Haemophilus influenzae Raw food diet 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference Genetic engineering Bundaberg, Queensland Tetrodotoxin Emphysema Infectious disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Measles Obesity Genetically modified organism OPV AIDS hypothesis Sexually-transmitted infection Acne Mass Epidemic typhus Marburg virus Streptococcus pneumoniae Explosive material Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Tasmanian Devil

why did i feel this way i'm going to be a freshman and today was the first day of volleyball tryouts when i got there i felt fine and ready to work but as the tryouts progressed i started to feel sicker and sicker about minutes into the tryouts i started to have a little trouble breathing but that was just because i was working my body harder than i usually do and then i started to feel tired and a little dizzy lightheaded i think there the same thing eventually i started feeling like i was going to throw up and so i asked to go to the bathroom and i almost threw up but i didn't so i went to the bathroom and sat on the floor for a few minutes and i started to feel better i went to the bathroom because i didn't want to make a big deal out of it and ruin my chances i started feeling bad again so i asked my coach if i could sit and he asked if i felt dizzy lightheaded and i said no because again i didn't want to make a big deal out of it but i did say that my stomach sort of hurt and he said to just stand because that would be better than standing he also said to drink water but the water made me feel sick because it was warm i also forgot my water bottle and i was really thirsty so maybe i was dehydrated what do you think was wrong it was also hot and i was sweating alot i also have a sunburn but i don't know if that had anything to do with it except for the fact that it may have made me hotter warmer same thing i'd say heat exhaustion  Hyperthermia Shaggy dog story Dehydration Sandy Koufax Jackass: The Movie One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Diving Ron Weasley Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dialysis Social rule Satchel Paige The Shining (film) Panic attack Piccolo Junior Saga 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sauna Survival skills 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Hiccup Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Volleyball Sin City Fecal incontinence Blood on the Tracks Poker jargon Sento Chronic fatigue syndrome Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Drinking Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ben Johnson (athlete) Kitchen Mattress Ex-gay Muslim ibn Aqeel First aid Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Japanese toilet Milton H.

lower calf leg pain i have been having lower leg pain since february at first it felt like it was going all around my cald muscle and then down the front bone of my leg at the time i had only been taking birth control for a month and the doctor had an doppler ultrasound performed on my leg to rule out a blood clot and it came back as negative plus i've had multiple doctors feel my leg since then and each has assured me repeatly there is no blood clot then i want to a new doctor who had an mri run to make sure the muscle was not torn and it just strained since i was still getting pain i had an emg done to make sure it wasn't my nerves and it was clear so i am at a complete loss i am still having a dull pain in my leg muscle today it felt like it was running down the front of my shin and coming out my arch i am not taking birth control i am a non smoker the area is not bruised swollen hot or red i am about and weigh i gained pounds this year due panic attacks without knowing further details about the characteristics of your pain what activities cause it relieve it etc one still has to consider if this pain may eminate from the spine even if the emg was negative and even if you have no back pain another consideration is your knee or stress fracture which is hard to detect on x ray and may require a bone scan sometimes you need to look at the surrounding joints to find the source of pain have you been to physical therapy they may have the ability to spend more time evaluating it than a physician to give you better ideas about the problem  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight training Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling holds Paget's disease of bone Carpal tunnel syndrome Cancer Muscle Stroke Multiple sclerosis Urinary incontinence Hip fracture Stomach cancer Childbirth Syringomyelia Obstetrics Stress fracture Chiropractic Aortic dissection Fecal incontinence Post Polio syndrome Osteoarthritis Myocardial infarction Bruise Puberty Anterior cruciate ligament Breech birth Tocopherol Duchenne muscular dystrophy Deep vein thrombosis Scapula Folic acid Group A streptococcal infection Cardiac stress test Breast cancer Cephalic disorder Pain Orthopedic surgery Endometriosis Mandible Iliotibial band syndrome Osteoporosis Humerus Tyrannosaurus rex Atherosclerosis Professional wrestling throws Medicine Osteopathy Clinical depression Swimming Pulmonary embolism Anxiety Asthma Psoriasis Alexander Technique Prolactinoma Epidural Cocaine Magnetic resonance imaging First aid Cirrhosis Diabetic neuropathy Penis Leukemia Massage Elephant Fascial compartment Coeliac disease Myasthenia gravis Temporal bone Appendicitis Menstrual cup Sleep apnea Tobacco smoking Tendon Gout Balance disorder Computed tomography Hal Trosky Aikido Colorectal cancer Shin splints Anatomical terms of location Turner syndrome Stuttering Local anesthesia

i am feeling real down and out today how do i pick myself up i am suffering from anxiety and am thinking today that i will never get better and get on with my life i am so scared to do anything i feel like my whole life is a waste of time and i am burdening everyone around me i don't feel like this all the time but today is one of those days yea today basically sucked for me as well but i just try to find ways of not thinking about the garbage by doing something fun such as listen to a favorite cd usually a ska band cuz they're impossible listen to without dancing haha my suggestion to you is to stop worrying about whatever it is for the moment and do something you enjoy that's fun watch a movie a comedy perhaps or listen to a favorite cd or play some video games or read a book anything that will take your mind off what is bothering you it's not bad to worry about things but it's not good to worry for an extended period of time so get away from it mentally and get preoccupied with something else thats fun  Jon Secada Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.

headache advice i have headaches almost everyday after work any advice on how to relieve them prescription medicine isn't always the answer although sometimes it can be incredibly helpful but i suggest trying other methods first since the headaches occur after work i must assume they are stress induced you need to find ways to relax yourself however reading may not be the best solution as this can be strenuous for your eyes especially with a headache try watching a non action film or when you get home arrange talks with your friends walks are especially helpful as not only does it provide exercise but even if you don't have a friend to talk to listening to calming music while you walk can really clear your head however if this doesn't help the headache or even makes it worse then try other approaches medicine being one of them make an appointment with your doctor and discuss your symptoms he will be able to diagnose the cause far better than i ever could also try relaxing during work every once in awhile contract your muscles slowly for ten seconds from the feet to your shoulders individually and breath slowly for each contraction this can help de stress you at work and can help you relax lastly avoid caffeinated drinks such as coffee and soda since both can cause an addiction and cause withdrawal you may even want to simply limit their consumption rather than going cold turkey instead bring a water bottle to work drinking more water really can help improve your mood and how you feel make sure to stay hydrated and this could also help with your headaches i'm not a doctor so i can't diagnose everything properly but i'm certain that some of these approaches should help you with your headaches either way i would consult with your doctor so you can be properly diagnosed i suggest you see a do rather than an md a do will look at the entire body and will try and find the root of a specific problem while an md will simply prescribe medication to limit the effects however both doctors should be able to help you best of luck  Insomnia Drug addiction Caffeine Prostate cancer Clinical depression Chronic fatigue syndrome Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Cannabis (drug) Decompression sickness Hypoglycemia Anxiety Asthma Bipolar disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Common cold Psoriasis Addiction Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Meditation Sleep Word of Wisdom Cancer Multiple sclerosis Childbirth Aikido Stuttering Reflexology Breastfeeding Myocardial infarction Massage Milton H.

do cigars do damage like cigarettes i'm pretty sure you cant gett addicted like smoking right and do they do damage to your lungs like cigarettes do they have any other effects on the body the worst part about these yahoo answers is when people who have no idea what they are talking about answer questions in which they have no knowledge yes cigars can be harmful meaning you are subject to cancer of the mouth however you do not inhale cigars and they are very unlikely to become addictive cigars are a pleasure to smoke so you may become addicted to the pleasure of smoking cigars you rarely absorb enough tobacco from smoking a cigar to make it addictive i have been smoking cigars for quite some time now and they are in no way as dangerous as many people make them out to be are there risks absolutely but no more risky than driving your car on a busy interstate or getting on a plane to go anywhere so to answer your question there is less risk involved in smoking cigars than there is in smoking cigarettes the reason for this is that you do not inhale cigars and the quality of cigar tobacco is much greater than that of a cigarette which means less toxins entering your body smoking anything is not safe but just like anything in moderation you may enjoy lifes little pleasures smoking cigars is no more harmful to your body than enjoying a beer a day or a glass of wine have a fine cigar and tell those kids who know nothing about this subject to shut their mouths and go back to asking questions about their favorite crappy band on the radio or which famous for nothing celebrity would be a better drug addicted mother  Tobacco smoking Cigarette Cannabis (drug) Smoking pipe Arguments for and against drug prohibition Tobacco Methamphetamine Cocaine Lung cancer Goodness and value theory Pneumonia Bong Nicotine Health issues and the effects of cannabis Asbestos Snus Fire fighting Hookah Drug abuse Word of Wisdom Tobacco advertising Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Drug addiction Breastfeeding Harm reduction Addiction Consensual crime Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Sigmund Freud Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Emphysema Dioxin Plutonium Medical cannabis Mojave people Mesothelioma Hand grenade Babe Ruth Alcoholic beverage Theory of conduct Air pollution Prostate cancer Hypertension Smoking fetishism Opioid Traumatic brain injury Inhalant Human sexual behavior Billboard (advertising) Uranium Cigarette Smoking Man Assassination Alzheimer's disease Camel (cigarette) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Tobacco industry Carbon dioxide Alcoholism Stroke Case-control Radiation therapy Cancer of the larynx Causality Food and Drug Administration Kretek Sherlock Holmes Poison Smoke-screen Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Kurt Cobain Cryptic crossword Ionizing radiation Acupuncture Tocopherol Hashish Oral cancer Beavis and Butt-head Asthma Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Childbirth Phaedo Anthony Burgess Drowning Animal testing Serial killer Moonshine Paracetamol Oral sex Survivor (novel) Firefighter Smoking cessation

i want to donate blood but i'm a big girl's blouse when it comes to needles can anyone tell me a whether it's a really painful procedure b tips on how i can distract myself and not faint i faint rather easily c how long the procedure takes many thanks donating blood is actually how i got over my fear of needles when i was a child i would actually try to run away from the nurse when they would come at me with needles for blood draws and shots the answers to your questions are a overall no the only part that hurts is the initial stick if you are really nervous about it ask to have the the most experienced person on schedule do your stick don't be afraid to ask people do it all of the time there are people who are really good and some who aren't that's just a fact b look away when they actually do your stick i think that it goes faster when you aren't expecting it try to keep your arm relaxed i know that sounds easier said then done but it will help during the actual donating concentrate on squeezing of the stress ball that they give you they tell you to squeeze every seconds i think concentrating on counting off the time will help you focus on something else other than the fact that you have a needle in your arm c i think on average it takes a person minutes for the actual donation process but keep in mind you will probably be there at least an hour because of paperwork eligibility checking and then after they have you sit and drink something and munch on some snacks  Blood donation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Intravenous therapy Theory of conduct Milton H.

can someone please read details explain hiccups and tell how to get rid of them i've had hiccups a lot in my long life and i was told they are caused by a spasm of the diaphragm when i was a kid my mother used the scare tactic on me sneak up from behind and scare me and it worked the sharp intake of breath seems to reset the diaphragm unfortunately once i learned that my mother would do this i no longer gasped in surprise because i expected it i've tried a lot of remedies since then and the only one that usually works is this without anything in your mouth sit comfortably and swallow three times while holding your breath and keeping your mouth closed this does not sound so hard until you try it but it actually requires a great deal of concentration somehow focusing all this concentration on swallowing seems to have the same effect as the involuntary air intake  Hiccup Carburetor Drowning Bong Stuttering Epilepsy Trumpet Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breath Microphone Milton H.

what could be causing this pain my mum has started to experience pain in her hand after using a wall paper stripping machine the pain is on the outside of her thumb and goes upto her wrist it does not hurt all the time but she gets really sharp shooting pains it is a nerve similar to what triggers carpel tunnel when you use any muscles or nerves that get more use than normal it can trigger off aches and pains i had to remove carpet staples a few weeks ago from the hard wood floors to prep for new carpet installation and by day if i so much as leaned on my one hand or bent my fingers i would be in tears the pain felt as if it was from my thumb and first finger up the vein area of my arm just above the hand any pressure on it would trigger a shooting pain your mom will most likely notice lessening over the next few days and eventually it will stop hurting but in the mean time a certain way she bends her wrist or puts pressure on it leaning with her hand will probably trigger these pains more it's no fun and an inconvenience it is best if she doesn't do any more strenuous work with that hand for now  Professional wrestling holds Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Aerial (dance move) Massage Pain Milton H.

i have a drink problem usually i don't drink months then i drink like a pig for a week i'm alcoholic sounds more like you are a binge drinker which in some cases can be more dangerous i say this because if you drank every day you would build up an immunity to the effects until you needed a certain amount just to function normally but a gap of months breaks down any such ability to become tolerant to the effects thus making your one week a big drunken bash if you are really concerned about these issue you might check with some local groups that provide alcohol counseling for dui recipients in your area often they will allow you to sit in on a session free of charge providing it is not court ordered but i can tell you from experience a dui will cost you a bundle night in jail fine st offense dollar license renewals for the classes that you have to take before you can get your license back and all of this is dependent on the state you live in and the circumstances you could end up in prison on the first offense if you kill someone i m not preaching at you just saying if you have to drink make sure you are at home good luck to you  Alcoholism Alcoholics Anonymous Driving under the influence Binge drinking Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oasis (band) Hypoglycemia Probation officer Temperance movement Mothers Against Drunk Driving Alcoholic beverage Appeal Arguments for and against drug prohibition Scientology beliefs and practices Intellectual property Member of the European Parliament Divorce Prohibition Objective-C Brian Jones (musician) TLC Magistrate Microeconomics Saturday Night Live Public transport Education in the United States Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Linux Michael Garibaldi Windows XP Breastfeeding Federal Communications Commission Drinking culture Bank Pretty Good Privacy Drug test Web crawler Trademark Administrative law of the United States Public domain Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bing Crosby Alcohol 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Drug addiction Legal research Stuttering Breaker Morant Taxation in the United States Baseball Rosa Parks Diablo II: Lord of Destruction American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Jury trial Murder Final Fantasy magic Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sin City Lawyer President (game) Darryl Strawberry A.

why do people abuse vicodin why do people find vicodin addicting what does it do to them vicodin is very addictive it's 'hydrocodone' a 'substitute' for codeine i live with 'severe pain ' and have a prescription for vicodin but evidently there is something in my body that doesn't react to it the way most people do frankly i've been without any vicodin for over three weeks now taking just acetominophen and i can't tell any difference at all other people though tell me that they feel 'slightly high' and 'invincible' when on vicodin i can't 'argue' with that i suppose but it doesn't do anything for me except relieve part of my pain it's not the 'high' that is addicting though it's the 'chemical reaction' to vicodin in the body but again i seem to be 'immune' to that too so in a way i'm like you and wondering why so many people abuse the drug  Hydrocodone Controlled Substances Act Analgesic Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Addiction Rush Limbaugh Drug abuse Prohibition (drugs) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Methamphetamine Duesberg hypothesis Codeine Migraine The Marshall Mathers LP Clinical depression Cannabis (drug) Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Antidepressant Alcoholism Prostate cancer Withdrawal Rick James LSD Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Diazepam Osteoarthritis Allergy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Narcotic Bipolar disorder Methadone Anxiety Illegal drug trade Kurt Cobain Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Rat Park Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tobacco smoking House, M.D. Psychosis Traumatic brain injury Narcissism Promethazine Convention on Psychotropic Substances Post-traumatic stress disorder Self-harm Dextropropoxyphene Fitz Hugh Ludlow Morphine Domestic violence Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Methylphenidate Herpes simplex virus Anti-psychiatry Diarrhea Eastern Orthodox Church Insulin Medical prescription Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Irritable bowel syndrome Symbiosis (TNG episode) Medicine Good Times Aspartame Acne Harm reduction COX-2 inhibitor Chemical reaction Medical cannabis Cocaine Homeopathy Sadism and masochism Urticaria Opium Dualism (philosophy of mind) Hay fever Alcohol Dana Plato Endometriosis Raw food diet AIDS reappraisal Social rule Brett Favre Anorexia nervosa Explosive material Drug test Elvis Presley Torture Haloalkane Fibromyalgia First aid Sedative Borderline personality disorder

can anyone prove that marijuana is harmful if used through a butane free vaporizer in this situation there would be no smoke that would release harmful carcinogens into the lungs and no harmful chemicals from flame or chemical lighters marijuana is well known in the medical field to relieve symtpons of alzheimers glaucoma depression and chronic pain it would be a wise decision for the government to pass out butane free vaporizers to medical marijuana users in my opinion so that no harmful carcinogens would be released during the inhaling of the marijuana please answer this question seriously to the marijuana protesters please concentrate your efforts on baning tobacco instead afterall it was a german who wanted to make marijuana illegal while promoting the sales of tobacco and beer some of the brightest doctors are of course germans if marijuana would be made legal oh how doctors would lose so much money that is to say of course the german doctors want you to drink beer and smoke you'll be seeing them and paying them more often when marijuana is vaporized it is not being smoked like a pack of cigs sorry to point you out as being wrong but using a vaporizer is not smoking marijuana it is vaporizing it for example the air vapir system utilizes a state of the art convection technology to heat herbal matter hot air is blown through a disk implanted with herbal material such as marijuana and other plants commonly used in aromatherapy the hot air induces the material to release its full flavor along with its active and volatile elements this easy to inhale vapor cloud is achieved without burning of the material without burning or smoking and just because people are near death doesnt mean they should be smoking marijuana they should be vaporizing it your whole idea backs up joanns point that doctors would lose out on the patients if they cheated by using marijuana marijuana is aka the poor mans heaven drug the united states is the perfect example of nazzism in this modern day with beer and alcohol sales the us government makes too much money from cancer patients and liver diseased dodos that got farked up from drinking and smoking to make marijuana legalized legalization of marijuana will never happen it would pretty much break the economy and bankrupt doctors all over the world so the question is why do doctors give it to people who are near death so they can enjoy life before dying so someone decided somewhere along the line that life was not meant to be enjoyed with marijuana and if it is given to people near their death stage then you are saying that it is helpful or beneficial in some way about henk and his comment about german phobia here is the german guy named harry j anslinger who had it in for the us as all germans in that nazi era did anslinger was an extremely ambitious man and he recognized the bureau of narcotics as an amazing career opportunity a new government agency with the opportunity to define both the problem and the solution he immediately realized that opiates and cocaine wouldn't be enough to help build his agency so he latched on to marijuana and started to work on making it illegal at the federal level anslinger immediately drew upon the themes of racism and violence to draw national attention to the problem he wanted to create some of his quotes regarding marijuana there are total marijuana smokers in the us and most are negroes hispanics filipinos and entertainers their satanic music jazz and swing result from marijuana use this marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with negroes entertainers and any others the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity criminality and death reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing you smoke a joint and you're likely to kill your brother marijuana is the most violence causing drug in the history of mankind and he loved to pull out his own version of the assassin definition in the year there was founded in persia the religious and military order of the assassins whose history is one of cruelty barbarity and murder and for good reason the members were confirmed users of hashish or marihuana and it is from the arabs' 'hashashin' that we have the english word 'assassin ' anslinger was a german henk truth be told on the page about why marijuana is illegal is in my source for everyone to read its not a german phobia issue its a racist issue about a german who hated anyone who wasnt his breed and didnt want anyone who wasnt of his breed to enjoy life heres to ya hater  Lung cancer Drug addiction Harry J.

how can i get an elderly client to cooperate when it is time to get her ready for bed she's and when i see her i'm supposed to have her washed up and in her nightgown by o'clock when i finish my shift someone comes to spend the night with her but she doesn't want to get off the couch when i tell her it's time it takes half an hour to get her ready but she won't listen to me even if she agrees that she's ready to get ready for bed she does nothing to get up i put her walker in front of her but she won't put her hands on it so i can help her up she just acts like she didn't agree to get up i don't know how to deal with her since i can't very well grab her and force her to cooperate and i can't yell at her or anything like that i'm very polite and pleasant with her but it's so frustrating the person that spends the night is not hired to do her personal care just to be there perhaps you can mix up the routine a little bit this is what we used to do at a skilled nursing facility i used to work at the first time she is assisted to the bathroom after she has eaten her dinner have the bathroom set up for her bedtime routine wash her dentures have her rinse out her mouth have everything you need nearby for her to wash up a bit have her bedclothing in the bathroom as well perhaps you can light a scented candle if safe to do so to make this a less stressful experience for both of you then once she is all spruced up and fresh let her go back to the couch and relax for the rest of the eve until your relief nurse gets there another little trick is to have warm water in the sink and float a small bottle of scented lotion in there when she's done washing she can be rewarded with a nice backrub with warm sweet smelling lotion alternatively perhaps a wash basin brought to her good luck and much patience to you nursemom  Certified Nursing Assistant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Kitchen Treehouse of Horror IV Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ron and Fez Japanese tea ceremony Married... with Children The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule Japanese toilet Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.

i get really bad headachs but they arnt quite migrains but help percriptions dont work any home remadies i know how you feel i have migraine headaches that were passed down to me from my dad so hopefully something in here helps you out i have had to change the way i excecise eat the lighting in my home what laundry soap i use and other cleaning supplies etc etc dietary modification chronic headaches often have their origins in food sensitivities to identify the food or foods underlying your pain try this elimination diet for one week keep a list of all foods and beverages you consume be sure to include seasonings for the next days avoid all foods and beverages you consumed during the hours preceding each headache you had during the week after days reintroduce suspect foods one per meal before eating the food take your resting pulse twenty minutes after eating take your pulse again if your pulse after eating is beats or more per minute faster than your pulse before eating you may be sensitive to the food you ve just reintroduced avoid the food for another days if you remain sensitive to this food for several months eliminate it from your diet permanently nutritional supplements headaches occur less frequently in individuals whose intake of certain key nutrients is adequate ask your doctor about taking magnesium mg a day this mineral has no effect on tension headaches but is moderately effective against migraines and cluster headaches most effective slow release or chelated magnesium tablets they re better absorbed than conventional tablets fish oil or flaxseed oil g per day these oils are rich in omega fatty acids which have been associated with reduced migraine frequency and severity lecithin mg a day this protein sold as a powder that can be mixed into beverages reduces symptoms of cluster headaches vitamin b riboflavin megadoses of this b vitamin mg a day for two to three months have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines megadoses should be taken only under a doctor s supervision acupuncture acupuncture works against tension and migraine headaches typically the patient undergoes weekly or twice weekly sessions for weeks followed by monthly maintenance sessions for the name of an acupuncturist in your area contact the american academy of medical acupuncture at caution make sure the acu puncturist uses disposable needles in many cases headaches can be prevented via acupressure the self help variant of acupuncture try these techniques at the first sign of pain press your thumbs against the hollows between the muscles in the neck just below the base of the skull and in line with your ears hold for two minutes breathe deeply throughout use your thumbs to press the upper inside corners of the eye sockets hold for one minute while breathing deeply use your right thumb to press on the top of the fleshy mound between your left thumb and index finger hold for one minute while breathing deeply switch hands and repeat environmental factors to avoid the eyestrain that triggers some headaches be sure to have adequate lighting for the task at hand trap fluorescent bulbs often produce a barely perceptible flicker that can cause head aches if there s a chance fluorescent flicker is behind your headaches switch to incandescent bulbs important have a professional eye exam once a year straining to compensate for poor vision can cause headaches mold dust mites and fungi can trigger headaches to eliminate these airborne irritants install exhaust fans in your bathroom and kitchen and a dehumidifier in your basement or any other damp area indoor humidity should stay between and use scent free hypoallergenic soap and nonaerosol sprays some headaches are triggered by chronic low level exposure to carbon monoxide co never leave a car idling in an attached garage consider installing a co detector in your home herbal remedies valerian root nourishes the nervous system and has soothing properties valerian is a safe and natural sleeping aid it helps soothe rattled nerves and assists the body in relieving insomnia helps with headaches because it has properties of the plant that have demonstrated a calming relief to muscles the nerves and blood vessels i use this and it works a lot of the time in my opinion wood betony works well for both children and adults it is said to help headaches dong quai calms the central nervous system and nourishes the brain feverfew can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches if you d like to try this herb chew two fresh or freeze dried leaves a day or take mg of dried feverfew that contains at least parthenolide cyani flowers soothe the nervous system and exert a positive influence on tissues of the eyes there s no evidence that herbal remedies are effective for tension or cluster headaches massage therapy massage has been found to reduce pain caused by tension and migraine headaches but not cluster headaches for referral to a massage therapist in your area contact the american massage therapist association at biofeedback by using devices that measure muscle tension and blood flow biofeedback teaches you to relax tense muscles and boost blood flow to your scalp each technique can ease headache pain for adults or more to minute sessions may be necessary children typically need only five or six to find a biofeedback therapist in your area send a self addressed stamped business sized envelope to the biofeedback certification institute of america w th ave ste wheat ridge colorado exercise aerobic activity is beneficial for people with chronic headaches adding a mantra a word repeated over and over to focus the mind enhances the effect or try yoga i prefer yoga because i also have severe back problems that keep me from being able to do very much in way of aerobics but this is only to help prevent if you excersise during the headaches it only makes them worse for persistent headaches if nondrug therapies fail to work within three months consult a headache specialist for a list of specialists in your area phone the national headache foundation nhf at or send a self addressed stamped business sized envelope to the nhf at w st james pl chicago

does smiling really release endorphins i've heard somewhere that when you smile you release some endorphins is this true or not it can be infered from the wikipedia entry linked below that the physical act of smiling does not release endorphins that's probably because voluntary smiling is simply a muscle reaction the entry mentions the polite or fake smile that we see and use daily ala saying thank you to a clerk as for involuntary smiles i'm sure those coinscide with an endorphine release but the release is tied to the emotional reaction not the physical act of smiling  Smile Endorphin Addiction Facial expression Orgasm Drug addiction Self-harm Body language Yawn Involuntary commitment E-meter Simplified molecular input line entry specification Autonomic nervous system Mona Lisa Urinary incontinence Muscle Spider-Man 2 Facial Action Coding System User Friendly Comedy Defecation Anxiety Sadism and masochism Deprogramming Good Vibrations Alcoholics Anonymous Russell's paradox Opioid Jackass: The Movie Source engine Nicomachean Ethics 20/20 (album) Laughter Smiley Smile Yoko Ono Miranda warning Cognitive science Objectivist philosophy Medea (play) Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Soul Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Zoophilia Pain play Terri Schiavo We Belong Together Stuttering Our Friends in the North Queen (band) Sherlock Holmes History of nuclear weapons Social rule The Beach Boys Elvis Costello Inference Psychosis Victor Cousin Cordelia Chase Philosophy of language David Hartley (philosopher) Human sexual response cycle Exit counseling Out-of-body experience Hall & Oates Real-time strategy The Matrix Online Manslaughter Premature ejaculation Blonde on Blonde Punishment Emoticon Human sexual behavior Probation officer Euthanasia Nuclear fission Lawyer Mass Superman: The Movie Motivation Shanice Determinism Essential tremor Biomechanics Salah Chemistry resources Smile Empty Soul Unemployment Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Hearing (sense) Smiling Faces Sometimes Jinyong Patriotism Smile (album) Happiness House of Leaves Drama Gratitude Queen II Physical intimacy Biochemistry

how do we die in our sleep what occurs i live in la i know of one case which was a colleague from work she went home normally one day from her job and never came back to work the next day this was very unlike her and people with whom she worked knew that she lived all alone so they were worried that something may have happened she had no health problem or illness that anyone was aware of but they just thought it was strange that she did not come to work so after calling the house number multiple times this was before everybody had cells her boss and another coworker who was a good friend decided to drive to her house and see if something was wrong when they arrived they tried knocking on the door and so forth but no answer they walked around her house and into the yard but were afraid to try to break into the house they were able to peek in a window and get a partial view of something that gave them a clue that she was there it may have been her purse or something like that i cannot remember but they decidedd to call the police and when the officers responded they went into the home together and found her dead she had died the night before not just right then they were shocked of course as she was not that old and had no health problems or anything she was still dressed from the day before and had laid down on her bed and never got up it turned out that she had had a heart attack while alone and probably just thought she wasn't feeling very well and laid down she had not cooked anything or done anything in her house everything looked neat and tidy like she had just straightened up  Shaggy dog story Social rule EastEnders Paul Is Dead Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) The Star Wars Holiday Special Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Shining (film) Breath of Fire III Charles Peace Piccolo Junior Saga The Subtle Knife Grandview, U.S.A.

i think i have a bladder infection i absolutely hate going to the doctor honestly would like to avoid it if at all possible so the urge to urine is quite often it burns like every other time sometimes the urge comes so fast that my stomach cramps had taken some azo last week when i first felt like this it went away for days or so just recently got the feeling back i eat and exercise decently almost never ever sick help please drink some cranberry juice that is supposed to be really good for a bladder infection but you really should go to the gp and get some antibiotics to begin fighting the infection right away they can't stop all the symptoms right away if you have a lot of pain your health care provider may recommend a medication to relieve the pain in your bladder this medicine will clear up the painful symptoms in about days although it will usually make you much more comfortable within hours it's important to take the antibiotics until the prescription is finished many people stop taking the medication when they begin to feel better but that doesn't allow the antibiotics to completely kill the bacteria which increases the risk that the infection will reappear if you ever develop a rash from an antibiotic or have difficulty breathing stop taking it immediately and call the health care provider who prescribed the medication for some infections you may only have to take antibiotics for days but usually you'll be on medication for to days it's important to drink lots of water during and after treatment because each time you urinate the bladder cleanses itself a little bit more cranberry juice also has been shown to have positive effects on utis don't use the kind of juice that says juice cocktail on the label that has too much sugar and is not concentrated enough with cranberries make sure the cranberry juice is juice many brands are now cranberry quality cranberry juice produces hippuric acid in the urine which acidifies the urine and prevents bacteria from sticking to the walls of the bladder if pure cranberry juice is not available cranberry capsules can be substituted they can be found in most health food stores always take these with a large glass of water vitamin c may also be recommended for you to take if you get help right away a uti should completely clear up within days to weeks you may be advised to avoid sexual intercourse until the symptoms have been gone for weeks which allows the inflammation to disappear completely  Pneumonia Stomach cancer Common cold Psoriasis Diarrhea Breastfeeding Acne Folic acid Cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Kidney stone Medical analysis of circumcision Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence Vitamin C Escherichia coli O157:H7 Gonorrhoea Urine Group A streptococcal infection Cephalexin Decompression sickness Urinary tract infection Gastroesophageal reflux disease Guinea pig Chlorpromazine Mouth ulcer Cystoscopy Urinary system Aspartame Sexually-transmitted infection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Osteoarthritis Fasting Traumatic brain injury Nutrition Tuberculosis Migraine Cellulitis Asthma Helicobacter pylori Crohn's disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Lupus erythematosus Multiple sclerosis Marathon (sport) Gout Cheese Cystic fibrosis Cranberry Menstrual cup AIDS Insulin Penicillin Shock Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Antiretroviral drug Milk Hyperglycemia Malaria Sulfasalazine Antidepressant Conjunctivitis Coeliac disease Ulcerative colitis Anorexia nervosa Cirrhosis Hamster Endometriosis Atherosclerosis Coffee Botulism Tooth Homeopathy Medical cannabis Eczema Alzheimer's disease Isotretinoin Tooth enamel Bipolar disorder Herpes simplex virus Foodborne illness Clinical depression Dental caries Colorectal cancer Diazepam Infectious mononucleosis Tobacco smoking Ultraviolet

alcoholics what are your reasons for drinking my mom was doing so good w staying sober and today she drank again what happened i am sorry that you have to see your mom suffer from alcoholism an alcoholic doesn't need a reason to drink they need lots of help not to the physical need for alcohol is too great to overcome without help lots of it they can't just have drink as that fuels the need even more they can't be around anyone that does drink as that's all the reason they need i wish you and your mom the best it's quite difficult for a non drinker to have to deal with a drinker she needs to make a life style choice and stick with it she needs to get support from the local chapter of alcoholic's anonymous and attend meetings they also have programs for the family of alcoholics that you may be interested in attending that might give you more insight into the alcoholic mind as a non drinker in an alcoholic family i see how alcohol can affect everyone around the alcoholic due to their behavior when they are drinking it is very sad to see these people subject the people they love to the hurt and heartache of watching them drink their lives away when your mom sobers up to where she can understand what you are saying you might want to express your feelings on her drinking hopefully it won't fall upon deaf ears don't take it personally if it does your mom has to be ready to give up drinking and seek help before she'll be able to be stronger than the bottle praying for your mom's success good luck to you both  Alcoholics Anonymous Alcoholism Maison Ikkoku Theory of conduct Social rule Pitaten Alcoholic beverage Nicomachean Ethics Addiction Alcohol Humphrey Bogart Book of Isaiah Traumatic incident reduction Cindy Sheehan Blood alcohol content One Tree Hill (TV series) Pok__mon Live!

how does one get hydrocodone without a prescription i have a friend whom i think is addicted to hydrocodone i do know for a fact that he does not have a prescription for this and he won't tell me how he gets the drug i guess he just knows me well enough to know that i would be against it him taking the drug i mean if anybody can give me information about this then maybe i can put a stop to him getting the drug or at least tell somebody who can make him stop i'm pretty sure that if he does not have a prescription for hydrocodone he can get it from online pharmacies they don't require prescriptions and this might just be the way your friend gets his stash however the price of hydrocodone when bought online is significantly higher than if bought from walk in pharmacies you should probably alert your friend's parents about his hydrocodone abuse he can get treated for this and then he'll be able to live a normal life again  Controlled Substances Act Drug addiction Hydrocodone Medical prescription Prescription drug Analgesic Rush Limbaugh Illegal drug trade Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Arguments for and against drug prohibition Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prohibition (drugs) Methylphenidate Osteoarthritis Addiction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drug abuse Diazepam Pharmaceutical company Methamphetamine Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Regulation of therapeutic goods Publicly funded medicine Clinical depression Opioid Antidepressant Bipolar disorder Pharmacy Health insurance Revco Food and Drug Administration Cocaine RFID Infantilism CVS/pharmacy Pharmacist Migraine COX-2 inhibitor Anorexia nervosa Drug test Pharmacology Alcoholism Kurt Cobain Oxycodone Anabolic steroid Shoppers Drug Mart Elvis Presley Emergency contraception English grammar Johnny Cash Health care in the United States Lorazepam Duesberg hypothesis Recreational drug use Withdrawal Acne LSD William S.

i eat food in the front of my mouth i only chew food with my front teeth how can i fix this bad habit its just like if you are right handed learning to use your left hand and vise versa the best way to do it is everytime you find yourself chewing with the frong of your teeth give yourself a small pinch and move the food to the back of your mouth this will work because the brain doesnt like punishment of any kind unless your into that so it will naturally train itself and you to do what it needs to aviod the punishment  Tooth Dog training Dental caries Dentures Tetrapod Mojave people Halitosis Hamster Tooth enamel Oral sex Elephant Digestion Cocaine Dolphin Squirrel Vise (tool) Domestic rabbit Bat Reinforcement Chewing gum Korean cuisine Fancy rat Hannibal Lecter Aztec Tobacco Unclean animals Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Maxilla Horse tack Breastfeeding Tyrannosaurus rex Eucynodontia Shark Whale Odysseus Customs and etiquette of Japan Deinotheriidae Mastication Lathe Raw food diet Crocodilia Motivation Food Karma in Hinduism Garfield Fecal incontinence Evidence of evolution Human Eryops Australian Aboriginal languages Sperm Whale Grasshopper Dog Radula Tuatara Hygiene Pork Happy Tree Friends Table saw Equine conformation Chew Valley Lake Extreme Programming Minor bounty hunters in Star Wars Salad Fingers Syberia Vampire Chopsticks USS Chew (DD-106) Sugar substitute Punisher Babylonian law Kosher foods Tobacco smoking Knife Kodocha Head Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Bushido Excel Saga Fugu Saw Betel nut Trapping Bubblegum Fire eater Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist John the Baptist Snake Rocko's Modern Life Richard Chase Left-handed Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adjustable gastric band Boxing training Doom enemies Characters in the Smurfs Place of articulation

when does our body actually use and remove vitamin a from the body i've heard that doing cardio exercise is one method of taking it out lately i've been reading things about how you may not need a after an extended period of time and i want to get rid of it vitamin a the forgotten bodybuilding nutrient you will search in vain through mainstream men's health magazines to find so much as a mention of the importance of vitamin a to bodybuilding yet this nutrient is essential to muscle building and may be the bodybuilder's most potent weapon vitamin a is necessary for the utilization of protein and the production of testosterone and other growth factors in fact one experimental study found the administration of vitamin a and iron to have results equivalent to the administration of testosterone itself rather than advocating the consumption of vitamin a rich foods such as liver and natural food based supplements such as cod liver oil mainstream men's health writers are advocating diets very high in protein which deplete vitamin a reserves leaving one to wonder whether the athletes who resort to over the counter steroid supplements might be able to achieve similar results by consuming a traditional diet rich in vitamin a vitamin a and testosterone abundant animal research indicates the importance of vitamin a to the production of testosterone vitamin a crosses the blood testis barrier in its alcohol form as retinol where it is stored in the sertoli cells and converted as needed to its more biologically active form retinoic acid experiments with rats show that greater concentrations of vitamin a in the testes increase basal testosterone secretion as well as transferrin which is responsible for the transport of iron and a variety of growth factors including igf binding protein which transports igf androgen binding protein which transports androgens transforming growth factor beta which causes cell growth but suppresses cancer and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein which is responsible for the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria for its conversion to steroids vitamin a also decreases estrogen production in the male testes rats that are deficient in vitamin a experience decreased testosterone until the accessory sex organs atrophy indicating that vitamin a not only aids in but is essential to testosterone production vitamin a and protein utilization cultured skeletal muscle cells increase the amount of protein per cell when exposed to vitamin a and d but not when exposed to vitamin d alone eat your liver bodybuilders and other athletes interested in gaining muscle have an interest in boosting their levels of testosterone and other growth factors and maximizing their utilization of protein and its incorporation into muscle cells typical recommendations usually include very high amounts of protein but exclude foods like liver that are high in vitamin a and low fat recommendations all but banish vitamin a entirely from the diet by excluding foods such as full fat milk the combination of a high protein diet that depletes vitamin a and a low fat diet that fails to provide vitamin a is a clear recipe for deficiency of this vital nutrient exercises that elicit a high demand for testosterone such as squats and deadlifts are often recommended for muscle growth but without vitamin a the body cannot meet that demand for testosterone it's high time for athletes to forget the modern mantras and remember the dietary wisdom of the past achieving a lean muscular physique through traditional foods such as liver egg yolks full fat milk butter from grass fed cows and cod liver oil  Prohormone Anorexia nervosa Multiple sclerosis Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Rickets Biochemistry Guinea pig Trans fat Iron Cryptorchidism Growth hormone deficiency Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vitamin K Dietary fiber Colorectal cancer Aspartame Progesterone Low-carbohydrate diet Cell (biology) Thyroid Crohn's disease Chicken Sewage treatment Polycystic ovary syndrome Steroid Melanin Dehydroepiandrosterone Human height Cocaine Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hemoglobin Intersexuality Organic farming

pulmonary embolism i had a pulmonary embolism years ago i am f in descent health didn't use birthcontrol pills injections adhesives didn't go on a long trip car or plane so my doctor never gave me a reason why i had such a life threatening embolism a few days before i had it though i was in a single car accident in which i hit my nose on the steering wheel and it fractured along the middle of my nose i didn't pass out i was wearing my seatbelt didn't hit anything but my head on the steering wheel felt no pain in my chest immediately or even the next day so i don't think a broken nose could've caused it i also am pondering if i could have some kind of blood clotting disorder that caused it when i went through the pe it was tiring painful i couldn't even take care of my daughter and i could've died so i'm scared that if i have another one it could kill me this time anyone have any ideas what could cause this kind of pe thank you ps anyone go through something similar it doesn't seem unlikely that the nose fracture couldn't have had something to do with it but i would think that the embolism would have gone to the brain from the nose typically embolisms can happen while on birth control because it tends to thicken the blood since you weren't on bc has there been any family history it seems strange to me that your doctor would be so evasive as to why it happened i would see a specialist and take your records to them and see what questions you can get answered there is always aspirin therapy to keep the blood thinned out i hear it's the best thing ever created and to take a baby aspirin once a day for ultimate health of course you want to be under a doctors care and advice before doing that but definitely find someone more experienced than your current doctor  Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pulmonary embolism Air embolism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hip fracture Medicine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aspirin Myocardial infarction Urinary incontinence Deep vein thrombosis Migraine Intravenous therapy Pope John Paul I Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asthma Childbirth Stomach cancer Time Out of Mind Characters of Lost Chest pain Rei Ayanami Shaggy dog story Oral contraceptive Paracetamol Atrial septal defect Prostate cancer Tobacco smoking Pulmonary hypertension Knots Landing Malaria Milton H.

panic attacks i have a huge problem with panic attacks i have about one to three per day even though there's nothing wrong when they happen it's not at a specific time i'm usually not upset or discouraged or anything my questions are is there a way to prevent panic attacks i'm sixteen years old and i've had panic attacks in school before how do i stop that because school hasn't started and i don't want panic attacks this year i can't get meds because my parents would probably make fun of me if they knew i was having panic attacks i don't go to a therapist or anything so if anyone tries to mention it that is out of the question when they do happen i try to control my breathing immediately and i put my head down to calm down and ignore everybody around me in school is there anything else to do that could work better please help me i've had problems with panic anxiety for almost years now great outline of your problem i'm a physician and i started having panic attacks a few years ago so i have an interest here let me first say that the fact that you are aware that you have them and know what they are is a huge huge step for you you won't appreciate this though because you likely only know one person who has them you my experience with people with panic has shown me that those who know what they have and recognize it will do better i'll try to answer your questions prevention avoid caffeine all caffeine til you settle down for a few months get plenty of sleep do some introspective work many people with panic have a post traumatic disorder did you ever have an experience where you felt you were going to die unfortunately for women many times this is a rape i believe that gaining insight into this is important and helps but maybe you didn't have a trigger talking openly about your panic helps as well this is a catharsis look word up if you don't know it tell your friends talk with others you will be surprised how many people have an issue laugh about it your freakin out over nothing it can be funny when your not having one if you think your parents will laugh at you they may as it is something others don't understand and is a normal response don't you think real crazy people act funny you should still let them know see catharsis above deep and slow breaths will help you when you are having an event laying down in a nice quiet environment helps but you can't do that at school let your school nurse know there are drugs but your better off lickin this yourself if you can i can not stress enough about the catharsis and at this is more embarrasing for you im sure the introspection is important too if you think you are more of a post traumatic then you need to talk about that event as well the non physical world stress feelings emotions fears definitly manifest themselves in the physical format diarrhea nausea heart racing short of breath lump in throat back pains headache chest pains flushing its an amazing process but will scare the you know what out of you when it hits btw most people seem to have a course of about years from what ive seen with a gradual improvement tho you may never completely get rid of them talk  Anxiety Traumatic incident reduction Traumatic brain injury Post-traumatic stress disorder Migraine Multiple sclerosis Theory of conduct Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome God Emperor of Dune Breastfeeding Autism Stroke Meditation Hypoglycemia Asthma Human sexual behavior Milton H.

why do your fingers look like raisins after you get out of the pool they dont as much after a shower your body absorbs water if you are submerged for a while this basically inflates or expands your skin but not your bone or blood vessels under it so your skin is just stretched further than normal so the only thing it can do is sag or scrunch up it isn't enough to make it sag so it just kinda shrivels up around the bone the same idea as when someone loses an excessive amount of weight and has to get the skin stabled back or removed just on a much smaller scale  Swimming Skin Knife Mattress Bleeding First aid Crocodilia Carbon dioxide Human physiology Dehydration Drowning Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Inflation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Decompression sickness Scar Brassiere Fluoride Anemia Puberty Glucocorticoid Tire Insulin Strap-on dildo Callus Vitamin D Gold standard Cephalic disorder Lymphatic system Dialysis Traumatic brain injury Protein Blood Kidney Cancer Diving suit Hyperthermia Backstroke Tetrapod Weight training Sailing Eczema Vampire Psoriasis Uranium Testosterone Hyperglycemia Fecal incontinence Aerial (dance move) Metastasis Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Stomach cancer Penis Noonan syndrome Human skin color Nuclear weapon design Intravenous therapy Menstrual cup Hydrochloric acid RuneScape economy Pebble bed reactor 613 mitzvot Penis enlargement Skin graft Cocaine Prostate cancer Dinghy Slide rule Hydropower Plastic surgery Blood pressure Professional wrestling holds Stroke 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Tocopherol Equine conformation Intracranial pressure Textile manufacturing Growth hormone Autopsy Acne Soap Nutrition Androgen insensitivity syndrome Suture Normal distribution Big Bang Vegetarian nutrition Fugu Naruto jutsu Diving Poker jargon Buoyancy compensator Nitroglycerin Bone fracture Massage Dam

why does my yr old keep running fevers read for more info the fever will come on and last for about days not a high fever more on the low side sometimes coughing will come with it but other times it doesn't this afternoon he said his tummy was hurting then said he was cold temp here w heat index so it wasn't cool out by any means that was when i realized he had a fever again the fever comes and goes about x a month sometimes he'll go a month w o any this has been going on for close to a year now it's mostly in the summer months tho i took him to the doc awhile bac and was told it was a cold he was giving several diff cough meds but none worked triamintic seems to work better than prescrp meds for him we did move into a new used home last yr at this same time not sure if that has anything to do with it or not i know ppl has allergy probs but i don't think that would explain the reoccuring fevers any idea what's causing the fever all the time like i said he has already seen a doc but still don't know anything he also stays peaky looking i am by no means dark i am as light colored as can be so i don't know whether to think he has taken after me with the light color skin or if there is actually something else wrong his blood was checked back in nov and it was a little low then they ran sum test but only came up with having a cold but he has always been real light is there any certain thing that could cause him to be light skinned children of his age quite commonly suffer mystery fevers unfortunately they think it's a normal response to viral infections which can take up to two weeks to get conquered he could also be suffering from an allergy to something the first things i think i would check would be the filter on the a c or the water pan in a swamp cooler mold or mildew in either spot could be the cause of the low grade fever or cough an allergic responce can and does cause low grade fever especially in little ones it is a response of the immune system and the first line of defense is to raise the body temperature body cells can function quite well in the higher temperature while bacteria and virus can't when the allergen level drops off the immune response would back off and his temperature would drop the fact he's coughing makes me suspect this is something he's breathing it coughing is the body's way of reducing or eliminating things that irritate the respiratory tract his skin color is a genetic thing although if he is staying on the sickly side he might look paler because his little body is always on the fight try checking the various filters and do a big clean on things like carpet pillows and drapes my son had a run like this at the same age and i ended up putting some lysol disinfectant in the rug cleaner as well as the wash for the pillows and drapes i used the anti allergen spray all over the place and loads of bleach cleaner on just about every washable surface there was we never did figure out what it was that caused it all but he did get better as he got older the pediatrician said sometimes that's how it goes with the little ones we did discover our a c unit filter was loaded with pollen and mold spores we just changed it out monthly when it had to run and i sprayed like a nutter with the allergen spray for the peaky look i'd make sure he's getting a multivitamin mineral chewable every day to make sure that's covered and as long as the fever isn't getting up there and if it stayed near my peds doesn't recommend doing anything to bring it down he said push the liquids and let the body do what it does best it's not the fever that is the enemy it's whatever is spurring it on i know what you mean about the pale i personally think i can give a snowbank a run for the money and my kids are all on the pale side as well so that could be genetic just trust your instinct on that you will know from the way he looks overall if it's a pale from genes or a pale from sickly look at his eyes not the skin bright eyes are healthy

why do my fingernails seem longer after i get out of the shower mine do the same thing after i do the dishes it's because your skin retracts when it's wet sort of like how it gets wrinkled up pulling away from your nails and temporarily making them longer if you're going to trim file your nails wait until this effect wears off you don't want to end up leaving part of the matrix exposed because your nails looked longer than they were  Nail (anatomy) Manicure Nail disease Nine Inch Nails Horseshoe Cosmetics Team Fortress Classic Textile manufacturing Cat Static Shock Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Hair Urinary incontinence Tire The Shield Social rule Time Out of Mind Drill bit Diving suit Nudity Callus Hyperthermia Condom Vampire Flight controls Milton H.

tramadol does tramadol produce a euphoric effect if so im not taking it tramadol works in the brain to relieve pain similar to the way the opioids work it does not get rid of the pain rather it changes your brain's perception of the pain because it works on receptors in the brain there is a chance that it can cause euphoria although it is not as common as with the opioids morphine codeine etc drowsiness is a more common side effect with this drug than euphoria  Opioid Analgesic Tramadol Codeine Opioid receptor Drug addiction Opium Nitrous oxide Buprenorphine Hydrocodone Morphine Oxycodone Hydromorphone Addiction Cocaine Migraine Tetrahydrocannabinol Neuropathy Ketamine Chlorpromazine Tricyclic antidepressant Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Osteoarthritis Endorphin Diarrhea Diazepam Controlled Substances Act Naloxone Paracetamol Pethidine Cannabis (drug) Drug abuse Cannabinoids Antihistamine Chlorprothixene Bipolar disorder Health issues and the effects of cannabis Methamphetamine Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Cancer Benzylpiperazine Rat Park Ethylmorphine Promethazine Epidural Naltrexone Gabapentin Antidepressant Sleep Antipsychotic Levomepromazine Sickle-cell disease Cholecystokinin Vomiting Doxepin Chile pepper Psychosis Immunosuppressive drug Fentanyl Haloperidol Pain Loperamide 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Capsaicin Route of administration Orgasm Khat Dissociative drug Salvia divinorum Psychedelic drug Anesthesia Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Paroxetine Intracranial pressure COX-2 inhibitor Meditation LSD Aspirin Constipation Maprotiline Clinical depression Methcathinone Sense Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Perphenazine Dextropropoxyphene Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Modafinil Berserker Methylphenidate Common cold Diclofenac Sedative Hypnosis Trimipramine

do you like walking outside and somebody in front of you is smoking and the smoke comes up right up to your face and you breath it in then your hair smells your clothes smell what do you think about it i personally hate it what do you think about it my work place has places set aside outdoors for both smokers and non smokers they both have benches and are shaded from the elements unfortunately they weren't smart about the respective locations because the non smokers are upwind worse the smokers congregate directly in front of the doors making it next to impossible for a non smoker to enter without having to hold his her breath while running the gauntlet of second hand smoke one time i politely asked the smokers to move away from the doors but you'd think that i asked them to jump off a cliff judging by their reaction or should i say lack of it they glowered at me but didn't do anything i then complained to upper echelons but nothing came of it i put signs on the doors which read please do not block doorway notice that it doesn't mention smokers but apparently smokers can't read i don't have to use that entrance but unfortunately it's the most convenient considering that there is plenty of space all around the entrance it astonishes me that anyone would want to hang around so close to it regardless we live in a society where people tend to react violently to the smallest provocation i belong to many blog sites and you would not believe peoples' misinterpretations and subsequent reactions to the least offensive things that are said when was the last time you asked someone to turn down their car stereo and lived to tell about it i presume that you are speaking in general terms but equally generally speaking everyone should deal with it as best you can if you're a smoker would it kill you to move if you're a non smoker can you find another way around btw this actually happened today as i parked my car i saw two co workers walking around the building which many of us do when we need a break one of them held a coffee cup in one hand a cigarette dangled in her mouth and a lighter in her other hand did she think that by walking she'd offset the effects of the cigarette or the caffeine for that matter p s the word is breathe please don't beat me up  The Smoking Room Mojave people Bong Cigarette Smoking Man Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cigarette Cigar Shaggy dog story Smoking ban Theory of conduct Kitchen Microeconomics Social rule James Bond Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Tobacco Sailing Fire fighting The Time Machine Common cold Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Conspiracy (TNG episode) One Piece minor characters The Amber Spyglass Diving The Inside Office Milton H.

boosting my immune system i have a very weak immune system due to all the suppresants i was on as a child b c of my u c now i think i may have contracted genital herpes from my bf who claimed he was tested and clean i've read that people with weaker immune systems have more outbreaks and i would like to prevent this anybody have any suggestions besides vitamin c certain foods dishes anything i am sorry about your weak immune system medications unfortunately do weaken it if interested here is some other reasons why the immune system gets weak skip this part to see some good news on how to boost your immune system below here are some reasons on why the immune system is weak toxins most people today have excess accumulation of toxins and waste material in their bodies causing their body to be acidic and adding stress to their immune system function the two main reasons for this is people are putting huge amounts of toxins mostly unknowingly in their bodies on a regular basis and their elimination channels are clogged slow or sluggish toxins like junk food medications drugs sugars excess alcohol allergens all stress your immune system thus making it weak and unable to fight the germs when exposed to them nutritional deficiency when your body lacks nutrition you will have a weak immune system since our bodies can not produce nutrients needed for optimal health quality food plays a major factor in keeping our cells healthy and our immune system strong food not only provides energy to your body but all the nutrients that are essential for a healthy immune system lack of drinking healthy water dehydration means the cells just simply do not have enough fluid dehydration cause medical problems including pain arthritis asthma and allergies among other medical issues it can affect your energy and your sleep and the ability to get toxins waste material out of the body lack of physical activity lack of regular moderate exercise appears to slow down cleansing the body of certain toxins and waste products lack of sufficient rest lack of sleep will stress your immune system and thus increase the risk of catching a bug the good news is that i think you can help control or reverse your condition by doing as many as possible of the following list chronic stress people who are under chronic stress have lower than normal white blood cell counts are more vulnerable to colds and other viruses and take longer to recover from them they are more likely to experience more severe symptoms than people who are not under a great deal of stress the good news is you can boost your immune system by doing as many of the following list as possible keep practicing good personal hygiene care wash your hands get plenty of rest during deep sleep our body release potent immune enhancing substances that strengthen your immune system function by not allowing our body sufficient rest the immune system will sputter and as a result not function at full capacity we then are more likely to become ill with common illnesses a healthy deep sleep allows our body to release a significant amount of growth hormone that boost the immune system and aids in the growth and repair of the body get moderate and regular exercise an increase in blood flow associated with moderate exercise helps to circulate antibodies along with white blood cells necessary to fight infection more quickly as a result this provides our bodies with an early warning system to ward off potentially damaging germs in addition the increase in body temperature as a result of physical activity may aid in inhibiting the growth of bacteria thus allowing the body to fight infection more effectively receiving a regular body cleansing body cleansing is essential because our bodies need to properly eliminate the toxic build up that has formed in our intestines colon which may lead to sickness and disease our body organs and tissues must be free of toxins for the immune system to function optimally thus enabling our bodies to receive the essential nutrients our bodies need boost immune system by drinking plenty of filtered water water is essential for all living things and keeps our immune system operating optimally while improving the way we feel look and live without sufficient amounts of water you may experience routine fatigue dry skin headaches constipation and a decrease normal bodily function which may lead to your body unable to fight off diseases without water we would literally dehydrate which could result in the shutting down of vital organs and ultimately end in death eliminate all sugar and allergens from your diet just a small amount of sugar has been proven to impair white blood cells up to for very short periods of time by discovering what our personal food allergies are then eliminating or desensitizing them will help strengthen your immune system by removing these triggers our immune cells are strengthened in order to combat other invaders such as influenza rather than the allergen the elimination of sugar from your diet can also strengthen immune system eat nutritiously good foods to eat include organic fruits and vegetables chloretta medicinal mushrooms like maitake shiitake reishi or turkey tail besides water wheatgrass juice aloe vera juice or green tea are good drinks my favorite is monavie juice take supplements supplements are needed because our bodies can not produce the nutrients necessary to maintain optimum health there are many nutrients needed in order to maintain a strong immune system it is very challenging in the world we live in to obtain sufficient nutrition with the foods available to us they are over processed and void of many essential nutrients additionally food is grown in soils that have been over planted and saturated with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides vitamin and mineral deficiency subjects us to more diseases aging sickness and the weakening of our immune system best herbs include echinacea goldenseal garlic olive leaf extract elderberry or astragalus best vitamins include vitamin a c or e these are a good source of antioxidants which will boost your immune system the minerals zinc and selenium also help with boosting your immune system as you can see there is no one magic cure one supplement or one way to boost your immune system but you can prevent future outbreaks and harsh consequences if your immune system is strong more details can be found at the website in the source box

what can cause a severe phopia towards road trips i am years old and deathly terrifried of road trips my family used to go on road trips in the past but we don't any more during road trips i would have a change in my attitude i am always calm and easy going but i can get annoyed easily i can't sit in a car any longer then hours without getting impatient and if i eat during a long road trip i get bathroom problems every road trip i went on gave me a back ache a neck ache a stomach ache and a severe head ache i can't imagine sitting for so long and doing nothing to entertain me nothing works to calm me down during a road trip i cry frantically during road trips because i hate them so bad i will never sit in a car for a long road trip even if it will save me from danger if i have to get somewhere a long distance i travel by plane and that's much better i hate road trips more then anything else and i don't know why what can cause such hatred and a severe phopia towards road trips what happened when you were younger were you involved in a terrible car crash and had to be rushed to the hospital in critical condition perhaps by a drunk trucker on the road who was driving in the same lane as you but in the opposite direction traumatic experiences like that can cause a phobia of long road trips by car however the stomachaches and headaches bathroom problems etc might also be a cause of motion sickness in this case carsickness for some people it may be a sometimes thing out of the blue sometimes carsickness may come as a result of doing certain things like eating and or reading in the car in your case it may be the cause of being in the car for a certain amount of time without a rest stop have you ever been nauseated on a road trip before and how do you handle being on a public bus like greyhound if you can't afford to fly a certain distance you need to get to it might be a safer alternative  Public transport Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Road safety Speed limit Driver's license Hitchhiking Bike lane debate Freeway Traffic light Pain Decompression sickness Utility cycling Transportation in Beijing Recumbent bicycle Shaggy dog story Car handling Fecal incontinence Characters of Lost Theory of conduct Pitaten Mojave people Boston and Lowell Railroad Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

have you been bitten by a brown recluse i need advice i was working in the yard and was covered in misquito bites and was stung by a yellow jacket one bite on my arm was especially tender and after i day it grew from the size of a pea to the size of a dime my skin had necrosis and inflammation and i had flu like symptoms i did my homework online and went to the doctors today i was rather disappointed by their care and am looking for sources of more information or personal experience all the doc did was poke at it with her finger confirm to the best of her ability without having seen the actual culprit that was probably brown recluse and put me on antibiotics this left me feeling rather lacking i've heard and seen all the horror stories about the recluse and i'm hoping someone can tell me they got bit took antibiotics and was better a week later the only thing i can find online is the extreme cases of tissue necrosis and nearly fatal occurances does no one report on the mild cases are there mild cases i'm worried while i've never been bitten by a brown recluse i've seen many people and talked to them and 'how well you heal' is really up to you keep the 'site' scrupulously clean and cover it with a 'dry gauze' with 'tape' around the edges because you don't want 'dirt' getting in but you want to let the 'sore' breath and slowly 'dry out ' all 'necrosis' means is 'dying skin' and that is actually a very good thing where a spider bite is concerned if you keep the 'sore' clean and dry the 'necrosis' should be 'less' than if you let it get dirty and wet the 'antibiotics' are not to fight the 'spider bite' that 'bite' is taking pretty much all of your immune system to get better so the rest of your body is 'more prone to getting infections' and that can kill you take your antibiotics as directed keep your 'sore' clean and dry at all times tape 'plastic wrap' over it when you bathe and wash it at the sink and dry it thoroughly to keep any 'poisons' from the rest of your skin get lots of rest take a nap every day and you should be 'fully healed' and 'back to your old self' in weeks to months yes it is 'a long time' but the brown recluse is actually the worst of the spiders that bite and in the 'old days' you would be dead now isn't 'technology' a wonderful thing  First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Cellulitis Brown recluse spider Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Tuberculosis Acne Breastfeeding Social rule Hobo spider Prostate cancer Rabies Herpes simplex virus Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Fancy rat H5N1 Allergy Eczema Crohn's disease Traumatic brain injury Spanish flu Pneumonia Tarantula Hip fracture Sauna Bubonic plague Avian influenza Textile manufacturing Legionellosis Mouth ulcer Radiation poisoning Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Theory of conduct Body piercing Equine conformation Milton H.

what's the scoop on having a slightly alkaline stomach omg what is david s babbling about if you have a slight alkaline stomach it means that your acidity is low therefore you need to increase the acid and not use antacids as david has suggested antacids normally chalk tablets will reduce the acid further and are only used for those that have too much acid reducing your stomach acids further will agitate you it may even encourage your liver to produce more bile the best solution is to consult your doctor to get the correct medication treatment in the meantime try eating more citrus fruit as this will help a bit citric acid is not as strong but it should help see your doctor and get it sorted and keep away from those so called nutritionists herbalists alternative medicine freaks many of them will cause more harm than good  Folic acid Stomach cancer Hydrogen peroxide Hydrochloric acid Vitamin C Mouth ulcer Acid Gastroesophageal reflux disease Veganism Traditional Chinese medicine Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Bipolar disorder Helicobacter pylori Garlic Obesity Cirrhosis Gastric acid Omega-3 fatty acid Buprenorphine Asthma Colorectal cancer H2-receptor antagonist Citric acid Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Migraine Alternative medicine Pharmacology Homeopathy Medicine Clinical depression Gout Soil pH Insulin Cancer Bile Yarrow Chronic fatigue syndrome Dieting Liver Alcoholism Acupuncture Biochemistry Vitamin Oily fish Phosphoric acid Psoriasis Nutrition Sugar beet Citric acid cycle Retinol Vomiting PH Caffeine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypercholesterolemia Aspartame Niacin Sulfasalazine Adjustable gastric band Atkins Nutritional Approach Water purification Patent medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nickel-cadmium battery Paget's disease of bone Stomach Tooth Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Lemon Lactobacillus acidophilus Alka-Seltzer Food preservation Ayurveda Naturopathic medicine Aloe Natural Hygiene Vinegar Herbalism Citrus Food additive Vegetarianism Tomato Olive oil Word of Wisdom Metabolic acidosis Osteoarthritis Poison Cocaine Aspirin Acne Public health in mainland China Low-carbohydrate diet

i'm trying to quit smoking any tips first off congratulations for wanting to quit smoking as far as answering there are a lot of ways the best ways are slowly lowering your dose takes a long time sometimes or going cold turkey which is faster but harder either way the last thing is making the decision to quit so you'll eventually have to deal with the withdrawal for the most part when you deal with withdrawal you'll just have to tough it out but there are some things that can help cleanse out the toxins and may help to minimize some of the effects of withdrawal drinking water will help to detox and taking some supplements that work as cleansers may help as well specifically apple cider vinegar green tea decaffeinated chlorophyll fantastic cleanser and even good amounts of fiber and water helps some people although it's not very comfortable for the lower level of detoxification you get all that being said it's likely that the symptoms should stop relatively shortly after your last cigarette it's never as long as it feels like it is your neurotransmitters don't take too terribly long to scream for something they are addicted to after you stop another important thing to note is that no matter how bad it gets taking more of the drug and yes nicotine is a drug will only make the withdrawal last longer and will be harder on you in the long run good luck and congrats again  Withdrawal Addiction Cannabis (drug) Cocaine Alzheimer's disease Caffeine Tobacco smoking Nicotine Drug addiction Vitamin C Buprenorphine Prostate cancer Tea Coffee Opioid Antidepressant Bong Methamphetamine Alcoholism Dietary fiber Illegal drug trade Arguments for and against drug prohibition Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fluoxetine Vinegar Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Tobacco Bipolar disorder Action potential Paroxetine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cider Diazepam Spice Girls Alcoholic beverage Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Narcotic Mattress Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Social rule Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Insomnia Dialysis Stomach cancer Drug test Babe Ruth Atherosclerosis Sleep Cigarette Foodborne illness LSD Health issues and the effects of cannabis Traumatic incident reduction Smoking cessation Anxiety Word of Wisdom 2000 Australian Grand Prix Snus Tocopherol W.

when you're afraid you gulp i dunno but sometimes when i'm afraid i start to gulp and i can't even control it it's like the saliva must go in rather painfull and sometimes and the only way you can ease yourself is to gulp but then your throat moves and people can tell you're afraid gaah why does this happen hey its the same with me there's nothin to worry about it i know its annoying cos every moment you feel that people are getting to know that you are uncomfortable or scared but then its helpless and then you can always disguise it as a natural gulp by trying to control your facial expression cos a lot of people gulp not from fear but by habit aaaaaaaaaaahhhh anyways keep smiling and face your fears bravely  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

how can quite smoking i hate it i hate the smell taste i have tried everything it seems but i just can't do it why first off congratulations for wanting to quit smoking as far as answering there are a lot of ways the best ways are slowly lowering your dose takes a long time sometimes or going cold turkey which is faster but harder either way the last thing is making the decision to quit so you'll eventually have to deal with the withdrawal for the most part when you deal with withdrawal you'll just have to tough it out but there are some things that can help cleanse out the toxins and may help to minimize some of the effects of withdrawal drinking water will help to detox and taking some supplements that work as cleansers may help as well specifically apple cider vinegar green tea decaffeinated chlorophyll fantastic cleanser and even good amounts of fiber and water helps some people although it's not very comfortable for the lower level of detoxification you get all that being said it's likely that the symptoms should stop relatively shortly after your last cigarette it's never as long as it feels like it is your neurotransmitters don't take too terribly long to scream for something they are addicted to after you stop another important thing to note is that no matter how bad it gets taking more of the drug and yes nicotine is a drug will only make the withdrawal last longer and will be harder on you in the long run good luck and congrats again  Addiction Withdrawal Tobacco smoking Cannabis (drug) Caffeine Cocaine Alzheimer's disease Nicotine Drug addiction Vitamin C Buprenorphine Coffee Bong Prostate cancer Tea Vinegar Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Opioid Antidepressant Alcoholism Dietary fiber Illegal drug trade Tobacco Cider Fluoxetine Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Social rule Bupropion Bipolar disorder Action potential Mattress Obsessive-compulsive disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paroxetine Cigar Diazepam Traumatic incident reduction Alcoholic beverage Spice Girls Shit Stomach cancer Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Cigarette Narcotic Babe Ruth Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Chronic fatigue syndrome Foodborne illness Microeconomics Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Health issues and the effects of cannabis Psychosis Borderline personality disorder Anxiety Sin City Snus Atherosclerosis Drug test Fitz Hugh Ludlow Cuisine of Denmark Sauna Kurt Cobain Non-medical use of dextromethorphan The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy LSD Japanese tea ceremony Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Word of Wisdom 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tocopherol W.

do substance abuse treatment programs really work i have pretty much lived a sheltered life i have an acquaintance who is going to undergo substance abuse treatment and i was just wondering whether such programs are effective well the aim of substance abuse treatment programs is to make the patient abstain from taking the substance that he happens to be dependent upon it also aims to bring back his productivity be it in the family workplace or community studies have shown that such programs have significantly decreased the usage of drugs and alcohol as well as diminished criminal activity it has also paved the way to the reduction of the proliferation of hiv infection as well as other diseases keep in mind though that the success of treatment programs such as this still relies upon the individual your acquaintance after finishing with the program will have to continually avoid being lured to do drugs or alcohol again  Drug addiction Drug abuse Alcoholism Addiction Cancer Diazepam Antiretroviral drug Migraine Harm reduction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Folic acid Immunosuppressive drug Clinical depression Chemotherapy Controlled Substances Act Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Arguments for and against drug prohibition Narcotic Pharmaceutical company Haloperidol Bipolar disorder Cannabis (drug) Psoriasis Homeopathy HIV Insulin Methamphetamine Trimipramine Psychosis Hepatitis C Alcoholics Anonymous Chlorpromazine Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cirrhosis Hypertension Clomipramine AIDS Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Illegal drug trade Rape Schizophrenia Cocaine Herpes simplex virus Prohibition (drugs) Convention on Psychotropic Substances HIV vaccine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Methylphenidate Multiple sclerosis Prostate cancer Crohn's disease Antidepressant Bupropion Parkinson's disease Medicine Malaria Substance abuse Hearing impairment Tobacco smoking Sexual abstinence Immune system Borderline personality disorder Medical analysis of circumcision Mesothelioma Paracetamol Timeline of AIDS Buprenorphine Alzheimer's disease Anxiety Psychiatry Safe sex Epilepsy Acne Animal testing Alcohol Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Word of Wisdom Methadone Doxepin National Institutes of Health LSD Lung cancer Food and Drug Administration Pneumonia DDT Hypoglycemia HIV test Traumatic brain injury Osteoporosis Ulcerative colitis Mental Health Act 1983 Tuberculosis Diabetes mellitus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Maprotiline Medical cannabis Health issues and the effects of cannabis

a question about addiction treatment i was just wondering whether there are statistics that show facts on whether persons who had spent their time in jail and gotten addiction treatment were really better off when they got out of jail than those who did not undergo addiction treatment yes there are indeed statistics that prove that persons who had undergone treatment for their addiction were better off than those who didn't the federal bureau of prisons had conducted a survey of the outcomes of drug treatment programs among inmates who were already released and have completed the program it was found that only were likely to be rearrested during the first months after they were released from jail as opposed to the of inmates who didn't get to receive treatment  Prisons in the United States Bipolar disorder Alcoholism Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Plame affair Stomach cancer Richard Allen Davis Life imprisonment Sexual orientation Prohibition (drugs) Kareem Said Parole Controlled Substances Act Duesberg hypothesis Neighbours Martha Stewart Antidepressant Simon Adebisi Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Red Hot Chili Peppers Addiction Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Psychiatric hospital Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Prisoner's dilemma Judith Miller (journalist) Probation officer Ross Perot Randomized controlled trial Census Vernon Schillinger Schapelle Corby Hubert Selby Jr. Pete Doherty Domestic violence John Holmes (actor) Clinical depression Days of our Lives Prison Oz (TV series) Buprenorphine Mordechai Vanunu Good Times Unlawful combatant Drug abuse Sexual addiction Human rights in the United States Alternative medicine Health care in the United States Divorce Alcoholics Anonymous Drug test Methylphenidate Transsexuality Darryl Strawberry Psychiatry Cancer Controversies in autism Harm reduction Kenny Wangler Camp Delta Anti-psychiatry Appeal Punisher Guantanamo Bay Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Neuro-linguistic programming AIDS in Africa Porridge (TV) Miscarriage of justice Arkham Asylum Johnny Cash Methadone Requiem for a Dream History of As the World Turns (2000-present) William S.
