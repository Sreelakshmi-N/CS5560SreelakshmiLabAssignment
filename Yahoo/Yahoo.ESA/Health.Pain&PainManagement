has anyone ever had a hip replacement and one leg is shorter then the other after surgery i have that problem need someone to share what they are doing actually it is more common than you think it could be a measurement problem when ordering the original prosthesis it could be they ran into trouble due to stress cracks in the femur that it needed to be placed down a little further than anticipated the more important part is to get you through the surgery extra delays is more time under anesthesia and difficulty with the heart or possible infections if the one leg is slightly off then the shoe sole is thickened on one shoe to make up the difference another possibility is the insertion of an insole into only one shoe for aesthetics depending on the amount of adjustment needed by the way this happens as a natural occurrence without the benefit of surgery as well there are many people with congential defects that make one leg shorter than the other the same thing is done for them  Equine conformation Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Hip fracture Urinary incontinence Hip replacement Strap-on dildo Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spina bifida Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Iliotibial band syndrome Folic acid Local anesthesia Intersex surgery Replacement joint Hormone replacement therapy (trans) High-heeled shoe Shoe Orthopedic surgery Multiple sclerosis Cricket Traumatic brain injury Medicine Hearing impairment Swimming Post Polio syndrome Cephalic disorder Organ transplant Growth hormone treatment Snowboard Drag racing Stress fracture Cancer Hebrew calendar Hypoglycemia Cholecystitis Bone fracture CPU cache James Brown (musician) Stomach cancer Hip dysplasia Tai Chi Chuan Glossary of climbing terms Adjustable gastric band Foot Myocardial infarction Floppy disk Welding Free trade Radar Horse gait Childbirth Turner syndrome Horseshoe Insurance Aneurysm Redundant array of independent disks Tyrannosaurus rex Knee Sniper Premature birth Single Transferable Vote Non-native pronunciations of English Pneumonia Havanese Fast bowling Chemotherapy Congenital disorder Benzene Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Blackjack Lung cancer Stroke Duchenne muscular dystrophy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Callus Oral contraceptive Inflation Mental retardation General anaesthesia R46 (New York City Subway car) Cryptanalysis Table saw Drill bit Dyslexia Glossary of partner dance terms E85 Intraocular lens Labor theory of value Tibia Infantilism Oscilloscope Medical analysis of circumcision Breast implant 1957 World Series Sock Password cracking Vitamin C Sickle-cell disease

in the medical field what is an osteopath an osteopath is a doctor who has had training similar to that of an md the philosophy of osteopaths differs from that of an md in that osteopaths believe in the body s innate ability to heal itself thus the osteopath will consider the whole patient rather than the symptoms a doctor of osteopathy can prescribe drugs perform surgery and use all scientifically accepted methods to treat their patients doctors of osteopathic medicine dos practise a whole person approach which means they consider both the physical and mental needs of their patients this holistic approach to health care was actually developed by an american md dr andrew taylor still feared that th century medicine was doing more harm than good disgusted at the ineffectiveness of fellow practitioners during the civil war he decided to focus on the body's ability to heal itself and began to stress preventive medicine  Alternative medicine Naturopathic medicine Physician Traditional Chinese medicine Reiki Chiropractic Homeopathy Medical school Stomach cancer Natural health Psychiatry General practitioner Psychotherapy Doctorate Cancer Health science Quackery Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Meditation Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Physical therapy Ayurveda Insomnia Transsexuality Reparative therapy Common cold Drug abuse Church of Christ, Scientist Faith healing Addiction Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Hypnosis Iridology Health profession Abortion Asthma Triage Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma History of medicine Stroke Patent medicine Medical prescription Nurse Psychology Diabetes mellitus Sigmund Freud Epilepsy Dentistry Anorexia nervosa Subluxation Medieval medicine Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Mental Health Act 1983 Ethics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stress (medicine) Psychopharmacology Medical record Folic acid Orthopedic surgery Prayer Migraine Neuro-linguistic programming Neurofeedback Mental illness Involuntary commitment A Course In Miracles Evidence-based medicine Borderline personality disorder History of alternative medicine Palliative care Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor New Age Science Acupuncture Ulcerative colitis Psychiatric hospital Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Myocardial infarction Schizophrenia Eczema Sleep apnea Scientology beliefs and practices

oxycontin mg is that the same as taking mg of oxycodone ir every hours im trying to figure out why my cousin got prescribed oxy's instead of her usual percocet she was fine with mg of percocet every hours and now was switched to oxy mg im nervous for her because she is opiate naive and was flying from just the mg i made sure to tell her not to ever split or crush the pills since she was about to break it in half to see how she would react thank god i was there thanks everyone so far thats what i though that the doctor upped the dose he should have prescribed her the mg oxy since she was fine taking mg every hours since the oxy only lasts hours you know and no she dosn't crush pills she just wanted to split one thanks again the mg ir is immediate release and the effects only last hours for pain relief the mg is sustained relief and the effects last for hours it is a longer acting medication so she should be taking fewer doses this is probably what the doctor was thinking when he changed the meds he must have thought she was taking them to often he upped the dose a bit but she can take half a tablet if it will suit her needs if she is crushing them or cutting them in half she is doing so to get a buzz or high from the pills she may be addicted and need to seek help to break the habit  Oxycodone Paracetamol Buprenorphine Migraine Drug addiction Diazepam Opioid Analgesic Antidepressant Medical prescription Methylphenidate Methadone Methamphetamine Addiction Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Barbiturate Narcotic Cannabis (drug) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Asthma Maprotiline Cocaine Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Local anesthesia LSD Medical cannabis Medicine Sedative Drug abuse Tocopherol Radiation therapy Apollo 8 Sulfasalazine Folic acid Emergency contraception Menstrual cycle Ketamine St John's wort Coffee Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Hydrocodone Malaria Illegal drug trade COX-2 inhibitor Cephalexin Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Physician Antipsychotic Rabies Diabetes mellitus Osteoarthritis Clomipramine Extreme Programming Propranolol Sildenafil Animal testing Decompression sickness Zolpidem Venlafaxine Lamotrigine Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prohibition (drugs) Herpes simplex virus Amiodarone Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Radiation poisoning Alternative medicine Howard Hughes Homeopathy Ionizing radiation Elvis Presley Aspirin Fasting Flunitrazepam Kurt Cobain Pharmaceutical company Doxepin Insulin Hypnosis Multiple sclerosis Withdrawal Opium Benzodiazepine Paroxetine Alanis Morissette Chemical abortion Codeine Baldness treatments Urinary incontinence Paget's disease of bone

what's wrong with my leg i got a pain in my left leg and it seems to be coming from the same area where a vein is popping out and there are other vein visible around it that weren't there before right now my leftfoot seems to be swelling up and the reason i awoke early this morning was because of pain from the swelling in my right foot and knee at first i attributed this to my dancing yesterday but now i'm getting similar feeling in the bridge of my nose i don't know though i agree with a previous poster that you should go to a doc mainly because i've never heard of that feeling on the bridge of your nose i've had swelling in my legs and feet and it does hurt went to my g p about it and he said it was a medication i was taking too much of plus sitting up for too many hours on the puter had a friend whose legs swelled up also and she also had the veins showing she used cocoa butter on those areas and that helped the thing that helps the most is to put your feet up as often as you can watching tv resting in bed reading etc in fact it helps pretty quickly and is a great relief hope this helps you  Diving Aerial (dance move) Escape from New York Professional wrestling holds Jon Secada Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story Paul Is Dead Milton H.

help i think i am dying of food poisoining i have back ache aswell how do i rest food poisoning treatment self care at home short episodes of vomiting and small amounts of diarrhea lasting less than hours can usually be cared for at home do not eat solid food while nauseous or vomiting but drink plenty of fluids small frequent sips of clear liquids those you can see through are the best way to stay hydrated avoid alcoholic caffeinated or sugary drinks if possible over the counter rehydration products made for children such as pedialyte and rehydralyte are expensive but good to use if available sports drinks such as gatorade and powerade are fine for adults if they are diluted with water because at full strength they contain too much sugar which can worsen diarrhea after successfully tolerating fluids eating should begin slowly when nausea and vomiting have stopped plain foods that are easy on the stomach should be started in small amounts consider eating rice wheat breads potatoes cereals low sugar cereals lean meats and chicken not fried to start milk can be given safely although some people may experience additional stomach upset due to lactose intolerance most food poisonings do not require the use of over the counter medicines to stop diarrhea but they are generally safe if used as directed it is not recommended that these medications be given to children if there is a question or concern you should always check with your doctor  Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Food Chocolate Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lactose intolerance Crohn's disease Coeliac disease Veganism Hypoglycemia Rehydration Dehydration Milk Vegetarianism Atkins Nutritional Approach Breakfast Prostate cancer Folic acid Food allergy Adjustable gastric band Gastroparesis Hangover Gastroesophageal reflux disease Paracetamol Guinea pig Dietary fiber Breakfast cereal Sulfasalazine Fancy rat Diabetes mellitus Anorexia nervosa German cuisine Gastroenteritis Japanese cuisine Fugu Jewish cuisine Ulcerative colitis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Aspartame Russian cuisine Tooth Hamster Kosher foods Vomiting Domestic rabbit Tofu Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cuisine of Denmark Multiple chemical sensitivity Alcohol fuel Porridge Charles Darwin's illness Marathon (sport) Migraine Ramen Urinary incontinence Cheese Tocopherol Gout Cuisine of Brazil Soy milk Roman eating and drinking Glycogen storage disease type I Food preservation Bread Homeopathy Cat Psoriasis Soft drink Chicken Japanese tea ceremony Tea French cuisine Nutrition Protein-energy malnutrition Common cold Sewage treatment Dairy Alcoholic beverage Agriculture Urine Cuisine of Malaysia Radiation poisoning Medical cannabis Buprenorphine Vitamin C Growth hormone treatment Chemotherapy Cantonese cuisine

chest pain hey i'm almost and sometimes my chest will start to hurt the pain doesn't go beneath my sternum or above my neck it's all inside my body too like there's no muscle or skin pain at all nowhere else in my body hurts when this pain comes it starts hurting at completely random times i can't figure out any common factors between when it hurts one time and then when it happens the next time it starts very mildly and sometimes i don't even notice it but if i don't do anything about it the pain can get really bad one time i couldn't focus on anything but the pain it was so bad if i lower my upper body towards my legs or lay down the pain lessens and goes away within minutes when i was a kid i had a temporary form of asthma so at first i thought that maybe i developed a full case of asthma however i don't have a problem breathing taking deep breaths does hurt a little though usually if the pain gets bad i'll breath shallow but not because my breathing is constricted oh what i want to know is what's wrong with me sorry lol i got carried away with the description and forgot the question no i haven't suffered any injuries lately and i haven't been sick well i had a guy problem that seems to have cleared up by itself but one that definitely was not an std if the pain is primarily provoked by breathing i'd tend to lead to plurecy this isn't too horrible just extremely painfull plurecy is when the plura outside lining of the lungs separates or dries out the plura and the lungs then rub on each other causing pain upon inspiration breathing in pain can be moderate to severe depending on the severity of the condition either way consult your doctor they may have treatments for you or something to help with the pain  Asthma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Diving First aid Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Lung cancer Drowning Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Massage Theory of conduct Hip fracture Spanking Myocardial infarction Angina Swimming Prostate cancer Pain Carpal tunnel syndrome Weight training Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tai Chi Chuan Aerial (dance move) Childbirth Gastroesophageal reflux disease Pulmonary embolism Acupuncture Cephalic disorder Mesothelioma Medicine Radiation therapy Tuberculosis Sleep apnea Sternum Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lung Milton H.

every time i stand up sit up my head throbs times and stops what the title says basically it's not that i'm sitting laying down for elongated periods of time i can sit for seconds stand up and my head will start throbbing a couple of time and quit it's not very painful but enough to be noticeable i don't get tunnel vision either so i don't think it's a case of standing up too quickly what do you guys think i have experienced this before too i do have low blood pressure sometimes or also i tend to feel this way when my blood glucose level is either too low or too high i am diabetic so those things do affect blood flow it could be nothing or it could be several things best thing is to go to a doctor preferably begin with a neurologist who can maybe do a brain scan and rule out anything serious with your nervous system or an impending mini stroke or something once that is ruled out i would go to a major medical center and get an appointment with a pulmonologist or cardiac specialist who can take it from there and rule several things and further refer you to other departments within the medical center until you are satisfied that you have found the correct cause i know it sounds extreme but that little bit can be a sign of mini strokes and they can lead to more dangerous problems hope everything goes ok maybe it is just a simple thing that can be diagnosed and will eventually go away but do not put off seeing a doctor and soon waiting can lead to worse problems down the road if you notice it then it is not weird to seek medical advice good luck  Stroke Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Medicine Hypertension Blood pressure Traumatic brain injury Insulin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetic neuropathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction Decompression sickness Terri Schiavo Cardiac arrhythmia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Epilepsy Multiple sclerosis Diabetic retinopathy First aid Aortic dissection Prostate cancer Coma Stuttering Brain Dyslexia Alzheimer's disease Syringomyelia Paget's disease of bone Physical examination Dieting Lupus erythematosus Bipolar disorder Drowning Obstetrics Migraine Chlorpromazine Shock Folic acid Panic attack Muscle Malaria Pain Breastfeeding Tobacco smoking Gastroparesis Lumbar puncture Angina Autism Adult attention-deficit disorder Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Anxiety Acromegaly Atrial septal defect Stomach cancer Asthma Dialysis Cardiovascular disease Aspartame Propranolol Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Cardiac output Carpal tunnel syndrome Dog training Balance disorder Turner syndrome Equine conformation Social rule Sleep Intracranial pressure Theory of conduct Publicly funded medicine Aerial (dance move) Terri Schiavo timeline Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Obesity Autoimmune diseases National Institutes of Health Transactional analysis Endometriosis Animal testing Addiction Glaucoma Dog agility Psychosis Pulmonology Milton H.

how do i stop being scared of needles i hate shots and blood tests since i'm kind of young i'm going to have to have them all my life is there any way to stop being scared please help i used to be the same way i'd actually go into a near passed out state happened to me many many times but then i learned that if i focused on something else like say pretending i was playing soccer or fighting someone it really helped out just remember too getting a shot or your blood drawn won't kill you also it helps if you don't look and forwarn the doctor you may puke or pass out they usually let you lay down and its much better if you do black out nothing happens they give you some smelling salts the shot is just a small prick and if youare like me you prob kept thinking about how all this blood may or may not supernaturally squirt all over the place and you could die thats what i used to think or imagine but this cannot happen so i say just suck it up and focus on something else you could bring an ipod and listen to some music  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City John F.

my mother's legs keeps on cramping locking up resulting in horrific pain her right leg and sometimes her left leg completely locks up but the pain is located towards the bottom parts of her leg below her knee and sometimes above it's excruciating pain to the point where she starts crying and rubbing the bottom part of the leg all over helps relieve the pain any ideas on what the heck is going on i'm extremely worried as this has happened several times she's already going to the doctor but if anyone has had any experience with this please give me ideas that could help relieve the pain there are a few issues that could be playing into this pain she is having first and easily fixed is charlie horses severe muscle spasms that are typically caused by a deficiency in salt potasium and water if thats not it it could be a vascular condition which is probably the most devistating if this is the case they can try to stent the main arteries in her legs to open blood flow to the lower regions if the arteries are diseased the only fix for this is bypasses to create flow to the lower regions one way to check this is to listen or feel for the pulse points in her feet ankles if it is strong and noticable it may be something else lastly disc problems in the lower lumbar spine can cause nerve damage in the legs and potential pain and muscle loss my own father has been dealing with similiar pain and his is vascular i hope she gets better if not its probably best to take her to a doctor  Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Angina Myocardial infarction Back pain Atherosclerosis Spina bifida Professional wrestling holds Diabetic neuropathy Osteoarthritis Acupuncture Prostate cancer Cephalic disorder Urinary incontinence Childbirth Insulin Paget's disease of bone Chronic fatigue syndrome Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Stroke Decompression sickness Heart Multiple sclerosis First aid Cramp Diabetes mellitus Pain Stomach cancer Penis Fecal incontinence Obstetrics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Post Polio syndrome Peripheral artery occlusive disease Pressure point Anxiety Breech birth Local anesthesia Gout Spinal cord injury Cerebellum Spinal stenosis Hypertension Weight training Asthma Physical examination Carpal tunnel syndrome Sciatica Blood pressure Circulatory system Glaucoma Angioplasty Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hip fracture Autoimmune diseases Lumbar puncture Anatomical terms of location Cirrhosis Abdominal pain Atrial septal defect Syringomyelia Pulse Coeliac disease Charles Darwin's illness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gastroparesis Blood vessel Diving Acute respiratory distress syndrome Peripheral vascular examination Growth hormone treatment Chiropractic History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Neuralgia Atheroma Massage Suicide methods Fascial compartment Erectile dysfunction Stopping power Aspartame Intracranial pressure Aerial (dance move) Anal sex Clinical depression Medicine Endometriosis Migraine Milton H.

opiate addict weening off anyone have any first hand knowledge of suboxone so you have all heard the stories with the i had this and that surgery and the doc gave me this and that yep same here for a while i was taking up to norco 's per day all of a sudden my doc stopped prescribing them to me so i got them off the street my habit was costing me a month easily one sunday about weeks ago i decided to stop cold turkey the first hours were hell the second were equally as bed and the third day i started feeling a little better but still crappy i went back to my doc and the pain management spc said to ween me off so he gave me and i started decreasing from a dose down to i got another and am down to pill twice a day but miss the high and have already gone to buy some more off the street just so i can ween even slower i am confident i will ween down and stop but once that is done i need a plan so has anyone ever had any first hand experience or knowledge of suboxone my plan is those and na hey there jay well im definitely familar with what you're going thru my husband and i have tooken painkillers like vicodin norcos percs etc you get the idea i started taking them just because of the hype very dumb and found out wow i like this feeling my husband took them for the high feeling and for his lower back pinched nerve we too have have bought them off the street his mom has had previous back surgeries and spends unfortunately about week on pills off the street this lady puts anyone to shame pops like a day its sickening but anyways back in february my husband decided enough was enough he figured why bother wasting his money for a feeling of you're first high experience you'll never really feel again so he went to his doctor who specializes with suboxone he prescribed him mg of it when he made the appt the nurse told my husband on the phone when he comes in he has to be in a mild moderate withdrawal therefore when they gave him the suboxone it could work properly because if you pop a pain pill before you take suboxone your body can actually go into more of a feening craving withdrawal feeling so that first day he took a whole suboxone the way to take this medicine you have to stick it under your tongue and let it dissolve so it goes into your bloodstream that first day was still pretty rough for him he layed in bed pretty much all day because he actually felt high from the suboxone which you do feel somewhat to get you away from the other opiates but then after the first day he broke the pill into 's and took a piece at a time he hated the way it tasted even though they try to make the pill not taste too bad since you're suppose to let it dissolve for a few minutes so he just would swallow the piece of the pill then later in the day if he felt like he was starting to feel that craving or withdrawal feeling he would take another piece but all in all since ive tooken painkillers as well i too have taken suboxone as well it does help alot and it really gets you thru the tough shitty times some people are anti medicine only natural spiritual things can help yeah that maybe so but to me some people like myself and husband need that extra kick in the butt and suboxone worked for us but of course this is just from our experience and im definitely no doctor if you're from the detroit mi area i know a doctor who prescribes them and helps people with this problem now if only his mom would get help but thats her choice i truly wish you the best of luck i hope this sorta helped in anyway go to this website for more information www suboxone com  Kurt Cobain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

my knee pain hello when i play basketball run or workout i get pain behind upper of my knee cap and my knee's turn red manly my right knee funny i know its hard to continue my exercises i want to know what causes this thanks and have a great day it sounds like you may have gout what is gout gout is a painful condition that occurs when the bodily waste product uric acid is deposited as needle like crystals in the joints and or soft tissues in the joints these uric acid crystals cause inflammatory arthritis which in turn leads to intermittent swelling redness heat pain and stiffness in the joints in many people gout initially affects the joints of the big toe a condition called podagra but many other joints and areas around the joints can be affected in addition to or instead of the big toe these include the insteps ankles heels knees wrists fingers and elbows chalky deposits of uric acid also known as tophi can appear as lumps under the skin that surrounds the joints and covers the rim of the ear uric acid crystals can also collect in the kidneys and cause kidney stones what is uric acid uric acid is a substance that results from the breakdown of purines a normal part of all human tissue purines are found in many foods normally uric acid is dissolved in the blood and passed through the kidneys into the urine where it is eliminated if there is an increase in the production of uric acid or if the kidneys do not eliminate enough uric acid from the body levels of it build up in the blood a condition called hyperuricemia hyperuricemia also may result when a person eats too many high purine foods such as liver dried beans and peas anchovies and gravies hyperuricemia is not a disease and by itself it is not dangerous however if excess uric acid crystals form as a result of hyperuricemia gout can develop the crystals form and accumulate in the joint causing inflammation what are the four stages of gout literally translated arthritis means joint inflammation it refers to more than different diseases that affect the joints gout accounts for approximately percent of all cases of arthritis the disease can progress through four stages asymptomatic without symptoms hyperuricemia in this stage a person has elevated levels of uric acid in the blood hyperuricemia but no other symptoms treatment is usually not required acute gout or acute gouty arthritis in this stage hyperuricemia has caused the deposit of uric acid crystals in joint spaces this leads to a sudden onset of intense pain and swelling in the joints which also may be warm and very tender an acute attack commonly occurs at night and can be triggered by stressful events alcohol or drugs or the presence of another illness attacks usually subside within to days even without treatment and the next attack may not occur for months or even years over time however attacks can last longer and occur more frequently interval or intercritical gout this is the period between acute attacks in this stage a person does not have any symptoms chronic tophaceous gout this is the most disabling stage of gout it usually develops over a long period such as years in this stage the disease may have caused permanent damage to the affected joints and sometimes to the kidneys with proper treatment most people with gout do not progress to this advanced stage when it s not gout it may be pseudogout gout is sometimes confused with other forms of arthritis because the symptoms acute and episodic attacks of joint warmth pain swelling and stiffness can be similar one form of arthritis often confused with gout is called pseudogout the pain swelling and redness of pseudogout can also come on suddenly and may be severe closely resembling the symptoms of gout however the crystals that irritate the joint are calcium phosphate crystals not uric acid therefore pseudogout is treated somewhat differently and is not reviewed in this booklet what causes gout a number of risk factors are associated with hyperuricemia and gout they include genetics twenty percent of people with gout have a family history of the disease gender and age it is more common in men than in women and more common in adults than in children weight being overweight increases the risk of developing hyperuricemia and gout because there is more tissue available for turnover or breakdown which leads to excess uric acid production alcohol consumption drinking too much alcohol can lead to hyperuricemia because alcohol interferes with the removal of uric acid from the body diet eating too many foods that are rich in purines can cause or aggravate gout in some people lead exposure in some cases exposure to lead in the environment can cause gout other health problems renal insufficiency or the inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste products is a common cause of gout in older people other medical problems that contribute to high blood levels of uric acid include high blood pressure hypothyroidism underactive thyroid gland conditions that cause an excessively rapid turnover of cells such as psoriasis hemolytic anemia or some cancers kelley seegmiller syndrome or lesch nyhan syndrome two rare conditions in which the enzyme that helps control uric acid levels either is not present or is found in insufficient quantities medications a number of medications may put people at risk for developing hyperuricemia and gout they include diuretics such as furosemide lasix hydrochlorothiazide esidrix hydro chlor and metolazone diulo zaroxolyn which are taken to eliminate excess fluid from the body in conditions like hypertension edema and heart disease and which decrease the amount of uric acid passed in the urine salicylate containing drugs such as aspirin niacin a vitamin also known as nicotinic acid cyclosporine sandimmune neoral a medication that suppresses the body s immune system the system that protects the body from infection and disease this medication is used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases and to prevent the body s rejection of transplanted organs levodopa larodopa a medicine used to support communication along nerve pathways in the treatment of parkinson s disease brand names included in this booklet are provided as examples only and their inclusion does not mean that these products are endorsed by the national institutes of health or any other government agency also if a particular brand name is not mentioned this does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory who is likely to develop gout gout occurs in of every people it is rare in children and young adults men particularly those between the ages of and are more likely to develop gout than women who rarely develop the disorder before menopause people who have had an organ transplant are more susceptible to gout how is gout diagnosed gout may be difficult for doctors to diagnose because the symptoms can be vague and gout often mimics other conditions although most people with gout have hyperuricemia at some time during the course of their disease it may not be present during an acute attack in addition having hyperuricemia alone does not mean that a person will get gout in fact most people with hyperuricemia do not develop the disease to confirm a diagnosis of gout a doctor may insert a needle into an inflamed joint and draw a sample of synovial fluid the substance that lubricates a joint the joint fluid is placed on a slide and examined under a microscope for uric acid crystals their absence however does not completely rule out the diagnosis the doctor also may find it helpful to look for uric acid crystals around joints to diagnose gout gout attacks may mimic joint infections and a doctor who suspects a joint infection rather than gout may also culture the joint fluid to see whether bacteria are present signs and symptoms of gout hyperuricemia presence of uric acid crystals in joint fluid more than one attack of acute arthritis arthritis that develops in a day producing a swollen red and warm joint attack of arthritis in only one joint often the toe ankle or knee how is gout treated with proper treatment most people who have gout are able to control their symptoms and live productive lives gout can be treated with one or a combination of therapies the goals of treatment are to ease the pain associated with acute attacks to prevent future attacks and to avoid the formation of tophi and kidney stones successful treatment can reduce discomfort caused by the symptoms of gout as well as long term damage to the affected joints treatment will help to prevent disability due to gout the most common treatments for an acute attack of gout are nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids taken orally by mouth or corticosteroids which are taken orally or injected into the affected joint nsaids reduce the inflammation caused by deposits of uric acid crystals but have no effect on the amount of uric acid in the body the nsaids most commonly prescribed for gout are indomethacin indocin and naproxen anaprox naprosyn which are taken orally every day corticosteroids are strong anti inflammatory hormones the most commonly prescribed corticosteroid is prednisone patients often begin to improve within a few hours of treatment with a corticosteroid and the attack usually goes away completely within a week or so when nsaids or corticosteroids do not control symptoms the doctor may consider using colchicine this drug is most effective when taken within the first hours of an acute attack doctors may ask patients to take oral colchicine as often as every hour until joint symptoms begin to improve or side effects such as nausea vomiting abdominal cramps or diarrhea make it uncomfortable to continue the drug for some patients the doctor may prescribe either nsaids or oral colchicine in small daily doses to prevent future attacks the doctor also may consider prescribing medicine such as allopurinol zyloprim or probenecid benemid to treat hyperuricemia and reduce the frequency of sudden attacks and the development of tophi people who have other medical problems such as high blood pressure or high blood triglycerides fats may find that the drugs they take for those conditions can also be useful for gout both losartan cozaar a blood pressure medication and fenofibrate tricor a triglyceride lowering drug also help reduce blood levels of uric acid the doctor may also recommend losing weight for those who are overweight limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding or limiting high purine foods which can increase uric acid levels what can people with gout do to stay healthy fortunately gout can be controlled people with gout can decrease the severity of attacks and reduce their risk of future attacks by taking their medications as prescribed acute gout is best controlled if medications are taken at the first sign of pain or inflammation other steps you can take to stay healthy and minimize gout s effect on your life include the following tell your doctor about all the medicines and vitamins you take he or she can tell you if any of them increase your risk of hyperuricemia plan followup visits with your doctor to evaluate your progress drink plenty of nonalcoholic fluids especially water nonalcoholic fluids help remove uric acid from the body alcohol on the other hand can raise the levels of uric acid in your blood exercise regularly and maintain a healthy body weight lose weight if you are overweight but avoid low carbohydrate diets that are designed for quick weight loss when carbohydrate intake is insufficient your body can t completely burn its own fat as a consequence substances called ketones form and are released into the bloodstream resulting in a condition called ketosis after a short time ketosis can increase the level of uric acid in your blood avoid foods that are high in purines high purine foods anchovies asparagus beef kidneys brains dried beans and peas game meats gravy herring liver mackerel mushrooms sardines scallops sweetbreads what research is being conducted to help people with gout because uric acid s role in gout is well understood and medications to ease attacks and reduce the risk or severity of future attacks are widely available gout is one of the most if not the most controllable forms of arthritis but researchers continue to make advances that help people live with gout perhaps someday these advances will prevent this extremely painful disease some current areas of gout research include the following refining current treatments while many medications are available to treat gout doctors are trying to determine which of the treatments are most effective and at which dosages recent studies have compared the effectiveness of different nsaids in treating the pain and inflammation of gout and have looked at the optimal dosages of colchicine and allopurinol a uric acid lowering drug to control and or prevent painful attacks evaluating new therapies a number of new therapies have shown promise in recent studies they include infliximab remicade and other biologic agents that block a chemical called tumor necrosis factor this chemical is believed to play a role in the inflammation of gout another new drug therapy is febuoxostat which works by blocking an enzyme involved in the production of uric acid discovering the role of foods gout is the one form of arthritis for which there is proof that specific foods worsen the symptoms now research is suggesting that certain foods may also prevent gout in a study published in the new england journal of medicine scientists found that a high intake of low fat dairy products reduces the risk of gout in men by half the reason for this protective effect is not yet known another study examining the effects of vitamin c on uric acid suggests that it may be beneficial in the prevention and management of gout and other diseases that are associated with uric acid production searching for new treatment approaches scientists are also studying the contributions of different types of cells that participate in both the acute and chronic joint manifestations of gout the specific goals of this research are to better understand how urate crystals activate white blood cells called neutrophils leading to acute gout attacks how urate crystals affect the immune system leading to chronic gout and how urate crystals interact with bone cells in a way that causes debilitating bone lesions among people with chronic gout the hope is that a better understanding of the various inflammatory reactions that occur in gout will provide innovative clues for treatment examining how genetics and environmental factors can affect hyperuricemia researchers are studying different populations in which gout is prevalent to determine how certain genes and environmental factors may affect blood levels of uric acid which can leak out and crystallize in the joint leading to gout

whats the best thing to do for shin splints i'm in the middle of my football two a days it really hurts when i run anny suggestions for things that would help sooner or later almost all runners experience pain in the calf or shin there are several types of overuse injuries that may develop in this region as a result of the repeated pounding from running shin splints stress fractures and chronic compartment syndrome have a common mechanism of development understanding the circumstances that lead to these injuries is the key to preventing them the overall recurring theme that leads to overuse running injuries is excess training with inadequate recovery excess and inadequate are relative terms and must be judged against one s usual training routine the more that excess and inadequate deviate from the usual training routine the less time it takes for an overuse injury to develop keeping this theme in mind one can now examine the specifics for how shin splints develop a simplified view of the mechanics of running shows a foot strike then a loading energy transfer phase and finally a push off toe off with the forefoot each foot strike delivers a shockwave that travels up the leg this energy must be absorbed by the musculoskeletal system the harder the running surface the greater the shockwave soft grass smooth dirt asphalt and concrete represent in order of increasing hardness the usual spectrum of commonly encountered running surfaces concrete is very hard on the body and training on this surface should be avoided distance running shoes are specifically designed to provide padding and support for the biomechanics of endurance running they help absorb shock and facilitate efficient energy motion transfer matching the type of running shoe to the athlete s specific biomechanics and proper shoe fit are important similarly worn out shoes should be replaced early because of reduced shock absorbing capacity runners with high rigid arches tend to experience greater pounding shock whereas those with flat feet tend to experience greater fatigue of the muscles that support the foot and push off both tend to develop shin splints the term shin splints refers to a painful condition that develops along the inside medial edge of the shin tibia the usual location is along the lower half of the tibia anywhere from a few inches above the ankle to about half way up the shin the repeated running cycle of pounding and push off results in muscle fatigue which may then lead to higher forces being applied to the fascia the attachment of fascia to bone and finally the bone itself respectively this represents a spectrum from mild to severe on the relatively more severe end of the scale the injury may progress from stress reaction within the bone to an actual stress fracture in the early stage of shin splints a runner will describe a pain that is present when the training run first begins but then disappears as running continues the pain will often return after exercise or the following morning as the injury progresses the athlete will experience more time with the pain and less time without it there is frequently a tender zone along the medial edge of the tibia that one can map out by pressing with the fingertips as they march up along the bone eventually if ignored and training continued the pain may become quite sharp and may focus on a very small area of the bone if this happens a stress fracture should be considered the treatment for shin splints is rest depending upon severity it is often necessary to completely stop running for a period of time generally this is done until day to day activities are pain free when running is resumed and this is where many injured runners make a mistake it must be significantly different from the routine that lead to the injury the concept of relative rest employs lengthening the interval between training as well as decreasing the volume and intensity of training one can often substitute cross training activities e g bicycling for running to help increase the interval between running days there should be a graded and gradual increase in run training keeping an eye out for the return of any shin splint symptoms stretching and strengthening the calf muscles can help prevent the injury from returning however the most important preventive strategy is not to repeat the mistakes that lead to the injury examine all the training variables surface shoes training volume intensity workout type hills weather conditions etc seek help from a qualified trainer or coach this all takes time and effort but it is well worth it related stretches  Alexander Technique Bicycle Terminal ballistics Car handling Diving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Seismic retrofit Asthma

heat exhaustion i'm going to be a freshman and today was the first day of volleyball tryouts when i got there i felt fine and ready to work but as the tryouts progressed i started to feel sicker and sicker about minutes into the tryouts i started to have a little trouble breathing but that was just because i was working my body harder than i usually do and then i started to feel tired and a little dizzy lightheaded i think there the same thing eventually i started feeling like i was going to throw up and so i asked to go to the bathroom and i almost threw up but i didn't so i went to the bathroom and sat on the floor for a few minutes and i started to feel better i went to the bathroom because i didn't want to make a big deal out of it and ruin my chances i started feeling bad again so i asked my coach if i could sit and he asked if i felt dizzy lightheaded and i said no because again i didn't want to make a big deal out of it but i did say that my stomach sort of hurt and he said to just stand because that would be better than standing he also said to drink water but the water made me feel sick because it was warm i also forgot my water bottle and i was really thirsty so maybe i was dehydrated what do you think was wrong it was also hot and i was sweating alot i also have a sunburn but i don't know if that had anything to do with it except for the fact that it may have made me hotter warmer same thing this actually happened last night and i was just wondering so that the same thing doesn't happen at the nd day of practice tonight i've suffered heat exhaustion twice and it sounds like you might have had the early symptoms as long as you can sweat it isn't heat stroke my doctor told me that since i had it twice i will be more likely to suffer it again and that turned out to be true just remember what the symptoms felt like and if you ever feel like that again remove yourself from that environment drink water and cool off you are young so take care of yourself and you should be fine from now on it could happen to anyone before any physical activity hydrate yourself as much as possible and keep water nearby  Hyperthermia The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Avenue Q Sauna Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Dialysis Chronic fatigue syndrome Sandy Koufax Water First aid Traumatic brain injury Panic attack Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Stomach cancer One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Marilyn Monroe 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Humphrey Bogart Thermoregulation Jam (TV series) Blood on the Tracks Fecal incontinence Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jackass: The Movie Ex-gay Pitaten Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Sin City Breastfeeding God Emperor of Dune Satchel Paige AFI 100 Years series Diving Survival skills Hypothermia The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Stroke Ebola Balance disorder Friends Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cancer Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 2) Drowning YuYu Hakusho The Contender (television series) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Babe Ruth K' Ben Johnson (athlete) Prostate cancer Bong Caving Good Morning, Vietnam Coffee Decompression sickness Anxiety Charles Darwin's illness 2000 Australian Grand Prix Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders The Catcher in the Rye Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Douglas Adams Hiberno-English Kitchen Kodocha Cigarette Smoking Man Dundas Square Paul Is Dead Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Symbiosis (TNG episode) Solar power The Ashlee Simpson Show Cardiac arrhythmia Fiddler on the Roof Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Syphon Filter Sento Extreme Programming

why does my right shoulder hurt so bad my right shoulder staring hurting about weeks ago it happened at work while lifting heavy objects over my head at first my shoulder hurt and was really stiff i also have trouble sleeping on it at night i went to the doctor he said probably just a strain and ordered physical therapy and naproxen x a day physical therapy relieved stiffness but pain is still there actually it's spreading it started out just deep in my shoulder now it's radiating down my arm in between my shoulder blades and even alittle in my neck also hands have been feeling weird i also can't move my right arm across my body to my other shoulder it feels like it's stuck and can't move no farther sometimes you can force it alittle other times you can't now my other shoulder is starting same thing i've had a mri but doctor says it showed nothing he told me it may just be something that i have to learn to deal with both the shoulder and the neck can refer pain into the arm and hand if you've had an actual worsening of the symptoms i'd start looking into a problem in the neck which may still require physical therapy but directed at the neck the fact that the pain is spreading and also going into the shoulder blade may very well indicate such a problem it sounds like you've have had an mri on the shoulder which should rule out any soft tissue problems in the shoulder such as a rotator cuff tear it may be time for one on the neck  Prostate cancer Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling holds Diving Radiation therapy Rotator cuff tear Syringomyelia Casualty lifting Magnetic resonance imaging Carpal tunnel syndrome Medicine Massage Cancer Humerus Reflexology Shoulder Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) Fibromyalgia Urinary incontinence Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Scoliosis Osteoarthritis Psoriasis Milton H.

what painkillers are you taking for fibro and do you think you are taking too much taking mg dihydrocoodeine and synap forte x a day sometimes mg valuim per day other meds are effexor and amitryptiline is that a lot i take effexor and amitriptiline and both have worked wonders for me it does kind of worry me that you're taking three narcotic drugs especially since narcotics are not known to be effective against fms over the long term were they all prescribed by the same doctor have you tried physical therapy or trigger point injections both have made a huge difference in my fibro and are quite a bit healthier than taking painkilers were i you i'd drop this doctor and find a pain management specialist your current doc seems a bit too willing to dole out the opiates drugs like those are best used over the short term and have a high probability of addiction i'd explore every single option you have before falling back on narcotics i've always told my doctor that i prefer fibro pain to narcotic addiction  Migraine Analgesic Addiction Narcotic Opium Fibromyalgia Drug addiction Venlafaxine Prostate cancer Withdrawal Antidepressant Drug abuse Buprenorphine Clinical depression Methadone Psoriasis Diazepam Illegal drug trade Cocaine Medical cannabis LSD Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Medicine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Convention on Psychotropic Substances Medical prescription Radiation therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Controlled Substances Act Arguments for and against drug prohibition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Physician Clomipramine Hydrocodone Rush Limbaugh Maprotiline Bipolar disorder Duesberg hypothesis Morphine Asthma Traditional Chinese medicine Gluten-free, casein-free diet COX-2 inhibitor Chronic fatigue syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Folic acid Route of administration Hypnosis Anxiety Multiple sclerosis Osteoarthritis Haloperidol Rheumatoid arthritis Cannabis (drug) Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Harrison Narcotics Tax Act Narcotics Anonymous Local anesthesia Paracetamol Hypoglycemia Pharmaceutical company Antiretroviral drug Harry J.

medical mystery long term undiagnosed knee swelling i am an year old male with no serious health problems last summer i had fluid in my right knee pretty severely which lasted for about months i had an mri and x ray done both showing it to be fine i had it drained twice and a cortisone shot but every time the fluid came back i was also treated for lyme disease although the titers were negtive after months of no running the fluid just went away over the next month period my knee was completely normal but the eventually the fluid came back this time less severe i had arthroscopic surgery which revealed my knee to be mechancally fine once again i have never had a traumatic injury but i have had a history of contact sports while my right knee continues to be swollen my left knee is completely fine the diagnosis is chronic idopathic arthritis synovitis which basically means they excellent rheumatologists dont know what's causing the swelling any comments will help i have never been more frustrated you may have gout what is gout gout is a painful condition that occurs when the bodily waste product uric acid is deposited as needle like crystals in the joints and or soft tissues in the joints these uric acid crystals cause inflammatory arthritis which in turn leads to intermittent swelling redness heat pain and stiffness in the joints in many people gout initially affects the joints of the big toe a condition called podagra but many other joints and areas around the joints can be affected in addition to or instead of the big toe these include the insteps ankles heels knees wrists fingers and elbows chalky deposits of uric acid also known as tophi can appear as lumps under the skin that surrounds the joints and covers the rim of the ear uric acid crystals can also collect in the kidneys and cause kidney stones what is uric acid uric acid is a substance that results from the breakdown of purines a normal part of all human tissue purines are found in many foods normally uric acid is dissolved in the blood and passed through the kidneys into the urine where it is eliminated if there is an increase in the production of uric acid or if the kidneys do not eliminate enough uric acid from the body levels of it build up in the blood a condition called hyperuricemia hyperuricemia also may result when a person eats too many high purine foods such as liver dried beans and peas anchovies and gravies hyperuricemia is not a disease and by itself it is not dangerous however if excess uric acid crystals form as a result of hyperuricemia gout can develop the crystals form and accumulate in the joint causing inflammation what are the four stages of gout literally translated arthritis means joint inflammation it refers to more than different diseases that affect the joints gout accounts for approximately percent of all cases of arthritis the disease can progress through four stages asymptomatic without symptoms hyperuricemia in this stage a person has elevated levels of uric acid in the blood hyperuricemia but no other symptoms treatment is usually not required acute gout or acute gouty arthritis in this stage hyperuricemia has caused the deposit of uric acid crystals in joint spaces this leads to a sudden onset of intense pain and swelling in the joints which also may be warm and very tender an acute attack commonly occurs at night and can be triggered by stressful events alcohol or drugs or the presence of another illness attacks usually subside within to days even without treatment and the next attack may not occur for months or even years over time however attacks can last longer and occur more frequently interval or intercritical gout this is the period between acute attacks in this stage a person does not have any symptoms chronic tophaceous gout this is the most disabling stage of gout it usually develops over a long period such as years in this stage the disease may have caused permanent damage to the affected joints and sometimes to the kidneys with proper treatment most people with gout do not progress to this advanced stage when it s not gout it may be pseudogout gout is sometimes confused with other forms of arthritis because the symptoms acute and episodic attacks of joint warmth pain swelling and stiffness can be similar one form of arthritis often confused with gout is called pseudogout the pain swelling and redness of pseudogout can also come on suddenly and may be severe closely resembling the symptoms of gout however the crystals that irritate the joint are calcium phosphate crystals not uric acid therefore pseudogout is treated somewhat differently and is not reviewed in this booklet what causes gout a number of risk factors are associated with hyperuricemia and gout they include genetics twenty percent of people with gout have a family history of the disease gender and age it is more common in men than in women and more common in adults than in children weight being overweight increases the risk of developing hyperuricemia and gout because there is more tissue available for turnover or breakdown which leads to excess uric acid production alcohol consumption drinking too much alcohol can lead to hyperuricemia because alcohol interferes with the removal of uric acid from the body diet eating too many foods that are rich in purines can cause or aggravate gout in some people lead exposure in some cases exposure to lead in the environment can cause gout other health problems renal insufficiency or the inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste products is a common cause of gout in older people other medical problems that contribute to high blood levels of uric acid include high blood pressure hypothyroidism underactive thyroid gland conditions that cause an excessively rapid turnover of cells such as psoriasis hemolytic anemia or some cancers kelley seegmiller syndrome or lesch nyhan syndrome two rare conditions in which the enzyme that helps control uric acid levels either is not present or is found in insufficient quantities medications a number of medications may put people at risk for developing hyperuricemia and gout they include diuretics such as furosemide lasix hydrochlorothiazide esidrix hydro chlor and metolazone diulo zaroxolyn which are taken to eliminate excess fluid from the body in conditions like hypertension edema and heart disease and which decrease the amount of uric acid passed in the urine salicylate containing drugs such as aspirin niacin a vitamin also known as nicotinic acid cyclosporine sandimmune neoral a medication that suppresses the body s immune system the system that protects the body from infection and disease this medication is used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases and to prevent the body s rejection of transplanted organs levodopa larodopa a medicine used to support communication along nerve pathways in the treatment of parkinson s disease brand names included in this booklet are provided as examples only and their inclusion does not mean that these products are endorsed by the national institutes of health or any other government agency also if a particular brand name is not mentioned this does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory who is likely to develop gout gout occurs in of every people it is rare in children and young adults men particularly those between the ages of and are more likely to develop gout than women who rarely develop the disorder before menopause people who have had an organ transplant are more susceptible to gout how is gout diagnosed gout may be difficult for doctors to diagnose because the symptoms can be vague and gout often mimics other conditions although most people with gout have hyperuricemia at some time during the course of their disease it may not be present during an acute attack in addition having hyperuricemia alone does not mean that a person will get gout in fact most people with hyperuricemia do not develop the disease to confirm a diagnosis of gout a doctor may insert a needle into an inflamed joint and draw a sample of synovial fluid the substance that lubricates a joint the joint fluid is placed on a slide and examined under a microscope for uric acid crystals their absence however does not completely rule out the diagnosis the doctor also may find it helpful to look for uric acid crystals around joints to diagnose gout gout attacks may mimic joint infections and a doctor who suspects a joint infection rather than gout may also culture the joint fluid to see whether bacteria are present signs and symptoms of gout hyperuricemia presence of uric acid crystals in joint fluid more than one attack of acute arthritis arthritis that develops in a day producing a swollen red and warm joint attack of arthritis in only one joint often the toe ankle or knee how is gout treated with proper treatment most people who have gout are able to control their symptoms and live productive lives gout can be treated with one or a combination of therapies the goals of treatment are to ease the pain associated with acute attacks to prevent future attacks and to avoid the formation of tophi and kidney stones successful treatment can reduce discomfort caused by the symptoms of gout as well as long term damage to the affected joints treatment will help to prevent disability due to gout the most common treatments for an acute attack of gout are nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids taken orally by mouth or corticosteroids which are taken orally or injected into the affected joint nsaids reduce the inflammation caused by deposits of uric acid crystals but have no effect on the amount of uric acid in the body the nsaids most commonly prescribed for gout are indomethacin indocin and naproxen anaprox naprosyn which are taken orally every day corticosteroids are strong anti inflammatory hormones the most commonly prescribed corticosteroid is prednisone patients often begin to improve within a few hours of treatment with a corticosteroid and the attack usually goes away completely within a week or so when nsaids or corticosteroids do not control symptoms the doctor may consider using colchicine this drug is most effective when taken within the first hours of an acute attack doctors may ask patients to take oral colchicine as often as every hour until joint symptoms begin to improve or side effects such as nausea vomiting abdominal cramps or diarrhea make it uncomfortable to continue the drug for some patients the doctor may prescribe either nsaids or oral colchicine in small daily doses to prevent future attacks the doctor also may consider prescribing medicine such as allopurinol zyloprim or probenecid benemid to treat hyperuricemia and reduce the frequency of sudden attacks and the development of tophi people who have other medical problems such as high blood pressure or high blood triglycerides fats may find that the drugs they take for those conditions can also be useful for gout both losartan cozaar a blood pressure medication and fenofibrate tricor a triglyceride lowering drug also help reduce blood levels of uric acid the doctor may also recommend losing weight for those who are overweight limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding or limiting high purine foods which can increase uric acid levels what can people with gout do to stay healthy fortunately gout can be controlled people with gout can decrease the severity of attacks and reduce their risk of future attacks by taking their medications as prescribed acute gout is best controlled if medications are taken at the first sign of pain or inflammation other steps you can take to stay healthy and minimize gout s effect on your life include the following tell your doctor about all the medicines and vitamins you take he or she can tell you if any of them increase your risk of hyperuricemia plan followup visits with your doctor to evaluate your progress drink plenty of nonalcoholic fluids especially water nonalcoholic fluids help remove uric acid from the body alcohol on the other hand can raise the levels of uric acid in your blood exercise regularly and maintain a healthy body weight lose weight if you are overweight but avoid low carbohydrate diets that are designed for quick weight loss when carbohydrate intake is insufficient your body can t completely burn its own fat as a consequence substances called ketones form and are released into the bloodstream resulting in a condition called ketosis after a short time ketosis can increase the level of uric acid in your blood avoid foods that are high in purines high purine foods anchovies asparagus beef kidneys brains dried beans and peas game meats gravy herring liver mackerel mushrooms sardines scallops sweetbreads what research is being conducted to help people with gout because uric acid s role in gout is well understood and medications to ease attacks and reduce the risk or severity of future attacks are widely available gout is one of the most if not the most controllable forms of arthritis but researchers continue to make advances that help people live with gout perhaps someday these advances will prevent this extremely painful disease some current areas of gout research include the following refining current treatments while many medications are available to treat gout doctors are trying to determine which of the treatments are most effective and at which dosages recent studies have compared the effectiveness of different nsaids in treating the pain and inflammation of gout and have looked at the optimal dosages of colchicine and allopurinol a uric acid lowering drug to control and or prevent painful attacks evaluating new therapies a number of new therapies have shown promise in recent studies they include infliximab remicade and other biologic agents that block a chemical called tumor necrosis factor this chemical is believed to play a role in the inflammation of gout another new drug therapy is febuoxostat which works by blocking an enzyme involved in the production of uric acid discovering the role of foods gout is the one form of arthritis for which there is proof that specific foods worsen the symptoms now research is suggesting that certain foods may also prevent gout in a study published in the new england journal of medicine scientists found that a high intake of low fat dairy products reduces the risk of gout in men by half the reason for this protective effect is not yet known another study examining the effects of vitamin c on uric acid suggests that it may be beneficial in the prevention and management of gout and other diseases that are associated with uric acid production searching for new treatment approaches scientists are also studying the contributions of different types of cells that participate in both the acute and chronic joint manifestations of gout the specific goals of this research are to better understand how urate crystals activate white blood cells called neutrophils leading to acute gout attacks how urate crystals affect the immune system leading to chronic gout and how urate crystals interact with bone cells in a way that causes debilitating bone lesions among people with chronic gout the hope is that a better understanding of the various inflammatory reactions that occur in gout will provide innovative clues for treatment examining how genetics and environmental factors can affect hyperuricemia researchers are studying different populations in which gout is prevalent to determine how certain genes and environmental factors may affect blood levels of uric acid which can leak out and crystallize in the joint leading to gout

i'm having a great deal of pain in my upper left back the pain will also extend to my left arm i notice that every time i turn my head to the left the pain is definitely increased i have been taking some bayer pain reliever and it has helped a little bit i have no idea how i developed this little problem but it is driving me nuts any ideas on what this can be i hope that i have provided enough information thanks for your help sounds to me like you may have strained a muscle in your neck there are many muscles in your neck that also attach down in your shoulder blade region you may have slept funny which caused the irritation the irritation in your neck may be causing referred pain down into your arm i would get a good massage to your neck and shoulder blade area and see if that helps to relieve your pain problems with your heart can also be referred into your left shoulder and down the arm if you have any history of heart problems i would seek medical attention the fact that your symptoms occur with movement of your head makes me think this is not the case if the massage does not help i would consider having your doctor take a look and possibly refer you to a physical therapist who will be able to evaluate your symptoms and get a better idea of what is going on  Repetitive strain injury Equine conformation Massage Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Myocardial infarction Medicine Pneumonia First aid Angina Professional wrestling holds Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Carpal tunnel syndrome Prostate cancer Fibromyalgia Physical examination Duchenne muscular dystrophy Cephalic disorder Fecal incontinence Chiropractic Decompression sickness Professional wrestling throws Childbirth Humerus Iliotibial band syndrome Weight training Syringomyelia Milton H.

lower leg pain i have been having lower leg pain since february at first it felt like it was going all around my cald muscle and then down the front bone of my leg at the time i had only been taking birth control for a month and the doctor had an doppler ultrasound performed on my leg to rule out a blood clot and it came back as negative plus i've had multiple doctors feel my leg since then and each has assured me repeatly there is no blood clot then i want to a new doctor who had an mri run to make sure the muscle was not torn and it just strained since i was still getting pain i had an emg done to make sure it wasn't my nerves and it was clear so i am at a complete loss i am still having a dull pain in my leg muscle today it felt like it was running down the front of my shin and coming out my arch i am not taking birth control i am a non smoker the area is not bruised swollen hot or red i am about and weigh i gained pounds this year due panic attacks i also work at a job wear i would wear heels and for three months this year had to run up and down the steps at least thirty times a day also i get charlie horses and now just started taking a potassium supplement i am just tired on hurting and almost feel defeated anybody have any suggestions the reason for your pain could be something as simple as muscle imbalances in your leg there's also the possibility that perhaps your foot may have structural abnormalities like a flattened arch which could be causing you to walk differently on that leg a physical therapist would be able to check out your muscles and feet or you could see an orthopedic doctor the fact that you are on your feet a lot and wearing heels which provide very little support or stability makes me think your problem is more mechanical in nature hope this helps  Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Weight training Prostate cancer Multiple sclerosis Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spina bifida Iliotibial band syndrome Diving Fecal incontinence Boxing Stomach cancer Myocardial infarction Hip fracture High-heeled shoe Orthopedic surgery Clinical depression Obstetrics Carpal tunnel syndrome Tocopherol Breech birth Puberty Stroke Atherosclerosis Childbirth Post Polio syndrome Cancer Medicine Syringomyelia Massage Bruise Cephalic disorder First aid Diabetic neuropathy Becker's muscular dystrophy Professional wrestling slang Group A streptococcal infection Aortic dissection Menstrual cup Folic acid Cardiac stress test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aerial (dance move) Foot Action potential Scapula Stress fracture Paget's disease of bone Back pain Migraine Duchenne muscular dystrophy Osteopathy Menstrual cycle Diabetes mellitus Stopping power Eye Tyrannosaurus rex Osteoarthritis Colorectal cancer Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Horse Swimming Humerus Insulin Dieting Alexander Technique Enzyme Professional wrestling attacks Turner syndrome Backstroke Cerebellum Elephant Endometriosis Leukemia Ebola Babe Ruth Ben Johnson (athlete) Biped Coeliac disease Poliomyelitis Doom enemies Intracranial pressure Cirrhosis The Contender (television series) Aikido Chiropractic Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

i am very sore how do i get rid of the pain to start off i jog usually every other day and do torso workouts on the odd days on the days i jog i go for about minutes so i sweat a lot but i'm not necessarily really tired well yesterday i felt like pushing it a bit i decided to jog for hours because i had woken up early i had my jog and i was so tired after that i almost felt like laying down at work when i usually have tons of energy i got through the day and only felt tired no soreness yet so i woke up this morning and my quads glutes and calves are very very sore they feel tight and painful when i stretch today is a odd day so i wont be jogging but i am worried that by tomorrow i will be so sore that i cant even run my normal minutes are there any tricks or things that i can do to relieve the soreness by tomorrow morning but if not should i wait till the soreness is completly gone to go running again any help is greatly appreciated i would suggest ice ibuprofen and stretching out your muscles i would also take it easy until you begin to feel better because you need to give your body time to heal and recuperate before you begin running again  Weight training Massage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Equine conformation Milton H.

neck shoulder pain killing me i started getting a little twinge of a pain in my neck monday noonish now it's friday and not only has it not gotten any better it has actually gotten worse it went from being a little twinge to being an all out war on my muscle from the base of my head to my shoulder i went to the er today and the doc gave me lortab but that didn't touch the pain and actually made me seriously sick to my stomach felt like vomiting weak slow heart beat and breathing cold heat only temporarily eases the pain some but not much the massage head on full heat in the shower works while i'm directly under it but as soon as i move the pain comes rushing back i can't barely move my head much i can't look up or touch my chin to my chest without wanting to cry the muscle actually feels like its hot inside i had a migraine last night as well i took tylenol and motrin during the course of the day yesterday and nothing seemed to help much at all any advice on what my next step should be the pain is well a pain it throbs like with my heart beat and when i bend over to pick something up it aches right up into my head it feels hot but not like a burning hot like a fever hot and that's deep inside so it's not even something that can be felt with my hand i have had constant heat on it since getting home and it's just doesn't help much at all try a heating pad with a damp towel inside of the bag moist heat helps the best and you should skip the tylenol and stick with motrin i know how you feel i've hurt myself in the same spot and its very painful try the moist heat i hope that it helps if not then go see your family doctor  Massage Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation First aid Breastfeeding Professional wrestling throws Pain Diving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pneumonia The Inside Migraine Myocardial infarction Professional wrestling attacks Fecal incontinence Mattress The Shining (film) Paracetamol Professional wrestling slang Gastroesophageal reflux disease Sin City Sento Weight training Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Swingout Billboard Hot 100 Fire fighting Tai Chi Chuan Cluster headache One Piece minor characters Breaststroke Angina Richard Rahl Piccolo Junior Saga Traumatic brain injury Babe Ruth Milton H.

i have very recently got welder flash burn to my wrist that is terrible can anyone give professional advice cold water is the best only first aid when you burn yourself minutes under the tap and no less never ice or vinegar or milk or butter or green tea or mustard or toothpaste or sunscreen or semen or vaseline or tomatoes or vanilla extract or yogurt or sour cream or egg white or egg yellow or lavender oil or cocoa butter or salt or tea bags or potato or shaving cream or olive oil or baking soda or banana peel or petroleum jelly or whipped cream or avocado or bacon grease or corn starch or turmeric or lemon juice or curd or pickle juice or soy sauce or urine or talcum powder or mashed strawberries or exfoliating scrub or mayonnaise or peroxide or bleach or deep heat or ketchup or red grapes or hairspray not until the skin is fully healed ibuprofen or aspirin will help but large burns are often accompanied by stomach ulcers so tylenol panadol is best for pain if you are gonna tough it out drink plenty of water or energy drinks that don't have caffeine gatorade i would advise that you cover the burnt area with white soft paraffin white petroleum or aqueous cream bp check the links below and see if you can find a local equivalent wash the burn and reapply every hours cover with cling wrap if you wish to cover with clothes this will stop your clothes getting covered with paraffin and maintains the burn cling wrap alone is also ok if you can't get hold of any paraffin it acts as a protective artificial skin helping retain moisture and protect from further damage and pain aloe is good coz it remoisturises but that moisture can be quickly lost as the skin can't contain fluids so put aloe on and then the paraffin on over the top if there is broken skin leave out the aloe just paraffin http www doorone com au xgs aqueous cream ns linkin id http www pharmacyonline com au david craig paraffin g p html http www cvs com cvsapp cvs gateway detail prodid previousuri cvsapp cvs gateway search page query white petrolatum activecat email if you still have questions send photos feedingthedogcustard hotmail com finally if you are really worried go to a hospital that has a burns unit or plastic surgeons serious sunburn i e blisters and all other burns should be seen by a burns trained doctor or nurse  German cuisine Aloe Japanese cuisine Breakfast Mayonnaise Peruvian cuisine Hot dog Genericized trademark Barbecue Jewish cuisine McDonald's Pizza Potato Soft drink Tattoo Food preservation Cheese Mouth ulcer Plastic Chocolate Dairy Acne Bread Cuisine of Singapore Bengali cuisine Psoriasis Sauce Cuisine of Africa Fish and chips Sandwich Cha chaan teng Pancake Soul food Petroleum First aid Cantonese cuisine Kit Kat Milk Soap Salad Cuisine of the Southern United States Starch Hydrochloric acid Cuisine of Malaysia Carbon dioxide Caffeine Cold Stone Creamery Fire extinguisher Gout Cocoa Acetic acid Yoghurt Hot sauce Eczema Water Breastfeeding Russian cuisine Chili con carne Turmeric French fries Dim sum In-N-Out Burger Tooth Sunscreen Hydrogen peroxide Potassium Hyperthermia Perfume Essential oil Brewery Hamburger Soy milk Vinegar Soy protein Jones Soda Potato chips Sugar Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Turkey Manicure Urinary incontinence Cuisine of Argentina Malignant melanoma Cajun cuisine Dairy product

what causes tension in your neck is there a certain type of stress that tends to cause tension in your neck rather than other places thought maybe it had to do with different parts of the brain no there are two main causes for muscle tension whether in the neck or elsewhere first is bad posture sitting at a desk all day with your shoulders slumped over etc you should adjust the height of your chair desk and keyboard so that you are sitting up straight second is improper breathing westerners tend to breathe way to shallowly for health you can work on deep breathing exercises and eventually they will continue through your day but any time you notice the tension building up take a few minutes to deep breathe and that will make it better  Repetitive strain injury Massage Equine conformation Weight training Chair Tai Chi Chuan Human position Professional wrestling holds Diving Aikido Trumpet Meditation Alexander Technique Carpal tunnel syndrome Professional wrestling throws Urinary incontinence Back pain Tension headache Tae eul ju Asana Qigong Scuba set Hatha yoga Mattress First aid Diabetes mellitus Yoga Triage Anxiety Decompression sickness Breaststroke Suicide methods Stuttering Traumatic brain injury Angina Diver rescue Human adaptation to space Muscle Chinese martial arts Tightlacing Anahata Yoga Asthma Frogman Liquid breathing Cello Sleep apnea Backstroke Kundalini Breathing gas Chiropractic Swimming Glossary of climbing terms Halitosis Sciatica Poliomyelitis Myocardial infarction Bass guitar Apnea Cerebellum Taxi Driver Rebreather Insulin Conspiracy (TNG episode) Physical attractiveness Humerus Migraine Aerial (dance move) Vulcan (Star Trek) Exercise Obesity Hyperthermia Tensegrity Hydrogen sulfide Tetanus Swingout Movie projector Lighting Duchenne muscular dystrophy Gray Wolf Cancer John F.

why won't my heel pain go away on my right foot only i have a very bad heel pain just on the bottom of my heel it is worse in the mornings when i wake up depending on the shoes i wear the pain comes and goes sometimes it is sharp other times just a dull throbbing type pain the pain has been present now for over a month without any signs of real healing i realize my best bet is to go to the doctor but without insurance that is very unlikely i simply can't afford a doctor visit right now i'm hoping someone can help me out a little thanks in advance sounds like plantar fasciitis most people with plantar fasciitis have pain when they take their first steps after they get out of bed or sit for a long time you may have less stiffness and pain after you take a few steps but your foot may hurt more as the day goes on it may hurt the most when you climb stairs or after you stand for a long period if you have foot pain at night you may have a different problem such as tarsal tunnel syndrome how is plantar fasciitis diagnosed your doctor will check your feet and watch you stand and walk he or she will also ask questions about your past health including what illnesses or injuries you have had your symptoms such as where the pain is and what time of day your foot hurts most how active you are and what types of physical activity you do your doctor may take an x ray of your foot if he or she suspects a problem with the bones of your foot such as a stress fracture how is it treated no single treatment works best for everyone with plantar fasciitis but there are many things you can try to help your foot get better give your feet a rest cut back on activities that make your foot hurt try not to walk or run on hard surfaces to reduce pain and swelling try putting ice on your heel or take an over the counter pain reliever like ibuprofen such as advil or motrin naproxen such as aleve or aspirin do calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day especially when you first get up in the morning get a new pair of shoes pick shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole or try heel cups or shoe inserts orthotics use them in both shoes even if only one foot hurts if these treatments do not help your doctor may give you splints that you wear at night shots of steroid medicine in your heel or other treatments you probably will not need surgery doctors only suggest it for people who still have pain after trying other treatments for to months how long will it take for the pain to go away plantar fasciitis most often occurs because of injuries that have happened over time with treatment you will have less pain within a few weeks but it may take time for the pain to go away completely from a few months to a year stick with your treatment if you don't you may have constant pain when you stand or walk the sooner you start treatment the sooner your feet will stop hurting  Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Osteoarthritis Iliotibial band syndrome High-heeled shoe Medicine Hip fracture Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Cancer 1957 World Series Callus Massage Acupuncture Decompression sickness Shoe Traditional Chinese medicine Asthma Pain Pneumonia Fecal incontinence Migraine Alternative medicine Stress fracture Sleep apnea First aid Milton H.

there is a pain in my left side shoulder bone what should i do about it it aggravates after i wake up in the morning i never do any hard work exercise or sports the pain develops while engaged in sports lifting an object or a minor slip and fall they should apply an ice pack as soon as possible a better way of applying the cold is an ice massage this should be used at least to times daily for minutes at a time during the next hours preparing the ice is quite easy fill several paper cups with water and place in freezer when frozen use one cup at a time to massage the painful muscles as the ice melts tear off part of the cup to expose the ice and continue the massage for those who resist going through such preparations there is a hot cold massager called the variotherm by medisana the use of this massager can be extremely valuable it can be used for to minutes and also offers the additional benefit of a magnate in its head the magnetic therapy increases circulation to the injured area as well thus speeding the healing process after the hour period heat can be applied to the area this can also be accomplished with the variotherm massager another useful adjunct is first applying the cold then the heat as a combination therapy for more info plz visit http www doctorsexercise com journal shoulder htm  Massage Weight training Reflexology Physical therapy Ice hockey Swimming Coffee Ice cream Iliotibial band syndrome First aid Severe weather terminology (United States) Sento Repetitive strain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sea ice Welding Prostate cancer Menstrual cup Traumatic brain injury Hydrotherapy Bruise Professional wrestling holds Phase (matter) Alexander Technique Paget's disease of bone Tea Food preservation Diablo II Desert Breastfeeding Spark plug Fibromyalgia Thermoregulation Myocardial infarction Local anesthesia Alternative medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Naruto jutsu Powder metallurgy Childbirth Carbon dioxide Manicure Cramp Water Glacier Hypnosis Snowball Earth Tai Chi Chuan Cancer Water (molecule) Cold fusion Electroconvulsive therapy Pottery Brassiere Ice Diazepam Osteoarthritis Fast bowling Bone marrow transplant Growth hormone treatment Mountaineering Bodybuilding Milton H.

help back pain been having it for about yrs now at first it was light pain now its become really bad it hurts when i stand sit lie down or sleep on a different mattress i suspect the primary cause for my pain is yrs of carrying heavy books throughout highschool i tried to avoid it but in one of my schools they never even had any lockers so hear i am only yrs old my back is killing me i've told my physicians about it they've done x rays found nothing well it still hurts it gets worse worse my doctors aren't even being helpful everytime i see them cause they ignore it they assume that just because my x rays haven't shown anything that there's no problem now i' m really stuck in a rut because i was supposed to get an mri done on my back but my mom i have a real bad relationship she's my sole financial provider she's refused to spend any money on my back problems so i can't even see i doctor about it when i want to or have any further diagnosti cs because i have no money what should i do does anyone have any solution as to what could rid of my back ailments should i try seeing a chiropractor do they help if i tried to get state insurance or medicare or something would that cover my expenses i m sorry you have back problem here s some info that might be helpful from what you described it could very well be that you have a problem with you l and l discs the x ray was a waste if there is a problem and based on your pain i say there is only an mri will show the exact cause you can go to any public hospital in the states and say you don t have any insurance and that your back hurts to the point that you can hardly walk and you re afraid of becoming paralyzed the hospital will have you fill out forms lots of them and may have you wait in the waiting room for a long time hours is common in los angeles county hospital having said all that let s focus on the cure surgery should be your last resort and this decision should be made carefully in conjunction with your doctor besides surgery that doesn t always work but with the advancement in medicine in becoming more and more an acceptable alternative you can still do things that can ease your pain you need to strengthen your abdominal muscles and your back muscles through low impact exercises and very important when you are feeling well and not suffering from back pain don t take it for granted don t make moves that would suddenly make your back act up as an example always use your knees to pick things up and never bend your back to end this answer the pain you experience is mainly due to your l and l discs they can be herniated in simple terms the discs are inflamed swollen and there is a gap between them this displacement along with the fact that they re inflamed pushes the ultra sensitive nerve around your spine and that s why you feel the pain please take care of yourself and have the patience to go to a county hospital and get the mri as you grow older your back can get worse so take care of yourself while you can you will be happy you did best wishes  Chiropractic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Health insurance Prostate cancer Medicare (Canada) Chronic fatigue syndrome Theory of conduct Publicly funded medicine Babe Ruth Osteoarthritis Weight training Back pain Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Osteopathy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
