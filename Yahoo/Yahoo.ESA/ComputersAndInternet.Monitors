i want to use my lcd monitor as a tv i want to use my lcd monitor as a tv what can i use to do this its a viewsonic vx wm true res is x thanks for the answers guys what i forgot to mention was i wanted to use this without my pc so that counts the tuner card out i just want to know if a standard tuner card will give a clear picture on my monitor seeing as most only say they are compatible with etc sorry that was supposed to be standalone tuner not tuner card you will need a tv tuner card for sure but there are different types of tv tuner cards if you want to use it as a tv without having another computer near by you will need to buy an external tv tuner not a usb one which will connect to your tv directly that way you just need that tv tuner and the monitor to watch tv on it else you could use a usb or an internal tv tuner which will need a computer to process the tv signals and then send to the monitor as a tv  Universal Serial Bus Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting TV tuner card Secure Digital card Computer display Commodore International MicroATX Laptop IMac Digital photography Digital Visual Interface Liquid crystal display IBM PC compatible Musical Instrument Digital Interface High-definition television Desktop computer Digital camera Sound card Ethernet Floppy disk TiVo TurboGrafx 16 Digital video recorder Archos USB flash drive Handheld game console Common Unix Printing System SCART Personal computer IPod High fidelity Apple Macintosh Softmodem ATI Technologies Atari ST Game Boy Advance GSM services Nintendo Revolution Surveillance PC Engine Computer hardware Digital audio player Computer Stereoscopy Computer bus TFT LCD PC card S-Video Atari 8-bit family AirPort RS-232 System/36 PlayStation Portable Hard disk PowerBook Windows 2000 SCSI AlphaSmart FireWire Set-top box Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PCI Express Commodore 64 Composite video Engine Control Unit Camcorder PlayStation 3 Sound Blaster Architecture of Windows 2000 Cable television Memory card Parallel port Graphics card Accelerated Graphics Port Analog-to-digital converter D-subminiature Liquid crystal display television SmartMedia PIC microcontroller USB mass storage device class Power Mac G4 Cube Color Digital audio broadcasting Konica Minolta Pirate decryption Creative Zen Frequency modulation Composite monitor Power Macintosh G3 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Electric guitar IBM PC Cathode ray tube Federal Communications Commission History of computer and video games Game Boy Sega Saturn

twin monitor is it possible to connect two monitors to a pc run different aplications ie watch a dvd on run exel on the other regards as most of the above said yes it is but what they failed to state is you need to ensure the desktop is extended across monitors not cloned the former treats the two monitors as one giant one while the latter just gives two identical displays if you have an ati card and vista use catalyst the latest at time of writing had problems with widescreen monitors and the settings applied to the secondary monitor would be applied to the primary one and take notice about hop much you're trying to do watching video's and dvd's with vlc player is fine when word processing but not when playing half life jbv  Television Radeon ATI Technologies IMac Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Anamorphic widescreen Windows XP Computer display Desktop computer Screenshot Laserdisc Atari ST Personal computer Apple II family Blackjack Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Color Graphics Adapter Nintendo GameCube OpenGL Computer display standard Computer wallpaper DVD Widescreen Surveillance Graphics card Commodore 64 GeForce 4 Laptop Computer and video games Power Macintosh G3 Scalable Link Interface Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind IBM PC ZX Spectrum Atari 8-bit family Enterprise content management Xbox Dance Dance Revolution Apple IIGS Enhanced Graphics Adapter Commodore 128 Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Nintendo Revolution PowerBook Apple Computer Counter-Strike Bluetooth Microsoft Windows Oscilloscope Consensus decision-making Computer hardware RGB color model EMac Frame rate H.264/MPEG-4 AVC S-Video Ethernet Computer Tenchi Muyo!

what is the average aspect ratio rate which is high or low theres some general terms here aspect ratio either standard or widescreen resolution number of defined pixels on screen pixel dot of pure color the average desktop resolution is x but its becoming more common to use x obviously if you have a smaller or larger monitor you will want to adapt to your liking x will look very comfortable on a monitor of course you can even hook up your computer to your television in which case i'd recommend a resolution of x d the average aspect rate is widescreen is becoming more and more common the reason for that is one widescreen monitor can often if its large enough say do the same job as two monitors acting together  Computer display standard Television Video Widescreen Color Graphics Adapter Digital photography Anamorphic widescreen Liquid crystal display Atari 8-bit family IMac 1080p Laptop Amstrad CPC High-definition television Stereoscopy Computer wallpaper NTSC Letterbox Display resolution Digital cinema Video Graphics Array Raster graphics Pan and scan Digital cinematography Cathode ray tube Halftone Apple IIGS ATSC Extended display identification data Atari ST Aliasing PNG Analog-to-digital converter Dots per inch Light-emitting diode PowerBook Anti-aliasing PowerBook G4 MPEG-2 Hercules Graphics Card Plasma display Image scanner RGB color model Liquid crystal display television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Original Amiga chipset Computer Digital QuickDraw Nintendo GameCube Hard disk Refresh rate Console game Apple typography Digital Visual Interface Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace 720p Macintosh LC Call centre JPEG 2D computer graphics MOS Technology VIC-II Laserdisc Normal distribution Commodore 64 Digital television Digital camera Gamut Babylon 5 Super Video Graphics Array Chroma subsampling Apple Macintosh Computer printer Apple Computer Movie camera Image file formats 1080i H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Oscilloscope Icon (computing) Standard deviation Digital-to-analog converter Rendering (computer graphics) Cascading Style Sheets Acorn Archimedes Signal-to-noise ratio Mac OS X Impedance Orders of magnitude (data) Confocal laser scanning microscopy JPEG 2000 Portable Document Format Circuit design ZX Spectrum Color

what have i done wrong hello guys thanks for reading this my computer room is getting decorated and so i moved all my computer stuff out disconnecting the things from the computer ie monitor keyboard mouse printer etc and carrying them to the room as i went along when i had carried everything back into my room i reassembled it admitted i have little experience hooking things to computers but i think i did it justice that is until i turned my monitor on and it complained of no signal i made sure all connections between monitor and computer were ok and secured in the wires but that made no difference i also tried a different plug when i take the cable out it recognises this and says cable not connected power is definitely going to the monitor though and it is plugged in my monitor is months old like my computer and is the aoc lm lcd monitor model help would be really appreciated computer's on no response from monitor i'm on windows xp sp thanks connor normally that is because the monitor is not plugged in properly check if it is well connected if it is well connected try another monitor if it does the same thing again the no signal message indicates that the monitor is working but the computer is not your monitor is not gettting a valid signal from your video card you have either knocked a component or connector loose or have moved a connector from where it should be possibly you have done both you need to consult the motherboard manual for your pc or download it from the motherboard manufacturers website if you haven't got it and check that all wires and connectors are correctly attached to the appropriate pins you then need to check that all expansion cards and cable connectors are firmly and securely pressed 'home' in their sockets good luck  D-subminiature Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore 64 SCART Personal computer Ethernet Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Computer bus Television Nintendo Entertainment System Advanced Technology Attachment Jack plug Desktop computer Digital Visual Interface Modem Windows XP Oscilloscope Enigma machine IMac S-Video Laptop Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family DVD Motherboard BS 1363 USB flash drive Cheating in Counter-Strike ZX Spectrum Amiga Gender of connectors and fasteners Xbox Serial ATA XLR connector RCA connector ATX Sinclair ZX81 Sound card Serial port GSM services FireWire IPod PC motherboard Commodore 128 SCSI Coaxial cable Amstrad CPC ACCESS.bus Computer hardware TRS connector Gender DIN connector IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Registered jack Burglar alarm Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Apple IIGS Wi-Fi 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Altair 8800 Computer surveillance System/36 Computer Adapter Internet Digital photography Overclocking Floppy disk Loudspeaker Computer forensics Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Xbox 360 Category 5 cable Apple II family BBC Micro Spyware Computer and video games IBM PC Parallel port Spark plug Microsoft Windows Computer display ATI Technologies MDAC Computer case

what size square monitor has the same height as a wide i have a widescreen i'm buying another one tonight to acheive an unneccesarily extensive span of monitor on my desk i'm wondering if the seam in the middle where the edges of the monitors meet will suck so i was thinking about puting a rd non widescreen monitor inbetween the two ers i'd like it to line up well so the middle one fits the height of the two wides on either side which size would accomplish this also any thoughts comments concerns regarding this setup any information would be appreciated i have vista enterprise premium business edition so it should be able to handle it also my main concern is having the seam directly in front of my line of sight i think i'd rather have two offcenter seams than one right in the middle i would not mix a widescreen and standard aspect ratio monitors i have tried it and it did not work well normally a widescreen has a resolution of x this vertical resolution does not exist in the standard aspect ratio monitors the closest is x as a result of this difference i had some weird behavior on my secondary monitor standard monitor while i was playing full screen games on the primary widescreen at my previous job i had extended desktop spanning across monitors of the same resolution and the transition from one monitor to the other was very easy and although they were not placed closely together the seam was not a problem for me the closer you place the monitors next to each other the easier it will be for you get get used to the dual monitor setup another thing to consider is that monitors will require video cards and it will make this type of setup more expensive and may complicate things if you do not have the ability to install two identical video cards regarding physical height a standard ratio is about the same as a widescreen  Widescreen Anamorphic widescreen Fast bowling Aspect ratio (image) Television Digital photography Windows Vista IMac IBM PC compatible Pixel Computer display standard Surveillance Floppy disk Pan and scan Stereoscopy Color Graphics Adapter Oscilloscope Movie projector Cinerama Computer Dance Dance Revolution Original Amiga chipset Laserdisc Windows XP Commodore 64 Windows Server 2003 Star Trek Customizable Card Game Babylon 5 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cognitive science Volleyball Enterprise content management Information Technology Infrastructure Library Welding Atari 8-bit family PC Engine Video Graphics Array Bass guitar Geodesy A Course In Miracles Display resolution Education in the People's Republic of China Pretty Good Privacy Computer display Microsoft S__CAM PostScript High-definition television Laptop Loudspeaker Bicycle frame System 7 (Macintosh) QuickDraw PowerBook Mac OS X Stairway Mattress Color Explosive material Java programming language Liquid crystal display History of Microsoft Windows System/36 Extended display identification data Tank Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Amiga Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Internet Apple II family Teletext EIA-708 OpenGL 64-bit Sega Saturn Mainframe computer Magic: The Gathering M16 (rifle) Infantilism Francis Crick AmigaOS Atari ST Minesweeper (computer game) Final Fantasy

why dont widescreen movies play full screen on widescreen tvs arent they made just for them here's the real answer no tv is made for widescreen i suppose you didn't read the manual many movies are shot in many different formats widescreen tvs are generally in format not all movies are filmed that way if you are watching a movie that is filmed in the format it will fill the screen if the movie is shot at a wider angle most are such as they won't fill the screen since they are too wide if you formatted them to fill the screen the film will look distorted and ugly since you can't force movie directors to make their films you can't do anything about it  Widescreen Anamorphic widescreen Television Pan and scan Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Aspect ratio (image) Laserdisc Digital photography 3-D film Cinematography Movie projector Cinerama Matte (filmmaking) Stereoscopy Babylon 5 Screenplay 16 mm film Todd-AO Digital cinematography Channel 4 IMAX Computer display standard Original Amiga chipset Film 24 (television) 35 mm film The Ultimate Matrix Collection The Criterion Collection Movie camera Late Night with Conan O'Brien Quentin Tarantino Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Resident Evil: Apocalypse Depth of field Panavision The Internet Movie Database Batman Forever SCART The Truman Show Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events The Passion of the Christ Vertigo (film) Tom and Jerry (MGM) R-Type Batman Begins Jennifer Lopez Digital television Trailer (movie) Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) Taxi Driver Panoramic photography The Day After Technicolor Resident Evil (film) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Digital cinema Motion picture terminology Screen Actors Guild Crime film Superman III Computer animation War of the Worlds (2005 film) Monty Python and the Holy Grail Projection screen Volleyball Plasma display Return of the Ewok Dial M for Murder Cinemascope 3-perf and 2-perf pulldown Photography Marlon Brando Star Wars Edge of Darkness Filmmaking Mad Max Xbox 360 Irr__versible Glossary of American football Hollywood blacklist $ale of the Century GoldenEye NTSC Serial Resident Evil 4 Sin City (film) Henry Fonda Screenwriting Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Team America: World Police Contemporary culture of South Korea Cinema of the United States Gramophone record The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Moonraker Wheel of Fortune

pixelation on videos how to get rid of it it happens whe i change to full screen on real player higher quality videos are the only way im afraid interestingly though its the leading cause of further advancements in video formats newer formats like divx get better compression rates so you can store better resolution in the same file size you'd be surprised it may just be that you've download a version of something in mpeg or something old newer formats get better graphics hardware support to fix little odds and ends like pixellation  QuickTime Digital photography MP3 Streaming media High-definition television PlayStation 2 Raster graphics Pixel Atari 8-bit family H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DivX DVD PlayStation Portable GIF Portable Document Format PNG Xbox Super Nintendo Entertainment System Xbox 360 Super Video CD Video codec Original Amiga chipset Radeon Image file formats Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Color Graphics Adapter Nintendo DS JPEG ATI Technologies Nintendo Nintendo 64 XviD Digital camera Creative Zen Vorbis Game Boy Advance Mac OS X MPEG-2 Windows Vista Amstrad CPC Video CD Sega Dreamcast Laserdisc GeForce 6 Series Advanced Audio Coding ITunes Digital image editing ZX Spectrum Windows XP AmigaOS Apple IIGS Computer display standard Video Graphics Array Digital television Minesweeper (computer game) OS/2 PlayStation 3 Digital rights management Betacam Chroma subsampling SAM Coup__ Commodore 64 Windows Mobile Computer graphics NVIDIA Atari ST Warez QuickDraw Theora Console game Game Boy Mouse (computing) Apple typography Digital Visual Interface RGB color model Nintendo GameCube Digital video recorder Macromedia Flash JPEG 2000 Image compression DV Screenshot Motion compensation Moving Picture Experts Group GamePark IPod ZIP (file format) Texas Instruments TMS9918 Pump It Up MPEG-4 Palm OS In The Groove (game) Blu-ray Disc 2D computer graphics Anti-aliasing Geographic information system

does an lcd or plasma computer monitor generate less heat than a crt monitor i have a crt monitor and it it seems to generate an insane amount of heat i can feel a lot of heat radiating when i hold my hand over the rear end of it the pc tower puts out less heat than the monitor does i have also tested this by keeping a thermometer in the room for every one hour the monitor runs the room temp goes up one degree fahrenheit if the room is degrees when i turn it on in the morning by the end of the day the room is about note using stand by mode and energy star settings apparently make no difference in the heat output will an lcd put out a lot less heat than a crt monitor it pretty much goes like this projector crt plasma lcd oled in development its gonna be sweet google search it lcd is not as quick as a crt in some you can see mouse blur at times but this is becoming rarer also when you arent using the lcd in its natural resolution you should be told this when you buy the image will always tend to be blurry eg when using an lcd with a natural resolution of x and then playing a video game in x the game will look blurrier rather than pixelated same if you played the game in a higher resolution than natural however those points are moot when you consider the lcd is so much more compact and requires less electricity and generates condsiderably less heat plasma is out of the question for a pc monitor its application is in large tvs because its pixels are actually made of small fluroescent phosphor bulbs which are times bigger than an lcd or crt pixel and thus easilly seen by the naked eye not to mention the phoshor decay really cuts into the displays lifespan  Pixel Plasma display Temperature Light-emitting diode Computer display Television Laptop Digital Visual Interface Oscilloscope Digital photography Stereoscopy Light gun Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Atari 8-bit family Color Graphics Adapter TFT LCD Interlace Organic light-emitting diode Plasma (physics) Amstrad CPC Fluorescent lamp Mouse (computing) Digital projector Original Amiga chipset Loudspeaker Solar power High-definition television Movie projector Transformer PlayStation Portable Lighting DLP Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Welding Computer display standard Incandescent light bulb Spacecraft propulsion In The Groove (game) RGB color model Konica Minolta Game Boy Advance Laser Apple II family PLATO Sun Nintendo GameCube Glass TurboGrafx 16 Refresh rate Fusion power Handheld game console Nuclear reactor Carbon nanotube Nintendo Entertainment System LCD projector Nuclear power 1080p Aliasing History of computer and video games Nintendo DS Overclocking Personal computer Digital camera Commodore 64 Display resolution Digital cinematography Dialysis Tier One Renewable energy Galileo spacecraft Persistence of vision Video Rendering (computer graphics) Wearable computer Computer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple IIGS Eye Windows XP Typeface Console game Magnet Computed tomography Anti-aliasing PlayStation 3

power off monitor when my computer is totally shut down do i still need to power off my monitor manually or can i leave it power on so it will go off anyways without a sync i have been wondering this for years it depends on how old the monitor is if the power light on the monitor goes off or changes color when you shut down the computer you're ok the monitor is powering almost everything down itself and only stays awake enough to sense the computer coming back on if the power light stays green it's an old dumb monitor and you should turn it off with the computer  Liquid crystal display Embedded system Personal computer Color Gamut Thermal power station Traffic light CMYK color model Computer display Original Amiga chipset Canon T90 Cathode ray tube Escape from New York RGB color model IMac Stereoscopy Apollo Guidance Computer Server The Arsenal of Freedom (TNG episode) Fire alarm control panel Color theory Hybrid Synergy Drive Desktop computer Toyota Prius Mercury Atlas 6 Floppy disk Television Pixel Daylight saving time Computer animation Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Blue screen of death Digital photography Commodore 64 KIM-1 Hybrid vehicle Cypher (The Matrix) Dumb & Dumber System/36 Composite video Commodore 128 Laptop Component video World War Three (Doctor Who) SCART The Ark in Space Nintendo GameCube Out-of-body experience DV Plasma display Nuclear reactor Raster graphics Computer case System/34 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Color space Color Graphics Adapter Swingout Fischer Random Chess One (Voyager episode) HSV color space Extended display identification data Video game console Altair 8800 Ethernet Inferno (Doctor Who) Apollo 8 Computer and video games Digital camera Death Comes to Time STS-86 Knight Rider Rendering (computer graphics) Frame rate Mega Man & Bass Danger Hiptop Color temperature Lighting Furnace Mouse (computing) Tag 2001: A Space Odyssey Surveillance Commodore PET The Parting of the Ways Waveform monitor Computer forensics 2003 North America blackout Commodore International Warriors of the Deep Single certification Mainframe computer Sugar push TRS-80 Color Computer Computer graphics Universal Serial Bus ARPANET Starsiege: Tribes Elevator Atari ST

i have a pc monitor at mode how can i turn my monitor settings to its original settings turning mode monitor to its original settings hiya tuesdayg when you say original settings it could mean things it could mean that the display was showing full color and somehow was changed to colors this would be a windows display setting the other would be to reset the monitor itself to the original factory settings here is how to change these things to change the number of colors that windows is using open the control panel and double click the display icon this will open the display settings window it can also be opened by right clicking on an empty area of the desktop and then select properties on the drop down menu once you have the display settings window open you will see tabs along the top edge click the last one toward the right side labeled settings once the settings window is open you can make some changes the first change will be to pull down the color quality menu and you should have more choices then the that is currently selected select bit or bit depending on what is available the higher the number the better the quality click apply to save the settings or ok to save and exit the screen may flicker and the new color quality setting will be applied you may get a pop up telling you that the display settings have been reconfigured i will ask if you want to keep the new settings if the color not the sizes looks better then click yes if your screen does not seem to be the correct size and everything is too big then you will want to increase the screen resolution setting the correct setting will depend on your monitor typically a crt non flat panel will do well at x pixels and an lcd flat panel will need to be higher since the monitor model is unknown i recommend that you experiment to find the right setting for you to change this move the slider bar under screen resolution to the right until you get something you like resetting the monitor to the factory settings to do this use the buttons on the front of the monitor to access the internal settings menu use the buttons again to move around the menu system until you find a setting named restore factory settings or factory default settings then highlight it and press the select button some monitors have different labels for the buttons and the menu items so the wording may be a bit different this will affect the monitor only not your windows settings on the computer good luck  Liquid crystal display Screenshot Windows XP Oscilloscope Pixel Palm OS Danger Hiptop Macintosh Finder IMac IPod Taskbar Embedded system Television Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable Apple typography Cathode ray tube Screensaver AmigaOS Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Plasma display Beatmania IIDX System 7 (Macintosh) Opera (web browser) Hello world program Color Graphics Adapter Pump It Up System 6 Video Graphics Array Windows 2000 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Floppy disk Computer display DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Microsoft Windows X Window System Gamut Double-click (computing) Resident Evil (video game) Blue screen of death Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital photography Dance Dance Revolution DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Object Desktop DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX HTML element History of the graphical user interface Gradius Advance Wars: Dual Strike Nintendo Entertainment System Mozilla Firefox Nintendo GameCube Original Amiga chipset Commodore 128 Computer display standard Macromedia Flash Liquid crystal display television Windows Vista AppleScript Bubble Bobble Arcade cabinet Amstrad CPC QuickDraw Unicode DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Solar cell Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Laptop Minesweeper (computer game) Emacs EIA-708 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 TRS-80 Nintendo DS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tungsten Handheld Control Panel (Windows) X86 assembly language IBM PC compatible Refresh rate Loudspeaker NTSC Sega Saturn RGB color model Light-emitting diode Natural Selection (computer game) PowerBook IBM PC keyboard TFT LCD Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Laserdisc

why is the text on my computer screen so small it's just the text and i tried the thing where you hold down ctrl and the or sign but it only helped sometimes also will you say what country you're in right now curious im in america ctrl or doesn't always work depending on how the website is coded it works on some when they define the text like a text editor does similar to pt font ctrl and just basically increase the size of the font sometimes though the font is defined by pixels and these can't be changed because your computer monitor always displays the same amount of pixels on the screen at one time one way to always get a larger font is to change the resolution of your monitor right click on the desktop assuming you have a pc i don't know about macs properties settings and lower the screen resolution the downside is you can't see as many things on screen at the same time so you have to find a balance  Unicode TrueType Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) Blue screen of death QuickDraw Portable Document Format PostScript Emacs Digital photography Laptop Liquid crystal display Color Graphics Adapter Apple IIGS Raster graphics Windows 2000 Cascading Style Sheets PNG ZX Spectrum Computer display standard AppleScript System 7 (Macintosh) Video Graphics Array Computer display Computer wallpaper Vector graphics Palm OS Apple Computer Windows XP Mac OS X Anti-aliasing Graphical Environment Manager Display resolution IMac Library (computer science) OpenOffice.org QuickDraw GX Icon (computing) Keyboard layout Dash Cathode ray tube Original Amiga chipset Minesweeper (computer game) BlackBerry ASCII art AmigaOS EIA-708 TeX Stereoscopy Analog-to-digital converter Computer keyboard CPU design Sinclair ZX81 Texas Instruments TMS9918 Image file formats Screenshot History of the graphical user interface MacPaint Unicode and HTML Opera (web browser) Macintosh LC Plasma display Apple II family HTML element Han unification Adobe Type Manager Control character Danger Hiptop High-definition television Floppy disk Commodore 128 Commodore 64 PowerBook Quotation mark AlphaSmart IPod MOS Technology VIC-II X Window System ATSC X Window System protocols and architecture Atari ST WYSIWYG Television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MPEG-2 Control key Apple Advanced Typography Digital image editing Acorn Electron Euro Virtual Network Computing

i have a by screen resolution is a hz refresh rate safe i am using a forcer powerstrip it seems to safely go up to hz without crashing i am doing this because the normal hz gives me a headache very quickly is it safe to do this hz is too low a refresh rate even though hz is a standardized minimum refresh rates lower than hz causes a percievable flicker in crt monitors it can cause head aches and may be bad for the eye hz is a good rate it will not consume too much cpu and refresh is handled by the graphics processor so as long as your system runs smoothly go for a higher refresh rate  Frame rate Refresh rate Interlace Atari 8-bit family Computer display Video Graphics Array NTSC Embedded system Liquid crystal display television IMac Cathode ray tube Central processing unit Computer animation Sinclair ZX81 TRS-80 Color Computer Liquid crystal display Original Amiga chipset Windows XP Computer display standard Persistence of vision PlayStation 3 SGI Indy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital Visual Interface Laptop ATI Technologies Amstrad CPC Atari ST Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer workstation CPU design Deinterlacing Apple Macintosh Personal computer 3dfx MIPS architecture Pixel Alternating current 1080p Apple Computer Commodore 64 PowerBook Color Graphics Adapter Sega Saturn Movie projector RISC Fuse (electrical) Apple IIGS NX bit Texas Instruments TMS9918 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Plasma display EMac Amiga Commodore 128 MOS Technology VIC-II MSX Light gun Motorola 68000 History of computer and video games Computer terminal Dynamic random access memory Screenshot Light-emitting diode ZX Spectrum AMD IBM PC compatible MP3 Console game PostScript Zilog Z80 Computer architecture CPU cache Nintendo 64 Silicon Graphics Laserdisc Redundant array of independent disks Digital Display resolution Game programming QuickDraw Fluorescent lamp TRS-80 PC Engine Windows Vista Athlon DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution High-definition television Inflation Xbox 360 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Beatmania IIDX Oscilloscope Nintendo Entertainment System Sport utility vehicle Microsoft Windows Pentium 4 NVIDIA Nintendo Virtual Boy

like tft monitor screen auto adjustment is there any tool available to adjust crt monitor screen display i have not yet seen a crt that auto adjusts like an lcd display crts usually have a lot of extra controls including things like pincushion and trapezoid adjustments i think the reason is there is a lot more variability in how a given signal will display on different crts that's also why there are a lot more adjustments for a crt display some crt monitors come with software from the manufacturer that will make the screen adjustments through a utility i don't think this is very common depending on the video card and drivers you may be able to make some of the adjustments from display properties you may prefer to just make the adjustments from the buttons on the monitor good question  Computer display Liquid crystal display Oscilloscope Cathode ray tube IMac Pixel Television Windows XP Gamut PowerBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Liquid crystal display television Apple II family Screensaver Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Interlace Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable Sega Saturn Nintendo GameCube Commodore 64 Gamma correction Atari ST Refresh rate Digital Visual Interface Color Graphics Adapter Sega Dreamcast Stereoscopy Light-emitting diode Nintendo DS Screenshot Arcade cabinet Embedded system Apple typography Laptop Color Laserdisc AmigaOS TurboGrafx 16 Organic light-emitting diode IPod Transformer Computer terminal Cheating in Counter-Strike Konica Minolta Aperture grille Tungsten Handheld Computer and video games Bluetooth History of computer and video games Game Boy Waveform monitor Windows 2000 EMac Vectrex Microeconomics Apple IIGS PlayStation 3 ZX Spectrum Floppy disk Canon T90 Sharp Zaurus Light gun Digital photography Palm OS Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Digital audio workstation Web design Game Boy Advance PC Engine Computer surveillance Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC Teletext Macromedia Flash Hello world program Touchscreen Graphics card Console game Computer animation Video Graphics Array Windows registry NTSC Computer-aided design Slot machine Enterprise content management Movie projector Tesla coil Beatmania IIDX Nintendo Knight Rider Commodore 128 Gameking Mouse (computing) MicroBee Video Shadow mask

x vs x is this change resolution like the change from x vs x i liked the change to x because the icons got smaller which i did not mind and i had more room to play around with it this the same from x to x does going from a ' with x res to a ' with x res really pay off in the end and look better well for one thing you will have that much more 'desktop space' to work with at that resolution and screen size you should be able to comfortable operate windows side by side much in the same benefit that using a dual screen setup would give you using x screens you have to be aware though higher resolution higher resource cost processing graphics etc the x is probably the native res of that monitor meaning running in lower resolutions to play video games will make them look slightly blurred which is why its best in that case to be sure your card can run the game in the higher res and my god it just looks better if your upgrading from a to a keep them both dual wide screen view the thought makes me salivate also if you find the icons get to small for your liking go to the display options and under the appearance tab there are some advance options you can use to increase or reduce the size of your default fonts and icons  Windows XP Windows 2000 Laptop Apple Computer IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Blue screen of death Floppy disk AmigaOS Digital photography Video Graphics Array Color Graphics Adapter Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) RISC High-definition television Pixel PowerBook Blackjack System 7 (Macintosh) Apple typography PostScript Screenshot Radeon Microsoft Windows Natural Selection (computer game) IMac QuickDraw Apple IIGS Opera (web browser) Portable Document Format ATI Technologies Final Fantasy (video game) Xbox 360 Apple II family Game Boy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Oscilloscope Amiga Atari ST X Window System TrueType Mac OS history Stereoscopy Palm OS Redundant array of independent disks Computer wallpaper Computer display Sinclair ZX81 System/36 Icon (computing) EIA-708 Advance Wars: Dual Strike IPod Handheld game console Amstrad CPC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Console game Extreme Programming History of the graphical user interface Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 128 CPU design Windows Server 2003 Nintendo GameCube Typeface Nintendo 64 Commodore 64 Graphical Environment Manager Linux Window Maker Beatmania IIDX Policy Debate Neopets Game Boy Advance Cascading Style Sheets Apple Macintosh Public transport Final Fantasy In The Groove (game) PlayStation 2 Desktop computer Graphics card 3dfx Computer and video game industry Refresh rate Image file formats Windows Mobile Macintosh Finder

how can i remove stuck mineral spots caused by water off an lcd screen you know those tiny pixels that change color and are most visible on light or bright bgs i used tap water to clean my lcd screen that's why they appears first off i guess by now you know you shouldn't have used tap water especially if it's hard tap water try the following in order until you find one that will shift the flecks proprietary screen cleaner wipes proprietary glass cleaner the clear stuff whatever brand name it goes by in your locale sprayed onto a clean soft tissue to lightly damp it wipe the screen gently soft tissue lightly damped with clear vinegar wiped over the screen if you use spirit vinegar dilute it with distilled water first then wipe the screen with a soft tissue damped with distilled water not deionised not mineral spring or tap anything stronger than this there is a high risk of damaging the anti reflective coating on the screen if you do that it's permanent damage so battery acid is not a good idea nor is steel wool then only use screen cleaner wipes or glass cleaner in future to clean the screen  Liquid crystal display Cathode ray tube Tin Sulfuric acid Genericized trademark Nintendo DS Tooth Light-emitting diode Titanium Plasma display Mineral Tooth enamel Diamond Ultraviolet Mattress Stereoscopy Ammonia Contact lens Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Drill bit Wok Dry cleaning Acetic acid Pixel E85 Digital photography Acne Menstrual cup Marine aquarium Cookware and bakeware Vacuum cleaner Hydrochloric acid Advertising Hard water Tofu Hydrogen peroxide Dishwasher Tattoo Toilet paper Aluminium Guinness Apple Glass Game Boy Battery (electricity) Violin Solar power Lionel Corporation Printmaking PlayStation 2 Industrial wastewater treatment Cancer Beer Naval mine Trademark Internal ballistics Textile manufacturing M16 (rifle) Laptop Diseases of the honeybee Turquoise Water Sulfur Magnesium Carnivorous plant Nuclear explosion Silicon Phosphoric acid Tamagotchi X-ray Rum White phosphorus incendiary Corrosion Weed control Citric acid IPod nano Cider Wine Game Boy Micro PlayStation Portable Staining (biology) Lithium Opportunity rover Disc brake Liquid crystal Carpal tunnel syndrome Diamond enhancement Smoke-screen Canon T90 Rendering (computer graphics) Lead Water purification Water (molecule) Knife Motorcycle Handheld game console Game Boy Advance Upholstery

can you do this to a computer monitor answer please is it possible to customize the computer frame to what you want i mean like are you able to take the monitor all apart and replace the frame with something else or do i have to put something over it monitors contain high voltage capacitors that can hold a charge even after being unplugged that could possibly kill you so unless you really know your way around with electronics i would advise that you keep from opening it also do not cover the air vents up on the monitor it can cause the components to overheat and monitor to fail over time  Capacitor plague Capacitor Tesla coil Overclocking Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Computer Impedance Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Circuit design RC circuit Cathode ray tube Operational amplifier Dynamic random access memory Radiation hardening High-voltage direct current Loudspeaker Transistor Switched-mode power supply Liquid crystal display Electronics Rebreather Arcade cabinet PC motherboard Battery (electricity) Diving regulator Electronic amplifier Commodore 64 Electrostatic discharge Service life Membrane potential Low-pass filter Analog computer Floppy disk Hall effect Analog-to-digital converter STS-61 Action potential Volt Embedded system Electric motor Transmitter The Long Game CPU design Phase-locked loop Ford Ranger EV Logic gate Frame rate Voltage source X10 (industry standard) Directed-energy weapon Digital-to-analog converter Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical element Electric power transmission Thermal power station Ethernet Diode Call centre Electrophysiology Geomagnetic storm VFO Nickel-cadmium battery Apollo 8 Computer display Digital cinematography Laptop Carburetor Corona discharge Power factor correction Microphone Nintendo GameCube Personal computer Dielectric Lithium ion battery KISS (band) Epson Seiko Corporation SCADA Hubble Space Telescope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Page table Electrolytic capacitor Van de Graaff generator Distributor M16 (rifle) Acorn Electron Spark gap Capacitance Fluorescent lamp Video camera tube G-Man (Half-Life) Airbag Charge-coupled device Nonconductor The Covenant Television Power factor Magnet Amstrad CPC Electrical network

i am trying to convince my boss to switch our crt monitors to lcd because it will save energy and from what i hear they aren't great for your eyes when they get old and the colors start to distort anyways i would like some information on why lcds are better than crt monitors i know that they save energy but what are some other key points that i can use to convince my boss that they are better for our company we have about computers in our company right now thanks for the help there are lots of considerations here first of all what is the age of the existing crt monitors if they are relatively new it might not makes sense to replace them right away if you were going to make a purchase decision today clearly the lcd monitor would be the right choice the total cost of ownership toco for an lcd is much less both purchase price and utility cost over an assumed life cycle are less overall the power required to run an lcd is about one third of that required for a crt with the same screen area in addition the amount of heat generated by an lcd monitor is considerably less than a crt monitor resulting in a lower load on air conditioning building cooling needs could be decreased by up to without taking into account the building cooling needs the energy cost of a typical lcd monitor over years of usage of hours per week will be about less a typical lcd is rated at w while a crt consumes w this of course depends on specific monitor specs and utility rates etc but it means assuming a life cycle of years you can deduct at least off the purchase price the increased utility costs for cooling depending on your situation could make the cost differential over years become in all likelylihood regardless of your specifics more than of the purchase price of a new lcd monitor will be recouped by the energy savings you should also remember that a lcd is larger than a crt actual viewable area is vs for the crt savings can be realized through gains in productivity with larger monitors some research suggests that an employee may reclaim more than hours per month working on a larger screen versus a monitor but even a savings of hour per month in labor cost yield savings of per year of course the time saved has to either result in fewer hours worked fewer people working or the same people dedicated to other productive activity in order to actually reap those savings for either a large or small business a monitor can easily pay for itself in productivity alone furthermore the perfect focus and geometry straight lines are never warped and the completely flicker free screen of an lcd are easy on the eyes this means that lcds can be used comfortably for typically longer periods of time than crts lcds like crts have a refresh rate only they have a longer residual phospor effect in other words at a hz refresh rate the lcd is flicker free better quality crts can also be easier on the eyes if they are driven at faster refresh rates hz and up all depends on the video card and monitor capability replacing computer monitors all at once might not make sense in terms of cash flow that would require if they were each you may want to begin a targeted phase out of some of the oldest least efficient ones while considering which employees would benefit the most in terms of productivity also disposal cost if any may be a negative cost to consider in terms of getting rid of the old crt monitors good luck  Digital photography Cathode ray tube Welding Laptop Supply and demand Inflation Progressive tax Gamut Windows XP Monetary policy Capitalism Television Tax Apple II family CPU cache Transformer Deflation (economics) Solar power Oscilloscope FairTax Gross domestic product Spacecraft propulsion Wind power RISC CPU design Energy development Labour economics Gas metal arc welding Refresh rate Alcohol fuel Principal-agent problem Stereoscopy Liquid crystal display television Light-emitting diode Nuclear power TFT LCD Unemployment Plasma display IBM PC compatible Hydrogen economy Explosive material Biodiesel Credit card Taxation in the United States E85 PowerBook Pebble bed reactor Commodore 64 Sewage treatment Free trade Central processing unit Natural monopoly Future energy development Redundant array of independent disks Productive and unproductive labour Insurance Capital accumulation Economics Economic growth Mortgage Efficiency wages Labor theory of value Computer display Ocean thermal energy conversion Price discrimination Life insurance Surplus value Blackjack Hyperinflation Solar cell Modem Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Russia High-definition television Jet engine Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting NTSC Fluorescent lamp Corporate finance Fusion power Apple Macintosh Compiler optimization Overclocking Management information system Manitoba Hydro Outsourcing Color Externality Economic inequality Annuity

what are the resolutions that the sony cpd g r can support i am at a very old to years system right now and am not sure what this crt monitor supports i know that with newer monitors one can not easily set an unsupported resolution but i do not know if that is still true with older monitors crts because of how crt works can support a very broad spectrum of resolutions usually for a crt it can get as low as x resolution and in your models case as high as x either way the model in question will most definitely accommodate any age pc you will have no problems running it on a windows machine  Cathode ray tube IMac Apple II family Atari 8-bit family Gamut Apple Macintosh Amstrad CPC Laptop Windows XP PowerBook Oscilloscope Refresh rate Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer display Liquid crystal display television Color Graphics Adapter 1080p ZX Spectrum Plasma display Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Pixel Television Atari ST Personal computer Video Graphics Array Liquid crystal display EMac Super Nintendo Entertainment System History of operating systems Interlace SGI Indy Laserdisc Computer terminal PlayStation 2 Computer-aided design Xbox 360 Tungsten Handheld Sega Dreamcast Thread (computer science) Vorbis PowerPC USB flash drive Display resolution Amiga Device driver Amstrad PCW In The Groove (game) Computer display standard History of computer and video games Digital cinematography MIPS architecture Windows 3.x System 7 (Macintosh) Theory of constraints Degaussing MIPS Magnum Autodesk Media and Entertainment MSX Digital photography Mac OS X Dialysis Commodore 128 Commodore 64 S__CAM Automatic number plate recognition Dance Dance Revolution Digital cinema IBM PC compatible TRS-80 Color Computer IBM 5100 Visual Basic E-waste Linux Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 High-definition television Transformer IPod Windows registry Eye Sega Saturn Acorn Archimedes Server OS/2 Information Technology Infrastructure Library Commodore PET Digital projector Digital Equipment Corporation IBM 700/7000 series Light gun MP3 Sinclair QL Digital Visual Interface Screensaver Gamma correction Business Process Management Aliasing Kaypro

my computer was unplugged before it got turned off should i be concered my son unplugged my computer while it was still on should i be worried about it harming the computer in any way is there anything i can do to make sure the computer is fine sudden power losses can cause the current going through the system to build up this can result in damage to vital system parts and costly repairs there are incidents where we have no choice but to pull the plug however it is not wise to use this as a common method to turning off the computer you should always insure that you back up your data documents to prevent data loss you can do a defrag and check disk chkdsk f through command prompt to see if the system discs have any damage command prompt can be accessed through the start menu and clicking the run button type in cmd in this area and press run the last program is to use sfc scannow in command prompt as it will check all system files for corruption that could have occurred during the power loss or at any other time  Windows 2000 Embedded system File system Mouse (computing) Computer virus Cmd.exe Windows XP Cache AmigaOS Computer forensics Virtual memory Hard disk File format Common Unix Printing System Redundant array of independent disks Computer storage Hello world program IPod Debugging Super Nintendo Entertainment System CPU cache Backup System/36 Defragmentation Screenshot Universal Serial Bus Copy protection Btrieve FreeDOS PaX Commodore 64 Windows 95 Malware Knoppix DVD Computer BASIC programming language USB flash drive System/34 JADE programming language Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fsck Year 2000 problem Emacs Windows registry AS/400 Command Language Password Federal Standard 1037C Datatype Expert system Nintendo Entertainment System Forth programming language Personal computer Macintosh Finder Floppy disk Architecture of Windows 2000 COMMAND.COM Apollo Guidance Computer PlayStation Portable Trusted computing Common User Access Digital photography Data General Nova MDAC NX bit Macromedia Flash Digital rights management Computer insecurity Library (computer science) CP/M Taskbar Master Control Program Spyware C programming language Mach kernel Prostate cancer Partition (computing) Disk image Information Technology Infrastructure Library Microsoft Windows Modchip Password cracking MiniDisc Booting Screw Read-only memory Web crawler Pretty Good Privacy Computer hardware MAME Information warfare Classified information Firefighter Commodore 128 AppleScript 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Common Lisp

what is the difference between x and x resolutions both resolutions are meant for ratio not widescreen the x shows lower definition than the latter but the tradeoff is that it requires less system performance to run with for most computers x is the standard gaming resolution x is the most common desktop resolution because the desktop isnt typically used for high end graphics unlike games you can also see much more on screen and you have a wider area to work with in physical terms imagine your computer desk was x feet and then you enlarged it to x feet obviously though to fit more space on the same size screen everything will look a little smaller than it would at x  Widescreen Laptop Aspect ratio (image) IBM PC compatible Anamorphic widescreen Portable Document Format Computer display standard Digital photography Television Display resolution High-definition television Stereoscopy IMac Apple IIGS Apple Macintosh Redundant array of independent disks Computer wallpaper Color Graphics Adapter Desk Hard disk Pixel art PostScript X Window System Mouse (computing) Dot matrix printer CPU cache AmigaOS RISC Windows XP Computer Letterbox Image scanner Atari 8-bit family Typeface Hash table History of Microsoft Windows Analog-to-digital converter Computer display MP3 Virtual desktop Final Fantasy CPU design Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 64-bit Windows 2000 Silicon Graphics Computer workstation Screenshot C programming language ALGOL 68 History of the graphical user interface Microprocessor Mac OS X Object Desktop Supercomputer Apple Newton Atari 2600 Laserdisc Digital single-lens reflex cameras Graphical Environment Manager Nintendo GameCube Mach kernel PC Engine Xbox 360 Vector (spatial) Handheld game console Desktop computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Anti-aliasing Puberty Desktop environment In The Groove (game) Babylon 5 Computer role-playing game Desktop publishing 3dfx Sinclair ZX81 Commodore 64 PCI Express Amstrad CPC OpenGL Microsoft Windows Autodesk Media and Entertainment Genetic algorithm Digital cinematography PowerBook JPEG Game Boy Computer software Atari ST Central processing unit Video Blue screen of death Opera (web browser) Personal computer Machinima Word (computer science) Console game

fixing driver issues i was having this freaky problem with my monitor where every now and then like every hour of so it would turn off and then turn back on again and a couple times a day it would make this weird click pop sound when it did that and it would just turn off for good and i'd have to restart the computer i got advice from someone that i should uninstall my nvidia drivers and then reset to the via chipset that came with the computer and download the latest drivers for that apply directx updates and corrected drivers for the monitor and then reinstalling the nvidia card i uninstalled the nvidia drivers but when i run dxdiag it doesn't say anything about my chip it just says i'm using nothing how do i reset back to the chip and also does anyone think the solution i was given will work i know that the drivers were the problem because the monitor no longer turns off now that nvidia is uninstalled and also i never uninstalled the via chip i just installed the nvidia card when i got it and that was that so i figured that when i uninstalled it that the chip would just take over but its not even showing that i have one how do i get the computer to detect it after u uninstall u need to reinstall everything u uninstalled i think it will probably work if the problem is indeed driver related u need to eliminate that anyway before u start troubleshooting hardware  ATI Technologies NVIDIA Radeon 3dfx DirectX Windows XP Spyware GeForce 4 Modem AmigaOS IBM PC compatible Graphics card PlayStation 3 SoundStorm IMac GeForce Blue screen of death GeForce 6 Series Graphics processing unit Game programming Commodore 64 OpenBSD Uninstaller IPod Vertex and pixel shaders OpenGL GeForce 7 Series Embedded system Original Amiga chipset GeForce FX Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Anti-virus software DDR2 SDRAM Xbox NForce4 GeForce 256 NForce Apple IIGS Counter-Strike Steam (content delivery) Microsoft Windows Knoppix Windows 2000 CPU design Copy protection Debugging Apple Macintosh Daylight saving time Booting VIA Technologies Rootkit Doom 3 AMD Atari 8-bit family Internet Explorer Commodore International RFID Indianapolis 500 Rendering (computer graphics) Commodore 128 Windows Me GeForce 2 Ethernet PlayStation 2 ZX Spectrum S3 Savage Linux Nintendo Entertainment System Radeon X Series History of Microsoft Windows Screenshot Device driver Shader Sound card Scalable Link Interface PCI Express Floppy disk USB flash drive GeForce 3 Cheating in Counter-Strike SUSE Linux Computer virus Common Unix Printing System BIOS RISC Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Surveillance Dawn (demo) World of Warcraft NForce2 The Sims 2 CPU cache 64-bit Digital photography MAME Motorola 68000 Trusted computing
