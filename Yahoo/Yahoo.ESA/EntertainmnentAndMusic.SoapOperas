y and r fans do you think devon likes lilly as more than just a sister i sure think he does i always found he looked like he did just the way he'd smile at her etc and he wanted her and daniel to break up in the worst way by telling lilly you deserve better and he's no good for you now he tried to set up a night of fun for them and lilly went and invited other people to be their dates he looked sooo dissapointed i think they'd be cute together but i also don't know if a relationship with them would ever happen what doyou think i agree with you your dead on the money he has a thing for her for sure girl he's in love but i think that he is struggling with the whole sister thing he want's to be a part of a family and for that reason he hold's her sacred as his sister but the man part of him really has a thing for her in the worst way that's why he is so jealous of daniel but i don't think that they will match them up though when he first started on the show i thought they would and have to say that i wanted them to be but not now  Friends Knots Landing EastEnders Humphrey Bogart The Emancipation of Mimi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Characters of Lost The Ashlee Simpson Show Dead Like Me Jon Secada About a Boy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Another World (TV series) Pitaten Social rule Sin City Paul Is Dead Neighbours Fiddler on the Roof Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Jennifer Lopez Cardcaptor Sakura Tenchi Muyo!

if given the opportunity how would you write a script for elizabeth's character on general hospital i personally can't stand elizabeth and think sam jason should be back together however if i was given the chance to write the script for elizabeth's character i would have so much fun first at this point since she perjured herself on the stand i would have ric call her to the stand again and have him trip her up admitting jake was her and jason's son with lucky hearing the whole thing she and lucky would divorce elizabeth would go to jail for perjury jason would be convicted for killing alcazar the baby would end up going into foster care and then sam would file to be a foster parent and take care of jake as a foster parent that's just for starters i just can't stand weepy little poor elizabeth it would be cool to have carly hook up with jerry too have jax w arina what a twist what would you do this is such a fun question because like you i cannot stand elizabeth either as jason's trial continues ric realizes that his case is not turning out as he has hoped and needs to resort to drastic measures knowing that elizabeth would not be pleased with his decision ric orders a paternity test to determine who the father of baby jake is in hopes that it is indeed jason proving this would show that elizabeth not only perjured herself but even lied about the phone call jason received in her presence the day alcazar vanished the twist would be that baby jake is really lucky's son and fake elizabeth has been lying to jason the whole time can you imagine how jason would feel knowing elizabeth led him to believe jake was his son not to mention all the pain she had caused between him and sam who he truly loved and cared deeply for in the meantime sam and lucky's relationship is turning into more than just friends the pain that both of them have experienced has left them hurt and seeking comfort in oneanother as the passion begins to develop they become romantically invovled unknown to anyone but amelia amelia confronts sam about the affair and threatens to tell elizabeth and jason while carly and jerry have planted a sufficient amount of evidence to make it look as if alcazar is alive which allows jason to be released however elizabeth is fighting to stay out of prison for perjury claiming that her children need their mother jason is trying to cope with losing sam and the love they shared and confides in spinelli determined to rekindle the romance spinelli tries very hard to reunite them together until sam realizes that she is pregnant with lucky's baby what a shock sam was told she could never carry to full term how could this happen although sam is very happy how will jason feel he could never give her a child and that is what she has always wanted doesn't that sound great  EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Luke and Laura Spencer History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Another World (TV series) Hollyoaks General Hospital Knots Landing Charmed 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sex and the City Kodocha One Life to Live Everwood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Appeal Jean Grey Boston Public Humphrey Bogart Sunset Beach (soap opera) Smallville (Season 4) Taken Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dawson's Creek Plame affair Guiding Light Blood on the Tracks Sharon Tate Past characters (Neighbours) Marilyn Monroe Fred Phelps Friends Sin City Little Britain Series finale Fancy Crane Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada The Untouchables Hip hop rivalries Melanie Wilkes Phoebe Halliwell Vernon Schillinger Abortion debate Neighbours Big Brother (USA TV series) Daredevil Darth Vader The Fairly OddParents The Lovely Bones Glen Jacobs Harry Potter (character) The Ashlee Simpson Show Alois Hitler Seinfeld Leo Wyatt George Costanza Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Terri Schiavo Mystique (comics) Social rule Transsexuality Adoption All My Children Narcissism Great Teacher Onizuka Professional wrestling holds Big Brother UK series 6 About a Boy Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Death Gate Cycle Characters of Smallville T'Pol It's Walky!

why does the media always portray men as bumbling idiots think about it almost every tv show or movie you can think of depicts the husband father as incredibly stupid and the wife is the only smart one i havent even seen that many movies or tv shows but i always notice it in almost every movie or show example everybody loves raymond king of queens family guy even childrens shows lizzie mcguire thats so raven etc i cant think of a whole lot right now but how many agree with me do you think that if the media stopped telling everyone that men were stupid and incompetent and started portaying them as smart intelligent and honest that it would make a difference in men in the real world lol bmetjerry some guys are stupid but i think that the media is really most of the problem i know a lot of very intelligent guys and they dont get enough respect apparently you haven't seen the jeffersons honkey in all actuality it's more of a clich then anything else the dad thinks he's the king of his castle and his wife lets him think it all the while controlling things kinda like the rare opportunities when fat people aren't scarfing down everything in sight or republicans not compared to the devil or democrats not compared as tree hugging sissies etc all it is is typecasting people enjoy fitting people into categories and the networks fill that need but i do agree stereotyping leads to people expecting less from themselves and adds to the decline of civilization  Humphrey Bogart Married... with Children Joke Recurring South Park characters The Fairly OddParents Family Guy Garfield Ren and Stimpy Theory of conduct Beavis and Butt-head The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hogan's Heroes LaVeyan Satanism Maid Marian and her Merry Men Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kyle Broflovski Friends Plame affair American Dad!
