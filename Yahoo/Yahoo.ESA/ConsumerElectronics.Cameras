looking for digital camera that takes quick consecutive pics without a few seconds delay you don't say what your budget is i use a nikon d slr which fires off images at the rate of five per second my older d s now replaced by the d takes pictures at the rate of three per second this isn't exclusive to nikon either canon slrs have similar speeds so if high speed is a priority go for an slr if that's too expensive or bulky and you really want a point and shoot you're going to have to live with shutter lag though it doesn't have to be seconds i use a canon powershot as my p s camera the model g this one has about a one second shutter lag which isn't too bad it also has a continuous shooting mode in one setting is does pics at the rate of about three per second but it does that by not readjusting focus or exposure between shots in the second mode it does about one per second because it will adjust focus and exposure between shots either way for a point and shoot that's impressive i'm not recommending the nikon d or the canon g both are quite expensive and are designed more for purists i love them both but that doesn't mean someone else won't disagree with me however there are other models from canon and nikon that might meet your needs and minimize some of your frustrations i hope this helps a little  Digital photography Leica Canon T90 View camera Canon EOS Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera Rangefinder camera Konica Minolta Nikon FA Nikon FE Nikon D70 Nikon FE2 Canon PowerShot G Camera GunBound Photographic lens Floppy disk Movie projector Canon EF lens mount Point and shoot camera Secure Digital card Mouse (computing) Nikon FM Digital cinema Contax Digital camera back Shutter speed Advanced Photo System Street photography Stereoscopy Film speed Pentax Closed-circuit television Quake III Arena Canon EOS-300D Twin-lens reflex camera Mercedes-Benz Macro photography Embedded system Oscilloscope Atari 8-bit family Major League Baseball television contracts Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Time-lapse Camcorder Medium format Digital camera Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Canon FD GunZ The Duel Cinematography Bluetooth Motorcycle General Dynamics F-111 Olympus (company) Raw image format 135 film Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster F-number Bullet time Wind turbine NTSC Turbocharger Universal Century Technology Frame rate Canon EOS-20D Volleyball Aperture Image scanner Digital cinematography Traditional animation Eastman Kodak Escape from New York BZFlag Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Persistence of vision PlayStation Portable Autofocus Automatic number plate recognition Counter-Strike Tennis Canon T70 Pinhole camera Sniper Team Fortress Classic Full frame digital SLR Color temperature Cheating in Counter-Strike Hubble Space Telescope B-47 Stratojet Airsoft Movie camera

what not to clean your camera lens with what are some things most people would think is good to clean thier camera lens with but isnt good first of all it's prudent to try to never have to clean your lens i accept though that this is impossible with a p s camera however with an slr you can buy a uv filter for the lens which will protect the lens for its entire life secondly when you do have to clean a lens the first most important thing to do is blow it clean with a blower brush simply setting about cleaning it with a cloth can cause all manner of problems if there happens to be a little speck of sand or other abrasive material on the lens surface you could scratch the lens only after you blow it clean is it a good idea to start to use a cloth that said i agree with ben h in his recommendations methyl alcohol available at most hardware stores usually gets rid of most problems when a simple wipe of the micro fibre cloth doesn't work now don't coat the lens with the alcohol if that stuff gets inside the lens it can also disolve some of the grease and cause the lens to jam instead place a drop or two in the middle of the lens and work outwards with your cloth in a circular motion his windex comment is a bit unorthodox i'll admit and should be a last resort solution but it does work i've not had a fungus problem so i can't comment if it works on fungus or not though i suspect it does however one problem i've had often comes from the seaside i don't have a clue what the chemistry of the air is along the ocean but i've often found a real goo coating my uv filter trying to clean it dry doesn't work it simply smears things worse often alcohol also doesn't work you're just smearing the goo around more in those situations i've found the windex to work really well too it seems to disolve that goo more thoroughly and leaves you with a lens in pristine condition once more however unlike my earlier advice in this case you need a different technique first of all in this case you're trying to dissolve a coating of guck that accumulated from the air a couple of drops isn't going to do that i'd place several drops on the lens again making sure they stay in the middle and then i'd gently work from the centre to the outside of the lens in a circular fashion the stress is on gently because you will have salt crystals mixed in with the goo that can scratch the lens so what you're trying to do on the first pass is disolve them and get rid of them keep in mind when you do this that you are also contaminating your cloth if you use the same spot on the cloth in the next cleaning you'll simply smear the goo back on the lens so the second time you do this use a different part of the cloth or better yet another cloth usually after three or four attempts the lens will come clean once you've done that it's a good idea to thoroughly clean your cloth under warm running water to get rid of all the residue then hang it out to dry and when dry it's ready for the next time another answer is to visit your local camera shop many still carry a lens cleaning fluid which usually works on lenses the only problem is that this stuff is usually more expensive than the other solutions on the positive side though if you bought a couple of those bottles once they're empty you can use one for the alcohol and the other for the windex this way you'll have these with you in your camera kit wherever you go i hope that helps a little  Textile manufacturing Bong Dry cleaning Movie projector Opportunity rover Hard disk Sewage treatment Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Diseases of the honeybee Water Floppy disk Digital photography Lens (optics) Brazing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hydrogen peroxide Drag racing Glass Water purification Leica Breastfeeding Nuclear weapon design Menstrual cup Plastic Fecal incontinence Motor oil View camera Photographic lens Upholstery Fire extinguisher Electrophysiology Glasses Photography Thermal power station Sunglasses E85 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Vinegar Stereoscopy Spirit rover Hamster Nuclear fallout Carburetor Ceramics Carbon dioxide Modem Dialysis Urinary incontinence Mattress Tag Polarization Apollo 8 The Apprentice 2 Syphon Filter Scientology beliefs and practices Swimming pool Microeconomics CPU design Sulfuric acid Wood Alcoholics Anonymous Traumatic incident reduction Decompression sickness Violin Automatic number plate recognition Ammonia Arcade cabinet Gramophone record Dairy Soul Computer virus Japanese tea ceremony Sun Mach kernel Digital camera Otitis externa Internal ballistics Hemp Cheating in poker The Inside LSD The Smoking Room Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Soldering Disinfection Fluorescent lamp Glacier Leather DVD Diving suit

digital camera can the olympus fe take black and white pictures if so how no this model is meant to be a basic point and shoot camera and does not give you that option as with all olympus fe series cameras the fe almost completely lacks any manual settings besides flash and macro shooting preset scene modes and exposure compensation users can't make any image adjustments the camera completely automates white balance iso sensitivity and other settings giving a very literal sense to the phrase point and shoot this isn't necessarily a bad thing automation can be beneficial as long as the images look good in the end  Camera Digital photography Canon T90 Photography Leica Canon EOS Stereoscopy View camera Mouse (computing) Depth of field Cinematography Macro photography Movie projector Contax Olympus (company) Digital cinema Point and shoot camera Film speed Extreme Programming Enlarger Software testing Konica Minolta Canon PowerShot G Floppy disk Color temperature Nikon Corporation Nikon FA XD-Picture Card Binoculars GunBound Rangefinder camera Windows 2000 Nikon FM2 Television Film F-number Metering mode Oscilloscope Secure Digital card Digital cinematography Street photography NTSC Digital image editing Exposure (photography) Raw image format Anamorphic widescreen B3ta Macro Canon T70 Amateur astronomy Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas STS-62 Medium format Panavision Cheating in Counter-Strike Warez Atari 8-bit family ISO 9000 Embedded system Technicolor Synthesizer Gradius Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pixel Traditional animation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photograph Image Enterprise content management Professional video camera PlayStation Portable C programming language Anaglyph image Color Computer animation Eye Geodesy Bluetooth Beatmania IIDX Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Drill bit Charge-coupled device Federal Standard 1037C Emacs Automatic number plate recognition Internet phenomenon ITU-T Make Japanese toilet IPod Password Knight Rider Rendering (computer graphics) Nikon FE2

how would i fix my digital camera it's a polaroid pdc i think the pdc thing is the make or model but i don't know what it is all it does when i turn it on is the screen comes on a blue decorative background that says polaroid on it that was what it always did first while turning on when it was working there are no places that can fix my camera in my shop i tried the only two local places in the phone book but both have gone out of buisness i tried best buy but they can't fix my model and the only place left is a camera shop at the mall and they say it'll cost to send it out to be fixed and that's about ten dollars less than what it would cost to get a new one of similar quality how would i fix this myself my dad said that he might get me a new one next weekend but we don't have a lot of money right now and i want to fix it if i can otherwise i'll just destroy it and then i'll get a new one next weekend sorry that last paragraph was messy let me clarify i want to fix it and if i fail killing it i will just get a new one next weekend there's no harm in trying right this is a link a picture of the camera except mine's black http ec images amazon com images i c snyesl aa jpg the main problem i have had with digital cameras is that the batteries don't have good clean contacts the solution is to use a clean eraser rub on clean paper to clean to clean the batteries and contact points in the camera make sure the batteries are full charged this may not be your problem but it has been my problem pencil eraser is the best way to clean metal contacts it takes off gunk and corrosion user the one off the back of an hb pencil it has be to semi hard not that uber soft kind  Digital photography Photography Oscilloscope Windows Vista Digital camera Camera Instant camera IPod Traditional animation Xbox 360 View camera Silver Lead Stereoscopy Atari 8-bit family Single-lens reflex camera Anamorphic widescreen Voice over IP Digital cinematography Game Boy Drill bit Konica Minolta Textile manufacturing Naval mine Gold Nintendo DS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Leica Knife Mouse (computing) Movie projector PlayStation Portable Surveillance Computer Drawing Hard disk Energy development RGB color model AmigaOS Microeconomics Online shop Extreme Programming Digital single-lens reflex cameras Laptop Contact lens Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Treo 650 Photographic film Gold standard Solar cell GSM services Television Cellular network Atari ST Warez Game controller Violin Battery (electricity) 8 mm video format Mad Money Windows XP Bulk vending Telephone numbering plan Nickel metal hydride Mattress Technicolor Opportunity rover Switch Fountain pen IBM PC compatible Mobile phone Modem Thermostat GED Customs and etiquette of Japan Fiat money Piano Johnny 5 Airsoft Ocean's Twelve Resident Evil: Apocalypse Screenplay Contemporary culture of South Korea Inflation Canon T90 Medium format PlayStation 2 Best Buy Digital cinema Resident Evil 4 Money SX-70 Floppy disk Copy protection Back to the Future Pornography Enlarger

which lens are better nikon pentax or canon i'm getting my first dslr i was wondering which brand to start with a great and affordable array of lenses from the latest statistics the list is as follows nikon canon pentax that said all those lenses are better than any of the third party lenses available at this time lenses are more than just the glass the mechanical attributes of the system that surrounds the glass are nearly as important as the ability of the lens to focus the images then you have to consider the ability of the camera body to use all these wonderful attributes before spending a lot of money on a system do some serious research and see which camera body will do what you need it to do as you photograph your favorite subjects  Nikon Corporation Digital photography Single-lens reflex camera Photographic lens Leica Nikon FM Canon EF lens mount Nikon FM2 Nikon FE Konica Minolta Nikon FE2 Binoculars Digital camera Nikon FA Contax View camera Macro photography Lens (optics) Rangefinder camera Canon Inc.

changing the dpi resolution on a digital camera i am still a bit confused at the dpi resolution concept of a digital photo even on a megapixel camera using the highest resolution of x the jpeg quality and or if they are the same the dpi comes out at is it that some cameras do not have the capabilities of higher dpi so many sites like bay photo etc are talking about higher dpi numbers for better quality you can not control the pixels per inch in your camera as this is a function of the sensor i have found the following ppi for some cameras by the following manufacturers i wonder if this specification is available anywhere i have four camera manuals in front of me and i can't find it in any of them nikon ppi canon ppi pentax ppi we discussed this by way of question and answers a while back and decided that the ppi file produced by the camera really did not have any effect on the capability to produce a good print if i take a photo with my wife's mp nikon and view the image on the screen it will start out as ppi if it's a full frame image of pixels x pixels the screen image would be pretty big if i viewed it full sized but it would print x if you crop a x out of this keeping it as full frame as possible it becomes dpi with my brother's mp pentax the image is px x px but it's at ppi if you print this without cropping it would be x if you crop a x out of this though it becomes dpi resolution which is virtually identical for the nikon mp camera with my son's mp canon powershot a the image is px x px but it's at ppi if you could possibly print this without cropping it would be x if you crop a x out of this though it becomes dpi resolution which is a bit better than either of the other mp cameras in other words regardless of the sensor's pixel per inch output mp cameras produced the same resolution when it came time to print comparable images how about a camera with more pixels if i take a photo with my mp nikon d and view the image on the screen it will start out as ppi if it's a full frame image of pixels x pixels the screen image would be pretty big if i viewed it full sized but it would print x if i had the right paper if you crop a x out of this keeping it as full frame as possible it becomes dpi or higher resolution than the mp cameras we knew that is would work out like this though didn't we the real question is what difference does this make in the real world if we agree that dpi is an excellent resolution for prints as long as you end up with at least ppi after you are done cropping on the screen you will get an excellent print as far as resolution goes all four cameras exceed that amount i usually resize down to dpi before printing because you can't tell the difference above that resolution anyway most people would be quite happy with a dpi print so go ahead and crop a bit if you get a print resolution too much below dpi you will start to see digital artifact in the print and it will be objectionable  Image scanner Mouse (computing) WYSIWYG Raster graphics Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Digital camera View camera Windows Vista Digital camera back Inflation Camera Digital cinema Digital image editing Anamorphic widescreen Nikon D70 Nikon Corporation Canon EOS Photography High-definition television Geographic information system Image file formats Video Analog-to-digital converter Medium format Dot matrix printer Liquid crystal display PNG Motion capture Ebook Advanced Photo System Leica Digital cinematography Atari 8-bit family Original Amiga chipset MP3 Raw image format Movie projector Macro photography Aspect ratio (image) Digital video Widescreen Moir__ pattern 2D computer graphics Closed-circuit television PostScript PlayStation Portable MPEG-2 Nintendo GameCube Deinterlacing Nikon FM2 Autostereogram Computer printer Plasma display Holography Charge-coupled device NTSC Photographic film Floppy disk Camcorder Radeon QuickTime Binoculars Super Nintendo Entertainment System Depth of field Amstrad CPC Typeface PlayStation 3 Hubble Space Telescope Nikon FA Hash table Anti-aliasing Apple typography Bluetooth DV Killian documents Computer animation Canon EOS-20D Dither Machine vision Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RGB color model Canon T90 Nintendo 64 Motion compensation Clementine mission Nikon FE2

can someone please tell me which digital slr i should buy the canon eos d or the nikon d there is no better when it comes to those two camera makers both have similar quality both get you outstanding pictures both have a huge array of gadgets that will help to solve some of your photography issues so from a quality point of view you can flip a coin there is however a difference each tends to design their cameras differently so one brand might feel better in your hand than the other for me that's the nikon it's a bit bigger than the canons and i find the key controls slip comfortably under each finger making the camera a joy to use however there are people who say the same about canon too it depends on your hands and what kind of work you do so in the end you have to physically hold each model to determine which you prefer the other difference is historical nikon tends to be more conservative and slower to innovate but in return when a new model of something does come out it's incredible both in quality and functionality canon innovates faster so in any given moment they seem to have more solutions than nikon but by rushing things to market they end up selling things that aren't really fully debugged and working their new stuff works well to be sure but if you wait a few months or a year nikon's version ends up a hell of a lot better nikon also tends to stay away from wizbang stuff canon often builds in features which seem just wonderful to the novice photographer but in fact they are features that you'll never use since there are better ways to achieve the same end still though it sells a lot of cameras since people are taken in by features even when the features have no value nikon doesn't build in stuff that you don't need they put their resources into making sure that what you do need is functional and effective in the end better still depends on what you want to do if you're just into snapshots either brand will give you outstanding quality flip a coin and have fun if you're into more specialized stuff it's not the camera that is the issue it's the lenses and other accessories that are important will they help you achieve the goals you set for yourself better is meeting your specific needs so understand your needs and then come to a decision finally better is whatever feels right for you people who believe a camera should be a solid piece of work and is designed to be easy to operate often prefer nikon people who believe a camera has to be small and light and are willing to accept more cumbersome controls will pick canon and both will tell you that theirs is the best oh yes and what do i use i use a nikon d i started with a d s now replaced by the d and eventually migrated to the d both bodies placed the critical controls under my fingers and both bodies fit comfortably in my hands with the d i never have to go to a menu to turn something on and my eye never has to leave the viewfinder either to me those kinds of things are critical because often seconds count when you re taking a picture i hope this helps a little good luck  Leica Konica Minolta Canon T90 View camera Single-lens reflex camera Nikon Corporation Mouse (computing) Nikon FM2 Nikon FA Nikon FE2 Rangefinder camera Stereoscopy Macro photography Nikon D70 Binoculars Cinematography Camera Nikon FE Social rule Photographic lens Floppy disk Computer W.

looking for new digital slr camera lens i am looking at the nikon d x camera and i think i definately want to get it after looking at the reviews i am just getting into amateur photography and was wondering if anyone could steer me towards a good lens to purchase with it it comes with an mm lens mostly my husband and i will be taking snapshots and nature landscapes and sports shots any reccomendations your desires are at opposite ends of the spectrum landscapes typically demand a wide angle lens while sports usually required a telephoto as a primary and first lens i'd suggest the nikon mm mm as your best bet you don't have to buy the lens that comes with the camera you can subsitute it for any other but of course that will cost you a bit more in mm terms that gives you a range from a mm wide angle which it pretty good to a telephoto of mm which is also pretty good what's nice too is that you won't have to constantly change lenses this lens has an image stabilizer built in too which helps in low light situations later if you really need a wider angle lens you can add that as you have the money wider angles tend to be rather expensive and later you can also add a longer telephoto if you really need that capability beyond the lens above usually telephotos aren't quite as expensive as wide angles your other alternative is to buy two lenses get the mm mm which gives you that same mm wide angle and extends to mm in mm terms this is great for landscapes and parties and portraits stuff like that add to this lens the mm mm zoom with the image stabilizer this then takes you from mm all the way up to mm a fairly lengthy telephoto this combination will cost you more of course and will necessitate changing lenses all the time but it does allow a much larger telephoto range nature photography demands all kinds of things but either lens recommendation would meet your needs however if you're into little things small bugs for instance then the nikon mm macro lens is ideal it goes to life size has an image stabilizer and is very fast at f while stopping down all the way to f however this lens is not practical for every day photography its strengths lie in photographing little things i have all four of these lenses and have been very happy with them i do a lot of macro work so the macro is priceless to me when i first bought my d s it came with the and i added the however i found it a pain to constantly change lenses so when i bought my d i got that with the lens now i never use my it's unnecessary but once in a while i will use the when i need that extra telephoto length which isn't too often if i were starting out again i d get the as my primary lens and add a later on unfortunately the didn t exist at the time i bought my d s in terms of your camera choice the d x is an excellent exceptional entry level slr that will allow you to accomplish quite a bit and will give you an opportunity to really learn photography if you have a serious interest later if you want more sophistication look at the d or whatever replaces it at the time nikon has built in a lot of features into that one that are usually reserved for the professional line i use the d personally this model is almost identical in functionality and reatures to their professional camera but at one third the cost as you get ever more sophisticated this one is a real bargain for what it delivers to your hands i hope that helps a little  Cinematography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Contax Nikon Corporation Digital camera Konica Minolta Panoramic photography Microeconomics Zoom lens Canon EOS Digital camera back Canon T90 Rangefinder camera Depth of field Eyepiece Binoculars Economics Camera Canon EF lens mount Computer Extreme Programming Supply and demand Theory of conduct Insurance Surveillance Aberration in optical systems Car handling Amateur astronomy Poker jargon Photographic film CPU cache Advanced Photo System Street photography Lens (optics) Equine conformation Pinhole camera Inflation Atari 8-bit family MMORPG Camcorder Bicycle lighting Film Reflecting telescope IBM PC compatible Telescope Hubble Space Telescope Nikon FM2 Medium format Movie projector Explosive material Gamma ray burst Full frame digital SLR Lighting Parallax Windows Vista Polarization Drill bit Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Nikon FE Monetary policy Bloodstain pattern analysis Floppy disk Transformer Paragliding Redundant array of independent disks Color Golf Land use forecasting Mach kernel Anamorphic widescreen Apollo 8 Carburetor Goodness and value theory Wayne Corporation Oscilloscope Milton H.

why does the canon a seem to take better pictures then the sd when the sd has digic lll ok so digic lll which only the sd has has face detection technology and it says outstanding image quality reading off the canon flyer while the a only has digic ll i know that the a has a higher mp its mp and the sd is mp but does it make that much of difference is it just me cuz it seems when viewing sample photos that the a is better in image quality how come even with the sd 's digic lll and it's face detection technology that potrait photos on the a have better color and is more clean and crisp comparing to the sd 's portrait photos if ur gonna say its cuz a has a larger sensor tell me what a sensor is judge for urself look at the sample photos http www pbase com cameras canon powershot sd http www pbase com cameras canon powershot a by looking at the sample photos urself which has better image quality turn off face detection as this can be fooled and you can detect a face just as quickly yourself you are right that sensor size makes the difference the a sensor is about twice the size of the one in the sd here is a comparison between mp image from the sd which is a sensor like the a and a mp image from an sd is which is a sensor like the sd okay i don't know if we are comparing pixel count or sensor size here but take a look anyway and see what you think about the differences click on all sizes and then original to judge http www flickr com photos samfeinstein here's another http www flickr com photos n here is a mini tutorial i made myself to compare mp sensors in a digital slr dslr and a point and shoot p s camera i have tried to keep everything on equal footing with no unequal cropping of the original images both images were taken at the equivalent of mm from about feet away view this full size and scroll through the image to compare the resolution at various points of the images to me the p s sensor practically looks like an impressionist painting compared to the dslr sensor please note also that this is the large size p s sensor as most are using the smaller x mm sensor http www flickr com photos n  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Digital camera back Pixel Foveon X3 sensor Photography Canon EOS-20D Single-lens reflex camera Macro photography Gamut Stereoscopy Geographic information system Mouse (computing) Canon EOS Charge-coupled device Digital Image file formats Aspect ratio (image) Sensor Advanced Photo System Medium format Digital image editing PNG Full frame digital SLR Closed-circuit television Thermographic camera Leica Digital cinema Nikon Corporation Movie projector Digital cinematography Image scanner Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Opportunity rover Four Thirds System Analog-to-digital converter Raw image format Motion capture Panoramic photography View camera Nikon D70 Camcorder Grayscale Photo sharing Widescreen Ajax (programming) Konica Minolta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Clementine mission JPEG Canon EOS-300D Anamorphic widescreen Huygens probe Canon EF lens mount Liquid crystal display Road-rule enforcement camera Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft DVD 8 mm video format Dots per inch Secure Digital card IPod Optical coherence tomography Flickr Floppy disk Raster graphics Autostereogram Anti-aliasing Electronic organ Camera World Wide Web Laserdisc Schneider Kreuznach HyperText Transfer Protocol Shroud of Turin IMAX Photographic film Wallpaper group Amstrad CPC Canon T90 Chroma subsampling Fuel injection Atari ST Apple Computer Digital video Compact disc Digital image London Digital art Binoculars Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February

when people talk about digital cameras what does a larger sensor mean explain also i have a canon flyer here and beside the photo of the digital camera it says as one of its feauture iso or iso what does iso mean does it mean the sensor the terms you mentioned are used to compare digital cameras to film cameras the sensor is the flat thing that the lens focuses the light onto the sensor collects the image which is then stored onto the camera's memory the 'sensor' size would be equivalent to the 'film' size in a film camera the bigger the sensor the better the image quality all else being the same iso is also a term used to describe the sensitivity of film to light iso or higher film is better suited for shooting in low light conditions the trade off is that high iso film is very grainy in the digital world iso means that you can set the camera's light sensitivity to match that of iso film  Digital photography Film speed Digital single-lens reflex cameras Macro photography Camera Photographic film Photography View camera Anamorphic widescreen Cinematography Charge-coupled device Digital cinema Aperture Exposure (photography) Medium format Panoramic photography Pixel Digital camera back Digital cinematography Depth of field Widescreen Full frame digital SLR Foveon X3 sensor Canon EOS Movie projector Computer vision F-number Four Thirds System Advanced Photo System Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Nikon D70 Leica Photographic lens Canon T90 IMAX Stereoscopy Point and shoot camera Enlarger Raw image format Gamut Contax Nikon Corporation Photograph Aspect ratio (image) Color Advanced Audio Coding Street photography Oscilloscope Reflecting telescope Floppy disk Professional video camera 35 mm film Panavision Infrared photography Geographic information system PNG Shutter speed Machine vision Color temperature International Organization for Standardization Eye Night vision Canon EF lens mount Schneider Kreuznach Galileo spacecraft Binoculars Canon EOS-300D Thermographic camera Canon EOS-20D Digital image editing Disk image Nikon FE2 Color blindness Super 8 mm film Road-rule enforcement camera Telescope Closed-circuit television ISO 9000 Autostereogram Digital video Explosive material Eyepiece STS-62 110 film Lockheed U-2 Clementine mission Autofocus Digital Zoom lens Pinhole camera Canon EOS-20Da Television Amateur astronomy Infrared

will the canon sd camera's price go down anytime soon with some holiday or anything sure it will you can bet on it as soon as the sd comes out the sd will drop in price because the retailers want to get rid of them at the rate canon is coming out with new models i'd bet you anything that this will be by next christmas i bought my first digital camera this way it was originally and when the new model came out it dropped to with a rebate in fact with any kind of electronics or high tech stuff the very slightly obsolete model is usually much cheaper than the very latest thing and of course the very latest thing is only going to be the very latest thing for a few months any camera or stereo or computer or mp player you buy is going to be 'obsolete' for most of its life  Digital photography Best Buy IPod DVD Floppy disk IBM PC compatible UK Singles Chart Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camera Game Boy Apple Macintosh Laserdisc Apple Computer Atari ST Microeconomics Stereoscopy Computer Watch London Congestion Charge RuneScape economy Digital cinematography 8 mm video format Sound Blaster Universal Serial Bus ATI Technologies Hard disk Videocassette recorder Modem High-definition television Game controller Sony Gramophone record Leica Pornography Closed-circuit television Camcorder Betting (poker) Panavision Nintendo DS Digital camera Price discrimination Dot-com Solar cell Electronic Arts Sega CD Radeon Sinclair Research Ltd Xbox Romania Commodore International Arbitrage F-16 Fighting Falcon N-Gage Binoculars PlayStation 2 Computer animation Movie projector FireWire The Brady Bunch IMac Digital cinema TiVo Stuff (magazine) Ford Motor Company Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SimCity 4 George Lucas MP3 Grand Theft Auto III Black-Scholes Jack plug 3dfx Counter-Strike Walkman Bluetooth Inkjet printer Tungsten Handheld Overclocking High fidelity Tesco Computer and video games Nintendo 64 Manual transmission Prediction market USB flash drive Intellivision Canon Inc.

is the canon sd is's time lapse mode any good is the canon sd is's time lapse mode any good i want to be able to record a still image as a separate file every once in a while seconds would be ideal i want to do it in a night shot mode especially like second exposure time a salesman told me the canon's time lapse mode only records to a movie file how well does it work is there a compact digital camera with a better time lapse mode it sure seems to be a rare feature the sd is is an excellent point shoot camera however it has very limited manual controls and it's time lapse mode is not really right for your needs here is an excerpt from canon the time lapse movie mode enables users to capture changing scenes such as drifting clouds or a bustling city street for accelerated playback as smooth vga quality movie clips captured at one second or two second intervals a scene of two hours duration can be condensed to a fluid eight minute or four minute movie file what you need is a camera with an intervalometer the ability to take a photo at set intervals canon has some older models that can do this the s is is one example but unfortunately it's update the s is does not have this feature though you should still be able to buy an s is from somewhere my husband has the s is and the intervalometer can be set to shoot images every to minutes and from to images can be shot the camera has full manual controls and you would need to use m manual mode or tv shutter priority to select your second exposure time it works well i have this feature on my old canon g the camera will take the first shot then power down till the next shot is due the lens will remain extended the whole time it's obviously best to have the camera powered by an ac adapter if you intend to take many shots this way good luck  Camcorder Camera Leica Photography Movie projector Canon T90 PlayStation Portable Canon EOS Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Time-lapse View camera Single-lens reflex camera Digital cinematography Cinematography Compact disc Canon PowerShot G Canon EF lens mount Enlarger VHS ITunes Rangefinder camera Digital cinema Digital single-lens reflex cameras Floppy disk Binoculars ATI Technologies MP3 Shutter speed Canon T70 Bluetooth DVD Mouse (computing) Walkman Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Nikon FA Windows Vista Windows XP Gramophone record Film Domain Name System Motion capture Television Secure Digital card GunZ The Duel QuickTime Atari 8-bit family Amateur astronomy GunBound Mercury Atlas 6 Hard disk Bullet time Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Stage lighting Contax Point and shoot camera Quake III Arena Medium format Nikon FM2 Parallax Digital camera Metering mode Apollo 8 Pinhole camera Laserdisc IMAX BZFlag Street photography Nikon FE2 Macro photography Musical Instrument Digital Interface Manual transmission Galileo spacecraft Warez Machinima Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

what camera should i buy i am trying to get into photography as a second job what type of digital camera would be the cheapest but good for me to start out with to take outside and inside pictures with first of all if you are looking to do photography as a second job i would not consider any type of camera other than a dslr this is the type of camera that you will see all professionals use if you are serious about doing this as a second job you may want to consider paying a little more for the camera if you just buy a point and shoot camera because its price is better then you may find the need to upgrade to a dslr anyway at that point you will have wasted enough on the point and shoot that it will make it harder to spend more for a dslr generally dslrs are not considered cheap one of the less expensive cameras but excellent in quality is the nikon d you should be able to find it for about with a lens i have a friend who has one of these and i really like the camera it takes great photos i personally selected the sony dslr a instead of the nikon d because of a few reasons this camera usually can be found for about with a lens although i got a good sale price of about with lenses first the camera had a bigger sensor so the images would be larger second the camera has a built in anti shake feature which works great since it is in the camera body the lenses i buy don't need this technology which saves a lot of money i traditionally use a higher zoom lens and don't feel like taking a tripod along for stability i have taken hand held photos with a mm lens with no image blur thanks to this technology i could never do this with my old slr third the camera has some built in dust removal technology the last thing i wanted to do was spend hundreds of dollars on a camera and have to deal with dust issues on the sensor all the time fourth the kit lens it provides covers a higher zoom range than the nikon so i wouldn't need to switch lenses to a telephoto lens as often you would really do yourself a good service by reading a review about your potential candidate cameras or a comparitive review of multiple cameras from a reputable website like www dpreview com when spending this much money on something you really should be comfortable with what it does well what it doesn't do so well and how that compares with what you need it to do this is how i made my decision good luck  Nikon Corporation Digital camera Single-lens reflex camera View camera Photography Leica Cinematography Binoculars Macro photography Camera Camcorder Canon EOS Nikon D70 Digital camera back Canon EOS-300D Rangefinder camera Contax Panoramic photography Hard disk Anamorphic widescreen Amateur astronomy Floppy disk Secure Digital card Stereoscopy Advanced Photo System Point and shoot camera Street photography Four Thirds System PlayStation 2 Shutter speed Zoom lens Nikon FE2 Nikon FM2 Zeiss Schneider Kreuznach Panavision Full frame digital SLR Digital cinema Eye Bluetooth Galactic Civilizations Movie projector Paintball Surveillance Motion capture Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Computer Depth of field Closed-circuit television Charge-coupled device Canon FD 8 mm video format Supply and demand Eyepiece Digital cinematography Photojournalism Henri Cartier-Bresson Canon EOS-20D DVD High-definition television The Apprentice 2 Film Steadicam Nikon FE Gross domestic product Oasis (band) Raw image format FairTax Windows Vista Microeconomics Electronic journalism Laserdisc Gamut Outsourcing Naval mine PlayStation 3 Apollo 8 Poker jargon Lens (optics) IMAX Road-rule enforcement camera Strategic management Professional video camera The Amazing Race Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Nuclear power Thermographic camera

is this a good camera i recently lost my camera so i'm looking to find a new one this one looks like it's similar to my old one but i really don't understand all the little details about what would make it a good camera the stuff at the bottom of the link does it look like a good one i had an hp before and i loved it http h www hp com wwpc us en sm wf a html the one i had before was mp and the quality was good enough for me i'm not doing like professional photography just regular pictures i don't know about this confusion but the link you gave shows and m and it says that this camera does have optical zoom not only that but they are honest about calling the digital zoom a cropping mechanism zoom in with x optical zoom then crop with x digital zoom to mm focal length equivalent to to mm this camera is a good step up from the one you had chosen before it lets you turn the flash off which is important for taking a baby's picture it has a frames per second burst rate that is also helpful for getting just the right shot of your baby if this is similar to your old camera you will be comfortable with it and i think it would be a good value and a good purchase for you given your stated purpose and experience  Digital photography Photography Zoom lens Leica Cinematography Photographic lens Panoramic photography View camera Konica Minolta Digital single-lens reflex cameras Contax Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera back Digital camera Stereoscopy Anamorphic widescreen Camcorder High-definition television Canon EOS Binoculars Panavision Movie projector Aperture Macro photography Traditional animation Film Motion picture terminology Nikon Corporation Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Movie camera World Wide Web Canon EF lens mount Camera Lens (optics) Widescreen B3ta Canon T90 Prank flash Rangefinder camera 8 mm video format 35 mm film Photojournalism Color temperature Windows Vista Telescope Gamma ray burst F-number Cinerama Holography Digital cinematography Modem Secure Digital card Schneider Kreuznach Amateur telescope making Eyepiece Digital image editing Television Tracking shot Laserdisc Digital circuit Universal Serial Bus Late Night with Conan O'Brien Point and shoot camera HTML Ebook DV Surveillance Magic (illusion) ATI Technologies Lightning Bubble Bobble Unreal Tournament 2004 Internet Warez Closed-circuit television Video The Inside Zeiss Persistence of vision Map Circle of confusion Digital Olympus (company) 3D computer graphics DVD Oscilloscope Instant camera Alfred Hitchcock Professional video camera Optics Street photography Charge-coupled device MP3 NTSC IMAX

is it better to have a uv filter or a polarizer filter on a digital slr polarizers cause too much light loss to be left on the lens all the time they have their use but not as an all purpose protective filter if you're as ham fisted as i am a uv filter is invaluable as a means of keeping nasty fingerprints off the front elements of lenses also since i use prime lenses and am constantly changing lenses a uv filter allows me to just shove a lens back into the bag without having to fumble around with the front cap with that said though uv filters have absolutely no effect on the image when used with a digital camera as dr sam's example photo so nicely illustrates there are two reasons for this unlike film which is very uv sensitive digital sensors both ccd and cmos have virtually no uv sensitivity thus if there is any uv reaching the sensor it's not likely to be recorded glass is generally virtually opaque to uv even without any special treatment so lenses themselves generally won't let through very much light in particular most lenses will block any light with a wavelength shorter than nm since nm is the aproximate cutoff for visible light only uv radiation in the nm nm near uv range could reach the ccd or film in any case if you're shooting film and at high altitudes where there is more uv please see the below link for information regarding the effectiveness of various uv filters on the market to make a long story short though the tiffen haze filter is the most effective filter at blocking light in the nm nm range  Digital photography Digital camera Charge-coupled device Ultraviolet Clementine mission Digital single-lens reflex cameras View camera Filter (optics) Galileo spacecraft Polarization Contax Telescope Stereoscopy Macro photography Observational astronomy Cassini-Huygens Cinematography Photography Digital camera back Canon EOS Pixel Glasses Microscopy Infrared Loudspeaker Federal Standard 1037C Leica Movie projector Foveon X3 sensor Camcorder Light-emitting diode Anamorphic widescreen Optical coherence tomography Sensor Single-lens reflex camera Holography Photographic film Antenna (radio) Optical coating Filter (photography) Eyepiece Radar Photographic lens Aperture Full frame digital SLR Color Nuclear explosion Zoom lens Astronomy Color blindness Konica Minolta Traffic light Eye F-number Electromagnetic spectrum Sunglasses Photograph Depth of field Incandescent light bulb Analog-to-digital converter X-ray Film speed Vignetting Sun Digital cinematography Technicolor Advanced Photo System Gamma ray burst Barcode reader Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Reflecting telescope Sewage treatment Pinhole camera Exposure (photography) Computer vision Enlarger Diode Liquid crystal display Stage lighting Panoramic photography Laser Light Low-pass filter Microphone Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 Digital cinema Gamut Raman spectroscopy Aberration in optical systems Electromagnetic radiation Radiation hardening Polymethyl methacrylate Monochromator

why does my digital camera focus on the background instead of my subject most of the time we get awesome sharp results of the background but our subjects will be blurry it seems no matter what setting we put the camera on it always does this the camera is a fuji finepix with megapixels we can't get good action shots either any ideas thanks this is a bit of a complicated question to answer but i'll try and give you a basic idea here i'm also not sure which model camera you have so i can't be certain that all the details will be accurate but you should still get the main concept when you take a photo with most cams there's a two stage process half pressing the shutter button first to lock focus on your subject and full pressing to capture the shot if you don't half press and allow the camera to determine focus ie you just full press right off the mark the camera will automatically hunt for the first thing it can focus on and sometimes it'll get it right sometimes it will fire prematurely in this scenario always half press wait for the camera to lock focus and give you a signal that it's ready to fire usually the focusing rectangle lights up a green color and then full press the nd thing you want to keep in mind is that most compact cameras rely on contrast detection to achieve correct focus if you're trying to focus on a part of a scene that has very low contrast the harder it'll be for the camera to determine what exactly you're trying to focus on this can sometimes be tricky so if the camera refuses to confirm focus green rectangle refocus a few times or focus on something more contrasty but that's at a similar distance away from you as the actual target there's more to this but try the two suggestions above to get you started good luck  Digital photography Stereoscopy View camera Digital camera Canon EOS Konica Minolta Internal ballistics Pixel Camera Cinematography Leica Panoramic photography Automatic number plate recognition Causality Camcorder Traditional animation Cheating in Counter-Strike Floppy disk Stage lighting Rendering (computer graphics) Anamorphic widescreen Radar Gamma ray burst Digital cinema Autostereogram Resident Evil (video game) Central processing unit Black hole Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Drawing Bullet time Eye Autofocus Mouse (computing) Scientific method CPU design Philosophy of language Revolver Movie projector Rangefinder camera Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Opportunity rover GunBound Terminal ballistics Theory of conduct Digital single-lens reflex cameras Depth of field M16 (rifle) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dial M for Murder Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Color Metaphor Canon T90 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory R-Type GunZ The Duel Film speed Falsifiability MP3 Macro photography Digital Filmmaking Big Bang Artificial consciousness Gamut Logic B-47 Stratojet Film Firearm Photographic lens CPU cache Modem Object-oriented programming Scientology beliefs and practices Bad Wolf Objectivist philosophy Lightsaber Binoculars Bluetooth Many-worlds interpretation Action potential Martial art Joel and Ethan Coen Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Computer vision Compact disc

kodak memory card i've bought a sd kodak memory card mb and i have a hp photosmart m when i put the memory card in it said that i could take pictures but something is wrong because that size memory card and megapixels should take between is something wrong with my memory card or it's normal and is that brand of memory card any good thanks thanks i've put my image quality to best and now i'm down to my image quality was just to normal that's why i had so many pictures check two settings on your camera resolution perhaps the camera is set to a lower resolution which would result in more photos fitting on your card compression perhaps the jpeg compression changed from fine to normal or standard otherwise it has nothing to do with the brand all mb cards will hold the same amount of data  Digital camera JPEG Image file formats Digital single-lens reflex cameras Pixel Photography Digital image editing High-definition television Widescreen Movie projector Data compression Photographic film JPEG 2000 Nintendo GameCube DV Motion capture PlayStation Portable QuickDraw MP3 PNG Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Secure Digital card GIF Poker jargon Digital television Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hubble Space Telescope Handheld game console 35 mm film XD-Picture Card Lossy data compression Video CPU design Television Gramophone record CompactFlash Credit card Atari 8-bit family Compression artifact Camcorder Sony Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation 3 Video compression Bluetooth Digital cinema Nintendo 64 Closed-circuit television Teletext PC Engine Digital Visual Interface Laserdisc Camera phone Memory card Betting (poker) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories IPod Mars Exploration Rover DVD Digital camera back Raster graphics Apple Computer Binoculars Lossless data compression Video codec Technicolor Digital image Sound Blaster Color Graphics Adapter Medium format Holography Synthetic aperture radar Windows XP Surveillance NTSC Warez MPEG-2 Tungsten Handheld Image scanner ATI Technologies Schneider Kreuznach Leica CPU cache Computer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Film speed GSM services Topps Computer printer GeForce 6 Series 120 film Microdrive Normal distribution Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Pinhole camera

how do i choose the camera i want what traits should i pay attention to details please i thought that the higher are megapixels the higher is the quality of a picture wrong i tried a megapixel camera from canon digital elph and the pics come out really grainy not that the camera is bad but it's not what i am looking for what i would like to know is what sort of camera i should look for if i'm looking for a good quality in nature pics mountains forests ocean etc nature in one word and also how can i make sure that zoomed in images will look good clear not obscure as if it's not taken from too far away now i know very little about cameras i would really appreciate if you give me the exact parameters i need to look for from what range to what range what sort of lens what brand how many megapixels details please and if you know the price ranges it would also help a lot also what should i look for the images taken at dusk and dawn w t a lot of light i appreciate whatever info i can get thank you all for the good info especially a user by name 'r m' and btw i never mentioned that the pics print grainy overall images appear grainy on the screen no matter what mode i use i started looking for the camera according to things listed by 'r m' and i think my head is about to explode the more you learn the more questions come out on the way so is ' mm f g ed af s dx lens' considered a good lens and overall is 'nikon d kit w af s dx zoom nikkor' considered a good camera i found one for thanks again there are three key things you should look for speed the faster the response when you press the shutter button the better you'll be able to capture those special moments this is known as shutter lag you want a very small shutter lag the best is around second the worst is around seconds noise in low light conditions a camera with noisy electronics will produce images with lots of speckles this is similar to graininess found on film cameras you want a camera with very low noise especially at iso settings of or more this will result in nice clean shots in low light conditions image sharpness a crisp image will be the combination of a good lens and image sensor the only way to get the best of all three features is to go with a dslr style camera such as the nikon d the downside to dslr cameras is that they are large and heavier that something like a pocket side digital elph  Konica Minolta View camera Photography Digital camera Photographic lens Camera Cinematography Film speed Stereoscopy Single-lens reflex camera Movie projector Canon T90 Nikon D70 Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Binoculars Widescreen Nikon FE2 Camcorder Nikon FM2 Pixel Nikon FA Panoramic photography Shutter speed Amateur astronomy Aperture Digital camera back Digital cinematography Motion capture Contax Canon EF lens mount Anamorphic widescreen Street photography Photographic film Floppy disk Bluetooth Nikon FE Danger Hiptop Macro photography Exposure (photography) Automatic number plate recognition Canon EOS-300D Zoom lens Canon EOS Opportunity rover Game Boy Quake III Arena Nikon FM Secure Digital card Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Charge-coupled device Hard disk Film Ebook Computer vision Gamut Pinhole camera Point and shoot camera Television CPU design Antenna (radio) Zeiss Time-lapse IMAX Gramophone record Modem Digital image editing PlayStation Portable Tank Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory GunBound Enlarger Computer Medium format Technicolor Wind turbine Advanced Photo System Bicycle lighting Carburetor Closed-circuit television Walkman Canon PowerShot G Extreme Programming Digital video Zire Handheld Road-rule enforcement camera Shutter (photography) Pump It Up Laserdisc Depth of field BASIC programming language Xbox 360

year old nikon mm camera did i break it i've been given a aprox yr old nikon fm camera the lever that advances the film won't move the film forward if i broke it is it repairable i presume you have pressed the shutter button and checked that you are not at the end of the roll of film both these will prevent the film advance working once you have checked these the next step is to give the base of the camera a solid thump with the heel of your hand do not use anything harder than you hand this may release the mechanism if it is stuck if this doesn't work the next step is to recover any film already exposed a good camera store will be able to do this for you if you don't have your own lightproof bag it will be repairable but you would need to know what the likely costs are before committing yourself to that a local camera repair shop may be prepared to give you some advice on that added you don't need to install a battery to operate the shutter the fm series are completely mechanical cameras and the battery is only used by the exposure meter  Canon T90 Leica View camera Digital photography Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE Movie projector Nikon FM Nikon FE2 Nikon FA Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camera Photography Windows XP Shutter speed Aerial (dance move) Point and shoot camera IPod Floppy disk Mouse (computing) Photographic lens Poker jargon Binoculars 135 film Stereoscopy PlayStation Portable Exakta Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Exposure (photography) Rangefinder camera Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Camcorder Surveillance Windows 2000 Equine conformation GunZ The Duel Radio controlled airplane Shutter (photography) USS Williamson (DD-244) The Price Is Right IMAX Pinball Enlarger Canon EF lens mount PlayStation 2 Shutter angle Bulk vending Canon T70 Welding Computer forensics Time-lapse Manual transmission Film speed STS-61 Holga camera Nikon Corporation Wind turbine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bicycle lighting Nintendo 64 Professional wrestling holds Steadicam Ty Cobb Automatic number plate recognition Twin-lens reflex camera Guilty Gear Traditional animation Thermal power station Kasparov versus The World Hubble Space Telescope Artillery F-number Harp Glossary of climbing terms Canon EOS Data recovery Knife Escalator Eastman Kodak Solar power Characters of Lost Game Boy Slot machine Stage lighting Helicopter Skateboarding trick Cruising (maritime) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Internal ballistics Panoramic photography Drill bit Automatic teller machine Apollo Command/Service Module Extreme Programming 8 mm video format Screw Elevator

what type of batteries and film does the polaroid land camera take and where can i purchase them online the takes polaroid peel apart pack film either polaroid type or type will work one is color and one is black and white although i can never remember which is which fuji fp c will also work and is around the same price perhaps a hair more expensive most people say that the fuji has better color although i never have done a side by side comparison to see for myself since this type of film can be used in many professional medium and large format cameras you should be able to get it from any camera store which caters to professional photographers if you order it online try either b h photo or adorama both located in new york both should stock all three types of film and have the best prices you'll find anywhere  Instant camera Digital photography Photographic film Medium format Photography Instant film Digital camera Panoramic photography View camera Large format Single-lens reflex camera Technicolor IPod Memento (film) Photograph Cinematography Camera Nintendo DS Magic: The Gathering SX-70 Film recorder Movie camera Color Game Boy Laserdisc Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Gamut Oscilloscope Widescreen Leica Digital camera back Internet fraud Black-and-white Enlarger 8 mm video format Image file formats Camcorder Surveillance RGB color model 16 mm film Color temperature Super 8 mm film Edwin H.

which is better canon powershot a or sony dsc w i like how canon a has the vari angle lcd screen and i like how sony comes in blue it looks nicer and is more smaller which is cheaper which is better in battery has anyone had both canon a a vs sony dsc w advantages for the canon include the a is mp instead of mp which is really only a slight advantage but it gives more detail in enlargements the a is also mp but the canon sensor is twice as big as the sony which makes for sharper pictures with less digital noise the canon zooms to an equivalent of mm instead of mm which is a significant difference much greater range of shutter speeds on the slow end higher flash output and ability to add external flash aperture priority shutter speed priority and total manual control none of which are offered by the sony uses cheaper more commonly available sd memory cards quality levels instead of probably no big deal frames per second limited by your card size and speed while the sony only goes fps and is limited to shots flip out and twist monitor opens up some real possibilities for creative point of view in your pictures uses aa batteries which are available everywhere if your rechargeable batteries die the a is well known as one of the best cameras for battery longevity though advantages for the sony include higher iso if it is really useable uses li ion batteries which are supposed to last longer than aa batteries but see my note above small enough to fit in any pocket unless you really want a blue pocket sized camera and don't care so much about your image quality get the canon  Leica Floppy disk Canon T90 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon PowerShot G PlayStation Portable Photography Movie projector View camera Stereoscopy Liquid crystal display Konica Minolta Camcorder USB flash drive Single-lens reflex camera Handheld game console Shutter speed IPod Mouse (computing) Photographic lens Aperture Walkman Motion capture Nintendo DS Universal Serial Bus Game Boy Digital cinematography Camera Oscilloscope 8 mm video format Bicycle lighting Laserdisc Digital camera Panoramic photography Internal ballistics Nikon FA Sound Blaster Computer Bluetooth Tungsten Handheld Nintendo 64 F-number Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Gramophone record Creative Zen Wind turbine Film speed Canon EOS Xbox 360 Nikon FE2 DVD Gamut Memory Stick Contax Sega Dreamcast High-definition television Sega Saturn Charge-coupled device Nintendo Revolution CompactFlash MP3 Apple Newton IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 Apple Macintosh Action potential Secure Digital card Depth of field Nikon FM2 Frame rate Federal Standard 1037C Digital cinema Macro photography Canon EF lens mount Light-emitting diode Canon T70 Pinhole camera Film Nickel-cadmium battery Digital camera back Cinematography Game controller Central processing unit Atari 8-bit family Clementine mission Resident Evil (video game) Octopus card RFID Laptop Exposure (photography) Explosive material NTSC Gradius Starfleet ranks and insignia Nintendo Tank

i am planning on buying a new digital camera what would be the best type to get what would have the clearest pics should i get one with more mp or optical zoom there's a delicate balance more megapixels allows you to enlarge more and crop more easily optical zoom lets you get 'closer' to the subject so you won't have to crop my suggestion would be to look for a camera with megapixels and with a x x zoom if you are using the longest reach of the zoom regularly or plan to then look at a camera with image stabilization is vr steadyshot etc as that will minimize the camera photographer movement that can be exaggerated when shooting at longer focal lengths sony panasonic canon nikon and all the big players make cameras that would fill your requriements the big thing is that you must handle each camera before making any decision the camera and it's controls need to fit the photographer not the other way around hope this is helpful  Digital photography Zoom lens Leica Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Photographic lens Konica Minolta View camera Photography Camera Cinematography Canon EF lens mount Digital camera back Binoculars Macro photography Aperture Pixel Digital camera Anamorphic widescreen Depth of field Camcorder Zeiss Rangefinder camera Contax Charge-coupled device Single-lens reflex camera Canon T90 Canon EOS Digital cinema Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Photo System Nikon D70 Schneider Kreuznach Movie projector Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Professional video camera Tracking shot Eyepiece Panavision Widescreen Enlarger Closed-circuit television Cinerama Motion capture Raw image format Canon Inc.

whats the best choice sony canon or panasonic i'm looking for an digital camara between and optical x zoom the pixels are also important i'll be here waiting for your advice it depends on what you're planning on doing with the camera if you're just looking for something to point and shoot on family vacations or the like then i'd say go with a midrange model sony they're pretty decent at that if you're looking for professional quality photos and are willing to put the time into learning what it takes to take them then nothing beats a canon you can check ebay and find a digital rebel for about what you're looking to spend and that's one of canon's better cameras  Digital photography Camcorder Photography Canon EOS Digital cinema Charge-coupled device Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Digital cinematography Camera DV High-definition television Zoom lens Konica Minolta Stereoscopy Videotape Canon Inc.

i read so many reviews from cnet about casio ex z they said the quality of picture is not good is it true yes it's true casio is into electronics and gadgets they're not into photography first of all i'd buy a camera from a camera maker not an electronics company you wouldn't go to a lumber yard to buy a tv so why go to an electronics supplier when you want a camera camera makers understand how photographers operate and they usually provide the tools you need not only to get outstanding pictures but also to set the camera quickly frankly casio sucks they're into electronics and gadgets not photography camera makers that are around include nikon canon pentax olympus and kodak these companies understand cameras and photographers kodak builds only simple cameras that have limited functionality and are priced low unfortunately they have been known to have reliability problems i've known many with a kodak digital and they all replaced them eventually if you look through all the questions here you'll also find more about inoperative kodaks than any other brand kodak is great if you want to spend as little money as possible and don't mind getting only a year of average pictures out of it their strengths are simplicity and low price olympus reliability isn't that good either and they use proprietary products so when you buy their memory cards you can't use those cards in any other camera except an olympus this is not usually a good situation to be in you may eventually want to replace it with another brand so you don't want to have to buy your memory cards all over again pentax builds a relatively good camera and offers the best bundled software available for handling your images pentax is someteims eliable and sometimes not but it's certainly better than olympus and kodak nikon and canon build the best point and shoot cameras and both use standard memory cards they're reliable and produce outstanding pictures i use a canon point shoot a powershot g which is an amazing camera that is highly reliable and incredibly well built in addition to being replete with features i also use a nikon d slr which is also an incredible camera you really can't go wrong with either of these brands i hope that helps a little  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Konica Minolta Nikon Corporation Eastman Kodak Leica Digital camera Pentax Canon EOS View camera Computer Nikon FA Camera Nikon FE2 Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Canon T90 Digital camera back Rangefinder camera Nikon FM Nikon FE Windows Vista Camcorder Full frame digital SLR Photographic film Canon Inc.

which digital camera lens should i choose for my first i have an olympus sp which allows me to add lenses i am considering buying my first lens and want to know which one is the best choice for my first lens x telephoto x telephoto wide angle or fish eye right now i use my camera for alot of different things including landscape sports and the typical point and shoot family event stuff landscaping would benefit from a wide angle lens fish eye is really a novelty and you probably won't use it much but when you do it'll be neat and i wouldn't go past x on the telephoto because adding lenses tends to diminish the quality of the pic it probably wouldn't be noticible much on x but x might show up  Cinematography Digital photography View camera Photographic lens Contax Panoramic photography Digital camera Schneider Kreuznach Leica Photography Zoom lens IMAX Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera back Four Thirds System Eyepiece Movie projector Stereoscopy Widescreen Shutter speed Binoculars Macro photography Bokeh Anamorphic widescreen Rangefinder camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Canon T90 Joel and Ethan Coen Canon FD Depth of field 3-D film Parallax Eye Street photography Canon EF lens mount Henri Cartier-Bresson Camera Camcorder Fisheye lens Olympus (company) Lens (optics) Konica Minolta Triumph of the Will Zeiss Nikon Corporation Microscope Electronic journalism Pinhole camera Cinerama Point and shoot camera The Contender (television series) Panavision Akira Kurosawa Canon EOS-20D Bicycle lighting Film speed NTSC 70 mm film Anaglyph image Aberration in optical systems Apollo 8 Red-eye effect Lighting Motion picture terminology Cosina Cinematographer Trilobite Lightsaber Amateur astronomy Gamma ray burst Secret photography Autostereogram Machinima Microeconomics Paparazzi Medium format Kurt Angle Volleyball Full frame digital SLR Digital cinematography Computer vision Canon Inc.

what is the difference between these two finishes for photos whats the difference between matt finish and glossy which would be better for a photo contest what makes the two different thanks glossy finish is very shiny and matte is not shiny at all as far as which is better it's personal preference it really depends on the picture i usually prefer matte or semi glossy which is kind of a cross between the two but sometimes glossy is nice to bring out the contrast in the picture  Fast bowling Carbon fiber Shoe polish Textile manufacturing Homestar Runner Textile manufacturing terminology Gloss (material appearance) Matt Kenseth Photographic paper Comics Mouse (computing) Autograph Crop circle Science fiction on television Glaze Laserdisc Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Rendering (computer graphics) Nottingham Forest F.C.

help i think my camera has been lost in the post but is still under warranty what do i do it's a fujifilm e zoom i sent it to fujifilm to get fixed and i have not received any conformation they have it with them they don't say anything about lost or stolen cameras on their website so i don't really know if they will send me a new one or not they gave me i tracking number but didn't write it down and my email deleted it somehow i still have receipt of purchase but will it be any good the only way you will be covered is if you have posted it via recorded or registered post through the post office as they normally ask when you are posting the item what the value is if you have done this and you have your postage receipt then take it to the post office and tell them what has happened when you post items this way they are covered through the post office the only other way i can think of is if you had the camera on your home insurance then claim through it usually when you post something to a company they do not cover loss or damage in the post either way  United States Postal Service Digital photography Warranty Data retention Surveillance Internet fraud Mail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Insurance Auto insurance E-mail spam Plame affair Automatic teller machine Phishing Neopets Postage stamp Health insurance Closed-circuit television FairTax Babylonian law Home insurance Mouse (computing) Identity theft Automatic number plate recognition Poker jargon Advance fee fraud Post Office Protocol Grey market Stamp collecting Bohemian Rhapsody Bank fraud Nikon Corporation Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Resident Evil 4 World Series Camera EXpanded MultiPlayer Arbitrage Envelope Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Argos (retailer) Postmark Trademark Digital single-lens reflex cameras Public domain Downing Street memo View camera Sears Holdings Corporation Computer virus BookCrossing United Kingdom corporation tax Stopping e-mail abuse Floppy disk Internet forum Photographic film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Reservoir Dogs Cash register American Depositary Receipt Liability insurance Income statement RuneScape cheats Mensal__o scandal Ex-gay Credit card Photographic lens Road-rule enforcement camera ZIP Code Medical malpractice Life insurance Gmail Transmission Control Protocol Nalgene SCO-Linux controversies Opera (web browser) Implied warranty MapleStory Vicarius Filii Dei E-mail Super 8 mm film Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Brit - British) Plame affair timeline Hash table Digital camera back Cross site scripting Billboard Hot 100 Eastman Kodak Japan Post Jessica Lynch Royal Mail UK telephone numbering plan Contract The Sims 2 Wal-Mart Zoom lens Postcode Something Awful Network Switching Subsystem Lloyd's of London

how can i create still pictures from a video my sister thought she was taking pics but actually took a video is there anyway i can edit the video in such a way that i get a still photo there are many ways to do this i am assuming it is digital video although tape video can be made into pics also however once you show the video on your computer you can pause the video at the point where you wish to take the picture and hit the printscreen button on your keyboard that causes the computer to generate an image of whatever is on your screen then you can go to any picture editing program and use the edit function to paste the printscreen image onto the editor that image can be edited also or saved as a jpg file or some other picture file this is by far the simplest way although there are many programs out there that do very much the same thing microsoft has the printscreen button on the upper right hand side of the keyboard sometimes labeled prntscrn sysrq or insert good luck  Screenshot Game controller PlayStation Portable Mouse (computing) Embedded system IPod Atari 8-bit family Nintendo GameCube Windows Vista Mac OS X v10.4 ASCII art ZX Spectrum Goatse.cx Floppy disk Synthesizer AmigaOS Emacs Text editor PlayStation 3 Digital image editing Macromedia Flash Windows Mobile Microsoft QuickTime Pixel Opera (web browser) Apple Computer ITunes Dance Dance Revolution JPEG WordStar Intellivision Stereoscopy Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Computer and video games X Window System Pinball Universal Serial Bus Defender (game) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family Editor Xbox 2D computer graphics IBM PC keyboard Podcasting IBM PC compatible Traditional animation Unicode Linked list Computer Amiga CPU cache Object Desktop Prank flash High-definition television Cheating in Counter-Strike Image file formats TRS-80 Common User Access Sega Dreamcast BASIC programming language Icon (computing) PlayStation 2 Xbox 360 Dither Computer virus Ebook Logo programming language Computer animation Final Fantasy (video game) Slot machine Text Editor and Corrector Laserdisc Computer forensics Video game music Musical Instrument Digital Interface TiVo Command line interface System/34 Internet slang Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Newline Macro Apple typography Nintendo Revolution Copy protection HyperCard Debugging TRS-80 Color Computer Anamorphic widescreen MSN Messenger Forth programming language

how many recharge cycles is typical for nickel metal hydride nimh batteries in cameras the nimh batteries in my kodak are failing to hold a charge after three years of use and about recharge cycles the package claimed about recharge cycles is the latter just hype or is my experience on battery recharge life more typical nimh will go through recharge cycles if used in certain circumstances for example do you leave your batteries depleted or do you charge them after your done using them how much of the range do you use your battery to to to fully discharging the batteries will shorten their charge cycle life especially if you leave it in the camera where the circuits slowly drain the batteries beyond the full discharge the longer they stay depleted the more damage they take the range that you use is important also charging them to is okay but beyond will damage the battery often times it's better to pull the batteries before they are completely charged on the charger unles your going to use them soon replace them around when they drain to charge they store and operate well in the region another factor with lower end nimh batteries such as used as an alkline replacement is that they have a shelf life this means that they will only last so long even in ideal conditions before their chemistries deteriorate the more frequently you use them the more you'll get out of them it's no wonder that they claim a recharge cycles they do them under ideal conditions for the batteries the closer you get to ideal conditions the better they work  Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Lithium ion battery Battery electric vehicle Toyota Prius Lithium ion polymer battery Ford Ranger EV Diode IPod Hydrogen economy Hybrid vehicle Digital photography Airsoft Circuit design Automobile Electric boat Armored Core Action potential Fuel cell Memory effect Laptop CMOS Carburetor Hubble Space Telescope Tesla coil Second Battle of the Atlantic Submarine Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory PlayStation Portable Tether propulsion Terminal ballistics Solar cell Groundwater Haloalkane Thermal power station Explosive material Uninterruptible power supply Bipolar disorder Electrophysiology AlphaSmart Iowa class battleship Nuclear fuel cycle Hybrid Synergy Drive Electroconvulsive therapy Ozone depletion Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Items in the Metroid series Capacitor Service life Radio controlled car Protoss Lead-acid battery Jet engine Spark plug Alkane MOSFET Sewage treatment Torpedo Transistor Vacuum tube Electroshock gun Nickel General Motors EV1 Handheld game console Internal ballistics Johnny 5 Traumatic incident reduction Universal Serial Bus Artillery Diesel cycle Radiation hardening Turbocharger Water (molecule) Roomba Hydrogen Iron Man Nintendo DS Lightning Ozone hole RuneScape weapons Incandescent light bulb USS S-38 (SS-143) Air gun Oscilloscope Nuclear power Petroleum Green Lantern Corps Urinary incontinence Electrical generator Halo 2 Field effect transistor Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Redundant array of independent disks Apple Newton

rearrange my question on focal length i did not explain myself correctly last night each and every shot i take in properties it shows digital focal length among shutter speed aperture etc want to know in each and every shot i take what would be the equivelent mm focal length with the sony it seemed about right times each digital focal length by to get equivelent mm focal length sensor x optical megapixels what would i times fuji with each shot x optical megapixels and sensor maybe take my old mm nikon fe and compare focal lengths and then times by a certain number antoni and dr sam sorry i did not explain my question correctly last night i posted this in your original question just a few minutes ago but here it is again for convenience your e has a sensor measuring about mm x mm the sensor to compare with measures mm x mm divide the larger length by the smaller length then do the same for width and the discrepancy is due to differing aspect ratios the smaller sensor being while the larger one is for differing aspect ratios the length multiplier is normally used to calculate the mm equivalent and in the case of a sensor that's it's actually but what's a few decimals  Digital photography Photography Pixel Photographic lens Aperture Eyepiece Aberration in optical systems Panoramic photography Decibel Sensor View camera Cinematography Leica Digital camera back Konica Minolta Movie projector Pi Antenna (radio) Aspect ratio (image) Floppy disk Depth of field Clementine mission Radar Numeral system Advanced Photo System Binoculars Telescope Film speed Canon T90 Reflecting telescope Lens (optics) Shutter speed Fuel injection Nikon FM2 Macro photography Digital camera Optical fiber Magnification Continued fraction Napier's bones Camcorder Golden ratio Optical telescope Zoom lens Angular resolution Normal distribution Hipparchus (astronomer) Trigonometric function Camera Digital circuit Motion capture Metric system Special relativity Units of measurement Exposure (photography) Gravity Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera Four Thirds System Huygens probe Binary numeral system Anamorphic widescreen Hard disk Circuit design Digital cinema Resistor Widescreen Pinhole camera Angle Vedic mathematics Shutter (photography) Canon EOS Gear ratio Specific impulse Nikon FA GED DV Piezoelectricity Nikon FE2 Vector (spatial) Diffraction Nintendo GameCube Solar variation Speed of light Synthetic aperture radar Elementary arithmetic Panavision Pentax Computer numbering formats Scientific notation Planetary orbit Nikon D70 Point and shoot camera Eye Charge-coupled device

can i use other software besides easyshare with my kodak digital camera the camera is a z my os is windows me i use firefox most of the time but also ie in case there's something i could use on line without downloading a program i can use photobucket to get them on line but how can i get them from my camera to my pc to begin with my biggest problems which the two responder's didn't catch was that i have a dinosaur computer me with not enough memory for most free programs and i need freeware because i spent all i have to spare on the camera buying a printer dock or a card reader isn't an option at this time dino has extra usb ports on the front but not a card slot a lot of times when i've downloaded something there was an older version available i could use i just haven't found one for working with photographs the camera is a z if that helps thanks for any suggestions if you get a card reader no additional software is necessary this is not only faster but it saves your camera batteries your computer or printer may even have a card reader built into it i have enough usb ports that i just leave it plugged in all the time first of all be sure there are some pictures on the card plug the card reader into an open usb port plug the card into the appropriate slot on your card reader i use photoshop elements and as soon as i plug my card into the reader it starts its own card reader and displays a thumbnail of every picture on the card if this does not happen automatically open your photo editing software do whatever you usually do to open a file but click on the selector where you can change drives your card reader will be assigned a new drive name that will be one letter higher than you ever saw before such as drive g or such then just double click on the name of the file you want to open and it will appear in your photo editor you can buy various kinds of card readers to accomodate many different memory cards pretty much anywhere that they sell digital cameras even walmart has decent card readers by the major manufacturers  IPod USB flash drive Secure Digital card Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Windows XP AmigaOS Apple Macintosh Bluetooth Apple II family Commodore 64 Mouse (computing) Digital camera Floppy disk Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows Vista PlayStation 3 Computer Apple Computer Sharp Zaurus Xbox IMac FireWire Musical Instrument Digital Interface Digital audio player ZX Spectrum IPAQ CompactFlash Mozilla Firefox Screenshot PlayStation 2 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Laptop Nintendo DS DVD IBM PC Xbox 360 N-Gage Memory Stick PlayStation Portable PNG Telephone exchange Embedded system XD-Picture Card Computer hardware AlphaSmart TRS-80 Color Computer Sound Blaster Sound card TeX TRS-80 Warez PowerBook Photography Game Boy Nintendo GameCube Copy protection Spyware Flash memory Digital rights management Nintendo Revolution NeXT ITunes Hard disk Computer forensics Timeline of computing 1990-forward File Allocation Table Computer bus Tungsten Handheld Danger Hiptop System/36 Sega Saturn Macromedia Flash Read-only memory Gmail Modem Microsoft Windows Konica Minolta MAME Sega Dreamcast Amiga Nintendo Entertainment System Adobe Photoshop USB mass storage device class IBook Opera (web browser) Multifunction printer Mach kernel Redundant array of independent disks Apple IIGS

sony camera memory card compatible with sont laptops hi i have a sony ericsson phone and one of the main reasons i got it was because i could insert the memory card directly into my sony vaio laptop meaning i can swap images and music easily from laptop to phone and vice versa i am now considering a new camera and wondered if sony cameras had this same feature would the memory card from a sony camera insert directly into my laptop many thanks grr stupid typing evidently the question should read 'sony laptops' that counts on the card slot if it uses the memory stick format you'll get an adapter if your camera uses the memory stick duo like mine i have a dsc t sony does make some really great cameras i've never been a fan of most of their other electronics excpet ps but their camera division does a great job  CompactFlash Memory card Memory Stick Secure Digital card PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable Digital photography Bluetooth Floppy disk Sony Nintendo DS PlayStation 3 Walkman Universal Serial Bus Flash memory IPod Apple Macintosh Multimedia Card SmartMedia VAIO IBM PC compatible PowerBook Hard disk PC Engine Surveillance Personal computer Photography Computer Sega Dreamcast Sega Saturn Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB XD-Picture Card Game Boy ATI Technologies Closed-circuit television PlayStation (original) USB flash drive Television Sony Computer Entertainment Sound Blaster Microdrive Xbox Nintendo GameCube Handheld game console Nintendo 64 Camera Nintendo Entertainment System File Allocation Table Musical Instrument Digital Interface Nintendo Camcorder Sony Ericsson K750i Punch card IBM PC Tungsten Handheld View camera RISC Smartphone Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Personal digital assistant Resident Evil 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Kraftwerk Sony Ericsson P900 Mobile phone Copy protection Graphics card PC card Windows XP Mac OS X Toshiba Nintendo Revolution Final Fantasy (video game) AmigaOS Sony Ericsson T610 N-Gage Konica Minolta Compact audio cassette Read-only memory Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital audio player Windows Vista Camera phone FireWire PCI Express Blu-ray Disc Octopus card Atari ST Pok__mon (video games) IBook DualDisc Automatic teller machine Verizon Wireless Linux kernel Slot machine

i need help finding a digital slr camera with good zoom i am looking to buy a digital slr camera the problem is i want to keep the costs fairly low prefer under but want a good brand and a good zoom i want to use it primarily for sports photography including baseball games where i will be sitting in the stands probably about ft from the dugout maybe feet from home plate and i would like to get good pictures of batters and baserunners it will also be used a lot at hockey games so i would like a zoom that could cover a pretty good distance and get me close to the action is this possible with that kind of budget i am willing ot spend more only if that budget won't get my anything worthwhile thanks for your help look into a nikon d bundled with the lens this range should be good for the vantage point you have described you can get them for at b h photo and add a or gb card and come in well under your budget the d will give you a burst speed of frames per second this is not really a blazing rate but for the money you are not going to get fps that really serious sports cameras provide the good news is that nikon claims you can take an unlimited number of frames as the buffer will be able to dump to the card faster than you can load it up with images be sure to get a decent speed card though i'd get a sandisk extreme iii or lexar professional x and i'd get at least gb if you plan on doing a lot of burst mode shooting edit fhotoace has suggested a longer lens since he makes his living doing this please give his answer all due consideration i just thought you were within reasonably close range as if you were not in a major league ball park and the equiv would be adequate your budget is actually my main consideration and you'll have to do the best you can with what you can afford i have a lens that would be great but there are two problems one it seems that you can only buy the d with a lens and not the body alone so you have to choose the best for your needs two if you wanted to add the lens to the basic kit even if you went for the mid level non vr lens it would add to your cost combine this with the cheaper kit and you'd spend closer to by the time you bought a decent card if you can do this it's worth considering i think you might try the for one season and save your money for an additional lens so you can get the vr lens a real help with those longer focal lengths for more like end of edit here's my stock recommendation for the d there is some duplication here with the material above that i wrote specifically for you so just skip any parts that sound familiar nikon d the nikon d is a great little camera very easy to use and quite reasonably priced it has a few consumer friendly totally automatic modes that make it very easy to use including a child photo mode but still offers total photographic control when you are ready to take charge it will get you in the nikon family which is a great place to be if you buy accessories and lenses you will be able to use everything on any nikon that you might upgrade to later on check out nikon's picturetown promotion where they handed out d 's in georgetown sc http www stunningnikon com picturetown here are a few reviews in case you have not read them yet be sure to note that they are several pages long and some of the reviews also have some sample images that you can look at http www dpreview com reviews nikond http www steves digicams com reviews nikon d html http www popphoto com cameras camera test nikon d html http www kenrockwell com nikon d d recommendations htm i hate to see people slam the camera because it can't autofocus with older nikon lenses it is true that there is a slight problem with older nikon lenses not autofocusing on the d but if you do not own a bag full of older lenses it is not going to be a problem it is barely a problem anyhow if you check www nikonusa com for af s lenses which are all compatible with the d you will find lenses including vr vibration reduction lenses and one true macro lens with vr there are another plus lenses in the current catalog that provide all functions except autofocus as well as many possibly dozens out of print lenses that will work just as well in addition although these lens will not autofocus most of them will still give focus confirmation from the d manual if the lens has a maximum aperture of f of faster the viewfinder focus indicator can be used to confirm whether the portion of the subject in the selected focus area is in focus after positioning the subject in the active focus area press the shutter release button halfway and rotate the lens focusing ring until the in focus indicator is displayed see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses or see http www nikonians org cgi bin dcforum dcboard cgi az read count om forum dcforumid for even more the d only has autofocus zones arranged horizontally at the center o'clock and o'clock positions this might be considered a limitation but realistically most people will find this perfectly adequate especially if you are moving up from a point and shoot with only a center zone there is no status lcd on top of the camera but nikon chose to use the rear lcd for this information this is actually a nice move as the display is bigger than the top display and you aren't using the read lcd for anything before you take the picture anyway this is not a step backwards and it actually makes sense to me you can get the d with the kit lens at b h photo available through yahoo shopping or at for june add a lexar platinum x speed card for or gb for or get the d with lens and gb lexar card for this is a decent lens and it is very versatile you will find it suitable for pretty much anything you want to do other than really long telephoto shots it will let you explore the range of focal lengths to decide where to start filling in your lens collection if you don't want to buy any more lenses this one will carry you through pretty much everything b h also have used d 's with the lens from  Film Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Laserdisc Camera

aperature f number f stop question i have a high end sony digital p s camera that goes from f to f i'm getting ready to make the switch to digital slr but as i'm looking at lenses i'm concerned that most only go as small as f i use the smallest size f quite a bit such as taking shots of moving water with a slow shutter during the day light in fact there have been plenty of times when i really wished i could make the aperture even smaller is this something i'm going to have to give up if i go to slr i'll check out antoni's answer in the other section but sinec he copped a plea i'll answer you here in hopes of getting points haha when you see a zoom lens described as f that means that the largest aperture at the wide angle end of the lens if f and the largest aperture at the telephoto end of the lens if f this is because the aperture is a ratio of the lens diameter to the focal length it's not as simplistic as this but the same size opening for one focal length is going to produce a smaller f stop value larger number for a longer focal length if this was not a zoom lens a mm lens set to a mm diameter aperture would be at f a mm lens set to a mm diameter aperture would be at f zooms are not so straightforward as this because of the shifting lens elements and things i don't even understand i'll have to try to learn some more about this stuff when they are talking about zoom lenses they use the term effective diameter and i don't know enough about optics to explain that term as pjgoros says the minimum aperture is going to be more like f in fact i see that the nikon zoom super wide angle nikkor mm f g ed af s dx zoom nikkor autofocus lens is more accurately described as an f lens get it at the wider angle lens the ratio is from f to f at the tele end the ratio is from f to f  Aperture Contax F-number Zoom lens Eyepiece Single-lens reflex camera Photography Canon EF lens mount Cinematography Konica Minolta Aberration in optical systems Pinhole camera Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Macro photography Reflecting telescope Movie projector Diffraction Digital camera back Shutter speed Nikon FM2 Rangefinder camera Binoculars Schneider Kreuznach Antenna (radio) Nikon FA Canon EOS Canon T90 Camera Lens (optics) Zeiss Point and shoot camera Stage lighting Terminal ballistics Angular resolution Stereoscopy Camcorder Synthetic aperture radar Nikon FE Floppy disk Radar Pentax Canon FD Optical telescope Nikon FE2 Motion picture terminology Nikon FM Film speed 35 mm film Panavision Parallax Confocal laser scanning microscopy Clementine mission Enlarger Wood Widescreen Fisheye lens Four Thirds System IMAX Eye DVD Laser Internal ballistics Lighting Olympus (company) Street photography Headlight Speed of light Magnification Optical fiber Cinerama Drill bit Shotgun Modem Amateur astronomy Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Aspect ratio (image) 70 mm film Exposure (photography) Autostereogram Television Astronomical seeing Shutter (photography) Schmidt camera Nikon D70 Bloodstain pattern analysis

can canon lenses be used on both digital and mm cameras i have a canon rebel xti and have some really nice lenses and im planning on buying just the regular canon rebel t but im curious if the lenses i already have will work on the mm help me out what was answered is true but totally inclusive if you are buying non canon lenses there are a lot of lenses that are designed for digital only by that they mean that they are designed for aps c sized sensors only your xti is an aps c camera while you could still fit the lens on a film camera or canon's full frame cameras canon d and the d mark i and ii you'll get extreme vignetting around the edges so yes if you stick with canon brand lenses with the ef mount you'll have no problems using those lenses on all ef mount cameras but if you go off brand you'll have to be careful to check if the lenses are made specifically for aps c sized sensors for example on the following website you'll see on the right hand column that there are a bunch of lens under the category dc lenses for digital slr camera click on any of those lenses and the first thing it says is that the lens is purposely made for dslr's with aps c sized sensors http www sigmaphoto com lenses lenses all asp just about every major off brand has these specialized lenses for aps c cameras these lenses also tend to be cheaper than lenses that can be used on all ef mount cameras because they don't have to project that large of an image onto the sensor since the sensor is smaller than a full frame sensor mm  Digital photography View camera Canon EOS Full frame digital SLR Advanced Photo System Leica Konica Minolta Nikon Corporation Photographic lens Digital camera back Macro photography Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera Panavision Camera Movie projector Canon EF lens mount Contax Digital cinematography Photography Panoramic photography Charge-coupled device Canon T90 IMAX Canon EOS-300D Vignetting Four Thirds System Binoculars Contact lens Rangefinder camera Cinematography Depth of field Telescope Reflecting telescope Medium format Widescreen Schneider Kreuznach Floppy disk Eyepiece Olympus (company) Pinhole camera Computer Shutter speed Lighting Parallax Canon FD Aspect ratio (image) Photograph Aperture 35 mm film Bluetooth Nikon FM2 Glasses Geographic information system Canon EOS-20Da Digital cinema Digital video Galileo spacecraft Photographic film Zoom lens Motion capture Violin Secure Digital card Computer vision Nuclear weapon design MS-06 Zaku II Pentax Cosina Nikon FA Film speed Enlarger Disposable camera Traffic light Point and shoot camera Film Stereoscopy Headlight Star Destroyer Zeiss Cinerama Sensor Motion picture terminology Professional video camera Lens (optics) 135 film Pixel Traditional animation Nikon FE2 Clementine mission Lunar Orbiter program Hubble Space Telescope

help with camera flash everytime i use my flash its so harsh and it makes the picture look bad but if i don't use the flash the pictures are too dark or too blury and i turn on all the lights i can find and i don't have a tripod how can i fix this problem is there a way i can have the flash half on i have a canon powershot a here is a example of what i mean cat with flash http www flickr com photos carrierox ever cat without flash http www flickr com photos carrierox ever flower without flash http www flickr com photos carrierox ever flower with flash http www flickr com photos carrierox ever see what i mean in the with flash pictures the flash is really harsh and in the without flash pictures they are either too dark even with all lights on or blury put some 'frosted' tape not clear over the flash and it will diffuse the intensity of the flash if you had an external flash i'd recommend you tilt it but that's not an option with your camera for those pictures taken without flash set the camera's iso to a higher level that will increase it's sensitivity to light and also allow the camera to snap the picture more quickly higher shutter speed and thus cut down on camera movement of course be sure you are steady and press gently down on the shutterbutton not smashing it another hint would be to set your exposure a bit to allow for the close image here's a link to your manual in case you lost it http alpha u c wss com inc applservlet sv wwuca you're right the more room light you can turn on the better hope this is helpful p s adorable cat but sssssshhhhh my can would be jealous if he heard me say that  Digital photography Photography View camera Canon T90 Leica Prank flash Single-lens reflex camera Camera London Flickr F-number HyperText Transfer Protocol Camcorder Street photography Canon PowerShot G Photographic film Shutter speed Butterfly Floppy disk Film speed Mouse (computing) Movie projector Secure Digital card Stereoscopy Panoramic photography Konica Minolta Canon EOS Road-rule enforcement camera Mars Exploration Rover World Wide Web Automatic number plate recognition Bicycle lighting Macro photography Charge-coupled device Warez Drill bit Traffic light Red-eye effect Exposure (photography) Rafflesia Saturniidae Aurora (astronomy) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Digital camera Nikon FA Welding M16 (rifle) Cinematography Domain Name System Digital single-lens reflex cameras Remora Nikon FE2 Nikon FM2 Pinhole camera Cat Uniform Resource Locator Shutter (photography) Closed-circuit television USS Tunny (SS-282) Violin Poker jargon SX-70 Helicopter Internet phenomenon Time-lapse IMAX Goatse.cx Phishing Sutro Tower Motion capture PlayStation Portable Explosive material Wget USB flash drive Canon EOS-300D Photographic lens Nikon FE Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Google Maps B3ta Eye Equine conformation Dither Galileo spacecraft Mozilla Firefox Files-11 Apollo 11 The Ashlee Simpson Show EIA-708 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Screw

affordable telephoto lens for canon xti i have the canon rebel xti with a mm lens i want something with a little more range but i don't want to spend more than any suggestions well you're not giving yourself a lot of leeway with a cap the next step up in the telephoto lens world from mm is mm and you won't find one from canon or a rd party at a low price a few options find a really cheap mm or more mirror lens these usually have a fixed aperture of f and they're not going to give you great results but it's mm and it's cheap get a tele extender x or x you can't use the canon or sigma brands as they are not made for the but there are cheap rd party brands like kenko that as far as i know will work on that lens stretching your mm to mm mm but note that a tele extender will also decrease your maximum aperture by x x as well and degrade your image quality especially a kenko get a compact superzoom for or less more check out some of the x x superzoom cameras which give you a minimum mm focal length equivalent of mm mm and more for a few bucks more those cameras accept tele extenders as well pushing the maximum zoom to mm and more mind you these compacts don't give you quite the same image results as a dslr with a good telephoto lens but it might still be better than the kenko option since those cheap tele extenders really degrade the optical quality of the lens they're attached to good luck edit george just noticed we're on the same wavelength except for specifically recommending canon brand extenders as far as i know they do not work on the which is too bad since it would probably be the best solution  Photographic lens Digital photography Leica Eyepiece Digital single-lens reflex cameras Zoom lens Aperture Macro photography Cinematography Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Binoculars Photography Telescope Zeiss Reflecting telescope Rangefinder camera Canon EF lens mount Aberration in optical systems Stage lighting Schneider Kreuznach Pinhole camera Camera Lens (optics) Optical telescope Canon T90 Depth of field Nikon Corporation Anamorphic widescreen DVD F-number Diffraction Canon FD Amateur astronomy Bicycle lighting Confocal laser scanning microscopy Panoramic photography Digital camera Bokeh Microscope Mirror Four Thirds System Fisheye lens Redundant array of independent disks Olympus (company) Clementine mission Microscopy Gamma ray burst Headlight History of telescopes Shutter speed Optical coating Normal distribution Camcorder Synthetic aperture radar Hash table Nikon FM2 Speed limit Holography Optical fiber Hubble Space Telescope Explosive material Myopia Astronomical seeing Canon T70 Digital cinematography Monochromator Widescreen Canon EOS-300D Poker jargon Pentax Ethernet Street photography 35 mm film Nikon FE2 Automatic number plate recognition Cosina Laserdisc UK Singles Chart Movie projector Betting (poker) Cassini-Huygens Oscilloscope Point and shoot camera DualDisc Eye Gramophone record Ultraviolet Schmidt camera M16 (rifle)

batteries in the us and uk for digital cameras i'm moving to the uk next month and i want to bring my digital camera from the us i usually use rechargeable aa batteries and can't find any info on whether aa batteries are used in the uk is there some voltage difference i should be aware of so just to clarify are aa batteries readily available in the uk no there isn't aa cells no matter where they are used are still aa cells but the charger on the other hand must be europe compliant in england the voltage is not and therefore you may need a travel adapter or a compliant charger to charge yoru batteries ni mh batteries are in my oppinion the best and cheapest batteries for use in cameras because they fit well with a digital cameras energy needs and they don't suffer from any memory effects many cameras also support cr lithiums which are great long lasting batteries but for the cost are only really a good idea if you need to use the camera all day and for one day  Nickel metal hydride Nickel-cadmium battery Lithium ion polymer battery Lithium ion battery Volt Bicycle lighting PlayStation Portable Battery electric vehicle IPod Digital photography Memory effect Oscilloscope Action potential Lead-acid battery Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Hybrid vehicle Ford Ranger EV Solar car Hydrogen economy Multimedia Card Toyota Prius FireWire Lithium Nintendo 64 Handspring Vacuum tube CMOS Apple Newton Flash memory Solar cell Electromotive force Digital camera Game Boy Secure Digital card View camera Circuit design Torpedo Uninterruptible power supply Game Boy Advance SP Radiation hardening Canon T90 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Camcorder Handheld game console Electricity Mars Exploration Rover Electric boat Bluetooth Tungsten Handheld Incandescent light bulb Fuel cell Laptop Solar panel Television Diode Mobile phone Lightsaber Green Lantern Corps Transformer IBM PC compatible MOSFET Hubble Space Telescope Digital single-lens reflex cameras Electrochemical potential ATI Technologies Galileo spacecraft Electrophysiology Power supply Cosmic Era technology Creative Zen Internal ballistics Membrane potential Loudspeaker USB flash drive Second Battle of the Atlantic Central processing unit Automobile Renewable energy SmartMedia Tank Weapons of Star Trek Geographic information system Nintendo DS Leica Computer Nintendo Game Boy Advance Read-only memory CPU design Sharp Zaurus London Congestion Charge Road-rule enforcement camera STS-87 Non-volatile memory Windmill Voltage source Internal combustion engine

what is the difference between a canon powershot s is and s is is it worth the money difference what are the improvements as tom noted the upgrade from s to s is hardly worth it aside from a slightly bigger lcd higher iso sensitivity hot shoe and a few other minor enhancements the jump from mp to mp resolution degrades image quality for small sensor superzooms like the s series and the literally hundreds of other compact cams out there with these tiny sensors you really shouldn't be looking for anything more than about mp if you value image quality the s at mp was is just right and it's cheaper too  Digital photography Canon PowerShot G Digital single-lens reflex cameras Liquid crystal display Digital camera Pixel Audiophile Floppy disk Gramophone record Binoculars Sensor Television Digital cinematography Fuel injection Galactic Civilizations PowerBook DVD Final Fantasy (video game) Photography Image scanner Game Boy Redundant array of independent disks JPEG 2000 Tungsten Handheld Thermographic camera Game Boy Advance Incandescent light bulb MP3 Oscilloscope Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Electronic organ Charge-coupled device Laserdisc Camcorder Photographic lens Advanced Audio Coding Gamut Konica Minolta Digital cinema Photographic film Bluetooth Japanese toilet Acorn Archimedes Solar cell Microscopy MS-06 Zaku II Plastic Computer printer 8 mm video format Carburetor Stereoscopy Clarinet Motion capture Plasma display Foveon X3 sensor Boeing 737 Seismometer STS-82 Film speed Macro photography E85 Inflation Ford Mondeo Solar power Laptop High-definition television Mazda Miata Phonograph Violin Psychoacoustics Glucokinase Night vision Digital camera back Analog sound vs. digital sound Windows XP Handheld game console Galileo spacecraft IBook Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem AIM-9 Sidewinder NTSC Radeon Hubble Space Telescope Double bass Pentium 4 Tank Compact audio cassette Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Hash table Canon EOS-300D Dodge Neon Nintendo United States dollar MIM-23 Hawk ELO rating system GM LT engine Color Video Full frame digital SLR Armored Core

showing pictures and video so i just got back from a trip to texas and i want to show people all the pictures i took there about what is the best way that i could show these preferably i would like them to be displayed on my tv but i don't have any cables to connect my computer to the tv i've tried burning cd's and putting them into my dvd player but it won't show the video's that i have thanks a lot oh yes and ive tried picasa and for some reason it always fails on the nd disk the reason why no one has answered is probably because you're asking for a lot i know it doesn't sound like it but it is if you want the simplest solution with the least amount of work go buy an mp mp player that is able to display both videos and pictures one that has a cable that goes to the tv of course there are quite a few that can do this trick but none that are all that cheap for example i have a creative zen vision w which i can show pictures and videos on it's large widescreen but i also have the cables to play it on my tv i would not recommend video ipods however since they are very limited in what format the videos have to be in so you'll be back to square one where you're gonna have to figure out how to convert your videos over to the correct ipod format pain in the behind just do a search on how many times this question is asked in yahoo answers going back to my creative zen vision w it'll practically play every format out there so i have no problems going straight from memory card to the player in fact this particular model has a compact flash memory card slot on the device that allows you to load pics and videos directly to the device no computer needed if your camera doesn't use cf cards you can buy cf adapters on ebay for really cheap but like i said that's an expensive solution unfortunately if you don't want to spend a lot of time with software and converting that's what you're stuck with  IPod Floppy disk Computer ITunes PlayStation 2 Atari 8-bit family Laserdisc IMac Computer and video games USB flash drive Nintendo GameCube Walkman Secure Digital card Digital audio player PlayStation 3 Gramophone record Digital rights management Xbox Sega Dreamcast High-definition television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Computer DVD Redundant array of independent disks CompactFlash ZX Spectrum Stereoscopy Personal computer Computer hardware Sound card Oscilloscope Apple Macintosh Embedded system FireWire Hard disk IBM PC Game Boy Advance Modem AmigaOS Atari ST Copy protection Ethernet Screenshot Surveillance Slot machine Anamorphic widescreen Wheel of Fortune Mouse (computing) Nintendo DS Apple II family Creative Nomad Amstrad CPC Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista Flash memory Compact disc Photography Enterprise content management MiniDisc Sound Blaster System/36 IBM PC compatible Digital video recorder ITunes Music Store Theory of conduct Karaoke Camcorder RGB color model Podcasting NTSC Acorn Electron Universal Serial Bus Microdrive Sega Saturn Sony Audiophile Extreme Programming Digital cinematography Compact audio cassette IPod nano Apple IIGS IPod shuffle Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Computer bus Vorbis

mb micro sd card problems i have a mb micro sd card i am having problems with it i like to take videos with it and a couple of days ago i was able to take up to almost min of videos when the card was empty now i can only take min with the card empty what happened and is it fixable okay i just reformatted it in my camera but how do i do it on my computer i have an apple powerbook g i looked at can't find where to do it your camera should have an option to format the card back to it's original state i've heard of several bugs where a camera will unlink a large file that is you won't be able to access it anymore but it never actually deletes the data or bugs out and only deletes a small portion of it irregardless try formatting the card first in the camera itself and then in windows if the problem persists this process varies by camera for example format card on my camera is on the same menu as delete modify picture to do it under windows right click on the camera or device in my computer and select format leave the default options alone because the camera will only force a format the first time you try to use it anyway since cameras and windows don't usually use the same file system  Mouse (computing) ITunes Screenshot File Allocation Table Floppy disk Computer Surveillance Common Unix Printing System Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Windows Windows XP System 7 (Macintosh) Mac OS X v10.4 Macromedia Flash Digital photography Java programming language Bluetooth Hard disk Apple Macintosh Virtual memory System/36 Windows 2000 WordStar HyperCard MDAC E-mail The Sims 2 Universal Serial Bus Secure Digital card Steam (content delivery) Hello world program PowerBook DVD Punch card Mozilla Firefox Debugging IBM PC compatible USB flash drive File format Library (computer science) Personal computer Commodore 64 HTTP cookie Spyware Apple II family Anti-virus software Movie projector USB mass storage device class File system Gmail Flash memory Windows 3.x History of Microsoft Windows ITunes Music Store Mac OS X Game Boy Visual Basic Control Panel (Windows) System/34 Device driver Linked list History of the graphical user interface Unicode Mozilla Application Suite Pixel SonicStage Memory Stick H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Mac OS history Digital rights management Mach kernel Atari ST AppleScript DirectShow AirPort ALGOL 68 PC Engine Btrieve SAS System Apple typography Memory card Oscilloscope Micro Channel architecture PlayStation Portable IMac

what's the best digital camera for getting rid of blur when i take low to moderate light pictures without flash i end up with a blurred photo even though i stand still hold my breath and snap the picture i like the natural look of light without flash but can't seem to get rid of this problem my digital camera is x optical zoom and x digital i don't blow my pictures up to poster size so i don't need a ton of megapixels hi it is quite possible you are suffering from a very low shutter speed such that no amount of stillness unless you use a tripod will work see if your camera has an iso setting a higher iso number usually one step below the max will increase light sensitivity and allow a faster shutter and still get an image which is not all black if you go to the max highest numeric value then the image is usually becoming grainy this number is similar to mm film asa also see suggestions on this website http www sportsflashtech com look at the setup and gym tab ultimately a camera without a good lens and without a very light sensitive sensor will not get a good photo for you in anything other than full sunlight your interests may send you to look at an slr camera a huge step up in image quality and the shutter response time is no longer so slow good luck rich  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Film speed Single-lens reflex camera Photography Konica Minolta View camera Photographic film Movie projector Digital camera Exposure (photography) Stereoscopy Street photography Aperture Photographic lens F-number Camcorder Pixel Contax Camera Panoramic photography Cinematography Amateur astronomy Canon T90 Anamorphic widescreen Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Rangefinder camera Macro photography Nikon Corporation Automatic number plate recognition Time-lapse Nikon FM2 Shutter (photography) Nikon FE2 Floppy disk Charge-coupled device Depth of field Canon EOS Persistence of vision Enlarger Nikon FA Bluetooth Widescreen Advanced Photo System Eye Digital video Galileo spacecraft Motion capture Digital cinematography Bullet time Secure Digital card Road-rule enforcement camera Medium format Red-eye effect Canon EF lens mount IMAX DV 8 mm video format Gamma ray burst Oscilloscope Explosive material Motion picture terminology Digital Four Thirds System Panavision Stage lighting Pinhole camera Drill bit 3D computer graphics Technicolor Shutter angle Binoculars Sun Apollo moon landing hoax accusations USB flash drive Computer Canon EOS-300D Image file formats International Organization for Standardization Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Photograph Color blindness Aurora (astronomy) Sensor

im having problems with my casio exilim it started yesterday i turned it on but it kept saying card error now i dont knw whats wrong wit it i take off the battery the memory card put them back in and nothing it still saids that i charge the battery but noo its not that does anyone knw what going on with my camera if you remove the memory card does it still display the message if not then it's because your memory card has gone bad it's rare but it does happen being that exilims take sd cards they are super inexpensive to replace search online or even at your local electronics store if you don't mind paying a little extra you can find a gb card online for like but if you remove the memory card only and it still displays that message then something is wrong with the camera itself and you'll have to send it in for service  Nintendo DS Digital photography Oscilloscope Surveillance Calculator Nintendo GameCube IPod Objective-C Computer Automatic teller machine Computer and video games Computer virus Floppy disk E-mail Simple Mail Transfer Protocol E-mail spam Flash memory Cross site scripting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Smart card Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act IPAQ On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Spam (electronic) RFID Poker jargon Atari ST Internet fraud PC Engine Spyware Digital Credit card Nintendo 64 GSM services Teletext Nintendo Entertainment System Casio Nickel-cadmium battery Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Musical Instrument Digital Interface Game Boy Advance Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ebook Digital camera MSN Messenger Tungsten Handheld Steam (content delivery) PowerBook Pirate decryption Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ZX Spectrum Buffalo Bills Ethernet Atari 8-bit family Social rule MDAC 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Windows Vista Bluetooth Handheld game console Wi-Fi Linked list Password (video games) Bank fraud Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Enigma machine Redundant array of independent disks Steven Wright Yu-Gi-Oh!

nikon d auto focusing troubles i know that there are problems with the nikon d af but are there any good strategies to get around them the camera is borrowed from school with a sigma mm lens i have tried manual focus but it is very difficult without being able to use the focusing rings etc because the viewfinder does not have them i've had several d 's over the last few years and all hunted for focus points the way i overcame most problems was to try to focus on a strong contrast subject with well defined vertical lines and lock focus exposure by lightly holding the shutter release button down then recompose and shoot that should work i have since gotten rid of all of my d 's and shoot with a d x with the buffer and firmware upgrades the older d x with upgrades blows away most any other nikon body up to a d or d i also use a coolpix for back up with great results but it also suffers somewhat from focus hunting not to the extent of the d though what lens are you using a ed dx this is a soft lens unless it is the very newest production run of about or so  Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon T90 Canon EOS Konica Minolta Nikon FE Nikon FM2 Nikon FM Point and shoot camera Leica Nikon FE2 Single-lens reflex camera Photographic lens Movie projector Rangefinder camera Nikon FA Camera Panavision Canon EF lens mount Contax Digital camera Depth of field Nikon D70 Aperture Eye Archery Stereoscopy Canon T70 PlayStation 2 Panoramic photography Twin-lens reflex camera Strategic management Shutter speed Pentax Cinematography Canon FD IMAX Anamorphic widescreen Telescope Canon EOS-300D Street photography Parallax PlayStation Portable Canon Inc.

should i buy a dslr or a good rangefinder camera i have one main question and one secondary question i don't like slr's because they're too big have shutter vibration make loud sounds that distract people even animals for nature photos i'm looking into a higher end rangefinder range can anyone give me a reason why i should think otherwise i'm not all that impressed that when you aim an slr you see the exact parameters of your shot second question is do you think the large size of an slr makes people automatically think the camera must be better and take better photos than a smaller format camera i'm assuming by rangefinder you are talking about digital point and shoot p s like the canon g it has a classic rangefinder look and feel if i had a choice between the g or the xti for my main camera i would have to go with the g i think it goes without saying that the g is smaller and less obtrusive and will be more friendly to carry around and get less noticed than the dslr therefore i can use it in lots of situations people do act differently around the larger cameras i think people feel more self concious when they have a big telephoto zoom lens pointed right at them than say a small p s camera it's psychological and it is somewhat conditioned in people that they expect a photographer who uses a dslr will shoot a picture of them in a more critical way than if the photographer used a p s which is viewed as fun and informal you would use a dslr when you want the best image quality and a versatile camera for all lighting conditions for professionals they must have the best equipment for their work so they almost always use dslrs and not p s  Rangefinder camera Digital camera View camera Konica Minolta Photographic lens Nikon Corporation Photography Contax Macro photography Cinematography Medium format Street photography Binoculars Digital camera back Camera Canon EOS Panoramic photography Canon T90 Full frame digital SLR Nikon FM2 Advanced Photo System Canon EF lens mount Four Thirds System Anamorphic widescreen Schneider Kreuznach Photographic film Shutter speed IMAX Zoom lens Cinerama Camcorder Nikon FE Aperture Nikon FM Image file formats Widescreen Canon FD Olympus (company) Electronic journalism Digital cinematography Canon EOS-300D Floppy disk Amateur astronomy Twin-lens reflex camera Secure Digital card NTSC Road-rule enforcement camera Circle of confusion Autostereogram Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Photojournalism Pentax Traditional animation Digital cinema Determinism Wind turbine Charge-coupled device Cosina Photograph Nikon FA Reflecting telescope Sniper Nikon D70 Computer vision Surveillance Film Closed-circuit television Clarinet Henri Cartier-Bresson Panavision PNG Enlarger Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Astronomical seeing Computer Psychology Aberration in optical systems Canon Inc.

why do people have red eyes in flash photographs the light of the flash occurs too fast for the iris of the eye to close the pupil light is focused onto the blood rich retina at the back of the eye and the image of the illuminated retina is transmitted to the camera resulting in the red appearance of the eye on the photo this principle is used in fundoscopy an eye examination used to examine the retina by using an opthalmoscope wherein a positve ror or red reflex is a normal finding the effect is generally more pronounced in people with grey or blue eyes and in children this is because pale irises have less melanin in them and so allow more light to pass through to the retina children despite superficial appearances do not have larger pupils but their pupils are more reactive to light and are able to open to the fullest extent in low light conditions  Eye Eye color Pupil Albinism Eye examination Color Diabetic retinopathy Retina Sun Stereoscopy Nuclear explosion Melanin Visual system Night vision Uvea Single-lens reflex camera Fluorescein angiography Digital photography Macular degeneration Explosive material Glaucoma Cat Autostereogram RGB color model Digital camera Light Retinal detachment Traffic light View camera Floater Heterochromia Eye contact Iridology Binocular vision Sensation Welding Gamut Tocopherol Flash (comics) Eyepiece Cat coat genetics Entoptic phenomenon Perspective projection distortion Criticality accident Photographic lens Aberration in optical systems Human skin color Hair color Hypoglycemia Depth of field Light-emitting diode Technicolor Philosophy of perception Glasses Photography Red eye (medicine) Myopia Lighting Cosmic Era human enhancements Compound eye Hypertensive retinopathy Telescope Saccade Macro photography Contax Camera Lightning Shark Parallax Red dot sight Evidence of evolution Laser Hypertension Binoculars Lens (optics) Cytomegalovirus Crocodilia Rainbow Chlorpromazine Color temperature Eyeglass prescription X-ray Konica Minolta Opportunity rover Intraocular lens Stage lighting Biometrics Persistence of vision Stroke Visual perception Monochromat Optic nerve Sleep Speed of light Aurora (astronomy) Cinematography

how do you save pictures to a cd that are saved in olympus camedia master is there a way to save my pictures that i have saved in the camedia master program onto a disk can you do it through the program itself or is there a folder somewhere on my hard drive where the program saves my pictures if so where can i find this folder thanks you can use the backup option to create a folder that you then transfer that onto a cd the backup option allows you to select the group and album but not particular image files if you want to select particular pictures you will need to find where camedia has stored them on my computer they are stored in a directory structure starting at c documents and settings all users windows application data olympus camedia master but they might be somewhere else depending upon how you did your installation  Windows 2000 File system NTFS Backup Computer virus Partition (computing) System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista Windows registry Macintosh Finder Object Desktop ITunes AmigaOS Windows XP IPod Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk Knoppix File Allocation Table Computer Mac OS X Apple II family Disk image Bluetooth File format Macromedia Flash Computer file management Windows Explorer HFS Plus Enterprise content management Booting Disk cloning ZIP (file format) Linux Gmail Icon (computing) System 6 Screenshot System/36 Digital photography Computer forensics Files-11 PlayStation Portable MDAC Btrieve Windows Picture and Fax Viewer PNG Database management system Active Directory Emacs BASIC programming language Master Control Program Home directory Expert system Apple typography WordStar Computer file Forth programming language Stardock Oracle database Lotus Notes Mac OS X v10.4 Embedded system Group Policy Portable Document Format LiveCD Launchd Resource fork Hard disk Start Menu History of the graphical user interface MAME Windows Installer Computer storage BIOS Xcode Control Panel (Windows) Microsoft Windows Comparison of file systems Spatial file manager Early IBM disk storage Palm OS Uploading and downloading Atari 8-bit family Cue sheet .NET assemblies Computer security Secure Digital card Malware USB flash drive Spring operating system

what's a good first dslr i have to make a decision on my first dslr and i have the following options nikon d kit rs rs k grey around us canon d kit rs k us grey is better then d x for around the same price nikon d kit k better kit lens us canon d kit rs k around us year warranty or k us grey i am tempted to look at the d because whatever i have read about on the canon verses nikon game is the usability pricing and choice of lense where i have nothing to gain or less as i have no legacy cmos sensor in canon seems to have an edge but noise on d is a bit higher then d because of cramping more pixels on a similar physical sensor k for d sounds expensive for a first dslr considering one can get one at k us for a d any advice i believe canon rebel xti is called d elsewhere in the world i've used both nikons and canons the definite choice is canon i think it is a bargain for all the features self cleaning lens mp digic processor etc canon is the only camera company that manufactures its own image processing ic digic and i think it helps the camera works better with other components inside compared to other manufacturer's off the shelf lsi chips in case there is a problem it's easier to repair too one thing i strongly recommend is that if possible do not buy the all in one kit w starter lens you will definitely grow out of such standard lens as mm ef s f usm in about couple of weeks then you will have to spend money again and buy a better lens you should get the body itself without the lens and buy lens separately they are well worth it even for a beginner i don't think you should get l series red circle yet because they are very pricey good all around lens would be ef s mm f is usm which has image stabilizer make sure to get good filters for lens such as hoya around and canon hood you should also get the lcd screen protector film about it protects from scratches and cracks on your viewing screen one last recommendation is get the black colored body it just looks more expensive and cooler than grey one good luck  Nikon Corporation Leica Digital camera Pixel Atari 8-bit family Canon EOS-300D Canon EOS Photographic lens Canon T90 Camera Canon EF lens mount Sega Saturn PlayStation 2 Secure Digital card Liquid crystal display Laserdisc Digital camera back Charge-coupled device Television Hard disk Photographic film Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo 64 IBM PC compatible Overclocking DVD View camera Floppy disk Nintendo Entertainment System Single-lens reflex camera Mouse (computing) Light-emitting diode Movie projector Microeconomics Technicolor Nikon D70 Windows XP Macro photography Anamorphic widescreen Image scanner Oscilloscope IMac Nikon FE2 Camcorder Clementine mission IMAX Nikon FA Canon PowerShot G Nikon FM2 Galileo spacecraft Digital cinematography Sound Blaster Intellivision Machine vision Color PowerBook Xbox 360 ATI Technologies Photography Cinematography Hubble Space Telescope Amstrad CPC Widescreen NVIDIA Bluetooth MSX Panavision Game Boy Advance Nintendo Radeon Zire Handheld Gamut Divorce Medium format Airsoft Nikon FE Radio controlled airplane Central processing unit XML Computer vision Raw image format Game Boy E85 Laptop Rangefinder camera Copy protection Windows Vista Grey market

about canon powershot sd i have a problem with setting the battery status i can't see the battery status on the screen until it's low battery by the time it's low batt i only can take more pics how to set the battery status so that it will appear on the lcd screen thanks the sd doesn't have a battery status indicator it only has a low battery icon that shows up on the lcd because your camera's battery is quite small up to shots when fully charged the only way to make sure you don't run out of power other than buying a spare battery is to make sure you always charge the battery before you intend to use the camera limiting the use of the flash zoom and movies will help to conserve battery power and turning off the lcd monitor between shots also helps you don't have a viewfinder to compose your photos with so you have to use the lcd this is a downside because the lcd consumes most of the battery power the sd would have been the better camera in this instance because it does have a viewfinder anyway just charge your battery regularly good luck  Digital photography Liquid crystal display Canon T90 Laptop Digital single-lens reflex cameras Windows XP Leica Photography Oscilloscope Konica Minolta Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Contax Danger Hiptop Universal Serial Bus Movie projector Canon PowerShot G IMac Handheld game console Ford Ranger EV Steadicam PowerBook Stereoscopy Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster IBM PC compatible Nikon FA Embedded system Television Liquid crystal display television Organic light-emitting diode Mouse (computing) Canon EOS PlayStation Portable TFT LCD Tungsten Handheld Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Watch Single-lens reflex camera Cathode ray tube Digital camera Digital cinematography IPod Thermostat Memory effect Nickel-cadmium battery Light-emitting diode Toyota Prius Energy development Sega Saturn IPod nano Vacuum tube Closed-circuit television Xbox 360 Canon T70 ThinkPad Screenshot Nintendo DS Apple Computer Battery electric vehicle Battery (electricity) Lead-acid battery Pixel Gameking Nikon FM2 Gamut Nikon FE PIC microcontroller Gross domestic product Creative Zen Archos Sharp Zaurus Plasma display Nikon FM AlphaSmart Nikon FE2 Cheating in Counter-Strike Rangefinder camera View camera Binoculars Bluetooth Lithium ion battery Surveillance Hybrid Synergy Drive WNEP-TV Microvision Computer display Color Wind turbine Bicycle lighting Thermal power station Macintosh Portable MIM-23 Hawk Inspector Gadget Bulk vending Wind power USS Terry (DD-513) Road-rule enforcement camera Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Prank flash

how can i find the claim number for my camera i'm sending my camera in to be fixed and i have to fill out a paper and it says claim number and i can't find it anywhere since you didn't give very much information this answer is just a guess most manufacturers and even retailers require you to call them up before you send back your equipment to be fixed that way they'll know what to do with it once they receive it the claim number that it's asking for is probably the number that the customer service rep gives you to mark on the paperwork and possibly the packaging itself so that once it gets to the manufacturer they'll know what department to send the camera to so if you haven't contacted the manufacturer and you're trying to get them to fix it call them if you don't and just send it they'll probably just send it back with a nice letter that tells you to call them first  Retailer Telephone exchange GSM services Morse Code Internet fraud Bluetooth Plame affair United States Postal Service FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Best Buy Data retention Jumpstart 3rd Grade Road-rule enforcement camera Musical Instrument Digital Interface IP Multimedia Subsystem Joseph C.

what is the difference between a normal sd memory card and a ultra sd memory card i want to buy a new memory card for my camera kodak z i just use it to take pictures of my kids and family functions do i really need an ultra memory card or will a normal one do just fine i have a normal one now and it works just fine but i didnt know if i get a gb if it would change it can make a difference ultra ii have a faster write speed than a normal kingston why does this matter we are now at a point were most of our point and shoot cameras will out preform traditional sd cards you would notice a difference when using the burst mode or movie mode you may see a busy message on the camera the reason is that most new digital cameras can capture images faster than memory cards can save this is also why you will notice that the price of memory has came down so much because most cameras they will be slowed down the memory if you are a person who will never ever use a burst mode or movie mode there is no benefit otherwise it will give you longer movie recording and will keep up to burst mode of your camera  Digital photography Digital camera Photography Panoramic photography IBM PC compatible View camera Cinematography Secure Digital card Overclocking Technicolor Hard disk CPU design Motion capture Computer Movie projector Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camcorder Sprite (computer graphics) Bluetooth 8 mm video format Stereoscopy Memory Stick 3dfx Dynamic random access memory Nintendo 64 Radeon RISC USB flash drive PlayStation 3 Panavision XD-Picture Card Digital cinema Atari 8-bit family Redundant array of independent disks PlayStation Portable Yu-Gi-Oh!

got my disposable camera wet pix ok my mom told me it was waterproof but i dont think it was becasue when we took it to the beach today and got it wet it still took pictures but the flash didnt work and water was dripping out of it i really hope they come out because the pictures will be hilarious underwater disposables usually don't have a flash so i'm guessing that yours was not a waterproof camera if the camera got soaked then the film is wet as well no lab will run wet film because the emulsion will flake off in the processor and make a mess causing the lab to dump and remix chemistry an expensive and time consuming procedure be sure to mention when you take it in for processing that it may be wet inside  Camera Photography Disposable camera Underwater photography Digital photography Technicolor Photographic film Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Plastic Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind RISC Film Town gas Laboratory IA-64 Paint Acorn Computers Anamorphic widescreen Underwater welding Opportunity rover Movie projector Widescreen Seabird The Ashlee Simpson Show Xbox 360 Internal ballistics Game Boy Thermal power station Collateral (film) Cinematography Cisco PIX Nickel-cadmium battery Camcorder Energy development Point and shoot camera Cookware and bakeware Canon EOS Scuba set Computer animation Tokusatsu Lightning Dry cleaning Diving suit Carnivorous plant Digital camera Television Francis Crick Welding Hay CDC 6600 MAME Spirit rover Shrek 2 Dairy Supercomputer The Curse of Fenric Diaper Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mercury 4 Drowning Sound card Single-lens reflex camera Wet and messy fetishism Sodium hydroxide Raw food diet Nintendo Revolution Methamphetamine Aluminium Sonar Caving Rebreather Pebble bed reactor Reservoir Dogs Irrigation Bullet time Fire extinguisher Sega Saturn Fluorescent lamp View camera Panoramic photography Battery (electricity) Surrealist techniques Screenshot Hilary Duff Disc jockey Color temperature CPU design Smallpox Emulator Sand art and play Late Night with Conan O'Brien Towel Burroughs B5000 Titanium Road-rule enforcement camera 135 film Swamp cooler Konica Minolta Casablanca (film) Shaggy dog story

lenses for pentax k d hello all my first time posting i'm all set to buy the pentax k d i'm just getting started with photography and wanted a camera that i could grow with my question is concerning lenses i will purchase it with the mm but i would like a lense to do portraits and one for everyday use i have a dog that moves a lot and would like to be able to catch him any links that can help me understand the difference between the lenses would be greatly appreciated also would appreciate any links to where i can get good deals on the lenses thanks ahead for your help don't buy any extra lenses yet the lens is the most commonly used kit lens because it is the most useful for most people you will have no problem catching your dog as he jumps around as this is a function of the shutter speed if you can't get a fast enough shutter speed probably will do fine just increase the iso until you can i'm sure you won't get up into the danger zone if you are outdoors there will always be enough light if you are indoors you will probably be using flash for portraits the classic range on a mm camera is to mm the mm end of your lens will perform as if it was an mm lens and this is right there in the portrait zone this doesn't mean that you must use the mm setting for all of your portraits as many people like to go outside the classic range one of our pros always mentions that he makes his living with his lens the pentax lens cupboard is surprisingly bare i must say you might consider a sigma zoom super wide angle mm f dc aspherical if lens for pentax digital slr which sells for at b h photo the nikon lens is constantly out of stock because this is such a versitile and useful range this is one of sigma's red line series which is supposed to be their pro level instead of the you might consider an upgrade to the pentax zoom wide angle telephoto da mm f ed al autofocus lens for digital camera which sounds like a nice lens based on the one review posted on b h or if you have just inherited some money the upcoming pentax zoom super wide telephoto smcp da mm f ed al if sdm autofocus lens for digital slr should be killer i use the nikon f lens and this one should be comparable the fixed maximum aperture of f should be fast enough to catch pretty much anything yeah i was going to mention that as a useful range as my wife has the vr for her camera i'm not versed in pentax lenses any more so i am not really the expert here if you get answers from pentaxian's like clavestone they will know more about the lens quality than i do i can only read reviews and pass along the information  Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Rangefinder camera Nikon FM2 Nikon FA Digital camera Zoom lens Cinematography Pentax Canon EF lens mount Camera Aperture Digital camera back Movie projector Floppy disk Point and shoot camera Panoramic photography Macro photography Nikon FE2 Shutter speed Stereoscopy DVD Nikon FE Film Nikon FM F-number Canon EOS-300D Schneider Kreuznach Street photography Film speed Anamorphic widescreen Automatic number plate recognition Volleyball IMAX Glasses Nikon D70 Stage lighting Lens (optics) Camcorder Red-eye effect Exposure (photography) Full frame digital SLR Dog agility Photographic film Television Autofocus Cosina Pinhole camera Diffraction Shutter (photography) Enlarger Widescreen Aberration in optical systems Closed-circuit television Depth of field Hard disk Drag racing Advanced Photo System CPU cache Polarization GunBound Eyepiece Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Railway signal Equine conformation Poker jargon Medium format Surveillance Eye Canon PowerShot G Cinerama Mouse (computing) Light-emitting diode Airsoft Olympus (company) Microeconomics Road-rule enforcement camera ATI Technologies Henri Cartier-Bresson Apollo 8 Bokeh Four Thirds System Bubble Bobble Canon EOS-20D

i need help with my nikon d camera please i feel so dumb i think turning the flash on and off is confusing and when i take pictures some of them look very blurry and idk how to fix that i also do not understand the masp thing i've read the manuel but i dont get it help before you swim in the ocean practice in the pool as dr sam said use auto and let the camera make the basic decisions be sure to use a high enough iso or higher to avoid movement blur also learn to hold the camera correctly way too many photographers hold a dslr like they would hold a book with both hands on the camera body hey it's a nikon not harry potter lol hold the body with your right hand poised over the shutter button and your left hand supporting the lens this prevents the lens from moving up and down also stand with one foot behind at an angle and the other foot in front think ballet this give you a more stable stance and minimized the vertical axis movement that naturally comes from a two feet aside stance finally don't smash down on the shutter button press slowly and be sure your shutter speed is at least matches the focal length of your lens for example if you're using a mm lens be using at least for your shutter speed as you grow in experience or when you acquire a vr lens you can begin to use slower speeds for more help on your d print off the pages of this guide i did the same for my d and am doing the same for my daughter's d just print them off three hole punch them and keep them in a folder or binder for reference http www kenrockwell com nikon d users guide index htm you have a great camera whatever you do learn from your mistakes and you'll find fewer of them as you grow  Digital photography Canon T90 Photography Leica Photographic lens Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Mouse (computing) Nikon FE2 Shutter speed Panoramic photography Nikon FM2 Movie projector Nikon FA Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta Floppy disk Automatic number plate recognition Eye Camera Cinematography Nikon FE Fast bowling Digital camera Depth of field Macro photography Street photography Pinhole camera Aberration in optical systems Super Mario 64 Cinerama Rangefinder camera Shutter (photography) Marching band Aerial (dance move) Binoculars Nikon FM Skateboarding trick Film speed Boxing Diving Contax Helicopter Backstroke Eyepiece Time-lapse Canon EOS Stage lighting IMAX Equine conformation Drill bit Black hole Horse gait Weight training B3ta Breaststroke Drag racing Digital camera back Knife GunZ The Duel Volleyball Wing Chun Windows Vista Swimming Ajax (programming) Exposure (photography) Water polo Wind turbine Poker jargon Guilty Gear Danger Hiptop Oscilloscope Hello world program Antenna (radio) Secure Digital card Front crawl Punt (boat) Professional wrestling throws Zoom lens Panavision Lighting Mattress Lathe Canon EF lens mount Bicycle Headlight Dance Dance Revolution Advanced Photo System Aikido Anamorphic widescreen

which is better a high pixel or changable a lens i have to make a choice between a pixel camera without the option of changing the lens or an pixel that can any camera reccomondations or less a make and model would help but the camera is undoubtedly a digital slr probably a canon eos rebel xt there are no fixed lens cameras that i know of that have more than a sensor which is about sq mm the xt has a much larger sensor at sq mm the sensor size in the slr will give you much better image quality check this out http www flickr com photos samfeinstein okay the slr is mp but you will see so much difference that i think you can practically discount that the slr gives much more definition or less i like the nikon d for a comparable rebel xt is both with the lens the pentax k d is with the lens my choice of these three would be the d regardless of price nikon d vs canon eos d rebel xt this isn't exactly what you asked for but perhaps you will find it helpful in making your decision i have never used a canon eos d so i can't actually compare the cameras but i favor the d because it has a spotmeter and the d doesn't although the d seems small it is practically the exact same size as the d http www dpreview com reviews compare post asp method sidebyside cameras canon eos d cnikon d show all http www dpreview com reviews nikond page asp tells us that the canon d meter calibration is off by about of a stop this would not really present any problems except that it suggests something to me about the quality since the nikon and pentax are dead on scroll on down the page for image comparisons the d is clearly sharper and shows less noise at all iso settings http www dpreview com reviews nikond page asp shows us that both handle shadows equally but the d clips the highlights by about of a stop http www dpreview com reviews nikond page asp shows a side by side of studio images the mp of the canon d at least put the camera on equal footing with the nikon d for image quality but you have to take note that the rebel xt is shot at iso and the nikon is shot at it lowest setting of iso i think the canon images may look a little better but we know from the prior page that under equal lighting levels the canon will start to break up before the nikon the reviewer says while it is possible to pick areas of the image which lend some credence to the eos d's pixel count advantage it's clear that the average observer would not notice these differences and that you would need a very large output size for any of them to become visible check this out http dpreview img fotki com gallery canoneos d samples originals img raw dpp jpg is taken by the canon d with a mm focal length at f th of a second iso using raw http dpreview img fotki com gallery nikond samples originals dsc jpg is taken with the nikon d with an mm focal length at f th of a second iso using jpeg the point of focus for the canon photo is a bit deeper than it is for the nikon but even having mp and using raw and a smaller aperture i think the canon image breaks up a lot more than the nikon you can barely make out the features on the face of the gentleman in the background is this the camera or the superiority of the nikon lens which so many of us here praise okay i've made my stance clear i like the nikon d better than the canon eos d so here's my general review of the d the nikon d is a great little camera very easy to use and quite reasonably priced it has a few consumer friendly totally automatic modes that make it very easy to use but still offers total photographic control when you are ready to take charge it will get you in the nikon family which is a great place to be if you buy accessories and lenses you will be able to use everything on any nikon that you might upgrade to later on check out nikon's picturetown promotion where they handed out d 's in georgetown sc http www stunningnikon com picturetown here are a few reviews in case you have not read them yet be sure to note that they are several pages long and some of the reviews also have some sample images that you can look at http www dpreview com reviews nikond http www steves digicams com reviews nikon d html http www popphoto com cameras camera test nikon d html http www kenrockwell com nikon d d recommendations htm i hate to see people slam the camera because it can't autofocus with older nikon lenses it is true that there is a slight problem with older nikon lenses not autofocusing on the d but if you do not own a bag full of older lenses it is not going to be a problem it is barely a problem anyhow if you check www nikonusa com for af s lenses which are all compatible with the d you will find lenses including vr vibration reduction lenses and one true macro lens with vr there are another plus lenses in the current catalog that provide all functions except autofocus as well as many possibly dozens out of print lenses that will work just as well in addition although these lens will not autofocus most of them will still give focus confirmation from the d manual if the lens has a maximum aperture of f of faster the viewfinder focus indicator can be used to confirm whether the portion of the subject in the selected focus area is in focus after positioning the subject in the active focus area press the shutter release button halfway and rotate the lens focusing ring until the in focus indicator is displayed see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses the d only has autofocus zones arranged horizontally at the center o'clock and o'clock positions this might be considered a limitation but realistically most people will find this perfectly adequate especially if you are moving up from a point and shoot with only a center zone you can get the d with the kit lens at b h photo available through yahoo shopping or at for june add a lexar platinum x speed card for or gb for or get the d with lens and gb lexar card for they also have used d 's from and yet clearly these are both very good cameras what it all comes down to is which one you feel better about go to a camera shop and pick them up and see nikon d vs pentax k d i was devoted to pentax film cameras for most of my life they have just started to come on strong in digital camera development but pentax has always been a concervative company in my opinion others make the point that you should choose a camera system by its lenses and this is definitely true both pentax and nikon have a full catalog of lenses to choose from although fhotoace points out that it may be harder to find good used pentax lenses finding used nikon lenses will not be a great help for you if you buy the d as most will not autofocus with the camera it requires the newest generation of lenses the af s lenses for auto focus however most of the older lenses will still work perfectly well in all other functions most will even give you focus confirmation as you focus manually the pentax has built in image stabilization but as far as i can determine it is only one mode nikon offers some vr lenses that have two modes of image stabilization to be used under different circumstances i admit that this is still an advantage for pentax though i have two stock answers that i will spare you reading as the real decision here is how the camera feels in your hands since you have some camera experience you will know what to look for go to a camera shop and ask to handle each camera ask how each one would be put into the different modes they each have a mode dial but once you are in shutter or aperture priority of manual mode see what you have to do in order to actually adjust the shutter speed or aperture frankly i'd like to see a few more buttons on either camera so you would not have to dive into the menu system to make changes but i guess that's part of being entry level from the spec sheets it concerned me that the pentax uses aa batteries i didn't know that until now true you can use nimh rechargeables but dpreview said that they have gotten many hundreds of shots out of dispoable lithium cr v batteries so i guess that is not an issue for an slr this quote from the dpreview page also concerns me k d is acceptably quick in most everyday respects but doesn't feel as snappy as you would expect from a modern digital slr the biggest disappointments would probably be the lack of instant startup relatively sluggish record review and a virtually pointless continuous shooting mode just four jpeg frames my usual pitch is to say that the pentax k d is the cheapest digital slr worth owning and the nikon d is the one i would choose for myself i would stand by that decision after some review on your behalf tonight check out this comparison page click on in depth review and read owner opinions for each camera be sure to note that the reviews are many pages long so you don't stop after page one check the sample images also you can enlarge these to full size images if you click on the file name shown below the picture you will have to then put your cursor in the white space to the right of the picture and click once after that you can pass your cursor over the image and it will turn into a magnifier click it as a magnifier once and the image will go to full size and you can really examine the detail or look for artifacts like purple fringing around items in high contrast photos or noise in darker areas of the picture http www dpreview com reviews compare post asp method sidebyside cameras pentax k d cnikon d show all fortunately these cameras came out at about the same time and both reviews compare one camera to the other in many aspects this will help you with your decision

question on digital cameras i just recently bought a olympus fe digital camera today i wanted to put one of the pictures that i took on it as my desctop background when i did that though the pictures were super big when i whent to the picture and right clicked on it and then said set as background the picture was all stretched out then i when to properties and selected center or tile rather then stretch but when i did that the picture came up huge and i could only see a fraction of it ie a pic of my cat but could only see the tip of its ear how do i down size the files or the picture so that it fits you probably have the camera on its highest resolution mp your desktop is usually x or less than mp so you have a mp window through which are looking at your mp photo that is why you only see a small part of the picture if you have a flat screen monitor it might be x resolution but this is still only mp the solution is to resize the photo to the resolution of your monitor you can retake the picture at a lower resolution or use an image editing program to resize the pic you already have to your screen resolution one of the above values then you will see the entire picture on your desktop  Digital photography Pixel Stereoscopy Anamorphic widescreen Digital image editing Image file formats Opera (web browser) Mouse (computing) Apple Computer Digital camera Digital cinema Digital cinematography Windows Vista Oscilloscope Display resolution Stardock Photography PIC microcontroller Computer display QuickDraw Object Desktop Super Nintendo Entertainment System Microsoft Windows Hash table Geographic information system File Allocation Table Digital video Aspect ratio (image) Digital single-lens reflex cameras Video Laptop Video Graphics Array Icon (computing) Movie projector Apple Macintosh Google Desktop Computer animation Mac OS X Atari 8-bit family Liquid crystal display Enlightenment (X window manager) Windows Mobile NTSC Film Microsoft History of the graphical user interface 2D computer graphics Window Maker IBM PC compatible Teletext Windows Picture and Fax Viewer PostScript Taskbar QuickTime Dither Iriver Computer International Phonetic Alphabet Motion capture Bluetooth Panoramic photography Blue screen of death Mars PlayStation Portable Portable Document Format Digital television Raw image format Floppy disk X Window System Nintendo GameCube Windows 2000 Depth of field Opportunity rover IPAQ Microsoft Office Digital camera back Machinima IMac Autostereogram Apple typography Embedded system Cinerama Graphical Environment Manager Unicode CPU design Java programming language Steam (content delivery) Game Boy Camera Linux 35 mm film Visual Basic

the digital camera flash issue i have a problem with my sony digital camera the flash does not work so all of my pics are dark help the most obvious thought i have for you is to check your settings it's far too easy to turn the flash off in which case it won't fire for you you should have a flash button on the camera and as you press it repeatedly it cycles through flash flash with red eye protection and flash off you likely also have a menu item that turns off the flash so if the button doesn't do it check your menu if neither of those works for you i'm afraid you're into a repair bill sorry i hope that helps good luck  Mouse (computing) Screenshot Danger Hiptop IPod Poker jargon Tungsten Handheld Embedded system PlayStation Portable Canon EOS Floppy disk Resident Evil 2 GunZ The Duel Road-rule enforcement camera Oscilloscope Photography Bubble Bobble Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sony Macromedia Flash Windows XP Gradius Nintendo DS DVD Platform game Nintendo Entertainment System The Price Is Right Universal Serial Bus Prank flash The Amazing Race Canon T90 Resident Evil (video game) HTML element EXpanded MultiPlayer Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Nintendo 64 Team Fortress Classic Bicycle lighting Traffic light Walkman Chrono Trigger Digital Modchip Xbox 360 Digital camera Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Starsiege: Tribes Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Combine (Half-Life 2) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Web design Stereoscopy Digital photography Ecco the Dolphin Copy protection Flash memory Super Metroid Phoebe Halliwell Spirit rover Leica Burglar alarm Mega Man (NES) Cheating in Counter-Strike Secure Digital card Bluetooth Movie projector Camcorder Beatmania IIDX Camera Adobe Photoshop Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Dance Dance Revolution PIC microcontroller Red-eye effect Wild ARMs 2 Memory card Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara System/36 Surveillance Wipeout (game) Dragon Booster Captain Marvel (DC Comics) SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Legal research Memory Stick 2000 Australian Grand Prix Konami Code Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Final Fantasy (video game) CompactFlash Sun Apple Newton Color temperature Game controller Charmed Compact disc Mobile phone Peugeot

i'm looking for a good quality digital camera for under anyone have a suggestion if you could give me your review on your digital camera that would be helpful i own a few nikon dslr's which cost more than but i'd buy the canon powershot a or a for myself these cameras have the larger sensor or mm x mm that is nearly double the sensor size you find in many point and shoot cameras and this translates into better image quality they allow fully automatic use or total user control and offer several stages in between the only significant difference between these cameras is that the a is mp and the a is mp if you're going to spend up to look at a canon powershot a my son has had his a for over a year may and we both like it my brother has had his a for over a year and it's a very nice camera also you can get it at b h photo available through yahoo shopping for if you can go to look at the mp canon powershot a this is an excellent camera it sells for and you can add a very nice memory card for under the images from the a compare very favorably with the images from a canon g which costs about twice as much for either camera buy a or gb sandisk ultra ii or extreme iii card you will need the increased capacity and write speed to fully realize the benefits of your camera the ultra ii would be excellent but if you are really into video you might prefer the faster extreme iii these cards cost from about at b h and several other outlets a http www steves digicams com reviews a html also http www dpreview com reviews specs canon canon a asp read owner opinions a http www steves digicams com reviews a html also http www dpreview com reviews canona if you want a superzoom camera the s is is now the one to get but some still prefer the s is there are other brands but my experience is with the canon s is and s is see http www dpreview com reviews compare post asp method sidebyside cameras canon a ccanon s is ccanon a show all click on read owner opinions and in depth review the a series cameras have a sensor that is about twice as big as the s is and this translates into generally better image quality they both have more pixels than the s is which isn't everything in image quality but it is certainly worth considering the only thing the s is has going for it is the tremendous zoom range yeah it has image stablization but without that huge zoom you will not need it the a series cameras are somewhat smaller and easier to carry around in a bag or coat pocket too personally i think i'd choose either the a or a over the s is i'm sure others will have a different opinion my son has an a and my daughter has an s is and they both love their cameras  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Camcorder Leica View camera Secure Digital card Canon PowerShot G Mouse (computing) Konica Minolta CPU cache Nikon Corporation Stereoscopy Binoculars Floppy disk IBM PC compatible ATI Technologies World Wide Web PlayStation 3 Radeon Hard disk Canon EOS CompactFlash Atari 8-bit family Computer Pixel Bluetooth Closed-circuit television Apple Macintosh Ajax (programming) Macro photography Canon EOS-300D Photographic lens Single-lens reflex camera Flash memory Windows Vista Amateur astronomy Rangefinder camera Gramophone record Digital camera back Internet Memory Stick Personal rapid transit Ebook Nintendo GameCube Nintendo NVIDIA Warez Charge-coupled device Panavision Road-rule enforcement camera Screenplay Movie projector Blog Portable Document Format Parachuting Apple II family Cinematography Galactic Civilizations USB flash drive Gross domestic product Fuel injection IMac Television Panoramic photography Camera Apple Computer Machinima Hubble Space Telescope Contax HTTP cookie Aperture Digital cinema CPU design GeForce 6 Series Computer and video games Geographic information system Computer vision Mac OS X Canon EF lens mount Canon EOS-20D Sport utility vehicle Extreme Programming Gmail PNG Timeline of computing 1990-forward Film PlayStation Portable MP3 3dfx Nintendo Entertainment System

how do you clear a memory card from a digital camera i've deleted all my pictures off my camera after putting them on the computer but when i go to take a video or a picture it still says card full what do i do the correct way is to simply go in the settings lin the camera look for the format tab and then simply hit the yes button it should say something like this will erase all on this card do you want to proceed another way is to hook your download cable and look at the card in windows and simply delete all the pictures in the proper folder this varies from mfg to mfg but most use either my pictures or documents or a specially named folder created by the mfg of the camera that is automatically written to the card when you insert the memory another is to use a card reader and delete the photos on the card in the same way you do with the download cable hope this helps you  Secure Digital card File Allocation Table Bluetooth Object Desktop IPod Digital photography Windows XP Floppy disk Universal Serial Bus Digital camera System 7 (Macintosh) Stereoscopy Photography Mouse (computing) File system XD-Picture Card Screenplay Nintendo Revolution Anamorphic widescreen Windows 2000 Screenshot Macintosh Finder Danger Hiptop Memory card Nintendo DS Game Boy Nintendo GameCube Computer Xbox 360 Yearbook AmigaOS TiVo Microsoft Windows Mac OS X v10.4 Mozilla Firefox NTSC Enterprise content management Television Amiga Memory Stick JavaScript The Sims 2 MSN Messenger High-definition television Java programming language Gmail Trusted computing Yu-Gi-Oh!

telephoto lens air show i'm shooting an air show in late september i want some input in what lens to use for this i have a canon mm is f i was thinking of buying a x tc or buying a mm f or a canon mm or even thought about a third party lens sigma mm sigma mm any suggestions thanks marvin tom what is ffl i forgot to mention i will be shooting with a full frame body canon eos d the ef mm f l is usm would be prefect for air show and other sporting events the is image stabilization feature should be pretty helpful in your case make sure to use it in mode so that the lens knows you're using it for a panned shot mode deactivates image stabilization in the horizontal direction i'm not too familiar with the sigma or mm lenses their broad range in focal length makes them very desirable but they don't have image stabilization vibration reduction and the quality of the glass might not be as good as the canon's lens anyways good luck with your decision and the shoot  Canon EF lens mount Digital photography Canon EOS Photographic lens Macro photography Cinematography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera View camera Lens (optics) Contax Leica Konica Minolta Zoom lens Canon T90 Binoculars Canon EOS-20D Digital camera back Canon FD Widescreen Rangefinder camera Eyepiece Canon PowerShot G Normal distribution Anamorphic widescreen Depth of field Zeiss Panoramic photography Schneider Kreuznach Polarization Aberration in optical systems Panavision Aperture Digital cinematography Telescope Camera Fresnel lens Advanced Photo System Cinerama The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Canon EOS-300D Stereoscopy Nikon D70 Full frame digital SLR Motorcycle Stage lighting Doctor Wily Photography Glasses Tetrapod Four Thirds System Seismometer Magnification Gamma ray burst History of telescopes Computer and video game genres Windows Vista Parallax Transformation problem Amateur astronomy Monochromator Strategic management Photographic film Eyeglass prescription Microscope Enlarger Light Movie projector Gravitational lens Shutter speed Clementine mission F-number Apollo 8 Equine conformation Oscilloscope Gas tungsten arc welding F-16 Fighting Falcon Antenna (radio) Care Bears Ray tracing Galileo spacecraft Political economy Eye Star Trek Fisheye lens Hubble Space Telescope Airsoft Doctor Who spin-offs Maximum likelihood Joel and Ethan Coen Microeconomics Mega Man X8 Autogyro Digital camera The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Bicycle Welding

why does the canon ii cost so much for than the l the focal length coverage seems similar are the optics on the that much better not that the optics are necessarily better but the at f is a full stop faster than the at f that alone makes a big difference in terms of price and at f you get a lens that gives you an advantage in low light shooting and for producing images where you want a pretty shallow depth of field iq wise check out the differences yourself here http www slrgear com reviews showproduct php product cat http www slrgear com reviews showproduct php product cat cheers  Digital photography View camera Eyepiece Digital single-lens reflex cameras Aberration in optical systems Stereoscopy Binoculars Single-lens reflex camera Photographic lens Aperture Reflecting telescope PHP Telescope Lens (optics) Leica Canon EF lens mount Bicycle lighting Microscope Photography Headlight Zoom lens Movie projector F-number Amateur telescope making Parallax Optical telescope Film Panavision Panoramic photography Contax Konica Minolta Anamorphic widescreen Eye Microscopy Widescreen World Wide Web Optical fiber Camcorder Web server Chromatic aberration Optical coherence tomography Zeiss Ray tracing Internet Ajax (programming) Macro photography Federal Standard 1037C Paintball HyperText Transfer Protocol Digital cinematography Optics Light-emitting diode Cinerama Gross domestic product IMAX Polarization Rangefinder camera Red dot sight Holography Free software Uniform Resource Locator History of telescopes MMORPG Ice core Laser Motion capture Warez Seismometer Nikon Corporation Welding Fusion power Magnification Antenna (radio) Digital camera Laserdisc Afshar experiment Common Unix Printing System Software engineering Political economy Wood Fisheye lens Pinhole camera Autostereogram Monochromator Publicly funded medicine Digital camera back Free trade Optical character recognition Violin Refractive index Internal ballistics Motion picture terminology RFID Balassa-Samuelson effect Strategic management Petroleum

digital camera my digital camera broke but i have a memory card in it if i just buy one of the same cameras and put the memory card in that would that work and would i have to instal the same software again there's no problem with the software as most will work with any camera you chose the brand of the camera is less important than the type of card it takes if you have a sony then you have to chose the same brand as only sony uses memory sticks if you have an olympus or fuji then you have to stick with one of those two as they are the only ones that use xd cards if your camera uses an sd card then you're in luck the vast majority of current cameras use sd cards if your camera used cf cards you would have to move up to the 'pro' line of dslr cameras memory cards are very inexpensive so i wouldn't make that the only thing to consider when choosing a replacement in fact i highly recommend that you use a memory card reader to transfer your images to the computer they're inexpensive and if you get one that takes multiple types of cards you can use any camera and card you can share with friends use current or future cards and save your camera's batteries as well hope this is helpful  Digital photography Secure Digital card Digital camera Computer XD-Picture Card Sony PlayStation Portable IBM PC compatible Memory Stick PlayStation 3 Memory card IPod PlayStation 2 SmartMedia Copy protection Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Universal Serial Bus Konica Minolta Nintendo 64 CompactFlash High-definition television Bluetooth Traditional animation Windows Vista Digital audio player Nintendo DS Digital single-lens reflex cameras Apple Macintosh Photography Apple Computer Floppy disk Digital rights management IPAQ Windows XP Panoramic photography USB flash drive Redundant array of independent disks Xbox DVD Nintendo Revolution CPU cache Motion capture Digital cinematography Acorn Computers Multimedia Card Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Computer and video games Tungsten Handheld Smart card Teletext Surveillance CPU design Personal computer Raw image format Sony Computer Entertainment Credit card Ebook Flash memory 3dfx Hard disk Camera Sharp Zaurus Extreme Programming Game controller Read-only memory Stereoscopy ATI Technologies 8 mm video format Digital video RFID ITunes Ethernet Computer bus Intellivision Unicode Wi-Fi Sega Dreamcast The Sims 2 History of computing hardware MAME Year 2000 problem Punch card Leica Hubble Space Telescope Sega Digital circuit Modchip FireWire History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Neopets Poker jargon Oscilloscope IBM 1620 The Amazing Race Jumpstart 3rd Grade

whats the scoop on the new olympus e volt digital slr has anybody used it how does it compare to other digital slr you mean the e e i've been a working nikon photographer for years but i'm seriously looking at the olympus system for a few reasons admittedly the biggest downfall of this line of cameras is that they're a bit noisier than the competition at high isos but the new models have closed the gap considerably to the point where they're more than good enough at high iso my interest in the olys is for their compact size build quality ergonomic layouts and lenses that are arguably the best of all brands now another possible negative olympus doesn't have a large lineup of lenses nor do they have many primes but i love the idea of having fairly compact zooms that give me a fov equivalent range of mm mm these are fast lenses too all of them giving me a variable aperture of throughout live view is something i welcome and i think all dslrs should have this it has benefits in several situations olympus is the first brand that incorporated live liew in their dslrs and except for canon's dmkiii at they're the only ones that offer it even now in as with any choice of gear there's good points and bad points but for my favourite subjects street people advertising a small system of bodies and lenses is just perfect and if i were to invest in this gear i'll also have the upcoming pro model e to add to it which i'm looking forward to  Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Leica Nikon Corporation Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Canon EOS View camera Olympus (company) Rangefinder camera Photographic lens Contax Binoculars Eyepiece Nikon FE2 Digital camera Canon T90 Zoom lens Nikon FA Street photography Nikon FM Full frame digital SLR Canon EF lens mount Macro photography Digital camera back Pentax Camera Nikon FE Aperture Photography Point and shoot camera Four Thirds System Cinematography MP3 Schneider Kreuznach Nikon D70 Advanced Photo System Secure Digital card Movie projector Panoramic photography IMAX Canon EOS-300D Depth of field Photographic film Zeiss Cosina Amateur astronomy Canon FD PlayStation 2 Medium format DVD Stage lighting Analog-to-digital converter Film speed Lens (optics) Anamorphic widescreen Microeconomics Enlarger Camcorder ATI Technologies Diffraction Supply and demand Widescreen Bicycle lighting Reflecting telescope M16 (rifle) Canon Inc.

how many pictures how many pictures could i store on a mb memory card with a mp camera or with a gb card and which is a good brand when it comes to buying a memory card for a camera thanks hello there there really is no easy or set answer to your question as there are many different variables for a start it would depend on the compression rate and would also depend on the type of memory card you're using to give something of an idea for you if you're using an sd memory card the most commonly used memory card you're looking at around pictures on a mb card with a mp resolution on standed compression gb you would obviously double to assuming we're talking about sd cards the best brand to get is panasonic i've got two digital camera's both use sd and i only use panasonic memory cards panasonic memory cards offer a higher transfere speed for storing photo's and the difference is noticable and is absolutely vital for a high speed semi professional or professional level cameras if you need to discuss it more feel free to get in touch with me  Digital photography DV Secure Digital card Videotape Sound Blaster Leica Floppy disk Digital camera Camcorder High-definition television MiniDisc Computer Photography CPU design Betacam Stereoscopy MP3 Video Laserdisc CompactFlash Nintendo Revolution Bluetooth Gramophone record DVD Television Analog-to-digital converter Mattress Pixel Oscilloscope Nintendo 64 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Charge-coupled device Teletext DVCPRO P2 Memory Stick Redundant array of independent disks Volleyball ATI Technologies Central processing unit Turbocharger Memory card Panasonic Cable television Quizbowl PlayStation Portable Photographic film Walkman Frame rate Linked list XD-Picture Card RISC Panoramic photography Apple Computer Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Jet engine Blackjack Sony Movie camera JPEG Digital video QuickDraw PlayStation 3 Contract bridge FireWire IPod Flash memory IBM 700/7000 series Commodore International Radeon Digital Philosophy of space and time Monty Hall problem Ethernet Nintendo GameCube Anamorphic widescreen Pornography Image Randomness Slot machine Diesel engine Smart card Road-rule enforcement camera Windows Vista Universal Serial Bus Modem Compiler optimization Video codec Nintendo DS Digital circuit MSX Microdrive Surveillance Microeconomics Topps Digital audio player Electric motor

trying to source extension tubes i have a nikon d s slr and use a nikon mm dx macro lens for my macro work i'm trying to find a set of extension tubes that will allow me to increase magnification the issue is that the tubes need to link seamlessly with the lens and the camera electronics so that i can retain control over aperture exposure and if possible with the autofocus though that latter need isn't essential despite a lot of hunting around i can't seem to find any manufacturer who is willing to certify their extension tubes as being able to provide this need is anyone using extension tubes successfully with this combination of equipment if so i'd really appreciate a recommendation as to who makes those extension tubes so i can get a set for myself i'm not hung up on an exact match if you are using a nikon digital slr and successfully using tubes with a nikon dx lens and this combination gives you control over aperture and exposure and maybe autofocus that's endorsement enough thanks i knew about the nikon problems so it has to be a third party maker like tamron kenko promaster or others the problem is none will certify that the combination works and i've not known anyone who's tried them to tell me if they do work or what problems i might have to expect nikon pk a pk and pk provide aperture indexing but do not support auto focus you will not get exposure metering on the d with ai lenses which is the standard design of these extension tubes i have not heard of a nikon extension tube that will give you what you want non oem extension tubes may provide what you are looking for but i am not aware of any that do  Nikon Corporation Konica Minolta Contax Digital single-lens reflex cameras Leica Macro photography Canon EOS Canon EF lens mount Canon T90 Photographic lens Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE2 Nikon FM Digital photography Olympus (company) Binoculars Rangefinder camera Point and shoot camera Depth of field Camera Nikon D70 Television Eyepiece Telescope Photography Enlarger Aperture M16 (rifle) Schneider Kreuznach Cosina Canon FD Pentax Autofocus Anamorphic widescreen IMAX Advanced Photo System Oscilloscope Digital camera Antenna (radio) Hard disk Camcorder Metering mode Canon EOS-300D Floppy disk Street photography Lisp programming language Aberration in optical systems Canon T70 Cinematography Lighting IBM PC compatible DVD Reflecting telescope Transistor PDP-11 Exposure (photography) Film speed Blu-ray Disc Lightsaber Galileo spacecraft Zoom lens Lens (optics) F-number Movie projector Vacuum tube Optical fiber History of telescopes 135 film Panavision Secure Digital card E85 Color temperature Microsoft Windows Bass guitar MIM-23 Hawk Photographic film Rebreather Zeiss Amateur astronomy Electrical engineering Solar power Canon EOS-20D Central processing unit Thermal power station Stereoscopy Widescreen Ultraviolet Image scanner Semiconductor device M60 machine gun Cathode ray tube

megapixels camera http www engadget com seitz x digital shoots at megapixels what do you think about that that's unbelievable i can't believe people actually need that a computer can't even show that many pixels so there is nowhere where you can actually see the whole image with the same quality it is stored in the memory and minutes of video requires terabytes of space lol it sounds crazy but remember moore's law when the ibm pc came out it had a maximum memory of kb not megabytes kilobytes bill gates himself thought nobody would ever be able to use more than that my first digital camera was megapixel and that was considered 'professional' in those days megapixels sounds outrageous but if it was possible and cheap enough i'd want it all things being equal more megabytes is better it means not just more resolution but more color saturation better 'tones' etc digital cameras still can't match mm cameras for resolution but even mm cameras are not all that great as film cameras go imagine a digital camera with the resolution and sharpness of a x view camera it will come in time  Pixel Digital photography Digital camera Digital cinema Nintendo GameCube Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital video Image file formats Digital cinematography Camcorder Hard disk Xbox 360 Atari 2600 Konica Minolta RGB color model Anamorphic widescreen IBM PC compatible DV Stereoscopy Video Widescreen Digital image editing IBM PC Computer Charge-coupled device Medium format Photography Movie projector Image scanner PlayStation (original) Foveon X3 sensor Digital DVD Floppy disk High-definition television Motion capture Original Amiga chipset Analog-to-digital converter Amstrad CPC Dots per inch 8 mm video format Camera phone Camera Liquid crystal display Aspect ratio (image) NTSC Gamut Compact disc Game Boy Film Traditional animation File Allocation Table Central processing unit Secure Digital card Nintendo 64 Laserdisc Panoramic photography Leica Rendering (computer graphics) PlayStation Portable Color Graphics Adapter Atari ST CPU design Geographic information system Apple Macintosh 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Computer printer Sega Dreamcast Compact audio cassette Clementine mission IMAX Walkman Oscilloscope Machine vision Cinematography Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sampler (musical instrument) Pixel art Photographic film Apple Computer Multimedia literacy VHS Cognitive science Chroma subsampling Nintendo Entertainment System Raw image format TurboGrafx 16 Nikon D70 Warez Dither Computer graphics

i need to buy a digital camera which is better canon powershot a or kodak easyshare c any info helps i want to take nice pictures but im not into it hardcore i have come down to choosing between the kodak easyshare c and the canon powershot a any information that can help me choose either one of these would be great or if someone has any advice on me getting another digital camera in the price range of would be helpful as well thanks you have done your homework because you have found two very comparable and excellent cameras to me the tiebreaker would be the lack of an optical viewfinder on the kodak i would buy the canon here's my speech on that topic i lament the passing of the optical viewfinder and i would choose almost any camera with an optical viewfinder over one that only has an lcd viewfinder why you never have the option of turning off the lcd and these things eat batteries for lunch and spit them out why do away with the option of a viewfinder that has zero electrical drain it can be difficult to see the image on an lcd in bright sunlight even if they are new and improved you have to hold an lcd viewer out at some distance in front of your face this is more conspicuous than i prefer to be all the time the need to hold a camera at arms length will introduce some shake i like the idea of stabilizing a camera against my face when i am taking a picture this is especially important with a longer zoom lens no wonder image stablization or vibration reduction is necessary with these cameras not that there's anything wrong with is or vr but it is really a requirement with lcd viewfinders and telephoto lenses using the lcd to view photos after you've taken them slows down the camera quite a bit you can't shut of the lcd monitor and still take pictures if you don't have an optical viewfinder  Leica Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Contax View camera Konica Minolta Liquid crystal display Binoculars Canon EOS Photographic lens Canon T90 Single-lens reflex camera Stereoscopy Canon EF lens mount Movie projector Cinematography Digital camera Zoom lens Canon PowerShot G Panavision Camcorder Panoramic photography Closed-circuit television Macro photography Nikon Corporation Oscilloscope Camera Parallax IMAX Hubble Space Telescope Widescreen Light-emitting diode Bluetooth Amateur astronomy Canon FD Road-rule enforcement camera Mouse (computing) Digital camera back Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Eye Canon Inc.

camera and lens i have an olympus om with a lens thats like inches high is there a site or a quick way to learn how to take nice pictures within the next two days from bottom to top or from the camera outwards the lens read first ring om second ring macro the next thing slides back and forth i take it zoom and the next slide reads in ft and m with a sign that looks like circles attached also there is a accessory flash buts its a nikon it has two options m and asa whats that help please i'm so confused first ring is the aperture ring the lower the number the faster you have to take the picture in other words the faster the shutter speed and at the same time the less depth of feild meaning only what you focus on comes out in focus in the picture the higher the number the slower you have to take the picture and the more things that come out in focus if the lens is inches long im guessing its maximum focal lenght is mm according to the second ring but besides that i dont know what else the ft and m are feet and meters so you know how far your subject is when you focus unless you chose to focus by first finding out how far the subject is the two circles attached is the mathematical symbol for infinty on your lens this means that at this point anything farther than the previous foot or meter marker on the lens is in focus for the nikon flash the m is manual unless its a table suggesting distances and the power you should set your flash to i haven't used a manual flash for a while so the asa i am hazy about but might be something with power output you should experiment with the different settings on a roll of film and write down what settings you use for each picture you take keep in mind when you buy film the lower the iso number or speed example the slower you have to take your picutres or slower shutter speed and the higher the iso the faster you can take a picture have fun  Digital photography Canon T90 Photography Leica Nikon FM2 Aperture Nikon FA Macro photography Camera Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photographic lens Konica Minolta Canon EOS Single-lens reflex camera F-number Canon EF lens mount Nikon FE Film speed Cinematography Floppy disk Nikon FM Canon T70 Point and shoot camera Stereoscopy Exposure (photography) Mouse (computing) Rangefinder camera Pinhole camera Photographic film Digital camera Binoculars Street photography Shutter (photography) Amateur astronomy IMAX Stage lighting Movie projector Panoramic photography Speed limit Eye Autostereogram Manual transmission Canon FD Slide rule Anamorphic widescreen Zoom lens Eyepiece Redundant array of independent disks Digital camera back Film CDC 6600 Motion picture terminology Equine conformation Headlight Aberration in optical systems M16 (rifle) Recumbent bicycle Camcorder Super Mario 64 Drag racing Bokeh Opportunity rover Time-lapse Wind turbine Canon PowerShot G Dog agility GunZ The Duel Drill bit Telescope Color temperature Modem Beatmania IIDX Panavision Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME EIA-708 DVD Parachuting High-speed rail Interstate Highway Advanced Photo System Explosive material Olympus (company) Faster-than-light Chair Widescreen Oscilloscope

how to take pictures with high dynamic range i saw some stunning pictures using hdr but i dont know what are the steps of coming along an image using that technique what is needed how is it done apart from the methods already described by others here i e take multiple shots exposed for various points of a scene w high contrast and then compose them using photoshop i want to mention one very important thing dynamic range varies a lot depending on pixel size on the camera's sensor large sensors have larger pixels for the same megapixel count this is why digital slrs w larger sensors canon nikon give you better dynamic range than digital slrs w smaller sensors olympus which in turn give you better dynamic range than fixed lens cameras and their much smaller sensors so in case you are not ready to invest in photoshop and in hours learning how to use it buy yourself a nice high end digital slr hope this helps  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Pixel Digital camera back Single-lens reflex camera Nikon Corporation Full frame digital SLR Canon EOS Macro photography Advanced Photo System Konica Minolta View camera Canon T90 Digital image editing Nikon D70 Photographic lens Clementine mission Rangefinder camera Stereoscopy High dynamic range imaging Camera PNG Leica Digital cinema Pentax Foveon X3 sensor Point and shoot camera Charge-coupled device Canon EF lens mount Nikon FA Movie projector Binoculars Olympus (company) Computer vision Four Thirds System Autostereogram Motion capture Image scanner Digital cinematography Nikon FM2 Hard disk Fuel injection Digital Panoramic photography Holography Eye Liquid crystal display Canon EOS-300D Nikon FE2 Medium format Image file formats Machine vision Cinematography Drawing Gamut Geographic information system Analog-to-digital converter Cosina Zoom lens Nikon FE Aspect ratio (image) Floppy disk Contax Rendering (computer graphics) Traditional animation Bayer filter Motion compensation Video Autofocus Zone system Complex number Moir__ pattern Optical coherence tomography Vignetting Panavision Canon Inc.

help my camera lens is stuck i have a month old casio i accidentally dropped it while it was still on and now the lens is stuck i try turning it on and off and it only says lens error on the screen please help how can i get it unstuck it depends upon whether it shows any marks from being dropped if it doesn't some companies will repair their cameras under warranty unless they show obvious signs of impact if it has any dents in the housing or on the lens or any marks from where it was dropped they probably won't cover it under warranty check with your local camera repair shop for a repair quote don't call a camera store where they send stuff out or you will end up paying for their markup on top of what the repair costs usually all but the cheapest digital cameras are worth getting fixed also in the future if you're not going to be using your camera for more than a minute or so turn it off so the lens will retract and be less susceptable to impact bob k http www camerarepairs com  Digital photography Digital camera Single-lens reflex camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Leica Lens (optics) Poker jargon Rangefinder camera View camera Canon T90 Galileo spacecraft Movie projector Cleveland Browns Domain Name System IPod Surveillance Camcorder XML Mars Exploration Rover Road-rule enforcement camera Digital circuit Parallax Stereoscopy Photographic lens Apollo 8 Anamorphic widescreen Cinerama Binoculars USB flash drive 24 Hours of Le Mans Warranty Auto insurance Ebook Clementine mission IMAX The Inside Advanced Photo System Canon EOS Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web The Amazing Race Cinematography Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Bob and George Gmail Year 2000 problem Schneider Kreuznach 8 mm video format 3-D film Charge-coupled device Digital cinematography Nintendo DS Joel and Ethan Coen Best Buy Cross site scripting Oscilloscope Diamond enhancement On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pretty Good Privacy Computer virus The Price Is Right Contemporary culture of South Korea 60 Minutes Nikon Corporation Wheel of Fortune London Congestion Charge Zoom lens Character encodings in HTML Point and shoot camera Hubble Space Telescope Radio controlled airplane Wal-Mart Eyeglass prescription Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Marshall McLuhan EXpanded MultiPlayer High-definition television Automatic number plate recognition Secure Digital card Danger Hiptop Bulk vending Len Hutton Apple Computer Marilyn Monroe Twin-lens reflex camera Blackjack Bubble Bobble Paintball The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Cable television Windows XP Modem Depth of field Advance fee fraud Widescreen

digital camera sd card format error can ya help me with this one my dad is trying to fix this over the phone with me and i haven't experienced it so i'm throwing it to the wolves he has an older model hp digital camera with a gig sd card he has pictures on the card as viewable by playing them on the camera's lcd however when he connects the camera to the pc to transfer the pictures and clear his sd card he gets an error on the pc that simply says not formatted and he can't go any further obviously the sd card is not formatted it has pictures on it is this something anyone has experienced at all he's had the camera forever but the sd card is an upgrade from what he had and it's the first time he's tried to upload the photos to the computer with said card if he needed to format that card within the software on the pc before using it how can he get those pictures now after talking to him again suggesting he just go to my computer and search the removable drive files he said that when he clicks on the camera drive it gives him the not formatted error again the problem is the hp software because he didn't know the card had to be formatted beforehand in order to get the pictures he's not interested in removing the software i recommended he connect the camera to another pc without the software and just choosing his options that pop up once the camera is connected oh he has about pictures to get off that card very important pictures of the new grandson my first son so he can't just erase the pictures from the camera and start again do not ever try to format using the computers operating system mac's will destroy the card and in some cases so will windows to format the card use only the format feature that is on your camera sometimes even a card formatted on one camera will not work on another the only way to be sure to get all the image files from the card is to use a card reader some printers and computers have these built in but if he doesn't have that option then he will have to spend and buy one it connects to a usb port and the card goes in it then all he has to do is use the file manager to drag and drop the images on the card to a folder on his computer that he has pre named so he knows what is in the file  IPod Windows XP Windows Vista Mac OS X ITunes Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth Floppy disk Secure Digital card Digital camera Mouse (computing) Atari 8-bit family Computer USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Object Desktop Common Unix Printing System Atari ST ZX Spectrum IMac USB mass storage device class File Allocation Table Macintosh Finder PlayStation 2 Digital rights management System 7 (Macintosh) PlayStation Portable System/36 Mach kernel Computer virus Hard disk Screenshot Musical Instrument Digital Interface IBM PC compatible DVD Digital audio player Photography Apple II family Game Boy Enterprise content management Creative Zen Television FireWire File system SonicStage Gmail PlayStation 3 Mac OS History of Microsoft Windows Amiga Flash memory Konica Minolta Mac OS X v10.4 Linux Sony Windows 2000 Nintendo DS Warez Unicode Blue screen of death Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis X Window System Dither High-definition television Redundant array of independent disks Apple IIGS Tungsten Handheld Apple typography Mozilla Firefox Btrieve HyperCard Commodore 64 Sharp Zaurus Mac OS history Spyware Knoppix PNG OS/2 Pixel Computer forensics TRS-80 Computer hardware Raw image format Opera (web browser) Portable Document Format Laptop AirPort Sound Blaster Oscilloscope Novell NetWare MSN Messenger Xbox 360 Ebook XD-Picture Card Danger Hiptop TRS-80 Color Computer

help with settings on canon s is please i have a canon s is and we bought it before my son was born months ago i still don't know how to use it and the pics always come out blurry the manual is way over my head and i feel really bad that i have this great camera and my pics come out so bad anyone have a way that they can give me the canon s is for dummies version what should the settings be i really don't know why all your photos are blurry because if you are using auto then most of your photos should generally be fine plus your camera has an image stabilizer which means less likelihood of blurred photos some reasons why your photos might be blurred you are not giving the camera time to pre focus always make sure you half press the shutter button till the little square turns green then press the shutter button down fully always making sure you keep the camera still make sure the image stabilizer is turned on and make sure it's in shoot only mode for best results if you are trying to take photos of your young son who is obviously not staying still for very long then you need to use a faster shutter speed tv on the mode dial remember that your camera isn't smart enough to know that your subject is moving so you have to 'tell' it to use a faster shutter speed to try to capture any action or movement e g sec to a much faster shutter speed you can select where you want your camera to auto focus af i generally prefer to have my af frame in the centre so i can focus more accurately on my subject and you can also select how your camera focuses continuous or single i much prefer single so you should try both settings continuous focusing will consume more battery power don't forget to raise the flash when the lighting is low i suggest you try and spend some time going through the user guide step by step because it will help you understand your camera more i really like canon's user guides because they are very user friendly mostly good luck and check out the two links below which might be helpful  Photography Leica Canon T90 View camera Shutter speed Stereoscopy Automatic number plate recognition Canon EOS Movie projector Camera Single-lens reflex camera Canon T70 GunZ The Duel Time-lapse PlayStation Portable Eye Frame rate IBM PC compatible Oscilloscope Embedded system Canon PowerShot G Beatmania IIDX Panoramic photography Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Depth of field Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Shutter (photography) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Cinematography Welding Street photography Bluetooth Nikon Corporation Amateur astronomy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Quake III Arena Binoculars Canon EF lens mount Nikon FM2 Poker jargon Redundant array of independent disks Rangefinder camera Toyota Prius Macro photography DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Dance Dance Revolution Digital camera Drill bit Pump It Up Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Persistence of vision Prank flash Professional video camera Screenshot IPod Shutter angle F-number Wind turbine Motion capture Nikon FE2 HTML element GunBound Walkman Photographic lens Nikon FA Modem Knight Rider Motion blur Equine conformation Nikon FE Digital single-lens reflex cameras Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Sonic the Hedgehog Bicycle lighting M16 (rifle) Closed-circuit television Weight training BZFlag Gradius Rendering (computer graphics) Mars Exploration Rover Resident Evil 4 Mattress Cheating in Counter-Strike Danger Hiptop DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Windows XP Tank Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

need help deciding between two cameras pentax w or nikon d i'm in the market to buy a new digital camera the main uses would be for outdoor nature photos im by no means an aspiring professional photographer but enjoy taking photos i have been focusing on two totally different types of cameras and was looking for some reviews from users of these cameras the pentax w point and shoot and the nikon d i am aware of the huge differences between these two cameras but need help on decided whats best for me please do not give websites i've already been there personally forget the point and shoot i actually have one but i don't do any serious work with it it's just for the odd snapshots when i don't want to carry my slrs in their rather heavy knapsack i'd suggest two choices go for those cameras that look like slrs but aren't or go for the nikon in some respects you sound like me i started thirty seven years ago with a film slr with the only intention to take some good snapshots over time i migrated to a professional film slr and now i have two nikon digitals a d s and a d the nice thing about the ones that look like slrs is that you can get a lot of slr features except interchangeable lenses that means you have the controls and the tools to do outstanding pictures and to also master photography later as you outgrow the camera assuming you do you can then go for the slr and still keep the other one for those days you don't want to carry around a lot of lenses and stuff just be aware they're limited in what they can do and they're not very fast which means you may miss the odd pictures that isn't an issue when you have a mountain it's not going anywhere but when you're at a party sometimes seconds count to capture that special moment and expression on the other hand now is a good time to consider an slr i'd suggest the nikon d x actually instead of the d and i'd suggest an mm mm lens which will cover just about anything you want to do today later you could add a wider angle zoom and also a longer telephoto but in the meantime you'd have an outstanding lens range in a single lens that should keep you happy for years going straight to the d x accelerates your ability to really master photography and if later you outgrow your d x you can shoot for the d or whatever replaces it that one has a lot of professional features that you'd really appreciate once you're ready the nice thing is that the lens will still work for you and if you happened to buy a nikon flash in the meantime that too would still work fine too my personal opinion is to go for the nikon d x as your best choice that gives you something to grow with i remember when i started if i had bought an expensive regular film camera i'd have replaced it a year later with an slr so i was happy to start with the slr i have a feeling you'd be happier with that too when i went digital i started with a nikon d s replaced now by the d and i grew to a nikon d a year later i have three lenses and a huge flash too among other gadgets at the same time i also have a little point and shoot canon powershot g that i bought long after the digital slrs so that i have something for my pocket for those days when i really don't want to carry the slrs around that camera frustrates me it's got limited range in funcitonality and it's slow compared to my slrs but it serves the purpose at a party or dinner if i had to give up one of the cameras the canon would be the first to go i hope that helps a little good luck  Photographic lens Photography Cinematography Digital camera Canon T90 Contax Nikon FM2 Nikon FE Panoramic photography Rangefinder camera Nikon FM Stereoscopy Nikon FA Camera Macro photography Camcorder Binoculars Street photography Medium format Nikon D70 Advanced Photo System Point and shoot camera Panavision Closed-circuit television Canon PowerShot G Full frame digital SLR Computer Windows Vista Film Zoom lens Eyepiece Movie projector IBM PC compatible Shaggy dog story Depth of field Volleyball Anamorphic widescreen Cinerama Canon EF lens mount Poker jargon Canon FD Surveillance Shutter speed Canon EOS-300D Photojournalism Apollo 8 Cosina Pinhole camera Photographic film Secure Digital card Disposable camera Television Quake III Arena Gross domestic product Traditional animation Amateur astronomy Knife Schneider Kreuznach Lens (optics) Olympus (company) Machinima Aperture IMAX Motion picture terminology Technicolor Timeline of photography technology Theory of conduct Twin-lens reflex camera 24 Hours of Le Mans Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Airsoft Lightsaber Canon EOS-20D High-definition television Gramophone record The Star Wars Holiday Special Laserdisc Underwater photography Lightning Internal ballistics Road-rule enforcement camera Pornography Canon Inc.

i just bought a new camera and am wonder if i should charge the lithium battery fully before i turn it on is there any way to apporach a new lithium battery to make it max out in length lithium ion lion batteries are a little bit different than the older nicad or nimh batteries you will want to fully charge the battery the first time after that charge early and often that is don't let the battery run down below if at all possible before recharging unlike older technology lion batteries do not develop a memory and don't need to be fully discharged before recharging in fact fully discharging the battery frequently will reduce the life span of the battery it may take a couple of charging cycles to fully condition the battery and get the maximum capacity also don't store a lion battery in a discharged state it will also shorten the life of the battery store the battery with a charge if possible lion batteries do not discharge as quickly as nimh or nicad batteries when they are not being used so you won't have to immediately recharge if they haven't been used for a couple weeks having a second battery that you can alternate with is helpful bacause you can always have a charged spare to swap out when the battery falls below  Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Lithium ion polymer battery Battery electric vehicle Ford Ranger EV Hybrid vehicle Bicycle lighting Laptop IPod Xbox 360 AlphaSmart IBM PC compatible Automobile Digital photography Bipolar disorder Airsoft Non-volatile memory Apple Newton Fuel cell Action potential Segway HT Hydrogen economy Future energy development Energy development Uninterruptible power supply Tesla coil Memory effect Handheld game console Radio controlled car Lead-acid battery CPU cache Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Lithium Handspring Solar car Hydride PlayStation Portable Hybrid Synergy Drive Flash memory The Secret of NIMH Redundant array of independent disks Torpedo Thermal power station Halo: Combat Evolved Galileo spacecraft PowerBook Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Atari ST Nuclear reactor Read-only memory Circuit design FireWire Fusion power Hubble Space Telescope Universal Serial Bus Game Boy Advance SP Internal combustion engine Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory MIM-23 Hawk Douglas DC-8 Explosive material Artillery Tire Solar cell Johnny 5 USB flash drive Binoculars High-voltage direct current Electrophysiology Capacitor Weapons of Star Trek Watch Game Boy Advance Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Nintendo 64 Nuclear power Creative Zen Canon T90 Tungsten Handheld Aurora (astronomy) Energy storage Hydrogen vehicle Bus models used in New York City Transit Membrane potential Internal ballistics Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Oscilloscope Water (molecule) Air gun CMOS Electroconvulsive therapy Zinc-carbon battery A4000 Vacuum tube Universal Century Technology USS Texas (BB-35)

kodac z camera lens the outer lens has fell out and i need to know how to put it back in i have all the parts to it if it is just the front piece of glass that has come out you should be able to reinstall it first take out the small black ring on the front of the lens housing it has small notches in it gently slip a pin or something pointed between the black ring and the silver outer ring to disengage the snaps on the black ring and then lift it out the front glass element just sits in the front of the lens barrel behind it is a small ring with a rectangular hole in it then there is one more piece of glass after cleaning the rear piece of glass and reinstalling it insert the black piece with the rectangular hole there is a notch at each end to align it in the proper direction then put a small amount of rubber cement on the very edges of the front lens glass and seat it into its ring do not use super glue or it will ruin the camera when the fumes get to the glass surfaces then you can re snap the front black ring back into position to hold it together until the glue dries good luck i hope this works bob k http www camerarepairs com  View camera Floppy disk Professional wrestling throws Movie projector Screw Seismic retrofit Bong Headlight Knife Suplex Tire Photographic lens Stage lighting Earring Upholstery Cello Sunglasses Macro photography Strap-on dildo Glossary of American football Eye Glass Lighting Table tennis Violin Menstrual cup Ulna Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Oscilloscope Solar eclipse Temporal bone Door Amateur telescope making Snooker Parallax Aberration in optical systems Drill bit Car handling Canon EF lens mount Condom Stereoscopy Wood Reflecting telescope Radio controlled airplane Powerbomb Enlarger Electrophysiology Black hole Hamster Maxilla Piccolo Junior Saga Depth of field Photography Heckler & Koch G3 Palatine bone Binoculars IPod Woodworking Camera Contax Sheaf (mathematics) Canon FD Archery Horse tack Equine conformation Hand grenade Mars Exploration Rover Frontal bone New York Giants Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Chess strategy and tactics Krag-J__rgensen Table saw Sega Saturn Lathe Digital single-lens reflex cameras Printed circuit board Elbow-joint Solar cell Professional wrestling aerial techniques Solar panel Laser engraving Key (lock) Pinhole camera Mandible Revolver Piezoelectricity M16 (rifle) Glossary of firefighting equipment Enigma machine

before i consider buying it what are your opinions on this camera link included http www jessops com store s home cameras and lenses digital compact cameras pentax optio a digital camera details aspx your opinions would help thanks seems like a nice little point and shoot camera obviously one of the best ways to tell if it is for you and how you'd feel operating it is to go into the store and have a play around with the camera you've got a good megapixel rating an average zoom you're best only really paying attention to optical zoom if you're looking for the sharpest of pictures the camera uses sd which in my opinion one of the best memory cards you can use also a nice large screen one of the main downsides i'd think off is that there is no optical viewfinder so you are forced to use the lcd screen which will obviously reduce battery life and on sunny days glare may be a problem maybe be worth checking to see what scene selection modes and light balance modes are built into the camera also overall if you're looking for a straight point and shoot camera i think you'll be very happy with the results from this pentax if you want to ask me any further questions please feel free to contact me  Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera Konica Minolta Pentax Leica Pixel Photography Contax Camera Movie projector Stereoscopy Point and shoot camera Binoculars Secure Digital card Nikon Corporation Canon T90 Widescreen Cinematography Oscilloscope Anamorphic widescreen Photographic lens Digital cinematography Camcorder Handheld game console Canon EOS Digital camera back Digital cinema Nintendo DS Panoramic photography CPU design Modem Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Surveillance Film Game Boy High-definition television View camera Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Panavision Tungsten Handheld Federal Standard 1037C Windows Vista Digital image editing IPAQ Canon PowerShot G Solar power Endoscopy Automatic number plate recognition Lens (optics) Windows XP PlayStation Portable DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX USB flash drive Holography Parallax Sharp Zaurus Motion capture Aperture Rangefinder camera Zire Handheld Nikon FA Liquid crystal display Bluetooth Ebook Canon Inc.

taking photos through the lcd of a digital slr camera hi there i have just pruchased a nikon d slr i have had a fujifilm for years and have just upgraded is it not possible to take photographs with the d through the lcd screen if you can how do you turn it on i know i'm probably being dense but i just assumed that it would work the same as non slr cameras i mainly use the viewfinder to take photos but i find the lcd useful when doing close up photography or using a tripod many thanks nathan no nearly all dslrs only show the image on the lcd after you've taken the photo no light is falling on the detector until the mirror flips up with you press the shutter just like an slr there are advantages and disadvantages to this type of operation you've found one of the disadvantages olympus makes dslrs that offer a real time lcd output you might want to look at them check out the e or e they really are excellent cameras  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital photography Konica Minolta View camera Canon T90 Stereoscopy Rangefinder camera Nikon Corporation Digital camera Photography Camera Contax Canon EOS Pentax Nikon FM2 Advanced Photo System Twin-lens reflex camera Nikon FE Liquid crystal display Nikon FM Nikon FE2 Canon EOS-300D Macro photography Digital camera back Olympus (company) Street photography Four Thirds System Television Shutter speed Full frame digital SLR Canon EOS-20Da Photographic film Medium format Eastman Kodak Gamut Panoramic photography Charge-coupled device Secure Digital card Point and shoot camera Road-rule enforcement camera Persistence of vision Binoculars XD-Picture Card Shutter (photography) Oscilloscope Photograph Nikon D70 Game Boy Cosina Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Floppy disk Game Boy Advance PlayStation Portable Danger Hiptop 135 film Closed-circuit television Photojournalism Color Organic light-emitting diode Telescope Cinematography Praktica Pinhole camera Raw image format Film Camcorder Ebook Parallax Bluetooth Instant camera Large format Windows XP Exposure (photography) Pixel Circle of confusion Light-emitting diode IMac Exakta Canon Inc.

i need a new camera any suggestions i am in the market for a new digital camera and don't know what to get i am really into photography and want to learn more and take better shots i also want a camera that takes good night pictures and night does anyone have any suggestions if you're really into photography then its obvious a dslr is the way to go anything less will be too limiting in my opinion while canon nikon and sony formerly minolta dslr's are excellent choices it wouldn't hurt to look at the new pentax line the k d is the latest and features mp image stabilization built into the body and it accepts the entire range of pentax k mount lenses giving you access to excellent glass at reasonable prices note some excellent dslr cameras have the image stabilization in their lenses this results in a more expensive and heavier lens something to consider you say you want to take good night pictures check out fotosharp com and consider purchasing their day night exposure guide i've used one for years and its invaluable check your local high school or community college for camera classes you can learn a lot about photography and you'll meet people who share your interests  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Nikon Corporation Leica Konica Minolta Camera Binoculars View camera Photography Photographic lens Pentax Macro photography Rangefinder camera Nikon FA Nikon FE2 Digital camera Nikon FM2 Canon EOS Nikon FE Camcorder Panoramic photography Digital camera back Cinematography Advanced Photo System Stereoscopy Secure Digital card Canon EF lens mount Canon Inc.

best digital cam for taking pictures of yourself sure that sounds vain but i'm going on a trip overseas and i want to have plenty of pics not just pics of the surroundings but pics of myself experiencing the surroundings it's always nice to see yourself at times when you were happiest or adventuring so with that said i'm looking to buy a digital cam for the first time but i need one that allows me to see myself when shooting a pic of myself maybe one with a flip screen thanks for your suggestions you want either an articulating camera like the nikon coolpix s or s or one with an articulating lcd panel like the canon powershot a both are very good cameras with lenses that let you and the background be sharp this works best in wide angle settings cameras in which the lcd is not in a fixed position to the lens also let you take overhead shots in crowds while being able to see exactly what you are taking as well as very low to the ground shots which sometimes enhance the perspective in urban settings as always practice with your camera before you go on the trip and see what accessories batteries chargers extra digital storage cards you will need have a great trip  Digital photography Stereoscopy Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Television Canon PowerShot G Movie projector View camera Photographic lens Nikon Corporation Panoramic photography Liquid crystal display Cinematography Leica Game Boy PIC microcontroller PlayStation Portable Digital camera back Nikon FA Camera Film Anamorphic widescreen Zoom lens Widescreen Nintendo DS Point and shoot camera 70 mm film Universal Serial Bus Depth of field Gameking Digital cinematography Contax IMAX Binoculars Single-lens reflex camera Sharp Zaurus Canon EOS Tungsten Handheld Game Boy Advance Danger Hiptop Laptop Street photography Liquid crystal display television Cinerama GunBound Parallax Rangefinder camera PowerBook Gamut Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March High-definition television IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) Patricia Ford Cheating in Counter-Strike IPod Raw image format Movie camera Pornography Atari ST History of computer and video games Screenplay Archos Joel and Ethan Coen Pixel Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Vacuum tube Nikon D70 Nintendo Nintendo 64 PC Engine Bluetooth Canon EOS-300D Canon Inc.

how do i get my photos out of burst mode once they've been taken sony dsc t have a bunch of photos from my sony cybershot dsc t camera that a family member took in burst mode the preview shows the group as one photo with photos x photos how to i break up the burst mode photo so i can get a print of one shot i'm pretty sure hubby put it in multi burst since there is like photos per image when i downloaded to my computer what a shame they're photos of the kiddos getting an award using burst mode means that the camera takes a number of separate shots in quick succession so you will not have just one photo but a number of photos that look almost identical you should be able to select whichever photo you wish to print have you tried uploading your photos to your pc but i see from the review below that your camera also has a multi burst mode which is what your photos might have been taken in using this mode will compile all the shots you take into a megapixel image this is not a large enough size to print a decent photo anyway here is a description of multi burst mode the multiburst mode lets you record up to sixteen frames at high speed the capture rate is selectable for fps fps or fps via the menu these images are merged into one finished image when the image is played in camera it is animated in sequence it is most useful in recording an athletic movement such as a golf swing or tennis stroke for later evaluation when reviewed in camera the images can be viewed frame by frame or as a continuous sequence so if you used multi burst mode then i think you will be out of luck and it will be difficult to seperate each shot don't forget these are only in a tiny resolution of x each but if you used burst mode then you can print whichever shot you want good luck  Pixel Screenshot PlayStation Portable Frame rate Photography Digital cinematography Stereoscopy Digital cinema Digital camera Mouse (computing) First-person shooter Video Movie camera View camera Resident Evil (video game) Halo: Combat Evolved Resident Evil 4 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Windows Vista Quake III Arena Motion capture Tennis Movie projector Hot Shots Golf (series) Panoramic photography Camera Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March IPod Items in the Metroid series Universal Serial Bus Traditional animation Unreal Tournament 2004 Perl History of computer and video games Counter-Strike Pump It Up Fast bowling Galileo spacecraft Filmmaking Machinima Photographic film Leica High-definition television Cheating in Counter-Strike Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Golf Apollo 8 The Big Break GunZ The Duel Computer animation Secure Digital card Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Camcorder Tribes 2 Computer printer BZFlag Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME CPU design Game controller Digital video Konica Minolta Memory Stick Computer and video games Bullet time Table tennis Widescreen Doom 3 Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 MiniDisc Snooker Tungsten Handheld Photo sharing DV Bluetooth Compiler optimization Hubble Space Telescope Guilty Gear Cinematography Multiplayer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Bubble Bobble RISC Natural Selection (computer game) Anamorphic widescreen Golf club (equipment) R-Type JPEG Panavision Sound Blaster Technicolor Web page

what is a good camera it needs to be under to have video with sound to have good battery life and it would be better if it had a cool design first of all i'd buy a camera from a camera maker not an electronics company camera makers understand how photographers operate and they usually provide the tools you need not only to get outstanding pictures but also to set the camera quickly frankly casio sucks they're into electronics and gadgets not photography camera makers that are around include nikon canon pentax olympus and kodak these companies understand cameras and photographers however kodak builds only simple cameras that have limited functionality and reliability problems i've known many with a kodak digital and they all replaced them eventually if you look through all the questions here you'll also find more about inoperative kodaks than any other brand kodak is great if you want to spend as little money as possible and don't mind getting only a year of average pictures out of it their strengths are simplicity and low price nothing else olympus reliability isn't that good either and they use proprietary products so when you buy their memory cards you can't use those cards in any other camera except an olympus this is not usually a good situation to be in you may eventually want to replace it with another brand so you don't want to have to buy your memory cards all over again pentax builds a relatively good camera and offers the best bundled software available for handling your images pentax too though isn't as reliable as one would like however it's certainly better than olympus and kodak nikon and canon build the best point and shoot cameras and both use standard memory cards they're reliable and produce outstanding pictures i use a canon point shoot a powershot g which is an amazing camera that is highly reliable and incredibly well built in addition to being replete with features i also use a nikon d slr which is also an incredible camera you really can't go wrong with either of these brands now after deciding which brands you would consider think about what specific features you need video with sound clearly is a feature and a good battery life is too but you also need to decide whether you want to have anything to do with taking the picture or you just want to push the button and have the camera make all the decisions this is an important choice it will affect the final cost of the camera as well as how it is to use another feature to consider is the amount of zoom usually the more the better and it's handy to have a flash that covers a reasonable distance once you're clear on your requirements have a camera store salesperson help you by pointing out the models that apply to your requirements and your budget take that list home and look those up on camera reviews on the internet determine which are the most reliable and which produce good quality pictures once you've sorted that out return to the camera store and hold each of the few left on your list often the deciding factor after you've established your requirements and reliability and quality is how it feels in the hand if you've got huge pudgy hands a small camera is a disaster you'll never be able to push the buttons if you have small slim hands a small one is idea and a large one would seem like too much so make your final decisions based on how it feels in your hands remember you're going to be holding it a lot after you buy it finally in terms of your budget remember there's more to it than just the camera you may also need to buy a charger and rechargeable aa batteries nimh ones rated at mah at minimum which can run about and you'll need a memory card too even if the camera suppiles you with one you'd be looking at likely mb to about gb which would also run you about to depending on capacity and speed so keep that in mind for your budget too otherwise you'll be in for a real surprise when you get to the cash desk i hope that helps a little  Leica

can i fix a scratch on a camera lens or is it done for can't see the scratch in photos i appear to have knocked my new lens and there is a fairly obvious mark evn though i can not see it on the lcd playback is this fixable or have i just made a v expensive mistake a scratch on the lens will not affect sharpness of pictures it will introduce a little flare when bright objects are in shot and reduce contrast a tiny bit you don't say what the camera is but a professional fix could cost as much as a new mid range camera whatever you do don't try to fix it yourself the best you can do is to make it worse i think your best plan is to just carry on using it until you get round to an upgrade and be more careful next time  Digital photography Photography Photographic lens Stereoscopy View camera Gramophone record Digital camera Single-lens reflex camera Cinematography Leica Movie projector Panoramic photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camera Technicolor Laserdisc Konica Minolta Television Camcorder Anamorphic widescreen Contax Canon T90 Depth of field Zoom lens Pixel Eyepiece Internal ballistics Phonograph Cinerama Binoculars Headlight Apollo 8 Photographic film Galileo spacecraft Combine (Half-Life 2) Machinima Digital cinematography Macro photography Lens (optics) Canon EOS Airsoft Dog High-definition television Widescreen Point and shoot camera Reflecting telescope Clarinet Solar eclipse F-number TFT LCD Road-rule enforcement camera Opportunity rover Automatic number plate recognition Videocassette recorder General Dynamics F-111 Drill bit Sun Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Diamond November (film) Radar Eye Joel and Ethan Coen MIM-23 Hawk 8 mm video format Amateur astronomy Billiards Zerg Deep Impact (space mission) Film Canon FD Secret photography Radio controlled airplane Gamma ray burst Digital cinema DVD Laptop Liquid crystal display Digital image editing Contact lens Atari 8-bit family Traffic light System/36 Slide rule Liquid crystal display television Hubble Space Telescope All Aussie Adventures Zire Handheld Autostereogram Nikon FA Platform game Very Long Baseline Interferometry Sunglasses Gamut 70 mm film IBM PC compatible Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Inkjet printer ITunes Eyeglass prescription

how can i prevent others from seeing my photos on a digital camera how are they saved i'll soon have use of a digital camera but will be sharing the camera with my child who plans to use the camera often with friends how can i be sure my pictures are not stored on the camera itself or mixed in with other pictures i was told i'll need some type of memory card are all the photos only saved on those cards and no where on the camera itself similar to a computer which means i would simply use a seperate memory card from my child thanks p s i read that digital cameras have built in computers and i know on computes even when you erase or delete things they can still be retrieved by someone with enough knowledge is that not the same with digital cameras yeah i would say that the best way is to get memory cards one for you and one for your kid just remember to set it up on your camera to save everything to the memory card if they have that option because i know that some camera have like a small amount of built in memory like about mb so when there's no memory card inside it will automatically save them there and be sure to label your memory cards too so they don't mixed up and get a bigger capacity for you and a smaller on for you kid  Digital photography Secure Digital card Floppy disk Computer XD-Picture Card Hard disk Digital camera File Allocation Table CompactFlash Memory card Surveillance Flash memory IPod Windows Vista Compact disc CPU design SmartMedia USB flash drive Trusted computing Atari 8-bit family CPU cache ITunes Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Analog-to-digital converter Cardcaptor Sakura Windows 2000 Octopus card MRAM Photography UNIVAC Apple Computer Memory Stick Nintendo Revolution The Sims 2 Bluetooth Digital circuit Virtual memory History of computing hardware Gramophone record Mouse (computing) Digital image editing Game controller Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DV Digital Konica Minolta High-definition television View camera Laserdisc Closed-circuit television DVD Nintendo GameCube Computer numbering formats Expert system PlayStation 3 8 mm video format Multimedia Card Privacy Napier's bones Microdrive RISC Central processing unit Oscilloscope AmigaOS IPAQ Road-rule enforcement camera Modem Computer storage Computer forensics Telephone exchange IBM 1620 Our Gang Apple II family PlayStation 2 Image Biometrics Topps PDP-8 PlayStation Portable Autostereogram Code: Lyoko Credit card Compact audio cassette The Amazing Race Raw image format Pixel Anamorphic widescreen Gmail Read-only memory Image file formats TRS-80 Poker jargon Pornography Computer printer Computer virus Automatic teller machine Yearbook Xbox 360

zoom problem my camera has digital zoom but when i try to zoom in even a little bit it is so completely out of focus theres no sense in even taking the picture i dont remember if it has always been like that or not so im not sure if its just because its digital or if theres some setting i messed up its a samsung a thanks unfortunately your camera does not have optical zoom it only has digital zoom and that's why your photos look terrible if you use the zoom to get in closer to your subject the only real way to make sure your photos are ok is if you do not use the zoom at all in future when you wish to upgrade to a better camera please make sure it has optical zoom and be sure to never use or activate the digital zoom function good luck  Digital camera Leica Zoom lens Konica Minolta Photography Nikon Corporation Modem Anamorphic widescreen View camera Photographic lens Cinematography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camcorder Macro photography Contax Canon EOS Image Aperture Panoramic photography Mouse (computing) Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Point and shoot camera Camera Motion picture terminology Dolly zoom Single-lens reflex camera Binoculars Canon EF lens mount Tracking shot Digital circuit MIM-23 Hawk Lens (optics) Film Blu-ray Disc Schneider Kreuznach Street photography Photograph Panavision Raw image format Movie camera Rangefinder camera Amateur astronomy Samsung Secure Digital card Late Night with Conan O'Brien Fantasia (film) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Windows Vista Rendering (computer graphics) Oscilloscope Nintendo 64 Sensor Digital Video Flash memory Enterprise content management Depth of field Digital camera back Electronic journalism Ken Burns Organic light-emitting diode Computer vision Widescreen Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Cable television Motion capture Aliasing Hey Jude Dither High-definition television Autofocus Closed-circuit television File sharing Computer animation CPU design Autostereogram Digital video Super Mario Sunshine Hubble Space Telescope Digital television Personal digital assistant ATI Technologies Circle of confusion Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Copy protection Road-rule enforcement camera Digital cinema Hardware random number generator Universal Serial Bus Camera phone Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Google Maps 16 mm film Federal Standard 1037C The Bill Zeiss Space Mountain Max Headroom

please help how can i get a shot of my son jumping off the diving board last weekend we went to my husband's family reuion which was on a college campus my nine year old son jumped off the diving board into feet i was able to take pictures on my cell phone camera but could not get any on my digital camera i could only get ones of the water splash with my son already in the water please help our neighborhood pool does not have a diving board but if you can help me i would like to take him to a nearby pool that does to get some pictures of him jumping off the diving board your problem comes about because of the way the camera works when you press the shutter the camera assesses the light and sets the exposure guesses what the best white balance is focuses and then takes the shot on older cheaper cameras this process could take as much as a second whilst a second doesn't seem like much as you are no doubt learning an energetic young child can do a lot in a second and your shot can be gone the newer cameras are getting faster but this delay can still prevent you getting the shot how do we fix this one approach involves doing as much as you can for the camera before taking the shot if your camera allows try to set the exposure yourself and also pre focus the camera this will involve using those scary manual modes and perhaps reading the manual another approach is to pre time the shot this involves hold the camera still and pressing the shutter a second too early it's difficult at first but with a little practice you will get the hang of it even with very high speed slr cameras there is still a small delay and professional sports photographers have this delay down to a fine art either way you have a little reading and or practice to do you are now moving off the ground level with your photography into a more advanced mode enjoy the ride  Digital photography Photography Canon T90 Camera Single-lens reflex camera Leica View camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Konica Minolta Panoramic photography Diving Stereoscopy Parachuting Movie projector Shutter speed Street photography Cinematography Skateboarding trick Quake III Arena Rangefinder camera Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Mouse (computing) Floppy disk GunZ The Duel Surveillance Drowning Film Nikon FM2 Photographic lens Camcorder Point and shoot camera Contax Oscilloscope RISC Professional wrestling aerial techniques Swimming pool Time-lapse Volleyball Macro photography Nikon FA Road-rule enforcement camera Rebreather Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Modem Central processing unit Twin-lens reflex camera Professional wrestling attacks Nikon FE Digital cinema Nikon FE2 Pinhole camera Bluetooth Solar power Apollo 8 Bullet time Amateur astronomy The Sims 2 Decompression sickness Electrophysiology Automatic number plate recognition Photographic film Photojournalism Charge-coupled device Enlarger CPU design F-number Nikon Corporation Technicolor Equine conformation Nikon FM Welding Henri Cartier-Bresson Weight training Natural Selection (computer game) Air traffic control Prostate cancer Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Deep Impact (space mission) Atari 8-bit family USS Tunny (SS-282) Motion capture Blood (computer game) Photograph Telephone exchange National Football League Canon T70 Computer and video game genres Digital cinematography

hp photoshop m question i recently bought an hp photoshop m and i was out taking some pictures at a wrestling show when i downloaded my pics i noticed that the flash kinda died at the tops of the heads of the people in front of me and not what's going in the ring is there something i should check first or is it just a matter of going over the heads of the individuals the flash bounces off the nearest object and fools the camera into thinking the exposure is good either lift the camera over heads or turn the flash off a flash on a small camera like that is only good for feet anyway sporting events typically have fairly bright lighting  Stereoscopy Photography Canon T90 Professional wrestling throws Digital camera Macro photography B3ta Digital photography Adobe Photoshop Parallax Suplex Professional wrestling slang Road-rule enforcement camera Goatse.cx World Championship Wrestling Panoramic photography Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Professional wrestling Mars Exploration Rover Camera Shaggy dog story Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Gamma ray burst Konica Minolta Table tennis Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Surveillance Canon EOS Lightning Professional wrestling attacks Leica Professional wrestling holds Spirit rover Closed-circuit television View camera Traffic light Internet phenomenon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Something Awful Forums Boom Town (Doctor Who) Film Something Awful GunZ The Duel Automatic number plate recognition Parachuting Color temperature New York Giants Professional wrestling match types Pornography Opportunity rover Flash (photography) Hubble Deep Field Professional wrestling aerial techniques Twin-lens reflex camera Equine conformation Determinism Depth of field Cassini-Huygens Movie projector Bicycle lighting Traditional animation Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Photographic lens Digital image editing Internet fraud Marching band Lightsaber Extraterrestrial skies Combine (Half-Life 2) Batting (cricket) Sun Universal Serial Bus Rail terminology Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Horse gait Sumo Flash (comics) Red-eye effect Game show Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Paintball IPod Unidentified flying object Prank flash Care Bears Mixed martial arts Mercury 4 Black hole Speed of light Slayers Boxing Cat's Eye Nebula Oscilloscope Volleyball Light-emitting diode Street photography Baseball

olympus camera warentee ok i have the olympus fe it kinda fell now something inside it is blocking the lense so you cant take pics but the camera itself still works when your not taking pictures does the warentee still apply i've had my camera less than a year if that helps thanks wow your camera works for everything but taking pictures then well that's the most important feature of a camera so you would need to get it fixed or replaced you will need to check your warranty papers to see how long the warranty is but they don't usually cover damage from dropping so you will need to pay for the repair how much did your camera cost new if it's a small pocket camera you will honestly be better off just replacing it with a new one and being more careful with the replacement i checked and it's a camera with a day warranty sorry you need a new one  Canon T90 Photography Single-lens reflex camera Digital photography Warranty Road-rule enforcement camera View camera Camera Screenplay Solar eclipse Konica Minolta Endoscopy Olympus (company) Product liability Photographic lens Cinematography Rangefinder camera Film Implied warranty Oscilloscope Escape from New York Digital single-lens reflex cameras Stereoscopy Schneider Kreuznach Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Canon EOS Macro photography Surveillance Pinhole camera Panoramic photography Shutter speed Apple Computer Goatse.cx Depth of field Grey market Secure Digital card Binoculars Mars Leasehold estate Movie camera The Amazing Race Universal Serial Bus Hubble Space Telescope High-definition television Computer virus Gramophone record GunZ The Duel Four Thirds System Movie projector Auto insurance Apollo 8 Mars Exploration Rover Digital camera Ranger program Technicolor Toyota Prius Assignment (law) Papal election Open access The Daleks' Master Plan Land Rover Health insurance Automatic number plate recognition IPod Poker jargon Tamper resistance Point and shoot camera XD-Picture Card Parallax Pentax Full frame digital SLR Nikon Corporation Digital camera back London Congestion Charge Karl Rove Sony CPU cache Tire Digital cinematography Master of Olympus - Zeus Leica Laserdisc Copyleft Zire Handheld Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Filmmaking Traditional animation Cinerama Closed-circuit television Texas hold 'em Betting (poker) Underwater photography Ocean's Twelve Knife Canon EOS-300D Haibane Renmei Panavision STS-61 Steadicam

digital slr question i am debating weather to buy the canon d rebel xti or th nikon d advice ok full disclosure i own a d and it is the perfect camera for me the d is also a nice camera and as already suggested at least of the decision between these two fine products will come down to personal preference hold each camera and let your fingers fall on the controls are they in the right place use the menus is one better laid out than the other take a photo with each how does it feel the d does better in my book with having a true spot meter which i use the canon has a center weighted metering but not a true spot meter hopefully dr sam will see this question and if he answers his points will be well worth considering either way you are going to end up with a really nice camera  Canon EOS Konica Minolta Digital single-lens reflex cameras Leica Nikon Corporation View camera Advanced Photo System Nikon D70 Canon T90 Nikon FA Nikon FM Nikon FM2 Nikon FE Opportunity rover Nikon FE2 Single-lens reflex camera Point and shoot camera Canon Inc.

what to look for in a new digital slr i want to get deep into photography and plan on going to college for it we have a casio elixim ev mp point and shoot at the moment it takes good pictures but i want to purchase a digital slr with at least mp i want more control and i want to learn how to use more manual settings and learn more about the different aspects of photography so what should i look for when searching the sites for a camera also is there a good site to get good free classes or information on how to use the manual settings and the overall use of a camera with a digital slr or digital point and shoot congratulations on considering a dslr above all when considering a digital slr you must consider that you will be the person using it day in and day out therefore you must feel comfortable using the camera regardless of megapixels after all if a camera is so uncomfortable to use that it sits in it's case all the time it doesn't matter how nice of a camera it is my first piece of advice to you is to go to your local best buy circuit city etc and actually touch the cameras hold them in your hands and take a few pictures with it adjusting the zoom and focus once you find something you like then start looking at the details if you intend on doing a lot of cropping look for a camera with megapixels or more nikon d x canon digital rebel if that's not a consideration you can save hundreds of dollars by purchasing a camera such as a nikon d which is a six megapixel camera also remember that dslr images are significantly larger files than standard point and shoot camera images upwards of mb each therefore look for a high speed you'll thank yourself later memory card that is either or gb as far as websites for everything digital visit http www kenrockwell com hope this helps  Konica Minolta Digital camera Nikon Corporation Leica Canon EOS Single-lens reflex camera Nikon D70 View camera Canon T90 Secure Digital card Photography Digital cinema Digital camera back Rangefinder camera Camera Stereoscopy Nikon FA Cinematography Nikon FE2 Camcorder Panoramic photography Nikon FM2 Advanced Photo System Photographic lens Canon EOS-300D Point and shoot camera Street photography Contax Macro photography Nikon FE Computer Closed-circuit television Zoom lens Movie projector Anamorphic widescreen World Wide Web Mouse (computing) Panavision Nikon FM Binoculars Pentax Supply and demand Depth of field Road-rule enforcement camera Oscilloscope Raw image format Digital circuit Medium format Floppy disk Image file formats Digital image editing Canon EF lens mount Digital Yearbook IBM PC compatible Image Windows Vista Game controller Full frame digital SLR Extreme Programming PlayStation 3 135 film High-definition television Amateur astronomy Starfleet ranks and insignia MAME Television Motion capture Film Spyware Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Charge-coupled device The Inside ITunes Circle of confusion Screenplay Photojournalism Screenshot EXpanded MultiPlayer Computer vision 35 mm film Opportunity rover Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Warez Theory of conduct Uniform Resource Locator Analog-to-digital converter Aperture PlayStation Portable Traditional animation

good camera im looking for a camera thats like good for taking pictures of people i already have a kodak easy share z which is great for taking pictures of landscapes and stuff but when i take pictures of myself or friends the camera always like messes up the colour its weird because when you look at the screen before you take the pic everything looks fine but after it makes all the colour different and it just doesnt take very good pictures of people so anyways does anyone know of a good camera that doesnt cost too much that would be good for taking pics of people thanks according to steves digicams com your kodak z takes wonderful pictures including in the portrait mode you should be reminded that even though the picture in the lcd screen may be off colored due to artificial lighting the final printout is what determines the actual color output so don't conclude prematurely that the camera is not properly taking what you see in the lcd it's not a true view you should go and have those portraits processed into prints so you can see for yourself how wonderful the z captures difficult lighting portraits good luck  Digital camera Digital photography Stereoscopy Color Liquid crystal display Photographic film Camera Pixel Traditional animation Gamut Oscilloscope Movie projector Technicolor Organic light-emitting diode Film Panoramic photography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Game Boy Television Anamorphic widescreen View camera Camcorder Digital cinema Opportunity rover Widescreen Super 8 mm film Eastman Kodak Drawing CMYK color model Surveillance Cinematography Instant camera Leica Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Plasma display Computer animation TFT LCD Canon T90 Henri Cartier-Bresson Screenplay Handheld game console Cinerama Tungsten Handheld Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Screenshot Anaglyph image Movie camera Computer display Liquid crystal display television Sharp Zaurus Transparency (photography) IMac Canon EOS Care Bears System/36 Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Computer printer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Digital cinematography Photograph Color temperature Hello world program Plasma (physics) RGB color model Closed-circuit television Sega Saturn 3-D film The Ashlee Simpson Show Enterprise content management Dot matrix printer Traffic light Laserdisc Road-rule enforcement camera Parallax Digital camera back Autostereogram Requirements analysis Charge-coupled device Nintendo DS Social rule Color management Rise of Nations High-definition television PostScript Film speed The Amazing Race Typewriter Contax Polarization IMAX Film stock Light-emitting diode Game Boy Camera Late Night with Conan O'Brien

digital camera buying whats the best here's the specs im looking for m p min prefered optical zoom min x prefered x face detection is a plus image stabilization is a plus smart flash correction is a plus i saw a camera that has a setting to take two pictures with one click one with flash the other without i want both auto and manual focus options i want to have manual options for most everything shutter f stop etc auto settings are a plus night landscape fireworks portrait etc having the option to attach different lenses is a huge plus im going to be taking lots of outdoor pictures in the mountains and of wildlife so i want to have big time zoom capability i also want to be able to attach filters for uv etc im also going to be using the camera for indoor pictures family party etc slr would ve nice but not required movie sound great i would like the price to be under for the camera and under after lenses filters tripod memory batery etc what do you guys think about fujifilm finepix line i can get any of these under s fd s fd s s s http www fujifilm com products digital cameras s finepix s fd specifications index html i use several standard answers but i don't give the same freaking answer for every single question regardless of whether it is helpful or not i don't know why this bothers me tonight but it does the pentax optio w is mp the optical zoom is only x it does not have full manual exposure control you are describing a digital slr in your spec list but you will have a hard time getting that kind of optical zoom for your budget so called optical zoom is not used as a measure of lens power in slr's anyhow here's a camera for you to consider it's not exactly what you have specified but i think it will perform better than you expect for the money look at a nikon d with the lens this is available from b h photo see yahoo shopping for techincally speaking is x zoom but it's the raw number that matters see http www flickr com photos samfeinstein for an idea what this lens covers look at the actual numbers and not the equivalent numbers would give you the first six pictures and every single focal length in between on a point and shoot super zoom camera you will find that they have a range but it is covered in steps so you end up with maybe different focal lengths instead of different focal lengths you can use auto exposure or any of the various scene modes as well as the infamous p a s and m modes for various degrees of exposure control up to full manual control this m is direct too and you don't have to play with menus to change your settings the way you do with a p s camera this is much faster you can use manual or auto focus you can choose from about lenses that give functionality on this camera and hundreds that do everything except auto focus see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses or see http www nikonians org cgi bin dcforum dcboard cgi az read count om forum dcforumid for even more obviously you can attach filters of all kinds which is a chore with p s cameras if it is possible at all with the d you are not getting your preferred mp but you are getting a sensor that is huge compared to p s cameras check out this tutorial and read the caption http www flickr com photos samfeinstein bear in mind that all of the currently available super zooms have the smaller sensor you will have so much more sharpness with a mp slr sensor than a mp sensor that it's not even funny you are giving up the following from your list no movies face detection many people defeat this after they see how much it slows the camera down just focus on the face and recompose you can find the face faster than the camera can the camera does not have image stabilization i agee that this is a plus but as you add a lens or two just buy a nikon vr lens they do cost a bit more but they are not insanely expensive my wife just got a very useful vr lens for i don't know what smart flash correction is but you can vary the output of the on board d flash some p s cameras might have a larger aperture that makes them seem better suited for low light but again the tiny sensor defeats any attempts to take really low light shots an slr will do much better in low light because of the larger sensor to get an idea what normal people can do using auto on the d check out check out nikon's picturetown promotion where they handed out d 's in georgetown sc http www stunningnikon com picturetown here are a few reviews in case you have not read them yet be sure to note that they are several pages long and some of the reviews also have some sample images that you can look at http www dpreview com reviews nikond http www steves digicams com reviews nikon d html http www popphoto com cameras camera

nikon d or d thinking of upgrading my nikon d for a trip to nepal later this year i've read lots of reviews on both the d and d i'm edging toward the d should i be worried about the extra weight are nikon about to upgrade the d intoduce new model should i wait a couple months or take the plunge now so i can get up to speed with new functions i'm not sure why you would upgrade from the d your not going to see you picture magically improve to any noticable point with either the d or d at least not any improvement that would justify the cost not to mention its very likely nikon will be discarding both those cameras with new models in the next months and before you listen to the poster suggesting the d realize that the d doesn't have a built in motor for auto focus so depending on which lenses you have already they may work fine or they may only be manual focus with the d if your dead set on a new camera you might well consider the fuji s pro at least with that camera you would see an improvement in the picture quality and still be able to use all your current nikon lenses  Digital photography Leica View camera Konica Minolta Rangefinder camera Nikon D70 Nikon FE Single-lens reflex camera Binoculars Nikon FM Nikon FM2 Camera Photographic lens Photography Canon T90 Nikon FA Mouse (computing) Point and shoot camera Movie projector Floppy disk Panoramic photography Secure Digital card Extreme Programming Road-rule enforcement camera Apollo 8 Camcorder Oscilloscope Depth of field Widescreen Contax Radeon Space Shuttle program Cinematography EXpanded MultiPlayer Panavision Film Speed limit Television Macro photography Natural Selection (computer game) Autostereogram Bicycle lighting Digital camera Stereoscopy MS-06 Zaku II Resident Evil 4 Auto rickshaw Automatic number plate recognition Ford Mustang Medium format Lens (optics) P-51 Mustang Dassault Mirage III Anamorphic widescreen Audi Strategic management Battery electric vehicle PlayStation 2 Commodore 128 Information Technology Infrastructure Library Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March CPU cache Personal rapid transit Redundant array of independent disks Traffic light Pentax Walkman Windows Vista Closed-circuit television Auto racing Stage lighting Ford Thunderbird Driver's license Automatic transmission Disposable camera Porsche 911 Digital cinema Movie camera Digital cinematography Piccolo Junior Saga Canon PowerShot G Bloodstain pattern analysis Technicolor Mitsubishi 3000GT Mac OS X F-number Automobile ATI Technologies Windows XP Street photography Headlight Raw image format Jet engine Ford Focus DVD

which camera is best for beginner i am going to college to study photography with the hope at the end of the year course of setting up my own business i want to buy my first 'real' camera to get me started and was wondering what type would be best ie sony nikon canon etc i want a good one that will last me a long time not just through my studies i was looking at the nikon d but not sure if i should start with something a little 'less professional' also can anyone suggest the best place to get such cameras and accessories i am in the uk thanx if you are thinking of doing photography seriously then you'll have the best choice of optics if you go down the canon or nikon route both systems have their die hard afficianados the nikon system is more backwards compatible as in you can buy many older mf lenses to fit and still work to some degree on current nikons that said canon lenses from the last years should work on any current eos camera a couple of things to consider buy a good body just now no harm to the budget models but they tend to lack some of the features you'll want you will need a camera with a 'pc' socket for studio flash you will need a camera with spot metering so you are looking up the range a wee bit also forget the kit lenses buy a body only and get a sigma there are two versions one at around one at around both are better than the supplied lenses that canon and nikon ship with their budget bodies buy the best you can afford canon tend to have the edge for professional photojournalists they have better af and faster buffers but don t expect any pro camera to be cheap most importantly go into a shop and handle the cameras both are good but a lot of it will come down to which one fits best in your hand the canon system tends to have more versatility in that they have full frame and aps c frame cameras in their range a lot of folk really rate the eos d but be warned it isn't as fast as the eos 's or nikon d 's but it is full frame better for wide angle in partiuclar canons ef lenses not ef s are suitable for both canon eos film and digital cameras nikons dx lenses don t work so well on film cameras though any other f mount lens will af d af g etc the other advice might be just to get a cheapish manual film camera something like a pentax k or a nikon fe or fm these will force you into learning the absolute basics and reward the effort you put in just check your college still uses darkrooms first if you buy a nikon fe or fm then you would be able to use this system lenses along side a nikon digital system in the future though nions digital dx lenses won t work with the old manual bodies so not a straight forward answer but not a straight forward question as i said the important thing is to buy something that feels right in the hand it's hard to buy a bad camea these days just make sure it's going to be comfortable in use if you buy a budget end dslr you might be kicking yourself in a couple of months go and see the folk at calumet they have the best prices even compared to the internet and helpful staff who'll give you good advice they don t have that many shops and they only open office hours but they make up for it with everything else enjoy the course and good luck  Camera Single-lens reflex camera Nikon D70 Binoculars Full frame digital SLR Nikon FM2 Nikon FA Canon EF lens mount Rangefinder camera Cinematography Movie projector Photographic lens Advanced Photo System Nikon FE2 Pentax Nikon FM Contax Floppy disk Stereoscopy Macro photography DVD Digital camera Canon EOS-300D Panoramic photography Digital camera back Bicycle lighting Canon FD Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Medium format Strap-on dildo Equine conformation Film PlayStation Portable Canon PowerShot G Mouse (computing) Compact audio cassette Amateur astronomy IMAX IPod Charge-coupled device Canon Inc.

what do you think of this canon combination i am brand new to the world of dslrs having been in the world of normal digital photography for a few years i have come into some money and thought i would finally splash out on a dslr but i want it to last the rest of my life i'm unlikely to be able to afford going to another one although i may increase my lens collection i photograph macro and wildlife eg deer birds here's the combination i came up with canon d body canon ef mm f usm canon ef mm f usm macro lens canon ef mm f hama tripod star ef digital have i made any enormous mistakes here anyone have experience with this kit i'd be really grateful for your help as this is unchartered territory for me and i want to get it right first time i'd like really sharp proffesional looking results thanks for both the answers so far the second one has been particularly helpful i have decided to go with the d the aforementioned macro lens and a canon ef s zoom lens mm is usm the lens you suggested looked amazing but a tad too expensive this is a wide angle but cheaper when faced with the same problem you have i bought a nikon d but that's not your question first of all probably no electronic device camera included will last the rest of your life but the canon d stands a much better chance of lasting than the d please consider that the crop factor aka lens factor lens multiplier etc with a canon dslr you are completely lacking anything in the wide angle end since you are familiar with mm focal lengths you might think that mm is the normal lens but it is not normal for a d or d is more like mm because the crop factor is x mm x mm your lenses as listed would equal the performance of mm f mm f macro mm f if you don't want any wide angle i have no problem with that but i don't want you to be surprised that is going to be a monster to control without image stabilization unless you always use the lens on a tripod you might consider getting a canon is lens the mm should be a good macro lens and it seems to be reviewed well the mm is an okay lens as long as you know that this is not going to be your normal lens but maybe you'd like the f better the f is a killer lens but costs over if you want a normal lens for your dslr look at the canon wide angle ef mm f autofocus lens for if you want a faster lens there is always the mm f l series but that's over canon lenses with the l in the name and red band around the barrel are their pro line of lenses some lens snobs say if you ain't gort an l lens you ain't got nuthin' or close to that is means image stabilization and this is a good thing for long lenses the canon ef s mm f is usm equiv april is a good walk around lens at a good price http www usa canon com consumer controller act modeldetailact fcategoryid modelid http www the digital picture com reviews canon ef s mm f is usm lens review aspx not quite as much of a wide angle the canon zoom wide angle telephoto ef mm f l is usm autofocus lens is a pretty good all around lens this review says if i had only one lens this would be the one http www the digital picture com reviews canon ef mm f l is usm lens review aspx if you got the as your main lens you would be very happy and you could supplement it with the canon zoom telephoto ef mm f is image stabilizer usm autofocus lens for and you'd be pretty well covered i'd much rather see you get the is lens at this focal length if you don't know about this ask another question and i'll send you my link neither one goes close than so you'd be lacking in the true macro range but the mm you mentioned is not crazy expensive since you are looking at the long haul here i'd even rather see you get one lens probably the and the d if you don't have the cash to buy more stuff now in the long run i think you will be happier i didn't count the tripod but your list totals about my d the lens totals i see b h has the canon eos d megapixel slr digital camera kit with canon mm f ef s is usm autofocus lens for it's not an l lens but it's a decent lens and it has a lot of range covered here are some popular canon lens review sites i like the first one quite a lot look at the

which place is best to buy a digital camera tax free holiday is coming to my town this weekend i need a camera for my science project out of these three places which is the place to buy a camera considering the quality and price target best buy circuit city and what is the best brand names for a camera sony samsung other thanks target best buy circuit city and even staples have good cameras you just have to bargain shop target and best buy probably will have the biggest selection there is a lot that you look for when your looking to buy camera first off you can get a camera with a lot of mega pixels which is good if your blowing up pictures but on a x or x photo you will not see the difference between a mega pixel and a mega pixel camera because they are so close together in my opinion the best camera is sony because they have a carl ziess lens which makes a great quality picture cannon is a good camera too because they are originally a microscope company that puts really good lens on their cameras nikon is a good quality camera too kodak is good as well and has a high optical zoom which is always nice but ultimately its what camera fits your needs the best and what your comfortable with and what looks good so good luck  Digital photography Leica View camera Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Contax Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Camera Photography Panavision Binoculars Single-lens reflex camera Photographic lens Rangefinder camera Closed-circuit television Zeiss Digital camera Movie projector Anamorphic widescreen Cinematography Macro photography Charge-coupled device Digital camera back Digital cinema Canon Inc.

is this a good lens for a starter user http jessops com store s lenses sigma mm f and dg macro canon af details aspx issearch y pageindex catid comp n i want to be able to do some pretty close up macro shots on plants and stuff as well as normal photos i have a kit lens aswell but no macro is this a good lens for what i want to do it's going to be attached to a canon eos d rebel xt thanks im so amateur that i cant tell if this is actually compatible with my camera stated above before i order it is it compatible with my camera thanks again yes the lens is compatible with your camera so it should work ok as to the macro setting what this means is that the lens is capable of going closer to the subject than is normally expected of a telephoto however this lens only goes down to what that means in english is that the best you can do with it is get your subject onto your sensor in half life size if you're into doing flowers and things of that size you'll love the lens it will achieve those scales providing you with really nice macro shots on the other hand if you're into doing tiny things like small insects one of my specialities this lens will not do it for that you want a lens that goes down to life size basically you want to be able to render the subject the same size on the sensor as it is in real life for that capability you would need a true macro lens what's also nice about this lens is that you can stand well back from your subject many shorter macro lenses have you crawling up to your subject sometimes within millimetres this one give you a great working distance but you may have to also consider a tripod when you use it in macro work you want to close down your lens as much as possible to optomize depth of field but that then leads to slower shutter speeds the size and weight of the lens makes it unlikely you'll be able to hand hold all of your shots and an added bonus too the lens is also a nice range for general work and wildlife so it will probaly make you happy for quite a number of years in terms of quality you get what you pay for sigma makes good lenses so it' s not a bad lens at all it will five you sharp images and good contrasts and it's unlikely there will be any optical distortions but it is also rather slow at f f for example i have i have a fixed length macro that is mm and has a maximum aperture of f those extra stops sometimes make the difference between getting the picture or not when the lighting is poor however my lens in pounds cost around pounds which is of course a wee bit more than you're looking at i'd say go for the lens and enjoy it later as you get more sophisticated you may end up replacing it but by then you'll also know why you want to spend the money and you'll consider it good value at that time and until then you'll have a lot of outstanding pictrues that you can be proud of i hope that helps a little  Canon T90 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Eyepiece Depth of field Stereoscopy Leica Cinematography Binoculars Canon EOS Aperture Contax F-number Konica Minolta Canon EF lens mount Zoom lens Reflecting telescope Canon FD Street photography Panoramic photography Nikon Corporation Rangefinder camera Camcorder Digital camera Movie projector Aberration in optical systems Photographic film Bokeh Amateur astronomy IMAX Floppy disk Pinhole camera Telescope Canon T70 Film speed Mouse (computing) Fast bowling Radar Eye Schneider Kreuznach Lens (optics) Widescreen Microscope Hubble Space Telescope Antenna (radio) Parallax Bicycle lighting Galileo spacecraft Normal distribution Internal ballistics Shutter (photography) Microeconomics Digital camera back Four Thirds System Clementine mission Explosive material Tank Atari 8-bit family 2000 Australian Grand Prix DVD Ammunition Autostereogram M16 (rifle) Automatic number plate recognition Gamma ray burst Enlarger Nintendo Revolution Advanced Photo System Autofocus Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Sensor GunZ The Duel Geographic information system Bluetooth Insurance Exposure (photography) Drag racing Equine conformation General relativity Technicolor Canon PowerShot G Terminal ballistics Star Trek Customizable Card Game Panavision PlayStation Portable Macro Oscilloscope Cinerama Traffic light

help i'm a slr newbie lenses ok ive ordered a canon eos d rebel xt and it's for a photography course at school so i need it ready soon was looking at a review and most have said the kit lens is trash pointless i pretty much want to do basic photographs to start off with but i have some knowledge in photography so i don't really want a bad lens to start with whats a decent lens for a starter like me one that isn't going to drop a bomb in my wallet ha thanks is this a good one just hit my eye becayse its and has macro http jessops com store s lenses sigma mm f and dg macro canon af details aspx issearch y pageindex catid comp n there isn't anything wrong with the kit lens for your purposes you will learn and develope your own techniques in class but a lot of people tend to go one way or another when it comes to lenses i prefer to stick with primes and let my feet do the 'zooming' for me where others prefer zooms i have a couple of each and use them depending on the situation if i am at a sporting event for example and i can't get in close to the action i will use a zoom but if i am doing something out in the open where i am free to move about i will use primes a great website for advice on all things photographic is www popphoto com sign up for the forums its free and ask all the questions you want i havent been there in a while just been to damn busy but i found most of the people there to be very kind helpful and very knowledgable good luck and have fun ow also if you are taking a beginning level class i believe that you will start with film and then move to digital and if that is the case the camera you ordered wont do you much good since it is a digital camera however if you need a digital camera then that will be just fine for you i have an origianl rebel and a d if you can find a new one anywhere i would reccomend getting one they have more features and are built a little better than the rebel forgot to say a good starter lens if you get a zoom would be a mm canon makes one as do a few third party manufacturers i like the sigma lenses they work just as well as teh canon come in a canon mount and cost quite a bit less check out these sites for great prices on cameras and equipment www bhphoto com www adorama com www keh com www digitalfotoclub com and this one for great prices on batteries for your rebel around vs www mydigitaldiscount com if you have any other questions feel free to message email me those mm are nice but not overly usefull if you are shooting any kind of ation they are a little on the slow side plus you aren't getting any wide angle so everything will be sort of close up the macro feature on long zooms like that is ok but its not great and i believe it is only or life size magnification if you like macro you are best getting a dedicated macro lens i have the sigma mm macro and its nice but i would really like the canon macro that goes from times life size that lens is around like i was saying before for a starter lens you are best off with a wide to telephoto lens like a or or higher rather than a telephoto to a super telephot like a that lens is just a little too restricted my first slr had a mm lens on it and it served me very well  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography View camera Contax Canon EOS Photographic lens Leica Konica Minolta Canon T90 Single-lens reflex camera Zoom lens Digital camera Nikon Corporation Cinematography Schneider Kreuznach Stereoscopy Rangefinder camera Canon FD Digital camera back RuneScape cheats Binoculars Canon EF lens mount Drag racing Floppy disk Anamorphic widescreen Movie projector Camcorder Canon EOS-300D Computer virus Full frame digital SLR Nikon D70 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Theory of conduct C programming language Depth of field GunZ The Duel Lens (optics) Camera Shutter speed Street photography DVD Canon PowerShot G Advanced Photo System Social rule Amateur astronomy Eyepiece GunBound Widescreen Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aperture RuneScape Panoramic photography Medium format Canon EOS-20D Film Photographic film Secure Digital card Equine conformation Closed-circuit television Mouse (computing) B3ta Paintball CPU cache Quake III Arena Fast bowling Scientology beliefs and practices Oscilloscope Martial art Parachuting Dog agility Economics Internet fraud Strategic management Henri Cartier-Bresson Parallax Bicycle lighting Pure Pwnage Nikon FA Cinerama Pretty Good Privacy Gameplay of StarCraft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Poker jargon Pinhole camera Traditional animation Telescope Windows Vista Baseball RISC Panavision Macro Milton H.

buying a digital camera i am looking in to buying a camera and i have been told that canon is the best i am looking for something over mega pixels any suggestions this question is like asking who makes the best car or which is the best band the answer depends on personal preferences and taste canon is the most popular in the prosumer market and makes many point shoot models too saying you want over megapixels is like saying you want a car with at least horsepower it will haul a or a big load but it will use a lot of gas make sure that is what you really want other quality manufacturers in alphabetical order are fuji leica if you are so rich that money is no object nikon olympus pentax and sony some of the smaller companies such as fuji olympus and pentax will allow you to get much more for your money check out steve's digicams for reports and reviews on lots of makes and models the big objection i have to canon nikon are that they spend a fortune on advertising and then charge more for all their products you don't specify what type of photgraphy you want to do or how you want to use the camera but both fuji and olympus have a wide selection of models from p s point shoot to pro grade cameras so i would go to steve's and look at some of the resources and links he has camera reviews by the number of mp brand or type and help sorting out the terminology all of the reviews include sample photos steve's conclusions a summary evaluation of the model i hope this helps good luck please email if you have specific questions  Binoculars Nikon Corporation Konica Minolta Digital single-lens reflex cameras Leica Pentax Canon Inc.

must i have win or higher for my digital camera i have a kodak easyshare c digital camera and i have windows me on my computer the disc says i have to have win or higher and the computer doesn't recognize the device could i possibly download a program that could recognize the camera please help yes and no if the kodak software demands that you have win or higher then it definitely means it however there are other options technically any computer running win or later should be able to connect to the camera as long as you plug the camera in and turn it on before you boot up the computer that's the theory in practice sometimes the camera isn't recognized expecially by win usually because the operating system doesn't have a driver for it if that happens you can also consider getting a card reader what works with win or later again the trick is to connect it to a usb port before booting up the computer unless you're running win xp which can detect it immediately if the card reader comes with a cd install the cd and that will provide the needed driver if it doesn't come with a cd and also doesn't work download the driver from the manufacterer's web site and install it once that's done you can download your images from your card i hope that helps a little good luck  USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Windows XP Secure Digital card Bluetooth Digital photography Microsoft Windows Floppy disk IPod Linux Digital camera Knoppix Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hard disk MAME Common Unix Printing System Computer virus Digital rights management Modem Device driver USB mass storage device class IBM PC compatible Computer forensics History of Microsoft Windows Apple Newton BIOS PlayStation 3 OpenBSD File Allocation Table Nintendo Revolution Spyware FreeDOS Closed-circuit television LiveCD PlayStation 2 X Window System DVD Blue screen of death High-definition television Rootkit Digital audio player Windows Server 2003 Apple Computer Modchip Movie projector Architecture of Windows 2000 Copy protection Mouse (computing) Television Nintendo Entertainment System Computer hardware Flash memory Surveillance IMac Disk cloning N-Gage Malware Photography Visual Basic Computer bus Xbox 360 XD-Picture Card Atari ST Trusted computing Anti-virus software Mac OS X Personal computer ReactOS Wi-Fi PlayStation Portable Memory Stick ITunes System 7 (Macintosh) PDP-11 Embedded system Atari 8-bit family Screenshot Danger Hiptop Windows Me Windows 3.x DirectX Commodore 64 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Multifunction printer Hardware random number generator CPU design Ebook Tungsten Handheld

how can i lower the resolution of a digital picture so it will e mail faster don't do it in the camera unless you feel you will never enlarge the photo after all you spent more money to get a camera with a high mp sensor so use the highest resolution you can when shooting use the resizing feature in the software that came with your camera and resize it to x inches at dpi you may have to adjust the compression of the jpg file to around or to get a file that is under kb in size you can always make an image file smaller but not the other way round  Digital photography Pixel Digital image editing Image file formats Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Dots per inch Raw image format Image scanner Digital camera Bluetooth Macro photography Digital cinematography JPEG Ebook Windows Vista PlayStation Portable Spirit rover Digital video View camera QuickTime Widescreen Drill bit Hash table Raster graphics Stereoscopy Medium format Camcorder Motion capture High-definition television Digital cinema Digital camera back Depth of field IPhoto MP3 Television Hard disk Camera Floppy disk Tagged Image File Format Photographic lens Deep Impact (space mission) Charge-coupled device Goatse.cx Warez H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Portable Document Format Video IPod Schneider Kreuznach Anamorphic widescreen Game controller Pinhole camera NTFS Opportunity rover PNG Xbox Circle of confusion Danger Hiptop ITunes Geographic information system Reflecting telescope ReiserFS Movie projector Hubble Space Telescope Opera (web browser) Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Panoramic photography Telescope Dot matrix printer Nintendo GameCube Data compression Videotape Cinematography DVD Mars Exploration Rover Photograph Aspect ratio (image) Handloading Atari 8-bit family Leica MAME Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Iriver Digital image GIMP DV Clementine mission 8 mm video format GIF Photojournalism Attitude control ASCII art Machinima Computer Memory Stick Disk image Canon EOS-20D 35 mm film

my friend dropped my camera my friend dropped my camera and the lens got jammed such that it is halfway out naturally the camera isn't quite working and i'm so freaking pissed at her irresponsibility can someone please tell me if there's anything i can do about my camera i loved it it was a casio exilim i didn't have a choice she's way older than me but sadly irresponsible sigh i have a guarantee but since there are no dents etc will it be possible to bring it to the store and just tell them it got stuck like don't mention that it was dropped drops are not covered by most warranties and unless you're using a camera that's worth at least it's not going to be worth the cost of having a professional repair it i bought a camera for at christmas and my son dropped it the lens housing was jammed just like yours my brother is great with mechanics but he couldn't fix it and when i asked at wolff camera what it would cost to have it repaired it would've been as much as buying a new camera so that's what i did next time let your friend use their own camera  Shaggy dog story Digital photography Camera Digital camera The Smoking Room View camera Happy Days Photography The Inside Poker jargon Single-lens reflex camera Marilyn Monroe Warranty Knots Landing Camcorder Canon T90 Ex-gay The Ashlee Simpson Show James T.

can someone tell me which camera would be the best for what i need i really love photography and my last camera a canon similiar to this one http www bestbuy ca catalog proddetail asp sku id ingfs catid pcname camera fcanon logon langid en got broken recently i am going on vacation soon though and am looking to buy a camera within the next week i know the people at the store could help but i just wanted some opinions so i'm not walking in there blindly so if anyone could find me a camera that takes good high quality pictures but isn't the most expensive on the site probably not over then that would be lovely http www bestbuy ca catalog dept asp catid logon langid en good luck and thanks well the sd is a great little camera your budget will allow much more so i would ask you to consider the canon sd is i think if i was buying a camera to stick in my pocket today this is the one i would buy here is my canned recommendation for this excellent camera please look at the new canon powershot sd is this is a very versatile camera that will not get in your way as you travel it has a nice workable zoom range that will take you from broad scenics to decent telephoto views look at some sample images from the reviews on the sd is to get the idea what this lens will cover it has image stabilization which really works it is small enough to fit into a shirt pocket it has a rechargeable battery that is good for shots depending on how much zooming and viewing you do or on how many shots use the flash a spare battery is x x and the charger is barely twice that size so carrying the spare is easy and packing the charger is easy it has an optical viewfinder which can be useful when the sun is too bright to see the image on your lcd monitor i could go on but you can read some reviews and see what the pro's say sd is ixus is preview http www dpreview com news canonsd is asp see also http reviews cnet com digital cameras canon powershot sd is html ar o tag pdtl list see also http www digitalcamerareview com default asp newsid user reviews http www digitalcamera hq com digital cameras canon powershot sd is reviews html see also http www steves digicams com reviews canon sd html if you know how to read these charts you can also go here and see what the changes are http www dpreview com reviews compare post asp method sidebyside cameras canon sd is ccanon sd is show all click on read owner opinions which are mini reviews by buyers you can also read the full review on the sd is by clicking on that option the upgrades for the sd is are canon digic iii image processor instead of digic ii mp instead of mp maximum iso instead of iso accepts up to gb memory card instead of gb lcd monitor has better image face detection i listed these in the order of importance in my opinion the first two are the ones that really count the most and the rest are just gravy  Leica Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera View camera Canon PowerShot G Stereoscopy PlayStation Portable Windows XP Konica Minolta Canon T90 Ajax (programming) Photographic lens Xbox 360 Contax Mouse (computing) Camcorder IPod Canon EOS-20D World Wide Web Oscilloscope Macro photography Bicycle lighting Canon EOS Windows Vista Movie projector Television Cross site scripting Warez Rangefinder camera DVD Single-lens reflex camera Floppy disk Closed-circuit television Liquid crystal display HTML HyperText Transfer Protocol OpenDocument Amateur astronomy High-definition television Cinematography Laptop Opera (web browser) USB flash drive Spyware Panavision Apple Newton Camera Photographic film Zoom lens Anamorphic widescreen Common Unix Printing System Nintendo DS ITunes Music Store Panoramic photography Sound Blaster Game Boy Advance Zire Handheld MP3 Game Boy Film Surveillance Apple Computer Mozilla Firefox Digital cinematography IPod nano Prank flash Unicode Pixel Universal Serial Bus Automatic number plate recognition OpenOffice.org Sharp Zaurus Canon EF lens mount Walkman Search engine optimization Gamut Windows 2000 Digital camera back Nikon Corporation XML Ebook HTML element Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Secure Digital card Uniform Resource Locator Screenplay Widescreen

sd cards for a digital camera hi i have a canon digital camera and i will be going on a trip to europe for weeks i am planning on taking a ton of pictures and i was wondering if anyone new any sd cards with really good memory my card can only hold around but i need a lot more plus im looking for a reliable card i heard online that someone took pics on a trip got home and all just dissapeared i can't have that happen know of anything thanks i bought an sd memory card from www tigerdirect com for my canon camera and it works just fine if you are going to take only still pictures then a or gigabyte memory card will let you store several hundred pictures but if you are going to record movies then perhaps you should get an gigabyte memory card perhaps that person who lost pictures from europe on his sd memory card didn't handle his memory card properly and accidently erased the pictures there even sd cards are vulnerable to static electricity and if you take out an sd card touch its electical contacts and there is a static electricity spark that goes from your fingers to the sd card then all information on that card may be erased to avoid such an accident you should avoid touching the electrical contacts on your sd memory card to find out what kind of an sd memory card you need for your camera you can search by the model number of your canon camera at this site http www ec kingston com ecom configurator new lines asp root linkback manufacturer can  Secure Digital card Digital photography Hard disk Computer Surveillance Flash memory Windows Vista File Allocation Table Road-rule enforcement camera Digital Nintendo GameCube Central processing unit History of computing hardware Universal Serial Bus Stereoscopy CompactFlash Cross site scripting PHP CPU design USB flash drive Domain Name System XD-Picture Card Electronic commerce High-definition television IBM PC compatible Sony Nintendo 64 Enterprise content management Read-only memory Gmail Photography Contract bridge History of radio Smart card Windows 2000 DVD Xbox 360 Canon EOS Konica Minolta Floppy disk Pixel Bluetooth Camera Hewlett-Packard Memory (computers) Computer forensics Automatic number plate recognition Internet fraud Phishing IPod Non-volatile memory Sound Blaster Television Video game music Virtual memory Xbox Federal Standard 1037C Sega Saturn Password 64-bit Cessna T-37 Card game Ajax (programming) Patricia Ford Radio Gramophone record UNIVAC Apple II family Creative Zen 8 mm video format World Wide Web 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Gigabyte DV MRAM Website Memory Stick Electrostatics Web server Synthesizer Punch card Game controller IBM PC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Pinball Movie camera CPAN Atari 8-bit family Telephone exchange Automobile Schindler's List British national identity card TiVo Privacy Credit card Octopus card

i plan to buy nikon d x in which country or made i have to buy and in which country price will less please tell me fhotoace brings up a very important point in other questions you've posted that you live in a european country if you want full nikon support buy from a local vendor you could buy from overseas but shipping will add to the cost and you might have problems with repair and support also beware of 'package' deals with useless tripod or over priced cleaning kits only buy the items that suit your needs some dealers will try to package a mm lens with the d x but you should get either a mm mm or mm for your basic kit lens if you want a true wide angle on your dslr hope this is helpful  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital photography View camera Binoculars Illegal drug trade Leica Canon T90 Commodore 64 PlayStation 2 Nikon D70 Commodore International Nikon Corporation Gross domestic product Apple Macintosh Bulk vending Atari 8-bit family Windows 2000 United Kingdom corporation tax Mac OS X Poker jargon History of the United States (1918-1945) Price discrimination Secure Digital card Scale model IBM PC compatible Yugo Nintendo Nintendo Entertainment System Best Buy Atari ST BASIC programming language Final Fantasy XI Wayne Corporation Pound sterling Konica Minolta Wal-Mart History of Microsoft Windows Mainframe computer Nikon FA Microeconomics AMD Warez Sears Holdings Corporation Loss leader National Weather Service Canon EOS-300D Tariff Nikon FE2 History of operating systems Microsoft Xbox 360 Single-lens reflex camera RuneScape weapons Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Wind turbine MOS Technology Free trade Health insurance M16 (rifle) Radio controlled airplane Photographic lens Regional lockout Sun Microsystems Trade Economics International response to Hurricane Katrina Daewoo Amiga Kyoto Protocol Ford Motor Company Supply and demand Economy of the United States Kurt Angle Xbox Resident Evil (video game) Photography Emergency preparedness Local food Copy protection Customer relationship management Craps Airline Political economy X Window System Internet fraud Hard disk Mecha Headlight Sears Catalog Home Laptop Enron Corporation Arbitrage DVD Surveillance Strap-on dildo ITunes Music Store Arguments for and against drug prohibition Stock Ford Sierra

canon and nikon i'm using a canon d and my friend's using his nikon d i've said it for ages but only today when comparing similar photographs have i concluded that the nikon shoots far better photos regardless of megapixels but instead with the colour i've checked that our iso speeds are the same etc but all my photos seem colourless and dull whereby his look as if they've already had a run though photoshop does anyone have any information for me or anything that you think i have missed also to add that we are both using polarizers on our shots so filters are not the case thanks wil you couldn't have put it any better your eyes like the results of the nikon d better but i can imagine that you'll find other photographers that like the canon's images more i've said it before the choice of a camera should be a personal one i shoot nikon and so does one of my brothers other members of the family shoot sony pentax canon we get into some pretty heavy dslr debates at family gatherings but we're all happy with our choices because they fit us individually all the camera makers are 'tweeking' their cameras for the desired customers for example nikon got complaints that the d d s required too much post processing for beginners so when they released the d it had brighter images with 'better' color straight out of the camera fuji put their own sensor chip into the nikon d body for their s series and got rave reviews about color accuracy for portraits i'm sure the canon line had done the same through all the different generations and models photoshop and other programs are the great equalizer but true beauty of images is truly in the eyes of the beholder  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Leica Digital camera Photography Konica Minolta Canon EOS Nikon D70 Camera Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE2 Binoculars View camera Nikon FE Pixel Raw image format Stereoscopy Color Nikon FA Secure Digital card PNG Cinematography Film speed Charge-coupled device Digital camera back Canon T90 Adobe Photoshop Canon EOS-300D Image scanner CPU cache Super Nintendo Entertainment System RGB color model Advanced Photo System Traffic light Traditional animation Photographic lens Pentax JPEG Canon Inc.

canon a vs a is is the worth the extra if so why these two cameras are almost identical however the a is has some extra features which make it the better choice in my opinion it would be my pick of the two for the extra you are getting an optical image stabilizer which is worth the extra cash alone this stabilizer means less blurry shots especially in lower light or when using slower shutter speeds you are also getting full manual controls aperture shutter priority you still have the standard auto setting but you also have the option to select your own shutter speed and aperture this will allow you to be more creative with your photography by giving you more control you are also getting a slightly stronger flash good luck and don't forget to buy a decent high speed sd card to go with the camera you will need this especially for shooting high quality movies sandisk extreme iii is my recommendation  Leica Canon T90 View camera Digital photography Konica Minolta Camera Movie projector Shutter speed Photography Cinematography Secure Digital card Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photographic lens Floppy disk F-number Single-lens reflex camera Canon PowerShot G Depth of field Nikon FE2 Canon EF lens mount Street photography Panoramic photography Nikon FA Contax Canon T70 Shutter (photography) Automatic number plate recognition Beatmania IIDX Anamorphic widescreen Film Winning Streak Canon EOS Nikon FM2 Exposure (photography) Time-lapse DVD Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Frame rate Mouse (computing) Poker jargon Digital camera Rangefinder camera Film speed CompactFlash Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Widescreen Enlarger Charge-coupled device Nikon Corporation IMAX Oscilloscope Inflation Shutter angle Bluetooth Photographic film Canon FD PlayStation Portable Eyepiece 35 mm film Redundant array of independent disks Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure M16 (rifle) NTSC Memory Stick Explosive material Panavision Laserdisc Ethernet Gramophone record DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Golf club (equipment) Messerschmitt Bf 109 Need for Speed GunBound Point and shoot camera DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Technicolor High-voltage direct current Persistence of vision Bullet time $ale of the Century Amateur astronomy Filter (optics) Zone system Pentax Ra (board game) Cinematographer Astronomical seeing Galileo spacecraft Wheel of Fortune Overclocking Telescope Professional video camera

d or rebel xti with extra lens which would be better the d or the rebel xti with the ef mm f macro usm lens there are a couple of other questions about whether canon or nikon is better so take a look up and down the list from your question for some discussion on that some people will like nikon me and some will like canon tom any right thinking person from either camp will also admit that either camera will give good results and you have to consider what you want out of a camera to make your decision here is my stock answer where i defend nikon's honor take from it what you will as both nikon and canon came out above the others in this market segment the february issue of popular photography has an article where they compared the top mp dslr's i took the scores and ranked the cameras similar to the way formula gives championship points i just gave for st place down to for last place splitting the difference when cameras tied in their catagories they evaluated image quality giving this twice as much weight as anything else ease of use control and system flexibility the final order and my scores are nikon d points best in image quality control and system flexibility canon rebel xti d points tied for best in system flexibility pentax k d points tied for best in ease of use samsung gx points tied for best in ease of use sony alpha points last in image quality ease of use and system flexibility then again this is the same magazine that put the sony alpha dead last in this comparison named it the camera of the year in the previous issue in a follow up to this seeming error pop photo published the explanation that only the d and the sony had been tested by the end of year deadline for choosing the camera of the year sony won on the strength of low price and built in image stabilization the other that beat sony in shoot out were not tested until after the camera of the year was selected because they were not yet available go to the original question and read the responses for more opinions http answers yahoo com question index ylt aig ehyd oq b x j jiulzy ix qid aahwjy if you want to get the best for the real world consider the nikon d or canon d if you can afford it for about less look at the results of the recent popphoto test and choose from that list according to your taste personally i use a nikon d and would recommend it without hesitation to someone who has some knowledge of photography for someone who wants the best but is starting with somewhat of an entry level knowledge base i'd suggest the nikon d there are people out there who will state their preference for the canon cameras and i will not argue with them the canon d and d are excellent cameras as well you would have to visit a camera store or camera department and pick them up and see what you think this article is available online at http www popphoto com cameras mp dslr shootout html here's another reference from outside the photographic press consumer reports compared the nikon d canon rebel xti and sony alpha personally i'd say that the nikon came out on top here also it beats the sony in noise free iso with an acceptable rating at iso kind of optimistic i think compared to the sony's iso it beats the canon in my opinion by having a spot meter that the canon does not offer http www consumerreports org cro electronics computers news electronics computers november shootout megapixel digital slr cameras overview digital slr shoot out htm here's another comparison of interest http www digitalcamerainfo com content canon rebel xti vs nikon d vs sony alpha a head to head to head digital camera review htm note the navigation menu near the top of the review the next thing to consider is what lens to start with and where you go from there if you are new to this i'd say to just get the kit lens which seems to be the lens for the d and get started once you know where you really want to go with your photography nikon has an almost unlimited family of

new digital camera trouble please help i bought a new canon a is digital camera and something must be wrong after i take only pictues it says the memory card is full i thought a memory card can hold at least a hundred images what is wrong yeah it's full the mb card that comes with the camera is more like a little thank you note from canon than anything else get a gb card and you will be able to save the following large x pixels superfine fine normal medium m x pixels superfine fine normal medium m x pixels superfine fine normal medium m x pixels superfine fine normal small x pixels vga useful only for e mail and small web postings superfine fine normal postcard x pixels allows date imprint fine widescreen x pixels superfine fine normal sandisk and lexar are the best known memory cards for digital cameras i am sure that the cards all pretty much perform the same but these brands have a lifetime warranty for some of their products so that makes me think they are built to higher standards as far as day to day use i have some generic and some of each brand i named and they all work the contacts on the brand name cameras seem to have the equivalent of the thunk that you look for when you shut a car door to check it's quality if you know what i mean you don't wonder is it in there right because it just feels right i don't buy generics any more though i just end up getting them with things somehow of course you'll need a decent memory card and i recommend a genuine sandisk ultra ii x or extreme iii x of at least gb the x should be fine unless you do a lot of continuous mode sport shooting or a lot of video lexar is another excellent card supplier and they have the professional x as well as the platinum x to choose from both lexar and sandisk come with image recovery software that you copy onto your computer before you format the card and both have limited lifetime warranties  Digital photography Memory Stick Pixel Secure Digital card Digital camera CompactFlash Windows Vista Video PlayStation 3 ATI Technologies Digital cinematography Floppy disk PNG Television XD-Picture Card Mac OS X Xbox PlayStation Portable Computer display standard Laserdisc Nintendo 64 Radeon Digital cinema Amstrad CPC Stereoscopy Video Graphics Array Digital Visual Interface Mouse (computing) IPod Overclocking High-definition television Aspect ratio (image) Sega Dreamcast SmartMedia NVIDIA Atari ST Computer Digital video Computer forensics Multimedia Card ZX Spectrum Anamorphic widescreen TurboGrafx 16 Xbox 360 Image file formats Sony JPEG GeForce 6 Series IBM PC compatible Poker jargon Bluetooth ITunes 3dfx Photography Camcorder Color Graphics Adapter Digital rights management Teletext Internet fraud Atari 8-bit family Ebook Graphics card Apple Computer Gramophone record Star Trek Customizable Card Game Windows XP Konica Minolta Medium format Liquid crystal display Machine vision Credit card 8 mm video format PlayStation 2 Binary prefix Copyleft Game Boy Holography Tungsten Handheld Dither Betting (poker) GeForce 4 Hard disk Panavision Leica IMac Intellivision Hubble Space Telescope Memory card BlackBerry Embedded system Year 2000 problem Original Amiga chipset

is the nikon sb speedlight unit worth buying or should i upgrade to the next step it's an excellent flash that might meet your needs it certainly integrates well with the nikon slr electronics but before you rush out to buy it pause a moment and ask yourself what you need the flash for what is the typical distance you have to cover with the flash when you need to use it what is the typical angle you're trying to cover answering those two questions is crucial the sb is a lovely flash but the distance it can cover is fixed and may not meet your needs have a look at the specs for all three the sb the sb and the sb while the higher models also give you more features as you go up you can also illuminate greater distances your choice of a flash should be determined by the distances you need to cover personally i use an sb on my nikon d slr my attitude is that no matter how powerful the flash is it's never enough i've been in many situations where that turned out to be true however that doesn't mean you have to go for that model today especially if you can't afford it the sb can also be a good slave flash in later years when you do buy a model or two higher it will never go to waste and in the meantime at least you'll have a better range than the one built into the camera i hope this helps a little  Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta View camera Nikon Corporation Nikon FE Leica Canon EOS Nikon FE2 Nikon FM2 Canon T90 Binoculars Secure Digital card Nikon FA Digital camera Contax Nikon FM Supply and demand Bicycle lighting Rangefinder camera Nikon D70 Poker jargon Photography Floppy disk Diamond cut Stereoscopy Full frame digital SLR Items in the Metroid series Central processing unit Light-emitting diode Transformer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital camera back Point and shoot camera Zerg Automatic number plate recognition Flash (photography) Pentax Traffic light Escape from New York Species Theodicy Mouse (computing) MS-06 Zaku II GunZ The Duel Embedded system Radar Canon EOS-300D Camera Slide rule Goodness and value theory Tank Oscilloscope Helicopter Determinism FN FAL Serial Life insurance Mars Exploration Rover Artificial neural network USB flash drive Public transport Fluorescent lamp Equine conformation Road-rule enforcement camera Gamma ray burst Flash memory Zeno's paradoxes Electronic amplifier MIM-23 Hawk Explosive material Sound Blaster Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Solar cell Single Transferable Vote Hearing impairment Laptop Wheel of Fortune Galactic Civilizations Galileo spacecraft Open cluster Parallax DVD Homosexuality and Christianity AIM-9 Sidewinder Diesel engine Airport Amiga Stairway Alcoholics Anonymous Surveillance General Dynamics F-111 Panoramic photography Keynesian economics Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Wealth Motorcycle

canon rebel xti question about lightning with this camera can someone tell me how it'd be possible to take a picture in a really low light place or at night without using flash while getting a semi decent photo i know you can change something to get more light in but i must be doing it wrong because every picture i take blurrs i went to the zoo yesterday and there were some dark inside areas where monkeys where and i couldn't get a shot of them couldn't use flash because they were behind glass my shutter stayed open longer i think it changed itself to automatically but the monkeys always blurred since they were moving can someone teach me how to do this better the only suggestion i have is to raise the iso setting you will get a little grainier pictures maybe one of the other gentlemen will have better advice for you if you don't get an answer soon repost the question in a couple of hours  Digital photography Film speed Photography Shen Gong Wu Stereoscopy Canon T90 Macro photography Camera Single-lens reflex camera Shutter speed Floppy disk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Lightning Milton H.

trying to pick out my first dslr i work with horses and enjoy taking pictures at competitions but shutter lag with my current camera makes it difficult to get good shots not to mention the lack of zoom i'd like to upgrade to a dslr but don't want to spend more than i've heard a lot about the nikon d but wanted to get others opinion i have no real preference to brand although i've mainly had canons in the past here's more about the d i think that the nikon d is a great little camera very easy to use and quite reasonably priced it has a few consumer friendly totally automatic modes that make it very easy to use including a child photo mode but still offers total photographic control when you are ready to take charge it will get you in the nikon family which is a great place to be if you buy accessories and lenses you will be able to use everything on any nikon that you might upgrade to later on check out nikon's picturetown promotion where they handed out d 's in georgetown sc http www stunningnikon com picturetown here are a few reviews in case you have not read them yet be sure to note that they are several pages long and some of the reviews also have some sample images that you can look at http www dpreview com reviews nikond http www steves digicams com reviews nikon d html http www popphoto com cameras camera test nikon d html http www kenrockwell com nikon d d recommendations htm i hate to see people slam the camera because it can't autofocus with older nikon lenses it is true that there is a slight problem with older nikon lenses not autofocusing on the d but if you do not own a bag full of older lenses it is not going to be a problem it is barely a problem anyhow if you check www nikonusa com for af s lenses which are all compatible with the d you will find lenses including vr vibration reduction lenses and one true macro lens with vr there are another plus lenses in the current catalog that provide all functions except autofocus as well as many possibly dozens out of print lenses that will work just as well in addition although these lens will not autofocus most of them will still give focus confirmation from the d manual if the lens has a maximum aperture of f of faster the viewfinder focus indicator can be used to confirm whether the portion of the subject in the selected focus area is in focus after positioning the subject in the active focus area press the shutter release button halfway and rotate the lens focusing ring until the in focus indicator is displayed see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses or see http www nikonians org cgi bin dcforum dcboard cgi az read count om forum dcforumid for even more the d only has autofocus zones arranged horizontally at the center o'clock and o'clock positions this might be considered a limitation but realistically most people will find this perfectly adequate especially if you are moving up from a point and shoot with only a center zone there is no status lcd on top of the camera but nikon chose to use the rear lcd for this information this is actually a nice move as the display is bigger than the top display and you aren't using the read lcd for anything before you take the picture anyway this is not a step backwards and it actually makes sense to me you can get the d with the kit lens at b h photo available through yahoo shopping or at for june add a lexar platinum x speed card for or gb for or get the d with lens and gb lexar card for this is a decent lens and it is very versatile you will find it suitable for pretty much anything you want to do other than really long telephoto shots it will let you explore the range of focal lengths to decide where to start filling in your lens collection if you don't want to buy any more lenses this one will carry you through pretty much everything b h also have used d 's with the lens from now if you like the feel of the canon xt or xti better that's the camera for you it's excellent i prefer the d but you might like the canon's lots of people use canon and nikon quite successfully  Nikon FM2 Rangefinder camera Floppy disk Nikon FE Cinematography Mouse (computing)

which camera is better sd sd sd i am not a professional photographer just looking for a good camera to use at events or family things in that group rule out the sd because it doesn't have an optical viewfinder and it's almost too small to use the sd is easily beats it in its own class between the others you are looking at a critical analysis of the image quality on one level the larger sensor in the sd gives it a better image and this is the camera that i chose for myself i have some slr's to use when i get serious though on another level the image stabilization of the sd is makes a real difference in fact if its predecessor sd is had been available when i was shopping for a camera i was going to buy that and not the sd the sd is gives a little but more telephoto reach also for your purposes the sd is is probably the best choice examined under a microscope the sd images may give more detail and allow for bigger enlargements but examined at arm's length on a normal print this advantage goes away you gain the advantage if image stabliization and that's where i think you should put your money you are going to get mostly x or x prints and they will be excellent even a full frame x will be quite good if i was buying today i'd get the sd is i can talk out of both sides of my mouth with this example but today i'll see it from your point of view see http www flickr com photos samfeinstein as you view it in the first size on the screen you don't see a whole lot of difference do you the sd is is very similar to the sd is click all sizes on my screen it's about x when you do that that's bigger than any print you'd ever get from a shot like this but see how little difference there is even if you cropped a x out of the center to show the people on the dock either side would give you an acceptable print if you click on original though you will see the difference but cropping the center out of either one is not going to be the highest quality any more my point is for all but a x poster or similar magnification the image stabilization is more important than the pixel count or the sensor size for your purposes  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Stereoscopy Leica Single-lens reflex camera Photographic lens Macro photography Photography View camera Parallax Digital camera back Digital camera Widescreen Konica Minolta Anamorphic widescreen Mouse (computing) Contax Medium format Movie projector Digital cinematography Panoramic photography Cinematography Canon EOS Telescope Aspect ratio (image) Pixel Zoom lens Geographic information system Panavision Opportunity rover Circle of confusion Binoculars Equine conformation Canon T90 Schneider Kreuznach Rangefinder camera Aberration in optical systems Motion capture PNG Gross domestic product Advanced Photo System Charge-coupled device Computer vision Image file formats Nikon Corporation Clementine mission Four Thirds System Microeconomics Autostereogram JPEG Cinerama MapleStory Betting (poker) Lens (optics) Deep Impact (space mission) Surveillance Microscope Reflecting telescope Eye STS-114 Photographic film Digital cinema Hubble Space Telescope Traditional animation Windows Vista Inflation Magnification Enlarger Economics Internet fraud Cascading Style Sheets MP3 Gramophone record Oscilloscope Machinima Cyberspace Mars Exploration Rover Nicomachean Ethics Canon EF lens mount Art Digital video Craps The nature of God in Western theology Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Supply-side economics Screenplay Photojournalism Color Ray tracing Ebook Laserdisc

is there a quality difference between the photo scan machines at wal mart kodak vs walgreens fuji i am scanning all my old family photos to make one good cd to save in case house burns downs and to give as gift to my grown up sons i have scanned with both machines at the two stores my concern is when i do the 'enhance' feature at walgreens when i look at it on my home computer screen there are some white dots as if it was from a magazine but the fuji walgreens prints looked great the wal mart scans looked great too i didn't look at the wal mart enhance pics from the cd i made on my computer as i couldn't even figure out their photo program at all i want the best quality scans in case someone makes prints someday and doesn't have the original pics i almost think i shouldn't even use the enhance but it does brighten them up nicely the prints are definitely better but projected large on a screen like for lcd they look like a copy of magazine pics thanks i think they are basically the sambut it is u preference i like kodak more trusted company thanfuji inthe scaningbusiness and picture business  Digital photography Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Photography Wal-Mart BASIC programming language TRS-80 Apple II family PIC microcontroller Bluetooth Commodore 64 Atari ST Stereoscopy Photographic film Konica Minolta Television Xerox PostScript Image scanner Windows XP Halting problem Cathode ray tube Windows 2000 Sinclair ZX81 Theory of conduct AmigaOS Technicolor Screenshot Liquid crystal display Computer printer System/36 System/34 Patricia Ford Windows Vista Nintendo Entertainment System GIF Fax Apple IIGS Walgreens Widescreen Oscilloscope Amstrad CPC Digital camera Computer Anamorphic widescreen Atari 2600 Game Boy Trusted computing Computer virus MAME Moir__ pattern Online music store Enterprise content management Screensaver GRASS programming language Handheld game console Photocopying Acorn Computers IMac Pixel Knight Rider Apple Macintosh Tungsten Handheld Trademark Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Copy protection Medical prescription Sears Holdings Corporation Computer forensics Digital image editing IBM PC compatible Primerica Financial Services Bank Organic light-emitting diode Brainfuck Sudoku View camera Magnetic resonance imaging Acorn Archimedes Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis TI-89 series Photojournalism Warez PNG Gmail Compact disc Common Unix Printing System Dot matrix printer Charmed Outsourcing Firewall (networking) Super Mario Bros. 3 Eastman Kodak Forth programming language Traditional animation Portable Document Format Management information system Killian documents Geographic information system

i have the nikon d camera i need a flash for it can i buy any brand flash like sigma ect and it'll st i wonder the same about macro lenses as well what brand will work well with my d if i can't afford the nikon brand this is a rare occasion but i will disagree with fhotoace you do not need to buy a nikon flash to use on your camera but you would prefer to buy a nikon flash to take advantage of the many interlinked functions between the flash and camera if you are buying a modern flash that specifies that it is for digital cameras and the and the manufacturer of the flash specifies compatibility with your d you will not harm your camera you just won't be getting all that you could be getting in the way of features i'd rather see you get the relatively cheap nikon sb instead of another maker's unit if you want to save some money it costs just over if you need something cheaper please stick to your on camera flash while you save at least it is designed with the nikon in mind you may not see the sb listed in your owner's manual because it is relatively new as far as the lenses yes you can buy any lens with a nikon mount there are many if you want a true macro lens there are not so many to choose from none of the zoom macro's go to i am looking at b h now you should only be interested in a prime macro meaning a non zoom single focal length lens i see a couple of sigma prime macro's for but only the sigma normal mm f ex dg macro autofocus lens for nikon af goes to the other one isn't even it's almost okay it's technically a macro lens but you are going to be disappointed if you can't get ditto for the mm sigma it costs and only goes to for a few dollars more you can have a new imported nikon normal macro mm f d af micro nikkor autofocus lens bear in mind the warranty issues with a grey market item but this lens is built like a tank and should last years without a warranty problem read b h's explanation about grey market items the next aftermarket macro lens i see costs which is the same as the usa nikon mm macro the way i see it you can choose between the mm sigma or the mm nikon import either one will work since macro can be very detailed and technical i think you will always wonder if the nikon is really better than the sigma so hold out for the nikon in the end i am not disagreeing with the ace after all the answer to your question is that yes you can use other maker's products on your camera but he is right in thinking that anyone who has made the leap and sacrifice to buy a d will not be satisfied with the results of those products  View camera Leica Contax Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Canon EF lens mount Macro photography Nikon FA Photography Canon T90 Photographic lens Nikon FE Nikon FM2 Binoculars Nikon FE2 Nikon FM Panavision Schneider Kreuznach USB flash drive Economics Floppy disk Nikon D70 Secure Digital card IPod Camcorder Camera Mouse (computing) Point and shoot camera Olympus (company) Depth of field Advanced Photo System Bicycle lighting Atari 8-bit family Digital camera back AMD Zeiss Normal distribution Labor theory of value Canon FD MMORPG Nintendo 64 Microeconomics Cinematography Gramophone record Eyepiece Computer virus C programming language IBM PC compatible CPU design Commodore International Wal-Mart ATI Technologies Cosina Panoramic photography Pentax Television Film Canon EOS-300D DVD Law of value Wayne Corporation C plus plus Acorn Computers Stereoscopy Telescope Gross domestic product Emacs Global System for Mobile Communications Strap-on dildo Stage lighting Computer B3ta Ford Motor Company Four Thirds System School bus RuneScape cheats Asian financial crisis Nintendo DS Labour economics Bulk vending United States dollar F-number Headlight RISC Flash memory Xbox Aberration in optical systems Land use forecasting Laserdisc

what other features should i look for when buying a digital camera apart from mega pixels what else can i look for i am looking for a digital camera and have to spend on it with your budget you are safely in the boundaries to affording a really good camera my recommendations would be the nikon d an absolute dream to use and the pictures that come out of it are stunning or the sony a not quite as sharp as the nikon but somehow more realistic if that makes sense also much better for bad weather and lighting conditions with your budget you could also look at compact non slr cameras such as the canon ixus range all of the ones that i have used are very very good for their size and then have some change to buy a decent piece of software for photo editing if you are a beginner then the latest version of adobe photoshop elements should suffice if not then try and find a second hand copy of cs  Digital photography Konica Minolta Adobe Photoshop PNG Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Nikon Corporation Digital camera back View camera Secure Digital card Nikon FE Nikon FA Nikon FM2 Contax Digital image editing Raw image format PlayStation Portable Nikon FE2 Camera Nikon FM Rangefinder camera Photography Digital camera Warez Digital cinematography Macro photography Pixel Canon T90 Digital cinema Camcorder Advanced Photo System Pentax Canon EOS Apple Macintosh IPod Pornography Street photography Unicode Canon EOS-300D Binoculars Windows Vista Digital television High-definition television Full frame digital SLR Camouflage Point and shoot camera Stereoscopy RGB color model Nikon D70 Cassini-Huygens Adobe Systems Panoramic photography Bryce Sony Amstrad CPC Walkman Olympus (company) Closed-circuit television IPhoto PlayStation 2 Rendering (computer graphics) Floppy disk Xbox 360 Geographic information system Canon Inc.

how many pixels does a digital camera need to be equivalent to a good mm film camera i want to make big prints from the images with roll film in a mm camera i am happy going to x assuming lenses etc are the same on the digital camera and the roll film one how many pixels will give the same definition i think it is worth coming at this another way if you want to print a x poster at dpi you will need a resolution of mp this is calculated as x x x x if you are prepared to reduce the printing resolution to dpi you will need mp for a print this size it is probably reasonable to use this lower printing resolution as viewers will need to be some distance away scanned at dpi a mm film will give you mp the film is an analogue storage mechanism so whether this is realistic is an entirely different matter however there seems to be little point in making dpi scanners if there weren't real quality gains to be made in scanning film at this higher resolution that said i agree with the comment that this is quite a large enlargement from mm for most consumer grade film you will not be getting anything like the equivalent of mp and the suggestion that around mp is possible might even be a stretch at this resolution you would be effectively only printing at about dpi if you enlarged to x note that i haven't done this last calculation exactly  Digital photography Dots per inch Pixel Digital camera Anamorphic widescreen High-definition television Digital cinema Aspect ratio (image) View camera Digital camera back Stereoscopy Television Digital video Camera Video Medium format Dot matrix printer Widescreen Konica Minolta Digital image editing Raster graphics Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital cinematography Autostereogram Circle of confusion Panoramic photography Mouse (computing) Photographic lens Depth of field Photographic film Movie projector Moir__ pattern Charge-coupled device Geographic information system Liquid crystal display Holography Anti-aliasing Optical coherence tomography Digital television Camcorder Image file formats Cinematography Magnetic resonance imaging Rendering (computer graphics) Fax Ebook Dither Laserdisc Gamma ray burst Binoculars Clementine mission Schneider Kreuznach Pinhole camera 8 mm video format Motion capture Inflation Microscope Windows Vista Computed tomography Killian documents Typeface Portable Document Format Halftone MP3 Color printing Computer animation Digital art Eyepiece Digital 2003 UB313 Gamut Tagged Image File Format Leica Single-lens reflex camera Traditional animation Astronomical seeing Nikon Corporation Analog-to-digital converter Motion picture terminology Pan and scan DVD Atari 8-bit family PNG Advanced Photo System Zoom lens Regular polytope Enterprise content management Microeconomics Film preservation Aberration in optical systems DV Digital circuit Big Bang Compact disc

which brand of slr camera is the best nikon canon olympus sony etc please tell me why it is a good one what model also how is it better than the other brands what is more advisable for a begginer like me note if you will mention brands of cameras that i did not include in my question please make sure that it is available worldwide not only in some places you know i live in asia teehee o o thanks guys n n there are really only two choices nikon and canon both of these companies have been building cameras before sony and olympus were even in existance olympus came along in the seventies and didn't build bad cameras they competed well with pentax and minolta but that also meant that they didn't have the extensive experience that canon and nikon had so their cameras were only average today they're still average and they have reliability problems too sony is new to the game they bought out minolta to get a bit of camera experience but they certainly don't have enough experience at the moment to really understand how photographers use cameras their cameras are not nice to use you end up having to go to the menu far too often when you should have a button to do the job besides that if you out grow your sony slr what's next there is no higher model and no professional model either pentax also makes slrs and again longer than olympus and sony but they're targeted at the consumer market not the professional market you can save some money here both on the camera and the lenses the camera has built in image stabilization but alas while that means the lenses are cheaper the stabilizor doesn't work as well as one built into a lens pentax reliability is only average too and if you out grow that camera there's also no place to go canon and nikon have a solid growth path from their entry slrs all the way to the top professional models they have extensive accessories and lenses to solve just about every photographic problem you'll ever encounter and they both innovate and develop new tools for photography canon innovates first usually but being first means you don't always have the best solution nikon takes longer to develop a similar feature and ends up doing it better if you have to have the latest features now canon is your only choice if you prefer to have the latest features when they've been refined and optomized nikon is the choice there are two major philosophical differences between the two companies canon wants to be the leader and have the largest market share so they have been building camera bodies that look sexy for the consumer market they are also cheaply built to cut costs and thereby move the price down further as a result although the entry level cameras from canon perform well they're not comfortable to hold their controls are limited and awkward and if you happen to drop the camera there's a good chance it will break nikon believes in building solid workhorses their cameras don't look sexy and they're not cheap either but if you drop one it takes the abuse it's also designed for photographers so the controls are many and they're strategically placed on the bodies where they are needed the other difference has to do with protecting your investment as canon evolved its cameras it was not concerned about the investments that their customers made when they went digital everything that was purchased for the film cameras was obsoleted it is not possible to use your film based lenses on a canon digital that raises the question of what will happen when the next major advance in photography happens will everything you bought suddenly have to be replaced at considerable cost because they chose again to not maintain compatibility most likely they have that kind of history pentax was the same incidentally and so was olympus nikon on the other hand tries its best to maintain compatibility they ensure that their new cameras at least accept the investments of the past if you happen to find a nikon lens at a garage sale the odds are really good that it will fit on your nikon digital slr and actually work albeit with some restrictions what will happen as nikon develops new cameras most likely whatever you bought today will continue to be useable so when you consider all of those factors your only realy choice is nikon however there are many people who swear by canon so if the above factors are not important to you canon remains a good option too certainly if you skip the consumer models and go directly to the professional ones both makers build incredible products just be aware that eventually the lenses you buy may not work on the next incredible professional camera if you want to go canon i'd look at the xti it's a nice little camera and its only real shortcoming is the absense of a spot meter if you go nikon the d x is a wonderful entry level product and has more than you need to start off it actually has many features that are usually only in higher end models i'd also be careful about what lens you buy usually the lenses that are sold with the bodies aren't that good with the nikon i'd go for the mm mm zoom that gives you an awesome range and negates the need to own two lenses for general photography canon doesn't make one of these unfortunately however you can get a similar lens from tamron and from sigma which will work with the canon so my suggestion to you is to consider a nikon d x as a starter camera with an mm mm lens later as you get more sophisticated and demand ever more functionality you can move up to the d which is also an incredible design and in time there's the d which is only one step below the professional model that provides you even more power and flexiblity of course by the time you're ready to move up those models will have been replaced but you'll find they will only get ever better i hope this helps a little  Photographic lens Microeconomics Free trade Digital camera back IPod Camcorder Computer Inflation Macro photography

how much do megapixels really matter so i'm like really into photography and all that and i've read so much about it like omg some of you guys on like no so much about cameras and stuff and like stuff that i really could never ever learn even if i lived to be like really old like or something anyway so my friend looked at some of my photos and he was like wow ur really good so i'm thinking i could maybe take some more photos so anyway my question is like how much to megapixels really matter because my friend is gettingmarried tonite and so like i told him i would do his wedding for hime and that i'm really good and stuff and he's like wow i am spending like on photos and stuff so seeeing as he is a good friend and stuff i like said wow i can do it for like and he's really exited to be saving like a thousand dollars because it means we can all drink more at the wedding and i'm like wondering like how much do megapixels matter 'cos i have like a pda and if megapixels don't matter too much and stuff it has like a megapixel or something camera in it and i am thinking that seeing as megapixels don't really matter all that much that i might be able to use my pda to take the photos because it's really great and the photos look great because it has like a really large screen and the photos look really really good on the screen so i am thinking they must print well because they look so good on the screen and the best part is that i don't have to do all the stupid stuff like mess around with shutter speed and aperture and stuff because that is really hard and this pda is really really smart and it does all that stuff for me and i don't even have to use a flash and the pictures look really great so what do you guys think because you know so much about cameras and stuff and do you think the photos will be great they should be because i took photos at my friends part so i have experience and stuff also do you think is ok or should i still charge please answer the wedding is tonight dr sam you got it but then i knew you would antony m this question was inspired by you and posted in response to a question you asked http au answers yahoo com question index ylt anv himklwsbsup av vgath gt qid aaltyo i'm afraid you may have stepped way out of your league photographing a wedding professionally appropriately and to actually please the bride and broom and their folks you must have a lot of knowledge and experience about how to photograph a wedding how to cover a wedding how to get organized so that everyone involved in the photos knows where to be and when mega pixels are important as are many many other facets of photography equipment a wedding photographer must have dependable sufficient and efficient lighting and or flash equipment as well as workhorse cameras yes i said workhorse camera s in professional photography the term workhorse is indicative of equipment that is tried and true and has the features and ability to work like a horse because to do a good job photographing a wedding that is you will do as well work like a horse it's hard and it moves fast and strategically important photo moments happen in a heartbeat and are gone did you catch that once in a lifetime look on the bride's face or how her dad looked at her just before they walked down the aisle what about the expression on the groom's face when he first gets a good look at the bride coming down the aisle to him and mom's tears that is the kind of stuff that makes a good wedding photographer of course the photographer must have very good quality and dependable professional quality equipment megapixels and all not only that but a good photographer has all his equipment multiplied by or even a professional photographer does not contract to photograph something as important as a wedding without having back up equipment and back ups for his back ups you do not charge a bride a few thousand to photograph her wedding and then have the first little blurp in your migapixel digital camera leave you completely dead in the water a real pro will hardly let the sudden death of a camera slow him down he will barely say just a sec and then he has another camera etc in his hands almost like nothing happened so i'm like really into thinkin omg if you are like really like really really for real and you really are like into photography and all that stuff wow you really want to learn stuff about cameras and stuff like that and i'm like hey go for it like read read read and then go out and take lots and lots of like you know photos cause like ya know that's great experience and like omg sooo much fun but please please save your friendship and let him stay with his professional photographer if you're going to the wedding you could maybe unobtrusively observe the photographer for the entire time and get a small taste of just what all it takes to professionally photograph a wedding but i'm betting you are not for real and just posted this question to get a rise out of a professional photographer huh well you did have fun  Digital camera Konica Minolta Stereoscopy View camera Shaggy dog story Social rule Time Out of Mind Digital

why use the same answer for everything i will be the first to admit that i use a series of standard answers but why do some people insist on giving the same freaking answer to every question they respond to whether it makes any sense to use that answer or not i'm not talking about tomtom's my suggestion answer either he uses that when someone asks the ubiquitous best camera answer and frankly it's usually the most appropriate answer i'm talking about people who name their camera and all of its features when someone asks how to take a picture without shaking or if they can have fries with that order why not use boilerplate answers when it makes sense and skip the question if you are going to just repeat the same drek whether it actually contributes anything or not i really ought to get some sleep good answer jt antoni i do that in my real profession also i will answer many many questions for my patients after all it's their body and they deserve information to help them make a choice about their treatment some people ask so many what if questions though when they get to what i call the rd generation 'what if' scenario i finally say if you want every possible answer about what might happen with every possible outcome of this treatment you will just have to go to dental school for yourself teef roll over my icon and you'll see that i am no longer a top contributor in cameras answers a day with half then being best isn't enough so i don't worry about it you picked up on my main concern it's not the laziness but the thought that someone thinks they got a real answer and might buy the wrong camera gunn r we get that here all the time if i recommend a canon s is over a digital concepts x digital zoom only something or other for someone who wants an ultrazoom camera i might be chosen as the best answer by the asker but they comment that they decided to buy the dc camera because it fits in their pocket they were just hoping to get at least one answer to support the bad decision that they already made george i hope you are saving your answers in a test file instead of searching out old answers on line in case you had not thought of that i'm trying to cut down on my addiction this place by moving on to only certain questions and leaving the routine to so many others who answer them so well sometimes i can't help myself though haha saranghamnida you are right i don't get angry with the people who ask the same question and i don't even get angry with the people who ask us to answer exam questions for them as far as they are concerned they have gone to the internet for an answer maybe they don't even know how to search for the information they want so they just come here it is presented as a resource so that's what we are tomtom nice move trying to improve the place i'm sure yahoo sent you a canned answer in return for your suggestion like i said i have no problem with canned answers as long as they make sense for the question you are right that people need to look at a camera selector if they have no clue what they are even looking for especially if they can't even give us general idea about their interests ability and budget i love the ones who say they want the best camera in the world and money is no object as long as it is less than how can we ferret out an answer with nothing to go on i think an earlier answer said it best to many this is just a game to accumulate points so they answer for only that reason and in this case it doesn't matter what they say they still get their two points now as to the rest of us it's not fair to assume that everyone actually understands the questions sometimes a question is rather subtle and unless you read between the lines it's not always clear what is really being asked some can be forgiven i think for not aswering those kinds of questions fully perhaps some too are a bit sore about the nature of some of the questions and retaliate by sending the same stock answer all the time one of my peeves in terms of answers is the nature of the answers i've seen many questions that will ask for a choice and finish with a plea for a reason or rationale it irritates me to see answers like i prefer the canon and that's it this doesn't help anyone after all that writer is just expressing his personal opinion and without the rationale behind that opinion the reader cannot judge the legitimacy of the answer sometimes perhaps a writer misses the why part but i suspect instead they don't have an answer or they're too lazy to provide one and of course when the why part isn't included it rarely occurs to anyone to provide a rationale that said though i also agree with an earlier answer that people do what they've already decided to do rather than what's best and that they often use this forum simply to find someone who agrees for a while i was top contributor to family relationships where you can find some really heart rending issues i usually offer an opinion and always a rationale most of the time that reply was ignored completely while they agreed with a two or three word answer that happened to fit with their view of the world and what it was they wanted to do so in a sense those who provide the one word answers also perform a useful service they bless what some people want to do who simply want a blessing from someone after all how can we respond to a question like should i go for the pink one or the blue one hello what does the colour of the camera have to do with its ability to take pictures if you try to answer that though they'll still go for the one word answer pink or blue and completely ignore the lengthy diatribe you've provided to help them avoid a mistake at the same time i see a lot of my camera is broken questions and the typical responses to those is get it fixed even when the individual is asking for an explanation of what might be wrong with it this too is totally useless obviously it may have to be fixed the question was what might be wrong with it this too is irritating it doesn't help the person asking and it doesn't help anyone else who happens to read that question in hope of a reply that might educate them too however i'll admit using the one line get it fixed earns points again for those who aren't too concerned about actually assisting and it takes minimal effort and time then there are questions where the writer genuinely is trying to understand a concept there too come the one line answers i recall a recent question asking what slow sync was the intent was to understand the concept and when to use it one answer simply said it's for low light situations that doesn't address the issue it teaches nothing but again it does earn the writer two points at least that particular question had a few additional queries too that this answer totally ignored on the whole there are genuine people out there with a genuine need for some comprehensive information and many have already tried other sources for the answer it's a given that there will always be people replying to earn points or to push whatever their personal agenda happens to be but then that's life anyway it doesn't just happen here so we can take solice that at least some of us recognize the needs expressed and try our best to fulfill the need even when it costs a half hour or an hour to be comprehensive those of us who do that may not earn the big points and we are often ignored in the end too but it's not only the asker who reads the responses those responses will help others in addition to the asker so it's time well spent i think even if there is no other reward in the process however isn't helping others as best we can all the reward that's needed i think so alas there's just not enough people in this forum who happen to think like that so most of the answers will be stock answers or one liners until there is  Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Consensus decision-making
