getting information from my camcorder onto my computer i have a sony camcorder and i don't know how to get the stuff i filmed onto my computer you don't say if your camcorder is an older analog model or a newer digital one easiest first if it is digital you should have a cable which you can use to plug it into the computer perhaps via a usb port hopefully you would also have software that came with the camera or is already on your computer that will recognize the camera and save the videos to disk it may be as easy as a file transfer since they are already digital on the other hand if the camera is analog then you have to get a device that convert the analog signal into a digital one an analog to digital a d converter turtle beach makes one as does pinnacle and several other vendors you load the software on your computer then plug the camera into the converter and start the tape the a d box converts the signal to digital and the software receives this and saves it as a file you can then go into that video and edit it  Universal Serial Bus Digital photography DVD FireWire Floppy disk IPod High-definition television Sound card USB flash drive 8 mm video format Secure Digital card VHS PlayStation Portable Digital video recorder Digital cinema Digital video DV Bluetooth Copy protection Xbox Digital camera Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 PlayStation 2 Digital Modem Nintendo GameCube Warez Nintendo 64 Professional video camera Betacam Digital rights management Sony Apple Macintosh Walkman Hard disk ZX Spectrum Computer bus PlayStation 3 Computer Charge-coupled device Mouse (computing) Compact disc MiniDisc Audiophile Memory Stick Screenshot S-VHS Telephone Embedded system Videotape Computer forensics SCART AmigaOS IBM PC Digital circuit Trusted computing Digital signal processing Creative Zen Sega Dreamcast Xbox 360 S__CAM IBM PC compatible MOS Technology SID Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Amstrad CPC Atari ST Analog-to-digital converter Telephone exchange Camera Oscilloscope SonicStage Blu-ray Disc NTSC Digital audio player Device driver Analog signal Sharp Zaurus RGB color model CompactFlash Enterprise content management D-subminiature Windows Vista Computer hardware

how can i transfer mini dv to dvd hiya well it's a bit more troublesome if you're new to this but we all need to try at least through trial and error as anyone new to this will find on all dvs or cam corders you have what you call a usb port this usb uses what you call a fire wire port or usually you can see this on your desktop named as you first need buy the fire wire cable from there you can use windows movie maker to extract or sometimes depending on the system you have extract direct i'm just trying tell you the easiest way there are several ways to convert to dvd and one of the first tools i used to use before nero was a cool programme called tmpgenc download all the latest codecs too so extracting it only does not make it into a dvd but tmpgenc is designed to do this for you after this stage then use nero to burn but to tell you the truth it's not really easy at first and just like me years ago spent hrs and hrs studying this so good luck pal and keep trying till you succeed  DVD Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 PlayStation Portable Video codec IPod Windows XP PlayStation 3 Apple Macintosh Bluetooth Musical Instrument Digital Interface Camcorder High-definition television Commodore 64 Xbox IMac Slackware RS-232 Warez H.264/MPEG-4 AVC MP3 Parallel port Digital rights management Television OpenBSD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 2 USB flash drive Digital circuit Common Unix Printing System Computer virus Mac OS X Linux Macromedia Flash Perl AmigaOS Digital audio player Apple Computer Windows Vista Mozilla Firefox IBM PC compatible LiveCD Nintendo Revolution Forth programming language Serial ATA Sharp Zaurus Mac mini Sound card Digital photography Dolby Digital Screenshot S__CAM Creative Zen Machinima Floppy disk Oscilloscope Game programmer Video Knoppix Sound Blaster Disk image Mandriva Linux Printed circuit board Digital video recorder BitTorrent Computer bus PIC microcontroller Hard disk DivX TeX ATSC Modem Transformer Ethernet Serial port M60 machine gun MPEG-2 Streaming media D-subminiature AirPort Java programming language FireWire Atari 2600 CPU design RISC Windows 98 PowerPC Modchip Advanced Audio Coding MDAC SUSE Linux Jon Lech Johansen PCI Express Symbian OS Electronics USB mass storage device class Compiler optimization 64-bit Digital television

which camcorder do you recommend hd or mini dv hi i am part of the vastly growing youtube generation i have done some minor video projects before but i am thinking of expanding onto youtube and buying an new camcorder here are the two i am between canon optura canon hv the canon optura is not hd but still has an impressive picture the canon hv is hd and has an even better picture but costs a good more while i am willing to pay the money i need to know if its worth it to buy an hd camcorder for youtube can youtube play hd please note that i do not have an hdtv or any other appliance that plays hd if you are planning on making small video projects and youtube videos i recommend you buy the optura i have heard good things about the optura it even has a ccd and youtube doesn't even have hd capabilities anyway you probably won't even be able to take advantage of hd features anyway for a couple years due to the fact that it is still new and being developed don't get me wrong the hv is still a nice camera but internet and youtube videos are highly compressed and you will not tell the difference between sd and hd if i were you i would save the extra and spend it on audio equipment or something considering the optura has a microphone input they say that audio is just as important as video edit also there is no point in an hd camera if you have no hdtv because the only difference between hd and sd is resolution so hd video on an sd tv would look no different than sd video on an sd tv there's also the hd dvd that you have to buy too  High-definition television Camcorder Digital cinema 8 mm video format Digital photography Digital video Warez Laserdisc VHS DVD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital cinematography Charge-coupled device Videotape Video Xbox DV MPEG-2 Widescreen S-VHS Video codec Stereoscopy Sega Dreamcast MP3 Digital television Gross domestic product Television Digital8 Nintendo Revolution Machinima NTSC Independent film Movie projector Blu-ray Disc Professional video camera Movie camera Hubble Space Telescope Windows Vista PlayStation Portable Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Oscilloscope Anamorphic widescreen Karaoke Surveillance Floppy disk Film Cable television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Aspect ratio (image) Moving Picture Experts Group Videoconferencing S__CAM High fidelity Economics Canon (fiction) Microeconomics Star Trek, other storylines ITunes Digital single-lens reflex cameras Stereophonic sound Ocean's Twelve Secure Digital card ATI Technologies Microphone Super Nintendo Entertainment System Screenshot Surround sound Home cinema Sampling frequency Computer and video games Telecine Theory of conduct Sharp Zaurus Apple Computer Chess strategy and tactics Green Day Real Love (song) Internet pornography Camera Copy protection Xbox 360 Super Video CD Inflation Transformer HDV UK Singles Chart Mouse (computing) Videocassette recorder Dolby Digital Nine Inch Nails Audiophile Data compression Windows XP They Might Be Giants

why are almost all divx movies mb no matter the length or quality i have downloaded minute shows and hour movies and they were both dvd quality and both mb i am just wondering how and why divx is like mp you can compress video as much as you like most people the reason they make a divx is because they want it to fit on a cd r so they make it mb or just below if it was bigger you'd put in on a dvd and then you wouldn't need to make a divx in the first place  DivX Warez DVD Digital rights management XviD Video codec GamePark DIVX Theora Laserdisc PlayStation Portable DVD player Streaming media Machinima QuickTime Sega Dreamcast Video CD Widescreen Ripping Nero Digital Format war Videocassette recorder Live Aid High-definition television Vaporware MPlayer PlayStation 2 Anamorphic widescreen Broken (movie) Telecine AVI Video MP3 Camcorder Strap-on dildo Blu-ray Disc Xbox Media Center Direct-to-video Betacam Karaoke The Criterion Collection Oasis (band) Data compression Computer and video games The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Reefer Madness Motion picture rating system Once Upon a Time in America Movie projector H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Censorship in Australia Film Ogg Fahrenheit 9/11 David Quantick Transformers: The Movie Phantasmagoria (game) Superman III Penny Arcade (comic) Intolerance (film) Mystery Science Theater 3000 Chicago (band) Peter Gabriel Vowel Anime Sesame Street VHS Tapwave Zodiac Babylon 5 DV Stewie Griffin Married... with Children 8 mm video format Digital cinema GP2X The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Digital photography Revision3 Studios Dubbing (filmmaking) Pok__mon (anime) Dune (film) This Is Spinal Tap Return of the Ewok Punisher Lossless data compression The Internet Movie Database FFmpeg Dolby Digital Beastie Boys The Emancipation of Mimi Dream Theater ITunes Music Store Digimon VideoLAN The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series) Television movie Gorillaz Terminator 2: Judgment Day

i'm looking to purchase a semi pro camcorder any suggestions budget around i'm looking to shoot mostly interviews and short commercials films with the camera for the internet it has to be good quality and be up to date with todays technology some camcorders that have been suggested are the pan hvx cannon xl h and the sonyhdr z are there any others i should know about or is one of the above sufficient and why thanks i would recommend the sony dsr pd it has the standard ccd's and the manual controls you would expect from a professional camcorder the good thing i like about it is that it has two xlr inputs with individual recording volume adjustments it is running in the range for a new one that leaves you with a couple hundred dollars to spend on microphones and if you want to go over a little on your budget you can get some good lighting equipment  Digital photography Professional video camera Digital cinema 8 mm video format Digital camera VHS Independent film High-definition television XLR connector Camera DV Digital8 Photography Movie projector Electronic journalism Mixing console Film DVD Compact audio cassette Jack plug S-VHS Digital audio workstation Warez Digital video Videotape Covert listening device Multitrack recording Amateur radio PlayStation Portable Walkman View camera Betacam Konica Minolta Digital cinematography Hubble Space Telescope Videocassette recorder Carburetor JVC MP3 Gross domestic product RCA Sound recording Microeconomics Keynesian economics Mobile phone Aperture Amateur astronomy Oscilloscope Movie camera Movie theater Widescreen Capital accumulation Lighting FireWire Karaoke Inflation Solar cell Reliability engineering Telephone Semi-trailer Weapons of Star Trek Anamorphic widescreen Apple Macintosh Nintendo Revolution Disc jockey WNEP-TV Machinima Circuit breaker Hearing aid Sony Mouse (computing) Fire-control system Megas XLR Panavision PlayStation 3 Sensor DMX (lighting) E85 Game controller Film crew Transformer Microphone Bluetooth Nintendo DS Digital rights management M16 (rifle) Holography Social Security debate (United States) Fluoroscopy Computer Canon T90 Anti-aircraft warfare Artillery Videoconferencing Battery electric vehicle Supply-side economics

i'm looking for the right camcorder or video camera i don't know the difference i am going to use it to film my soccer games for college reasons so i want it to be good quality with enough room to film long games i also want to be able to make copies of the tape so that i can send them to relatives to watch on their televisions hopefully there is something out there that fits all of my criteria i agree with the st response in that a camera with a hdd hard disk drive will give you the most for your money i would avoid using a refurbished camera as you don'yt know why it was refurbished and you don't know if that problem or another problem with teh camera will present itself again warranties on refurbished units usually aren't as lomng as the original manufacturers warnings if you can afford it wait until a jvc or a sony model goes on sale at best buy and seriously consider the year service plan it covers everything from maintenance to accidental damage due to dropping well beyond what the warranty will cover also you should note that the cameras start at about gb and will give you hours of excellent video not or on a gb unit that you were told as far as copying them for others you will get a standard av cable in the unit that will allow you to copy the video from the harddrive directly to a vhs tape or to a dvd recorder if you choose plus you wont have to worry about buying the right dvd as there are some compatibility issues with the dvd r and dvd r and their related media hope this helps  DVD Camcorder VHS Hard disk Videocassette recorder Digital photography High-definition television Laserdisc Videotape Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting 8 mm video format JVC PlayStation 2 S-VHS Floppy disk Blu-ray Disc PlayStation 3 Xbox Warez IBM PC compatible DV Surveillance Television S__CAM Digital video IBM PC Photography Betacam Doctor Who missing episodes Betamax Compact disc Pornography MSX USB flash drive Windows XP FireWire Back to the Future TiVo Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Live Aid Computer and video games Enterprise content management Fahrenheit 9/11 IBook First-sale doctrine Sega Dreamcast Digital rights management Universal Serial Bus Video CD Digital video recorder Grey market Nintendo GameCube Anamorphic widescreen Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Gramophone record Warranty Modchip Atari 8-bit family Nintendo Amstrad CPC Computer virus Copyleft Sound recording MiniDisc Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox 360 Video codec Video game crash of 1983 PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Walkman Western Digital Windows Vista Nintendo 64 Commodore International Atari ST Sega 32X The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Cable television RCA Video game music Digital8 SCART Punisher MP3 Internet fraud Escape from New York Stereoscopy

manage avi files captured from digital camcorder i used pinncale studio to capture avi files from my digital camcorder these files about gb each are scattered on three hard disks i want to put all files on one hard disk shall i just move the files to new location or i need to recapture the video will studio be able to detect the scenes in moved files is moving files affect my saved projects my other question can a software other than studio can open these avi files and detect the scenes thanks you can put them all into one file and studio will still detect the scenes however moving files will affect saved projects as the project links to the last known location of the video file when you capture studio creates a buffer file that you can disguard studio doesnt use it detecting scenes is a something that a number of video editing software does in studio it simply scans through your video and detects any frame where the pixels change completely in the next frame camera flashes will be picked up as scenes another thing in studio when you are in capture mode there is a little picture of a folder clicking on this allows you to direct files to a certain location this is a good way to keep files from going all over the place  Digital photography Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Warez Digital camera Digital video Floppy disk Screenshot Computer animation Enterprise content management PlayStation Portable DV Camcorder Traditional animation Windows Vista Stereoscopy File Allocation Table Anamorphic widescreen Geographic information system Streaming media IPod Movie camera Video Videotape ITunes AVI File system Digital cinematography Independent film DVD Windows XP Secure Digital card Computer virus QuickTime Pixel Disk image Digital video recorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Virtual memory Macintosh Finder Windows 2000 Digital circuit Photography High-definition television Atari 8-bit family Nintendo GameCube Copy protection AmigaOS Computer Ebook Motion capture NTFS 2D computer graphics Cache Web page 3D computer graphics ZX Spectrum Automatic number plate recognition Charge-coupled device Apple IIGS Hard disk Film VHS Amstrad CPC Object Desktop Professional video camera Iriver Federal Standard 1037C Image file formats ILife Btrieve NeXT Acorn Electron Steganography AviSynth Xbox 360 Anti-virus software System 7 (Macintosh) Steam (content delivery) USB flash drive Quest for Glory Original Amiga chipset Digital image editing Creative Zen Apple II family Password S-VHS FireWire PlayStation 3 Video codec Blender (software) Library (computer science) Persistence of vision DivX

how can i stop video from flickering when edited from a dvd in premiere elements i'm trying to edit a home movie from a finalized dvd from a mini dvd cam everything is fine until i render the project either as a file or straight to dvd it looks really flickery and hard to watch i've tried everything like changing field dominance and interlace options but to no avail can anyone help yes both are pal fps the dvd is finalized so it's basically it's a normal mpeg dvd like you'd get a movie on it loads edits and plays fine on the screen it's only when it is burnt back on to a dvd or file that the result is a really flickery picture kind of like when you see a news article on tv and hundreds of people are flashing cameras and the picture almost has an echo to it does the project setting and the camcorder recording standard match i e both pal or both ntsc make sure they do what quality setting was used on the camcorder the mpeg system works well if it isn't over compressed if you were in lp mode then this may be the problem premiere pro can give various qualities of playback from preview to full quality a lot of this will depend on your vdieo card and other system parameters check it's not on preview quality if you are really into your video work then it isn't a bad idea to buy a cheap portable telly and monitor using this far better than using a computers vdu computers don t display video partiuclarly well different scan patterns different signals and different ways of handling colour  Television DVD Digital photography NTSC S__CAM VHS Camcorder DV Digital television Laserdisc Digital cinema 8 mm video format Digital video Atari 8-bit family H.264/MPEG-4 AVC MPEG-2 PlayStation Portable Warez AmigaOS Interlace Windows Vista ATSC Floppy disk MP3 Digital cinematography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Super Nintendo Entertainment System Telecine Movie projector Screenshot Sega Saturn Betacam Computer display Pixel Digital camera Windows 2000 Original Amiga chipset Xbox 360 IPod Xbox Commodore 64 Nintendo GameCube S-VHS Video codec Videocassette recorder Enterprise content management PlayStation 2 Oscilloscope Digital video recorder RGB color model Stereoscopy Computer and video games Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation 3 Computer Compact disc PAL Film Federal Standard 1037C Video CD PC Engine Final Fantasy Videotape Copy protection Windows XP Macromedia Flash Amstrad CPC PNG ZX Spectrum Universal Serial Bus Movie camera Non-linear editing system ATI Technologies Computer animation Nintendo Entertainment System Computer virus Personal computer Apple Computer Compact audio cassette Digital rights management MiniDisc Portable Document Format Handheld game console Dance Dance Revolution Creative Zen Super Video CD System/36 Loudspeaker Sega Dreamcast Sound Blaster Cheating in Counter-Strike Archos IBM PC compatible

i am planning to buy a handycam hdd series either sony or jvc sony is cheaper than jvc same specs advise pls i am just wondering if why jvc gb mp is expensive than sony gb mp i want an advice before buying thanks i always choose sony simply because sony has imo the best picture quality if you use nightvision function sony have the best on the market read the small print regarding resolution also you want optical resolution quite often technical details refer to the 'software interpolated enhanced' resolution but either way this shouldnt affect your purchase if you plan on mastering dvds the resolution will be greatly reduced and current tv sets are incapable of displaying anything remotely as high as even mp whatever way go for sony its cheaper better quality and well built  High-definition television DVD Digital photography Blu-ray Disc PlayStation 3 VHS Sony PlayStation Portable Videocassette recorder MSX Apple Macintosh Camcorder Nintendo Digital rights management Nintendo 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Copy protection Videotape Bluetooth Sega Betamax Mouse (computing) DualDisc JVC Super Nintendo Entertainment System USB flash drive Nintendo Revolution Binoculars DV Atari ST PlayStation 2 MMORPG Amiga Sound Blaster Compact disc Modchip Image scanner Sharp Zaurus NTSC Atari 8-bit family Handheld game console Enterprise content management Super Video CD Unicode X Window System Gramophone record Universal Serial Bus MAME Photography Movie projector MPEG-2 Video CD Floppy disk Sony Computer Entertainment Anamorphic widescreen Machinima Solar cell Tungsten Handheld Radeon Widescreen Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega 32X 8 mm video format Digital cinematography PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Analog-to-digital converter Walkman Color Graphics Adapter MiniDisc MP3 Panavision Galileo spacecraft Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy (video game) Automatic number plate recognition Virtual memory Console wars CPU design Geographic information system Sega Saturn Publicly funded medicine SCART Warez Final Fantasy IX Compact audio cassette Cell (microprocessor) Computer and video games IMac Television Musical Instrument Digital Interface PolyGram Sega Dreamcast Solar power Digital cinema Windows Vista Betacam Mutual fund

how do i record from my tv to my camcorder so i want to know that i have a dv dsc camera camcorder and i have the red white and yellow jacks that connect to it but whenever i connect it to my camera nothing shows up on the camera it just goes blank but it shows up on the tv im trying to record some of my video games and tv shows and i dont want to spend money on a capture card what do i do most camera camcorder cameras don't allow the video signal to come in it most likely only goes out if it does allow for the signal to come in most of the time it's through an adapter for the camera check the camera manual for video in out and see what it says and if you need to purchase the adapter if no adapter is needed then maybe you have to set your camera to vcr mode then hit record to see if that opens up the signal  Camcorder 8 mm video format DV Digital camera Professional video camera S-VHS Secure Digital card Betacam Copy protection Digital photography Videotape Videocassette recorder SCART High-definition television Digital video Television Screenshot DVD Camera Compact disc S__CAM Digital video recorder NTSC Charge-coupled device Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Bluetooth Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Composite video Oscilloscope Universal Serial Bus Digital cinema Movie camera Atari 8-bit family Digital Visual Interface Warez Technicolor RCA Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters FireWire Game Boy ITU-T The Amazing Race Hiawatha Line Resident Evil Color Graphics Adapter Back to the Future Teletext Sinclair ZX81 Railway signal Jack plug Film Nintendo GameCube Game show Federal Standard 1037C Machine vision Traffic light Digital8 Computer bus Sampling frequency Commodore 64 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Advanced Squad Leader Widescreen Composite monitor TiVo Poker jargon Panavision RGB color model SMPTE time code Light-emitting diode Motion capture Independent film Blackjack JVC DirectShow ITunes YUV Video The Wiggles Washington Metro Sound card Floppy disk Surround sound Xbox Desktop computer Betting (poker) Archos Max Payne Ethernet Surveillance XDCAM The Sims 2 Color Movie projector Frame rate Modem

how do videographers shoot and edit video footages on the same day i myself is a videographer considering that you have to capture all tapes from all cameras to get the different angles what if you used say dv camcorders to capture all tapes from all cameras would be something like hrs the most if you have a tape full of video footage greetings i can't speak for the professionals whom do the same day edit sde but i can understand how it can be done i'm referring to wedding videographers but you might be referring to a one hour event there are different ways of doing them for the wedding videographer first have a fast laptop second have some of the recording already uploaded in the nle like the audio from the father for talk over etc as well as the entryway of the location of the wedding etc etc third take mental notes of what part of what tape you need to capture better yet capture with an attached hard drive and computer will be much faster than real time understand that most sde's don't have and hour of video from what i have seen they are more along the lines of to five minutes long and you need to catalog in your mind what to have in the sde and where they are contained on what camcorder tapes most sde are shown a hour or hours later at the beginning of the reception it varies depending on what part of the country you are in to what goes in seattle is not the same as what goes in new jersey or regarding an event like a concert i would think the easiest way to take care of a sde would be to do it real time if the camcorders are all liked together you can capture the video in real time that would be the easy way the second way would be to upload the tapes and seat the video in a nle and do a edit from there seems to me that once you had all the video together and they are at the same timeframe you could edit rather quickly and render the video out to dvd or whatever format you wanted please keep in mind that i'm not an expert see links below to some who are hope that helps  Digital video 8 mm video format VHS DV Music video Digital photography Warez Videocassette recorder Digital cinematography Digital8 Digital cinema Videotape DVD Machinima Sound recording Digital camera Betacam High-definition television Screenshot Disc jockey HDV Live Aid Video S-VHS FireWire Saturday Night Live Professional video camera Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Commodore 64 Bohemian Rhapsody Windows Vista Floppy disk 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Compact audio cassette MP3 JVC Closed-circuit television Photography Motion capture Surveillance Stereoscopy The Ashlee Simpson Show The Menagerie Glen Jacobs Reel-to-reel audio tape recording The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Sant Thakar Singh Back to the Future Compact disc Traditional animation Magnetic tape Audio tape length and thickness Girls Aloud XDCAM Enterprise content management IPod Windows XP Xbox 360 Computer bus WNEP-TV Film DVCPRO P2 Xbox Family Guy Amstrad CPC Photojournalism Hard disk Linear video editing Betamax RCA U.S. television news Bret Hart Muhammad al-Durrah Universal Serial Bus PlayStation 3 Mixtape Alias (TV series) Secure Digital card Not The Nine O'Clock News Escape from New York Video game music S__CAM Multitrack recording DVD-RAM Telecine Oasis (band) Guns N' Roses Apple Computer NTSC Archos Electronic journalism ITunes Music Store Mac OS X Television MiniDisc

camera conversion p how do you convert your camera's frame rate to p i dont noe if its possible iown a sony dcr hc minidv camcorder i would like to know how to convert the frame rate to p please you can make the coversion but you might not be happy with the results if the subject is moving or the camera is moving there will be bad artifacts the first comes from de interlace your i frame is actually made up of two fields both fields capture the entire picture at slightly different time this off set causes the moving objects to be in slightly different position in field and field so when combined to make a frame there is blur the second comes from the reverse telecine operation in order to make frames out of you have to throw out frames each second which is done by removing every th frame this results in a stutter step jerkiness in what should be smooth motion a program that speciallizes in the frame rate conversion will do a slightly better job as it will combine de interlace with reverse telecine to interpolate a smoother finished frame sequence pro sound is sampled at k which allows the audio samples do be divided smoothly over various frame rates and generally that can be converted without a lot of artifacts potentially a loss of sync can eventually occur if not corrected by the software but that is no more difficult than what it does when adding a k sampled cd to the soundtrack  Frame rate Digital video Interlace Movie projector High-definition television Video 3D computer graphics Digital photography 8 mm video format Anamorphic widescreen Camcorder Computer animation Traditional animation MPEG-2 Deinterlacing Digital camera Persistence of vision Atari 8-bit family Laserdisc Original Amiga chipset Compression artifact H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital cinema Television Screenshot Analog-to-digital converter Motion capture MP3 Synthesizer PAL Oscilloscope Sampling frequency Compiler optimization Mouse (computing) Telerecording Videotape Dither Frame of reference Warez Compact disc Digital cinematography Faster-than-light Geographic information system Audio data compression Film Federal Standard 1037C Motion blur Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Software-defined radio Video codec Swingout General relativity Super 8 mm film Secure Digital card Stereoscopy Broadcast television system Floppy disk Time dilation Depth of field Magnet Gravity Motion compensation Nintendo 64 Konica Minolta Speed of light Luminiferous aether Amstrad CPC 720p Computer Charge-coupled device Sony Digital Hubble Space Telescope Explosive material Sampling (statistics) Bullet time Sun VHS Apple Computer 1080i Automatic number plate recognition IMAX Horse gait Video game music Beatmania IIDX Computer virus Low-pass filter
