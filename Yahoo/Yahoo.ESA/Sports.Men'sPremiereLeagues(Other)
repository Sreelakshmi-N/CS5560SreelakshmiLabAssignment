in regard to the best football leagues in the world where would you rate the bundesliga last year's bundesliga's title race was great and it went right down to the wire but bayern munich had a bad season and didn't even qualify for the champions league they will be missed in order to make the bundesliga more popular a german club needs to go far in the champions league and perhaps even win the competition i would say the epl is the best league in the world followed by the la liga and then the serie a then the bundesliga and then the portuguese league  Bundesliga (football) Bayern Munich Gerd M__ller Werder Bremen UEFA Champions League Ali Daei FA Premier League Primera Divisi__n Argentina FC Schalke 04 FC Hansa Rostock Bayer Leverkusen Michael Ballack Alex Ferguson Futebol Clube do Porto SuperLiga VfL Wolfsburg Everton F.C.
