why is the field at bosman stadium completely brown is it sand or just really bad grass i just watched the end of a valke bulls currie cup rugby match and at first my impression was that this was some sort of beach rugby temperatures at night dip below zero on the highveld during winter and the nightly frosts turn the grass brown the bigger unions like the bulls lions and cheetahs can afford to spend huge amounts of money on grass that is not affected by frost they have lovely green fields but the smaller unions have to get by with frosted results of the climate  Currie Cup Johannesburg Wales national rugby union team Telstra Stadium Professional sports Japan national rugby union team South Africa History of rugby league England national rugby union team Croke Park Sport in the United Kingdom Blue Bulls November 2004 in sports Rugby football Football (soccer) Rugby union in Wales The Championships, Wimbledon Rugby league Sale Sharks 2003 Rugby Union World Cup Bristol Rugby Queensland Rugby League Troms__ I.L.

is a rugby field bigger than a football field from goaline to goaline im trying to figure it out so i know how to condition for rugby yes but that won't address your question rugby is a stamina game you have to go constantly for two minute halves a rugby pitch is meters long versus yards long for a football field so a rugby pitch is a little longer but in rugby you will run end to end many times during a game and from side to side as far as conditioning goes i would say stamina and lower body strength will be the area to focus on circuit training is very effective but you don't want to rest too long between stations you won't get the chance in a rugby game to rest often other than during penalties or after a try  Football (soccer) American football Rugby union Rugby league Football (soccer) positions Rugby football Canadian football Wales national rugby union team Newcastle United F.C.
