king and prince i have a hypothetical question and i'm trying to prove a point to a few people a man is prince he has an illegitmate child and then get married to another woman and they have a child even if the older one's parents weren't married at the time of his birth wouldn't he be the rightful heir to the throne because his father is going to be king and he's the eldest it depends on the laws of the country some countries go with the rule of primogeniture rule by the eldest child or eldest son some countries may have rules that restrict the inheritance of the crown to legitimate children only for example i believe henry viii had an illegitimate son that was never considered an acceptable candidate for the throne only the children of his wives were candidates also keep in mind that nothing is certain the prince father may die or be killed before he can assume the throne and if his sons are too young to rule the crown may be passed to the other princes or princesses of his generation and then to their children alternately a regent may be appointed to rule temporarily until the child comes of age this delicate power blaance is rarely accepted in most modern monarchies  Heir Apparent Order of succession British monarchy Line of succession to the Monegasque Throne Primogeniture Succession to the British Throne Emperor of Japan Regency Acts Christian IX of Denmark House of Bourbon Hereditary peer Monarch Edward III of England George VI of the United Kingdom Louise of Hesse Kings of Jerusalem Henry VIII of England House of Orange-Nassau Pretender Duke of Braganza British Royal Family Wars of the Roses James II of England George V of the United Kingdom Elizabeth I of England Mary I of England Succession laws Imperial Household of Japan Frederick VII of Denmark Anne of Great Britain George I of Great Britain Louis XIV of France War of the Spanish Succession __rp__ds Appanage George III of the United Kingdom Line of succession to the British Throne Mary II of England Salic law Edward VI of England Charles II of England Henry VII of England Lady Frances Brandon Matrilineal succession William IV of the United Kingdom Princess of Wales Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Richard III of England Joseon Dynasty Parliament of the United Kingdom Henry I of England Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem Caroline, Princess of Hanover Ruling Queens of N__menor Richard I of England Line of succession to the Spanish Throne Dutch monarchy Emperor of China George IV of the United Kingdom Margrethe II of Denmark Kingdom of Navarre Hatshepsut Danish Royal Family Hundred Years' War John of England Marriage Albert II, Prince of Monaco Monarchy in Canada Duke of Somerset Philip II of Spain Albert II of Belgium Thai royal and noble titles George II of Great Britain Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Maria II of Portugal Haakon VII of Norway Henry VI of England Elizabeth of York Inheritance Palaeologus Prince Princes in the Tower Monarchy Emperor Xuan of Han Competitors for the Crown of Scotland Emperor Guangwu of Han Struggle for the throne of Portugal Jadwiga of Poland Romanov Ferdinand II of Aragon Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon

why is the queen's husband not titled the king of england you would think that once you marry the heir to the throan you automaticly become their counter title i've answered this question so many times the queen was heir to her father king george vi and philip was not an hereditary heir to the throne just a son in law since the queen is regent no one can bear a title higher than hers which is queen regent the title king implies the regent and this won't do because the regent is queen philip of royal birth danish german greek royal houses must use the title for consort of a ruling queen which is prince consort consort is what a person who marries an heir can get in england england's rule is hereditary thusly the wife of the prince of wales will never reign but wear the title of queen or princess as they claim consort the same rule apples to a male who marries an heir to the throne he can never reign automatically but becomes a consort it would take an act of parliament for philip to become king  Heir Apparent British monarchy Louise of Hesse Regency Acts Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Christian IX of Denmark British Royal Family George VI of the United Kingdom Victoria of the United Kingdom Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Charles, Prince of Wales George I of Great Britain Edward III of England Prince Kingdom of England Edward VII of the United Kingdom George V of the United Kingdom Succession to the British Throne Dutch monarchy Princess of Wales Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Elizabeth I of England Imperial Household of Japan Thai royal and noble titles Mary I of England Henry VIII of England Kings of Jerusalem Monarch Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem Emperor Philip II of Spain Edward IV of England House of Bourbon Hatshepsut Mary I of Scotland George III of the United Kingdom Frederick VII of Denmark Line of succession to the British Throne Order of succession Joseon Dynasty Emperor of Japan House of Orange-Nassau King consort United Kingdom order of precedence Habsburg William III of England Richard III of England James I of England Victoria, Princess Royal and Empress Frederick Mary II of England George II of Great Britain Prince of Wales Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall Mary of Teck Charles II of England John of England Alexandra of Denmark Regent Wars of the Roses Henry VI of England Peerage Danish Royal Family Duke Kingdom of Hawaii Princess Charlotte, Princess Royal Richard I of England Marie Sophie of Hesse British princess Maud of the United Kingdom Juliana of the Netherlands Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl__cksburg Caroline of Ansbach Catherine of Aragon Princess consort Emperor Ai of Han Duke of Braganza Fujiwara clan James II of England Jadwiga of Poland Chinese nobility Henry VII of England Margrethe II of Denmark Christian I of Denmark Morganatic marriage Wladislaus IV of Poland Maria II of Portugal Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Style of the British Sovereign Lord Chancellor
