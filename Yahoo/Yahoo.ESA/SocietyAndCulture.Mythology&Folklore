whats your take on black and white magic when does magic become a black how far do you have to go can i use magic for anything and do i have to have candles and draw pentacles or can i soley rely on energy magick is not black or white it just is it's like electricity it can be wonderfully helpful or it can kill you it's how it is used that makes it positive or negative generally what is termed black magick is anything that interferes with another person's free will so many many things fall into that definition of black magick in that broad definition love magick when used to manipulate a specific person and domination magick getting the boss to promote you when generally you don't get along making someone bend to your will would count as black magick black magick could be limited to magick that causes specific malicious harm to someone so anything causing emotional mental spiritual or physical distress of any kind would fall under that definition however in some cultures black magick is only malicious magick that is cast without just cause for instance a killing spell would be justified if it was cast against someone who raped your wife girlfriend sister daughter etc but jinxing someone who simply rubbed you the wrong way would be black magick ethics are a very personal thing and one that everyone and especially any magickal practitioner should think long and hard about before beginning to cast anything  Magic (paranormal) Witchcraft Wicca Abortion debate Evil Scientology beliefs and practices Neuro-linguistic programming L.

paranormal question something may be trying to take my life when i sleep i sometimes feal a real negative force around me late at night at around midnight but more like twards in the morning anyone that can give me some helpful advice on how i can take care of this where i can enjoy my life more and have my mind on better goal orented things in my life i would greatly appreciate it again this is bothering me just give me some helpful advice thanks alot i agree with tasha however just because you feel a presence does not mean its a negative force our conscious mind tells us that if we do not know what something is it is probably bad between midnight and am most people in your time zone and surrounding are asleep so the mental plane is quieter allowing the spiritual to connect easier there are not as many distractions involving conscious thinking since this is happening during these times i would say you definitely have a spirit of some sort around you it's a posititve thing that you can pick up on this if it scares you do what tasha said burn some sage not just in the room you sleep but the entire house as well get a cross pendant wall cross whatever and put it in the room you sleep the point at which the two lines meet in the center creates a circle of white light invisible to the human eye but the spiritual can see this ask them to go to the light and leave you alone i don't feel this is a negative energy just unknown to you but i would like to mention that you having the ability to feel this is incredible not many people are that aware nowadays good luck  Out-of-body experience Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Theory of conduct Milton H.

what do you think is the best astrolodical sign to be born into and why capricorn aguarius virgo taurus leo cancer gemini sagitttarius aries libra pisces scorpio please don't just say because i was born into it nelly interesting point but can one could argue that not all months because a woman is only pregnant for months so how would you justify that we're all born under exactly the right combination of planets in signs to give us the skills we need to navigate our way through our present lifetimes remember too that we're all combinations of all twelve signs even if you don't have planets in a certain sign it's still there in your natal chart can't just skip a sign edit when you look at your birth chart it's a wheel comprised of twelve houses in which the twelve signs reside example my sun is in sagittarius in the fourth house however the sign on my fourth house cusp is scorpio sagittarius actually rules my th house capricorn rules the th aquarius the th pisces rules my th house and even though i have no planets in pisces the fact that it's there on the cusp of my th means that i express piscean energy in the area of my life that has to do with the th house house of death and regeneration also legacies and inheritances and psychic powers and occult studies so you see your birth chart is like a pie that has been divided into twelve slices and most of the time each of the twelve signs is going to be on one of the house cusps sometimes a sign is intercepted within a house meaning that it's completely contained within a house and doesn't touch a house cusp at all the sign cusps are all degrees apart the house cusps vary in distance to each other therefore even if there is no planet within a certain sign at the time of your birth that sign's energy will still be expressed through the house that it resides in no one is purely one sign alone does that make sense to you  Zodiac The Twelve Labours Western astrology Medical astrology Solar system in astrology Ruling planet Birthday Capricornus Virgo Sabbat (neopaganism) Pisces Scorpius Aquarius Cancer (constellation) Wheel of the Year Sister Princess Libra Gemini Aries Leo Taurus (constellation) Sagittarius Astrology Solar Element Saga Mithraism Star of Bethlehem Astronomy on Mars W.I.T.C.H.

don't you hate how ppl in the section don't believe in ghosts spirits ouija boards psychics aliens anything paranormal even if it is right in front of them whenever you ask a question they respond all rudely saying how you're lying about whatever it's not real that never happened first yes i do second when a response is both not helpful and rude i do not hesitate to use the report abuse button i respect different opinions when they are expressed respectfully and intelligently third there is a section in science mathematics called alternative and further divides into paranormal phenomena and parapsychology the section has a few vocal debunkers most of the people in the mythology section are usually more open minded i would love to see some open minded people over in science math fourth debunkers not skeptics which is a word they abuse long ago had to resort to claims of lying cheating drug use and mental illness to explain things that they had no other explanation for just fyi the actual research on this seldom finds evidence of any of their claims for instance there is zero correlation between mental illness and ghost sightings fifth all that said i am skeptical of some claims like the ouija board that when tested as far back as by michael faraday always shows that physical force is used to move the planchette the triangle this does not mean that it might not be working via your own esp and unconscious muscle movements or connecting with your own subconscious it means when it was shown to not be moving by unexplained forces debunkers dismissed it claimed it disproven and moved on real scientist would ask if it provided accurate information that was other wise unknown to you and create experiments to test this idea michael john weaver m s director new mexico anomaly society http nmas freeservers com  Unidentified flying object Extra-sensory perception Anomalous phenomenon Scientific skepticism Telepathy Supernatural Pseudoscience Abduction Phenomenon Psychokinesis New Age Unconscious mind Roswell UFO incident Out-of-body experience Consciousness Neuro-linguistic programming James Randi Magical thinking Autism Magic (paranormal) Psychology Condon Committee Near-death experience Intelligent design Philosophy of science Cognitive science Artificial consciousness Charles Fort Ufology Dissociative identity disorder Project Blue Book Empathy Extraterrestrial hypothesis Magic (illusion) Religion Epistemology Human Physics Intelligence quotient Scientific method Cult Edgar Cayce A Course In Miracles Science Franz Boas Skepticism Philip J.

why is heracles referred to as hercules in the west or is the term more applied to our modern world less we appreciate the ancient world let's see if i remember my intro to gk rmn mythology course hercules is the latin form of the name derived from the greek herakles via the etruscans and in use throughout the classical latin period bc ad since the majority of the english lexicon is derived from romantic and germanic roots and not greek it is only natural we use the latin derivation i agree calling the mythical figure heracles would be truer to its roots and provide a bit of insight ironic though it may be to the legends surrounding him  Heracles Greek mythology Mythology Celt Latin The Twelve Labours Greco-Buddhist art Hades Paganism Demigod Hesperides Lernaean Hydra Inflection Syncretism Omphale Hercules (constellation) Geryon Art in Ancient Greece Hera Atlas (mythology) Religion and mythology Melqart Chariot Dark Ages Ancient Greek Eostre Roman mythology Hercules (comics) Suiones Greek language Greeks Hermes Celtic mythology Romanticism Neopaganism Pelasgians Folklore Indo-European languages Erymanthian Boar Theology Morphology (linguistics) Republicanism Gothic language Athena Ceryneian Hind Lydia English poetry Serpent Tetragrammaton European dragon Jupiter (god) Nazarene Classical compound Proto-Indo-European language Hercules (1997 film) Old English language R-Type Amazons Phoenicia Nicene Creed Classical antiquity Troy Etruscan mythology Literature Europa (mythology) Etymology Hungarian language Greek alphabet Pomegranate Esperanto as an international language Atlantis Proto-Germanic language Sin Ruthenia German language English words of Greek origin Love Music genre Loeb Classical Library Names of God in Judaism Hippolyte Ligature (typography) Tityas Zonguldak Province Germanic tribes Etruscan language A Hebrew language Cerberus Jason Anglo-Saxons Old French Pillars of Hercules Infinity Prometheus Gnosticism Devil Etymology of Rus and derivatives

do things really happen for a reason ok i keep thinking about how things happen mostly how i have lived my life so far when i was small my parents moved from the small town we lived in to the city where i live now there i signed up for music classes which made me get into a good music middle school where i met my best friend that is still my best friend after all these years which made me apply for a good music high school so if my parents hadn't of moved i wouldn't or maybe i would of signed up and gone everywhere i have been so far and maybe the person i am today so what do u think do things lead up to other or is life just this spontaneous big blob i think so because if it didn't i too wouldn't have been where i am today something happened and still happen that have affected my life and continue to do so somethings happened that i have not thought about that have pushed me hopefully in the right direction if you believe in god you will truly believe it all happens with a purpose from him and for a good reason if you don't believe in him then i don't know maybe that's how the life cycle goes maybe it's all karma or fate written in the stars i however think there is a place for everything and everything and everyone in it's rightful place otherwise if it all didn't matter we wouldn't get where we're at right now it would all be chaos and insanity nothing would make sense my advice is to go with the flow believe in god and or the higher being and hopefully everything will fall into place but also believe in yourself because you have to be the difference in this world either written out or spontaneous  Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Predestination Karma Theodicy Friedrich Schleiermacher Free will Humphrey Bogart Karma in Hinduism Aristotle Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Determinism Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Atomism Supernatural Entropy Moral objectivism Tide Piccolo Junior Saga Luck Confucius Sri Aurobindo Soul Culture of Lithuania The nature of God in Western theology God Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Life insurance Origin belief Appeal Royal Assent Socrates Storytelling Reincarnation One Tree Hill (TV series) Cindy Sheehan God Emperor of Dune Leviathan (book) On the Road Professor X Ethics Phoebe Halliwell Montreal Screwjob Vacuum 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Intelligent design Tai Chi Chuan Sant Mat Japanese particles Duties of the Heart Summa Theologiae Characters of Lost Abortion debate Garth Brooks Friends The Pet Sounds Sessions Jon Secada Origin of life Opus Dei Milton H.

if psychics have true powers why does it seem like they cannot prove it to the scientific community look at http www randi org and look at the million dollar prize for a person to reveal their powers and prove them there is a full list of similar prizes and contests at http en wikipedia org wiki list of prizes for evidence of the paranormal and tell me what you think to everyone who answered i do beleive in the parnormal i just find it funny that a powerful psychic wouldnt go for the challenge and still successively complete it although that would mean extensive media coverage and extreme loss of privacy and someone who is so closely connected with the universe could care less about trivial things like money and fame i always beleived that the best musicain for example would never have the opportunity or desire to showcase his talents people including myself are going to be highly suspect of any question that mentions randi unless of course they are confirmed debunkers not skeptics which is a word they abuse now let's discuss science science does not prove anything for instance prove to me to my satisfaction that you are not evil i will always have the deciding vote and the upper hand science does provide support or fails to provide support for hypothesis science in the form of parapsychology has provided support for the hypothesis of esp and pk the parapsychological association http www parapsych org has been an affiliate of the american association for the advancement of science http aaas org since no skeptics organization has ever been admitted i myself am very skeptical of people that claim to have psychic powers at a accuracy rate now let's discuss human performance if i offered michael jordan million dollars to make free throws from the free throw line but they had to be in a row no misses it is unlikely that he could accomplish this the same is true of any human performance issue like esp this is why many psychologist are the ones studying such abilities it is a human ability research using the ganzfeld esp protocol has shown that people are correct of the time where chance predicts the odds against chance are in the 's of millions two groups at juliard tested and correct hit rates so there are some people that are better at this ability than others just like not everyone is a mozart thus to truly test a psychics abilities would require 's of controlled trials and satistically analyzing the results to see if they were more then chance and what the probabilities were randi does not accept statistical evidence as all real scientist do and does not conduct actual research michael john weaver m s director new mexico anomaly society http nmas freeservers com  Telepathy Scientific skepticism Science Pseudoscience James Randi Psychokinesis Scientific method Intelligent design Unidentified flying object Ganzfeld experiment Bayesian inference Cancer Philosophy of science Remote viewing Supernatural Roswell UFO incident Psychology Autism Project Blue Book Intelligence quotient Condon Committee Homeopathy The Bell Curve Neurofeedback Franz Boas The Skeptical Environmentalist Neuro-linguistic programming Abduction Phenomenon John Lott Epistemology William A.

i saw father christmas once no lie as a child a couple of days before the event i was drawn out of bed and i pulled the curtain aside and saw a cartoon image of father christmas reindeers and slay in the night sky it was confusing at the time and i'm not a believer of anything but what i saw was a moving image i tell you straight has anyone else seen this too i lived in the sticks at the time and there was no giant decorations or even a street light the image was very high in the deep blue clear cold sky and it used to snow every christmas time and my windows had frosty patterns on them even on the inside bbrrh cold i believe you moley because the child mind is so ripe with imagination and innocence and our creativity hasn't been beaten into submission yet when i was a kid the shadows coming through my bedroom window against the streetlight used to become a guy and a girl 's style sharing a giant single microphone and singin' and dancin' it was vivid not just kinda which leaves the question are these things really happening on some level and as we grow older we lose the sensitivity in our perception and the other question was this santa you saw a jolly fat white guy in a red suit or a giant laughing blue mole with a pajama cap on his head i never told my childhood vision story to anyone please don't make fun of me moley  Santa Claus Christmas Milton H.

how do you use a triangle of manifestation at first you trace a circle around yourself in which you are going to stand or sit you imagine this circle of being part of a protective sphere that surrounds you as you progress in your magical evolution you will expand the characteristics of this protective sphere consequently your power in dealing with spirits will increase especially when you are going to use the commanding power of divine consciousness in front of your circle you have your table or altar the altar is nothing but an individual switchboard that serves as a structural link to the specific realms or energies which you intend to explore or use in the practice that you are going to do your altar of course has to be a structural representation of the aligning of the four elements within yourself and an expression of the structure of the divine name therefore your altar will have utensils that represent the four elements these utensils should be arranged in a way that reflects their aligning you set your table up as follows draw a circle on the table you may use a cord and lay out a circle with the cord inside the circle you trace an equilateral triangle this is your triangle of manifestation leave enough space between the triangle and the circumference of the circle for the utensils of the four elements put one or two altar candles inside the triangle two candles especially are of use to control and see the energies that you are going to connect with inside the circle but outside the triangle you put the utensils that represent the four elements put the elemental triangle with the candle to the upper right put the elemental pentagon with the cup of water or wine to the upper left put the elemental square with the incense and dagger if you like to the lower left finally you put the elemental pentagram with the crystal or dish with earth to the lower right you can use this basic circle for many other types of work in each case this setup will represent your oneness with the divine your next step is the charging of your outer realm with the energies that you are going to use you do so by first charging the circle that surrounds you while imagining this sphere that surrounds you you know that this sphere is protection then you take your power rod or dagger and trace the circle on the altar you may do the tracing with your index finger that points toward the periphery of the circle while you trace the circle you project energy into it it builds up like a sphere of which the material circle that you have traced is the equator next you trace the triangle in the center of the circle as you trace the triangle with your finger or power rod or dagger you visualize strongly that energy flows into the lines of the triangle light the two altar candles proceed to light the candle that represents the fire element project fire energy into the elemental triangle of fire imagine the elemental triangle being a gate to the cosmic realms of fire draw the red fire energy from the universe while you inhale and project it into the elemental triangle of fire while you exhale proceed with the charging of the elemental pentagon of water with the blue energy of the water element charge water energy into the pentagon until you feel that this is enough proceed the same way with the air element and with the earth element after you have finished with charging the four elemental talismans you proceed to imagine their energies flowing into the triangle in the center of your altar mainly into the area between the two candles at first your work may not appear to you as perfect as you would have expected be assured that with practice your methods of drawing and projecting energies will gain in intensity and power  Pentagram

do you think god has a long grey beard and the devil is red well first off i dont believe in christianity but i dont think that the bible gives any describtions about the way people look just how they act it is up to us to create the look for these characters if you look at the sisteen probly spelt wrong chapel god touching out a hand to adam he has a long white grey beard and this just seems to be the general concensus of his looks except for in bruce almighty where he is morgan freeman but still has a beard i dont know where the idea that the devil is red comes from possibly the connotations of danger but i think the constant representations of the devil being red and the term red devil just fuels this theory  God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin Demon Bruce Almighty Witchcraft Original sin Satanism Sinfest Beard Blacks and Mormonism Michael (archangel) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Baptism Santa Claus The Matrix character names Satan Names of God in Judaism Evil Antichrist Hell Magic (paranormal) Number of the Beast (numerology) Christian Identity Fallen angel Creationism Religion Tetragrammaton Paradise Lost Athanasian Creed Witch-hunt Moses American Pie (song) Repentance Judas Iscariot Curse and mark of Cain Iblis Cult Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Death (personification) Mary Magdalene Rowland Taylor Freemasonry Trinity Icon Idolatry New Testament Theodicy Open Theism The Da Vinci Code Church of Christ Nation of Islam Creation according to Genesis Predestination Rastafari movement Lucifer Apocrypha Separation of church and state in the United States Barber Fundamentalism Unitarianism Pederasty Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Gottfried Leibniz Allah John the Baptist Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Christian demonology Perk__nas Theosis Gothic metal Relative clause Mormonism and Christianity William M.

some questions about mermaids firstly yes i know they're not real so these questions will be practically impossible to answer but this is hypothetical just pretend they are ok if you've been paying enough attention in bio you'll know there are different groups of vertebrates two of these being mammals and fish which one would mermaids be fish because they have scales and can breath uinderwater i'm pretty sure they don't come up for air or mammals because their human like appearance indicates this they have a covering of hair on their uppper halfs or at least on their heads and they almost certainly 'suckle their young' as the female mermaids have breasts next are there freshwater and saltwater mermaids or do they just change depending on where they are like salmon also how do they reproduce i'm not asking these questions for any reason other than the fact that i am strangely fascinated by mermaids right now just give me your best shot at answering and i will be happy thanks i think they would live in lakes sometimes they do in harry potter and anyway i like the idea of a mermaid popping up from a river every once in a while i've seen mammals w scales armadillo and pangolin i've never seen or heard of a fish w breasts i've never seen a pic of a mermaid w gills since a mermaid has breasts we can assume she bears live young there are pics of mermen much less common than pics of mermaids probably because most seamen of yore were males we don't see pics of the mermaid's or merman's reproductive organs because in the age of mermaids and mermen it was considered unacceptable to display them in public therefore we don't know the mechanisms methods of reproduction but it would be reasonable to assume they effected insemination in the manner of mammals and live bearing fish therefore we can conclude that mermaids and mermen are mammals mermaids and mermen may have been anadromous like the salmon or there could have been both salt and fresh water species or there could have been both scenarios to my knowledge the is no historical references to support either situation one thing is certain they did inhabit both environments as pictorial evidence exists for both environments  Mermaid Species Sockeye salmon Mammal Bird Salmon Fauna of Australia Fish Aquarium Cryptozoology Fish migration Chinook salmon Shark Breastfeeding Fishing Ecology Weekly World News Aquatic ape hypothesis Scientific method Human Biology Fish farming Breast Science Microeconomics Angling Atlantic salmon Orca Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Evolution Sexual reproduction Reproduction Whale Epistemology Color Parthenogenesis Marine aquarium Puberty Sexual attraction Aquaculture Biodiversity Inheritance (computer science) Ontological argument Theory of conduct Determinism Richard Owen Natural selection Largest organism Seabird Intelligent design Cetacea The Little Mermaid Noah's Ark Cancer Marine biology Extraterrestrial life Batoidea Normal distribution Life Philosophical skepticism Pink salmon Lamprey Water (molecule) Monogamy Elephant Trout Creationism Tlingit Philosophy of science Goodness and value theory Sociobiology Crocodilia Giant Panda Franz Boas Fishery Animal Mussel Expert system Rainbow trout Crocodile Drowning Sexual dimorphism Smelt Biology and sexual orientation Whaling Meaning of life Thermoregulation Dinosaur

palm reading questions no fate line what does it mean when i have no fate line in palmistry it's gone on both hands my right had has deep heart head and life lines my left hand has a deep heart line and a life line my left hand seems to have a faint head line why do i have no fate line does it mean my life isnt't ruled by destiny at all it's possible that your fate line is running with another line making it difficult to decipher another thought is that you haven't developed an awareness of your skills and talents the fate line often develops when a person becomes aware of his skills and talents during their adolescents a fate line that isn't there could also mean you do not wish to follow a conventional route which isn't bad at all i think you just might be free spirited  Chiromancy Theory of conduct Saruman Volleyball Kain (Legacy of Kain) Milton H.

has anyone heard of crowley tarot cards i watched a film with my g f lastnight called stay alive about a video game that if you get killed playing it you die in real life in the film they mentioned this guy crowley but didn't say much about him my g f has heard of him and said he is supposed to be evil or something has anyone heard of this guy cheers thanks for the links this guy was a nutter gosh where do i start aleister crowley was an englishman whose father was a parson he studied at cambridge with high marks he joined the order of the golden dawn shortly after its inception in the 's and had a falling out with several of the members due to his reckless nature in experimenting with the 'technology' and his refusal to 'stay in line' his magical battles with arthur waite designer of the rider waite tarot deck that is still a best seller are legendary in magical circles no pun intended his scholarly abilities and skills at translating latin greek and hebrew plus his monographs essays and charts of associations not to mention his well respected reputation as a magic user made him a force to be reckoned with in the early th century after breaking away being expelled from the golden dawn he went into the desert of eastern africa and had revealed to him the books of thelema which he published to great acclaim and led to his founding of a new magical order the silver star or astrum argentum known in magical circles as the a a based on the teachings from the spirit of thelema who revealed to him the cycle of aeons which is evident not only in the degree work of the a a but also revealed in the tarot deck he designed with the help of british socialite and artist frieda harris crowley was a recognized figure on the streets of london from with his shaved head flowing black robes and large staff that he carried one anecdote of him is particularly amusing that a chap was sitting in a private men's club in brighton and in walks a startling man in black robes shaved head with a large amethyst glittering on top of a walking stick no one turns to look at the surprising sight which walks in around and then out of the bar the chap turns to his waiter and asks who the astonishing person is and is told oh that's ol' crowley being invisible again he comes in most tuesdays and thursdays just pretend you don't see him or he'll start an awful row his title as the most evil man in the world he wore proudly it was based primarily on his reputation as a magic user of the most sordid type practising the great rite in very lurid ways the old saying just shut up lie down and be the altar is based on his practice of procuring lovely young women to participate in the rites he led and their naked bodies served as the altar he was the first modern occultist to teach sexuality as a communion and as a catalyst for magical operations which was later added to by occultists such as o a spare and gerald gardner the main difference between crowley's tarot and most others is its adherence to thelemic symbolism and form rather than the more well known golden dawn form he switches places with a couple of the major arcana cards and has very different symbolic content and meaning for them since he uses them to illustrate the thelemic concept of aeons by and large his minor arcana is in agreement with the established gd or gra forms but he was the first to overtly describe the decanic associations for each minor trump and the kabbalistic hebrew and planetary associations for the major arcana on the cards themselves as an aside i supply to you that crowley's 'golden child' and heir apparent was john jack parsons famed chemist and creator of slag or solid rocket fuel that enabled us to go to the moon jack parsons had an ongoing rivalry both magically and in matters of the heart with none other than l ron hubbard writer of pulpy poor science fiction and founder of the church of dianetics yes the one tom cruise and john travolta is in l ron stole private letters of tuition and accredidation from crowley to parsons and stole parson's wife too to this day ceremonial magicians remain divided along golden dawn mathers and silver star thelemic crowley lines dig it  Kabbalah Argenteum Astrum Wicca Playing card Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Thoth Tarot Poker jargon Angel Neopaganism Scientology Baphomet Occult Occultists Ten Commandments Yu-Gi-Oh!

can anyone tell me the name of this demon he was all black blacker then black even his eyes were even black he crawled around kind of like spiderman but he had sharp clawlike hands fingers and feet can anyone tell me the name of some demons who fit that description or give me a link to a demon dictionary that has names and pics thanks im so i dont think it could be a childish misconception of a cartoon character i was not sleeping when i saw this i was wide awake and one of those heads will be in the middle of its back for what you described was not a single demon but a demon that is made up of several demons this may have been a one time visit but if by chance it was not you will see two other heads also it was not a paranormal creature but a creature from the supernatural realm so be very care full and look around the room you are in and stay away from all moving objects it name is confusion and if i were you i would not try to talk to it and i would keep a little distance between us if you have any more question i can be reached at marks mypacks net and if you decide not to listen and talk to it anyway i am sure that almost immediately you will have another story to tell us  Phoebe Halliwell Ghost Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee RuneScape quests Doom enemies Demon YuYu Hakusho Sesshomaru Eye Out-of-body experience BloodRayne Magic (paranormal) Milton H.

do you ever see things like flashes of light or movement out of the corner of your eye or hear movements like shuffling or a creak next to you but when you look nothing is there it happens to me all the time its very creepy did i spell creak correctly or is it creek i don't smoke weed last night while at mothers i continued to see flashes of light in the hallway her cat sat at the entrance to the hallway and began growling she stayed there all night it was very creepy now again tonight i have begun hearing and seeing it but i am at home it keeps me awake at night the first commenter thought i was smoking weed lol its just sometimes it is more than a creak or flash one night i heard a loud bang then my front door flew open the door had been locked it sounded like someone kicked it another time it was storming out side and the latches on our storm doors are broken so we have to tie them shut this night we didn't tie them and i woke up to them slamming in the wind my daughter was awake and scared she said it had been going on for hours but she didn't want to wake us up i told her it was the wind then went to the kitchen to get a drink before i proceeded to tie them it was about in the morning while pouring a glass of juice i heard a knock on the back door everyone i know uses my front door like we instruct them to because we keep our screen door tied in the back most of the time my daughter and i ran upstairs and i got my husband up no one was there he tied the door and went back to bed a few minutes later we heard the screen door slam i looked and it was still tied sorry you think i over did it these things really happened don't be startled you're not going insane think of it this way your brain is only processing a tiny bit of information from your senses so what you are probably seeing and hearing are extra things the brain has decided to process there are so many things that our eyes alone cannot see so what you probably saw and heard are spirits or even angels although you probably do not believe in such i've heard someone speak asked if my hubby said something and he'll say no  The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Columbine High School massacre Grandview, U.S.A.

i have this fear of looking in the mirror after flushing the toilet so i always look at my hands while washing them does anyone know where this fear may have come from is there any folklore that might explain this i don't know what i am afraid of my heart just starts racing i have heard of bloody mary but i thought the story went you turn off the lights spin in a circle times say i don't beleive in bloody mary times then look in the mirror and she is supposed to appear but that doesn't have anything to do with flushing the toilet i mean in a psychological perspective cause that is not how i was taught the story i think i fear that when i look my reflection will not be my own you are probably right kia thats the thing my heart doesn't race unless i try to look after flushing the toilet idk its pretty silly isn't it but i can't explain it it may have come from watching something that you were to young at that time to remember or you were told something that just sits on the back of your mind what ever it is look into your mirror and try to over come this abnormal fear ok  Milton H.

help on ouija board i dont know if these are true i just started using one and i asked are spirits present and slowly it went to yes and i asked whats your name it spelled out fred i was somewhat amazed but it took a long time to get an answer what question should i follow up next o and i am doing this by myself it may explain why its slow hit me up with some pointers spirit boards ouija boards on another group there was a post about the ouija board i would like to clear up some misconceptions and superstitions what is true is that the ouija boards are not toys they were originally made to communicate and converse with someone who is dead is it any wonder that the spirit board is shrouded in superstition and mystery it is not bad or evil horror movies and society have made it bad some of the superstitions surrounding the ouija would be considered an urban legion people say that the board is a means of bringing the devil satan into the world some say that evil demons trick people into becoming spiritually possessed creating harassment and oppression by using the board none of these superstitions are true oh and by the way the ouija board does not scream when you burn it the ouija board became popular during the spiritualist movement in the united states during the mid th century methods of divination during this time used various ways to spell out the messages sometimes using a pendulum which swung over a plate that had letters painted around the edge most often used was a wooden tablet with caster attached the tablet called a planchette was affixed with a pencil that wrote out the messages much like automatic writing the methods mentioned above may predate modern spiritualism it was used for the purpose of bring spirit through to receive messages spirit boards were used to channel a spirit while using the board the medium is also many times aware of what the spirit is thinking and instinctively knows what the next word is because when you are willing to allow the spirit to use your eyes to see the board you also allow it to use your consciousness as well the spirit has the ability of influencing your mind and brain to form the words it needs to communicate the ouija or spirit board as i prefer to call it is another tool used to open to your mediumship abilities the board itself has no special powers neither does the planchette the board acts as an indicator for your subconscious linking your physical body in with the world of spirit it is simply one of the tools used by a medium to communicate with the spirit world when you use the board you open up to your intuitive abilities some of you will open to your own mediumship abilities when this happens there is no turning back so do not use the board if you are high or if you have been mood altered in any way the ouija board may not be safe for some personality types the ouija board may be dangerous if you believe that what you experience is bad or evil if you believe the board is not going to work or if you are afraid of what your experience will be it is probably best if you do not seek out the experience addictive personalities probably should never use the spirit board as it can be almost as addictive as alcohol it probably is not be wise for you to use it every day if you are sick do not play with the board you do not want a lonely spirit to attach itself to you never invite a spirit to come home or to stay with you i don t think it would be very wise to ask the spirit to move something in the room or to ask for a physical sign how will you remove it later don t ask the board if you or someone you know is going to die you just might get an answer you do not want to hear and will worry the rest of your life about it as with anything the energy vibration of the spirit or entity that comes through will usually be at the same or a higher level as yours by all means before you begin ask for and feel protected this may be in the form or a prayer if you choose tell the board that you want only the highest and best energy to come through to visit when as is sometimes the case things become negative tell it to leave or terminate the communication it is wise to remember that the spirit that comes through is potentially dangerous remember the board is your tool to open up intuitively to the spirit world respect it at the end of your session say good bye it breaks the connection between you and the spirit world looking on the internet for documentation i found that some famous people have used the ouija board alice cooper claims that a ouija board suggested that he was the reincarnation of a th century witch with the name alice cooper and thus the band's name alice cooper italian prime minister romano prodi held a s ance in with other professors at the university of bologna in which a ouija board spelled the word gradoli this turned out to be the name of a street in rome where a red brigades safe house was located bill wilson the co founder of alcoholics anonymous used the ouija board to contact spirits his wife said that he would get messages directly without even using the board for a while his participation in a a was deeply affected by his involvement with the ouija board wilson claimed that he received the twelve step method directly from a spirit without the board and wrote it down during sleepovers with her friends amy carter would use an ouija board to get into contact with abraham lincoln who is believed to be in the lincoln bedroom wikipedia the free encyclopedia  Magic

do you believe that cats can suck the soul of babies or any bodys the way this old wives tale got started is because cats like to sleep on warm objects and babies are warm if a cat lays on a baby it can cause it to sufficate due to the weight of the animal on their chest and die before people realized what was really happening they would assume that the cat had sucked the child's soul from it's body causing the death no cats can not suck the soul out of anyone it is just a legend but you still have to watch a cat or any animal for that matter around young children  Vampire Cat Breastfeeding Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Lycanthropy Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Pitaten Mary Poppins Infant Fan death Warm-blooded Angel Sanctuary Friends Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Kain (Legacy of Kain) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

does anyone know of any holy creatures animals mythical or real can anyone think of creatures that are apparently holy to any religion not just catholic christian ones i don't mean in the sense that cows are sacred in places like india more like creatures that are said to be for example heavenly visitors or agents of one god or another an odd question i know any thoughts at all would be appreciated thanks david creatures who are part human such as the centaur or merfolk centaurs are more associated with healing of the body whereas mermaids men are associated with the spiritual salmon are believed to be among the wisest of all creatures because they eat hazelnuts also beetles scarab or sacred beetle are a symbol of solar deities and new life because of the east to west rolling of ox dung to create young the process is more elaborate than this but if you're interested in say animal totems then a great book to check out is animal speak the spiritual magical powers of creatures great small by ted andrews  Scarab beetle Mythology Religion Salvation Mermaid Holy Spirit Animism Beetle Eucharist Roman Catholic Church Deity Origin belief Abrahamic religion Trinity Hinduism Simone Weil Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Creationism Supernatural Magic (paranormal) Sacrifice Bah__'__ Faith and Science Predestination Soul Kashrut Discworld gods Theosis Angel Eastern Orthodox Church Pharisees Theology Centaur Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Demon A Course In Miracles Saint Human Discordianism Animal Exorcism Minotaur Anointing Summa Theologiae Neopaganism Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Spirit Idolatry Christ Christianity Jesus Numerology Witchcraft Narnia Justification (theology) Protestantism Ramakrishna Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prophet Church of Christ, Scientist Satan Opus Dei Resurrection of Jesus Age of Mythology Vampire Original sin Sphinx Theodicy Mary, the mother of Jesus Lycanthropy Sola fide Sacred cow God and gender Transubstantiation Atheism God the Father Great Apostasy Meister Eckhart Ayyavazhi Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Hindu Ayyavazhi mythology Creation according to Genesis Ayya Vaikundar Psychology of religion Islam Hecate Solar system Homunculus Sant Mat RuneScape gods

ghosts i live next to a grave yard its not creepy or anything we live in the suburbs of long island in the hamptons and its perfectly normal but there is an old civil war era grave next to our house its not scary or anything but how would you tell if its haunted as a little kid i used tog o in there when my mom wasn't looking cause i found it really really cool i still think its fascinating but how can i tell if its haunted besides like holding a seance or something or an ouija board my motoher has had bad expiriences as a child i can't hold a seance because everyone i know is too chicken and its kinda creepy being in a grave yard all by yourself if i take pictures will they show up one time i was a dead bride for halloween and my mom thought it wouldbe cool to get a bicture of us in the grave yard cause it was like themed and in all the pictures there is a little orb of light thats always next to this one grave in every single picture was that one sorry it was long also i have heard cats and dogs can see them is there anyway to tell if my cat or dog is seeing one sometimes they start smeeling and swatting things that aren't there i thought maybe a tiny bug or something i can't see but nothing k thanks i have hobbies i play lacrosse fieldhockey on the track team got published take karate and pilates and am in all honors excluding math classes i am doing just fine thank you i am just curious which is probably more than you can say for yourself urrrp you generally see spirits in places that the person was attached to in life homes or even favorite pieces of furniture which is why you need to be careful buying antiques you may get more than you thought or certain geographical areas rather than the grave they were buried in which is why you hear more about haunted houses than haunted graveyards those who died violently are more likely to haunt the place of their death because it creates an energetic imprint typically this is experienced as ghosts that repeat the same action at the same time of day everyday it's like reliving their last moments on earth i wouldn't suggest using a ouija board anywhere as they tend to attract lower energy forms that can be disruptive and attach themselves to you are you sure the orbs are attached to the grave and not to you it's not uncommon for loved ones who have crossed over to show up as orbs in photos near us have you taken a photo of the grave without anyone standing there  RuneScape quests Soap opera Dead Like Me The Phantom Manor Goosebumps The Haunted Mansion (film) Ouija Charmed The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cat Horror film Phoebe Buffay's songs Scenes from a Memory Garfield Animism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban KaBlam!

ancient greek god morals the greatest god during the time zeus from greece aka jupiter in rome married his sister hera had sexual liaisons with many others and did so when disguised as various animals swan bull horse did the ancient greek romans think incest cheating and beastiality were okay great question and the things they did certainly do seem shocking but we need to remember the context of the mythology incest although it's instinctual knowledge to us that incest is wrong genetics research was not quite up to speed in b c also the greeks explained away the incest of the gods by saying that deities were free from any genetic deficiencies we would still consider it to be socially awkward because the stigma is so strong in our culture but from a purely scientific standpoint there would be nothing wrong with marrying your brother or sister if there were no genetic ramifications that being said no thank you very much their cheating hearts the men sure did get around in olympus and so did the women although not as much of course we can chalk this up to the same phenomenon that makes us love james bond even though he's such a cad the men behind the myths were not so very different from the men we know and mostly love today but without some of that social veneer that keeps their shirts tucked into their levis then as now they write their heroes doing all the things that they can't get away with themselves kill blow things up and have sex with lots of different people that's an oversimpification but if you strip away all the bravado of our hollywood action movies you'll see the same kernel of desires and extremities of human nature that fascinated the ancient greeks how different are the worst of our serial murder movies think seven with brad pitt and kevin spacey or kill bill and any other quentin tarantino movie for that matter from stories of cronos castrating his father and then swallowing his children okay this is a bit disturbing beastiality these stories were also allegorical when the gods sleep with 'animals' they are usually deities or humans who have been transformed into animals zeus turned himself into a swan for leda and a bull for europa but he was not actually either of those animals in an era when man was not as separated from nature as we are now animals held much more symbolic and important roles that doesn't mean they were actually sleeping with them well some might have been the answer to your question isn't black and white by modern standards and maybe by ancient greek standards some of their heroes were not good role models but they weren't necessarily supposed to be storytelling is not necessarily meant to reflect reality or always to serve a moral message sometimes it tests the limits of possibility and it helps us understand our humanity better by experimenting on paper with what's beyond it so let your moral qualms go and enjoy the mythology  Zoophilia Zeus Origin belief Hera Human Mythology Aphrodite Greek mythology Sexual orientation Abortion debate Trojan War Dionysus History of sex Heracles Religion Human sexual behavior Homosexuality Artemis Falsifiability Religion and sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Marriage Science Apollo Tamriel God Reincarnation Bisexuality Goodness and value theory Hecate Iliad Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Infantilism El (god) Human nature Art in Ancient Greece Bernard Williams Roman mythology Meaning of life New Testament Sociocultural evolution Creationism Poseidon Gaia (mythology) Supernatural Simone Weil Animism Theory of conduct Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Ethics Themes in Blade Runner Horus Pedophilia Socrates Evil Pederasty Postmodernism Western philosophy David Hume Bull (mythology) Ganymede Castor and Pollux Theology Same-sex marriage Storytelling Alignment (role-playing games) Philosophy Intelligent design Determinism Europe Ontological argument Quentin Tarantino Nicomachean Ethics Predestination Joseph Campbell Rape Narcissism Sin City Philosophy of mathematics God Emperor of Dune Atheism Separation of church and state Creation-evolution controversy Cronus Cultural relativism Rhea (mythology) Incarnations of Immortality Trinity Moses

got any decent ghost stories or experiences to share i shared a bed student flat in newcastle with my girlfriend at the time we used the second bedroom as a spare and there were some weird things going on there the bathroom light would switch on all by itself now this is odd but it would do it specifically when certain people walked passed not always and it did depend on who walked passed it usually happened to me and a couple of our friends i had a cat who frequently refused to enter the spare room he would spit and growl at the doorway i was once walking through the flat and 'saw' who i thought was my girlfriend in the kitchen i continued into the spare room to see my girlfriend in there working i went back to see who was in the kitchen and it was empty one morning my girlfriend was working in the spare room and i was in the front room and i heard her scream she ran passed me claiming the chair she was sitting on had moved on its own as i headed to that room banging started in that room the cat ran towards the kitchen hissing and spitting and i followed the banging through the flat to the front door one night we had been out and were met by neighbours who complained about the noise coming from our flat when i pointed out we had been out they claimed we must have left a cd on or something we let him enter the flat to check he went straight to the spare room and complained that's where the sound was coming from there was no cd player in there just a pc which had no sound card or speakers to play music and it was switchedoff he left very confused later that same night we were asleep in bed when the lights in the bathroom bedroom and passage all came on at once along with my radio then the banging started again and went through the house to the front door and that was the last time it happened apart from the bathroom light switching on and off all the time all of this is true and did happen it happened between in heaton newcastle i am fairly open minded but before this happened was a complete sceptic i always try and find a scientific answer to everything but for that sequence of events i am at a complete loss i have a degree in physics so do not generally get carried away with stories of ghosts and ghouls if anyone can enlighten me as to how this all occurred can you let me know  Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Out-of-body experience The Time Machine Blood Simple Richard Chase Eastern Illinois University Columbine High School massacre The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kitchen Friends Aliens of London RuneScape quests Social rule The Brady Bunch Miss Saigon Silent Night, Deadly Night Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Star Wars Holiday Special Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

why is it more acceptable today to practice christianity instead of egyptian religion or any other weird religion for that matter isn't christianity just as weird a concept i'm an atheist and questioned many religions i always wondered why so many people think less of those who worshiped the moon and stars isn't egyptian culture one that still puzzles us today we still don't quite understand how they did the things they did during those times they were smart enough to build temples that correlate with astrological events and mummify their dead so why do we consider their beliefs to be silly confuses me  Religion Supernatural Atheism Egyptian mythology The nature of God in Western theology Christianity Witchcraft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Intelligent design God Afterlife Magic (paranormal) Judaism Agnosticism Origin belief Philosophy of religion Discworld gods Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Phillip E.

who do you think is the king of the jungle the lion or the ape my little brother was watching lion king and said to me that the gorilla could be the king of the jungle also i always thought the lion was the king but i m not sure hate to be honest but there's no lions in any jungle anywhere that term is only a playful term and lions actually roam prairies or savannahs as they're called in africa but lemme think about this i'd have to say that this term usually relates to 'what eats more of what' since lions eat everything they have the title gorillas would be deathly fearful of lions who can do serious damge to any gorilla lions are bigger than you think gorillas also while they can do eat meat don't set out hunting for it and attach other animals like a lion so you can't set a gorilla as king although they do live in 'jungles' technically a leopard or big jungle cat would technically be 'king' of a jungle a lion by the way frequently gets its rear end kicked up down sideways from everything from giraffes elephants who should qualify for 'king' water buffalo as a recent viral video shows in spades crocs snakes groups of hyenas and in fact anything of size strength and with some horns it ain't easy trying to kill something that can fight back and cripple maim you for trying but a lion has the sexy mane and it looks enough like a 'crown' to a european passing through on an expedition to assimilate that human characteristic of bygone 'royal' europe and today tell your brother though the toughest animal is the hippo giant nile crocodiles don't mess with crocs or their babies out of fear of them lions can't say that hippos also can kill eat meat when they want their jaws are powerful they are heavy strong if elephants weren't pure plant eaters they'd take the title but hippos are really it however we will always call lions the king because like actors parts in movies that aren't actually real' but look real enough a lion looks the part of king think about it who would go to a movie broadway play called the hippo king  Lion Timon and Pumbaa Taikyoku shogi Tai shogi Disney's Animal Kingdom Mountain Gorilla Leopard Meat The Lion King Crocodile Nile crocodile Gray Wolf Lycanthropy Largest organism Elephant Puma Hippopotamus Dai dai shogi Animal Monster Rancher monsters Tyrannosaurus rex One Piece minor characters Giraffe RuneScape quests Tenjiku shogi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ape Gorilla Cat Brown Bear Chu shogi Age of Mythology Unicorn Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Madagascar (film) Tarzan (1999 film) Carnivore Maximal (Transformers) SuperCroc Shark Snake Bristol Zoo Shaggy dog story Kimba the White Lion Bushmeat Fox Feature Syndicate Who Framed Roger Rabbit Mowgli The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Transformers: Cybertron Rugby union positions Taboo food and drink Super Mario Bros. television series Fictional crossover Humphrey Bogart Cattle Dai shogi Zords in Power Rangers: Wild Force Bigfoot Animaniacs Panthera hybrid Professional wrestling throws Care Bears Hunting Bloody Roar Orca The Late Show with David Letterman Hybrid The Jungle Book (1967 film) Jane Goodall Water Buffalo Endangered species Devil Fruit Batman: The Animated Series Meta-reference Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Jungle Action Sly Cooper YuYu Hakusho Crocodilia The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Poker jargon Orc (Warhammer) Dinosaur War elephant TaleSpin Holocene extinction event Conan the Barbarian
