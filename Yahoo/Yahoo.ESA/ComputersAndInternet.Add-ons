my external hard drive spins down after minutes of inactivity how to keep that from happening i have a gb wd my book connected to my vista pc via firewire and i use it frequently it works fine but it can take around seconds for the drive to spin back up out of power save mode and during file operations related to the drive applications freeze until it has had time to spin back up i would ideally like to control the amount of time that elapses prior to it spinning down because i assume the power save mode extends the life of the drive as well as saving power wd says the spindown delay is set at minutes and is not configurable so does anyone know of an application that will periodically write a small amount of data to the drive so it won't spin down thanks in advance note windows does not provide power management options for external drives through control panel also i'm pretty sure you cannot control settings for an external device such as a firewire hard drive through system bios unfortunately this is supposed to be a clever move by wd and cannot be changed we had exactly the same problem for our back up drives by the time the back up was run the drives had spun down so the back up failed unfortunately wd are no help we created a txt file on each drive and scheduled a command file to run and write to the drive every minutes are you familiar with writing cmd files i have to go now apologies will try and pop back later ok i've got minutes keep drive alive now f alive txt is the command we use obviously this will change depending on your drive letter choose file save as keep alive cmd create an alive txt folder on your drive create a scheduled by start all programs accessories system tools schedule tasks in the run part type c keep alive cmd the actual path of your command and enter the time frame you want the command to run at ie minutes this will be done on schedule advanced hope i've made a little sense there i've confused myself  Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Windows Vista Floppy disk Hard disk IPod File Allocation Table NTFS Domain Name System Windows XP Mouse (computing) File system System 7 (Macintosh) System/36 IBM PC compatible Common Unix Printing System Mac OS X Embedded system Architecture of Windows 2000 Linux Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive Advanced Technology Attachment FireWire Computer Filename extension Macintosh Finder System/34 COMMAND.COM Btrieve AmigaOS CPU design CP/M Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer virus Apple Macintosh Blue screen of death File Transfer Protocol Master Control Program Virtual memory Screenshot Cmd.exe Partition (computing) ITunes Booting Object Desktop Debugging Thread (computer science) Windows registry Mach kernel Visual Basic Spring operating system Digital photography File format Data General Nova Microsoft Windows IMac Launchd Emacs Atari 8-bit family Control Panel (Windows) Forth programming language Expert system Time travel AS/400 Command Language Apple typography Modem Oscilloscope Palm OS Apple IIGS Computer bus Digital circuit DOS System 6 History of Microsoft Windows Windows 3.x MS-DOS Central processing unit Windows Me Ethernet CPU cache FreeDOS Diablo II Library (computer science) PlayStation Portable Windows Server 2003 Air traffic control Mac OS history Bluetooth Graphical Environment Manager NTFS junction point Computer multitasking

taking off the paneling to you computer so as to put in a dvd drive how would i take off the paneling to the computer at home so i can run dvds in there like san andreas my neighboor said it usually just takes a screwdriver but i want to know exactly how to do it like angle it and apply pressure or something please please help you need to get hold of the manual of the computer that should describe this in detail because it is very computer case specific in general there will either be screws on the back of the computer or large buttons on either side of the case that allow you to open it to install a dvd drive you also need to work with the front of the case if you need to pop out a plastic cover where the dvd drive will go your dvd drive will need to be attached to the power supply of the computer and will need to be attached by a cable to the motherboard and you may have to adjust your bios settings in order for it to work  Computer case Screw Hard disk DVD Personal computer Elevator Motherboard IPod Apollo Command/Service Module Modchip Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Advanced Technology Attachment Knoppix Circuit breaker USB flash drive Loudspeaker Seismic retrofit IBM PC Xbox Mouse (computing) Anchor Propeller STS-61 Floppy disk Carburetor Solar power Nintendo Entertainment System Drill bit Oscilloscope Spacecraft propulsion PlayStation 2 ATX BIOS Redundant array of independent disks Laptop Arcade cabinet TRS-80 Color Computer Nintendo Revolution De Lorean DMC-12 PlayStation Portable Case modding Sega Saturn Computer hardware Lighting Screwdriver SCART Professional wrestling throws Desktop computer Commodore 128 Rail terminology Lathe Electrical wiring Diving regulator Ethernet Drill IBook Atari 8-bit family Computer forensics Amstrad CPC Enterprise content management Nintendo GameCube Windows XP Violin Chevrolet Camaro Blu-ray Disc Skateboarding trick Table saw TGV Japanese toilet Manual transmission RS-232 Thermal power station Booting Canon T90 Motorcycle Dance Dance Revolution Operational amplifier PowerBook Windows 2000 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laserdisc Fan (implement) Cable car (railway) Atari ST Sniper Steering Movie projector Four wheel drive Computer virus Commodore 64 Embedded system Cathode ray tube Mac mini BS 1363 Glossary of climbing terms Combine harvester Trigonometric function IBM PC compatible

i have an optical mouse problem my optical mouse cursor on its own slowly moves up the screen i have tried uninstll reinstall and various other things including restore but it still does it does someone out there know how to fix this proble iam running windows vista home premium with many years experience this is a very common problem with a desktop configuration namely the desktop you are using to use the mouse on if you are using your mouse on a desk or surface with even a semi gloss surface the mouse will likely scatter the cursor at times it never ceases to amaze me how many users think they have ghosts in their machine until i notice they bought their computer desk from jysk or ikea with the frosted keyboard tray try using a black or matte surface contrary to popular belief you still should use a mouse pad for tracking white glossy and glass surfaces will cause the optics to reflect back and cause a mouse to think it is moving typically in a vertical motion since optics are angled typically up or down hope this helps  Mouse (computing) IMac History of the graphical user interface Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows X Window System Touchpad Screenshot Object Desktop Atari ST History of Microsoft Windows Stardock Desktop computer Stereoscopy Laptop ThinkPad Apple Computer Xerox Alto Windows 2000 AmigaOS Tablet PC Apple Macintosh Enlightenment (X window manager) Hard disk Linux Apple IIGS Slide rule Widget (computing) Color Gloss (material appearance) PowerBook Opera (web browser) Computer terminal Virtual Network Computing Eyepiece Game controller Cheating in Counter-Strike Screensaver Movie projector Windows Server 2003 Microsoft Blue screen of death Secretary desk Apple Desktop Bus OS/2 Parallax Polarization Personal computer Amstrad CPC Laser Desk PostScript Sound recording Bluetooth Macintosh Finder Computer and video game genres Amateur telescope making Commodore PET Power Macintosh G3 Tank Vim (text editor) Optical spectrum Optical fiber CPU design X Window System protocols and architecture Operating system Cascading Style Sheets Computer Lighting Rendering (computer graphics) System/36 Desktop environment Fitts' law Radar Inertial guidance system 2D computer graphics WinCustomize Mirror 3D computer graphics Liquid crystal display Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X Help desk Scattering View camera Double-click (computing) Mandriva Linux User interface Floppy disk Mousepad Information Technology Infrastructure Library

computer maintenance dust prevention i opened my case to install ram and noticed a buildup of dust and fuzzy looking debris around the fan cooling unit i disassemeld the thing and completely cleaned it this pc is only two months old is there a way to prevent accumilation of dust there are a number of guidelines that you can follow in order to keep the insides of your computer clean do not place you computer on the floor if possible have it raised an least inches off the floor especially if you have a carpet if you smoke place the computer as far away from cigarettes and ashtrays if you own pets try to keep them away from your computer most computers require a spring clean every now and then you will notice that most of the dust accumulates at the air intake vent holes and fans and on videocard cooling fan and cpu heatsink you do not need to disassemble your cpu fan when you clean it just use tweezers or a needlenose pliers to pull the dust bunnies out of the fan and heatsink i do not recommend using canned air to clean the inside of a pc because it will just blow the dirt into places that are even harder to reach another option is purchasing a computer case with air filters and those need to be cleaned on a regular basis but they are normally easier to access and prevent the buildup of dust inside your computer  Hard disk CPU cooling Overclocking Bong Virtual memory Vacuum cleaner Commodore 64 Computer cooling Floppy disk Thermal power station Cigarette M16 (rifle) Heat sink Fire fighting Jet engine Drill bit Atari 8-bit family Radio controlled car Motorcycle Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Sento Windows XP Radon Motor oil Swimming pool Air pollution Mattress Basement Watercooling Ethernet Haloalkane Textile manufacturing Tank Solar power Brewery Computer virus Table saw Windows Vista HVAC Nuclear fallout Cathode ray tube Lighting Carpet Asbestos Hamster IBM PC compatible Fan (implement) Gramophone record Ice core Fancy rat Fallout shelter Tobacco smoking Nintendo Entertainment System Furnace Domestic rabbit Elevator Commodore 128 IA-32 Upholstery Knife Capacitor plague RISC Commodore PET IMac Irrigation Windows 2000 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Swamp cooler PlayStation 2 Kitchen Water Central processing unit Fecal incontinence Energy development USB flash drive Tire Mercury 4 Fuel injection Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sinclair ZX81 Bus models used in New York City Transit Mouse (computing) Computer M60 machine gun Random access memory Turbofan PaX ZX Spectrum Handloading Cleanroom Linux Electrostatic precipitator Neopets Turbocharger Super Nintendo Entertainment System CPU cache CPU design

how to run programs off of external hard drives i'm wondering if i wanted to put all of my programs from my computers hard drive to an exteral hard drive how would i got about doing it programs like microsoft office grand theft auto san andreas yahoo messenger etc would i just need to copy the program files folder from inside the c drive and then they would work i know that is where all the information is kept so it would make sense and there wouldn't be any extra files stored somewhere else that i would need right of course games like gta san andreas have a folder in documents for save games etc that you would need but like for microsoft office i would just add it and run the application using the same icon that is short cutted to the desktop and start menu correct thanks for the help matt i think it would be better to uninstall anything you want to move from your computers hard drive and reinstall it on to your external hard drive as there are references to installed programs in the registry which would be wrong if you just moved files around desktop icons are just shortcuts to the present location of program files moving the files would make these icons shortcuts point to a non existent file location  Windows 2000 Macintosh Finder Windows XP AmigaOS Computer virus Object Desktop NTFS Windows registry File system Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas NTFS junction point Linux Partition (computing) MS-DOS History of the graphical user interface Stardock Grand Theft Auto (game) System 7 (Macintosh) System 6 PlayStation 2 Windows Vista Gmail Icon (computing) Screenshot Grand Theft Auto III File Allocation Table ITunes Microsoft Windows Xerox Star Taskbar Mac OS X Mouse (computing) Portable Document Format Mac OS history Redundant array of independent disks Macromedia Flash OpenOffice.org Windows Installer Konqueror Apple Computer LiveCD Library (computer science) Hot Coffee mod Spyware Apple typography IBM PC compatible Computer IPod Grand Theft Auto (series) DOS MSN Messenger GNOME Windows Mobile Hard disk Mach kernel Start Menu PHP Spatial file manager Apple II family Floppy disk Newline Mozilla Firefox Xbox Microsoft Word Copy protection WordPerfect Windows Me Virtual memory MDAC Apple IIGS Microsoft OS/2 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City File format Google Desktop History of Microsoft Windows Atari 8-bit family System/36 Common User Access Microsoft Office Uninstaller AppleScript Knoppix OpenDocument Windows 3.x Emacs CPU cache Computer forensics Danger Hiptop NeXT AOL Instant Messenger PlayStation Portable Ebook Mac OS X v10.4 Windows 95 WordStar Google

im looking to upgrade my video card i am currently running agp x x ati radeon se ugh okay so the old card isnt going to be cutting it because i want to get into gaming nowadays fear a lil wow quake half life this card runs mid to low settings and gets crappy fps anyway i have it narrowed down to the ati sapphire x there is two though one has memory and a mhz core clok while the other has memory and a mhz core clock both with a ramdac they are the same price and the card has high ratings on the net is this a good idea and if so which of the two cards should i buy thanks this is indeed the best you'll get for agp even though the memory is wasted even for the most demanding games the mb one with the faster gpu should be your choice but most likely the power supply of your pc will not be strong enough it should be at least w for x x and you should use a power connector line only for the video card thus not connected to hard disk or dvd player as well finally make sure your pc is up to gaming in general gb ram and a ghz cpu are the bare minimum  ATI Technologies GeForce 6 Series Radeon Xbox 360 Xbox GeForce 4 3dfx Radeon X Series Pentium 4 Power Macintosh G3 EMac NVIDIA PlayStation 2 Overclocking PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Atari ST Nintendo Revolution PowerPC Personal computer Computer bus Nintendo GameCube PowerBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Front side bus IBook GeForce 2 Doom 3 Apple II family DDR2 SDRAM Xserve GeForce FX Apple Macintosh PC motherboard Central processing unit The Sims 2 PowerBook G4 Windows Vista IBM PC Commodore 64 Graphics card Amstrad CPC Sound Blaster Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum MSX Athlon ThinkPad Atari 2600 IBM PC compatible Hard disk Celeron CPU cache CPU design Commodore 128 RISC Power Mac G4 Cube BBC Micro Sinclair ZX81 PC Engine Laptop TRS-80 Color Computer Pentium M Poker jargon Voodoo 5 GeForce 3 Amiga Sega Dreamcast Computer hardware USB flash drive Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Microprocessor VIA Technologies First-person shooter GeForce Northbridge (computing) IPod Oscilloscope Computer Cyrix Windows XP Zilog Z80 INMOS Transputer SAM Coup__ VIA C3 TRS-80 Acorn Computers Secure Digital card Computer and video games Sega Saturn

uses for an old computer with linux what would be some cool things i could convert this old computer to using linux currently i am thinking of a combination printer server webcam server regular server also i am unable to run more than one camera at a time i am guessing because of usb speed because i only have usb ports so would it work to install a usb pci card as for using linux on it great idea i've had linux running on just about anything currently using ubuntu on my laptop but i've gotten dsl linux running great on my old pentium mhz mb ram w no usb ports you could probably host a camera on it as well as a print server but networking linux pc's to windows pc's is sometimes confusing though i can print from ubuntu to a windows vista hosted printer but i've never tried the other way around as for the usb i'm sure you could connect two usb cameras to the same computer and get two streams most likely it's not usb that's causing it but the computer is too slow to run two cams at a time much less serve them over a network internet  USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh Laptop Bluetooth Windows XP Linux Common Unix Printing System Novell NetWare Sharp Zaurus IBM PC compatible PowerPC IMac Timeline of computing 1990-forward PlayStation 2 Damn Small Linux Digital camera Hard disk Digital photography Linux kernel Windows Server 2003 History of Microsoft Windows X Window System Microsoft Windows IPod Windows Vista Xbox Mac OS X AirPort Windows 2000 LiveCD Mandriva Linux FireWire ReactOS IBook Desktop computer Personal computer Operating system Peripheral Component Interconnect Computer PlayStation Portable ATI Technologies Microprocessor Wi-Fi USB mass storage device class Secure Digital card Computer virus Computer bus Softmodem Mach kernel 64-bit Commodore 64 PC motherboard Proxy server RS-232 Bootable business card MicroATX Sequent Computer Systems Xbox 360 Digital video recorder Atari ST Streaming media Quake Internet Ubuntu Linux Radeon ZX Spectrum Timeline of computing IBM PC Dongle Redundant array of independent disks Power Macintosh G3 VMware Xserve MSN Messenger SUSE Linux PS2 Linux Knoppix Device driver QEMU Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Apple Computer SCSI Voice over IP Secure Shell StepMania Cheating in Counter-Strike Skype Pentium M Computer forensics PC card

my pen drive just fell into the water and now i went crazy can it be fixed my sis said let it dry by itself meaning dont use it for few weeks then the pen drive is fixed is it true i'm not sure what type you have but if it is your normal flash drive then it should be fine i use the cruzer micro ones and actually put it through the washing machine and dryer before and it came out fine works like new drying it isn't a bad idea and they contain no moving electronic parts so it should be okay go ahead and try it if it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't there is not much you will be able to do about it at this point anyway if it already doesn't one strategy you could try though if it's not too late is to freeze it this will condense the water and you may be able to knock off the ice by tapping it semi hard on a table once it is frozen can't hurt to try  Carbon dioxide Floppy disk Dry cleaning Poker jargon Freeze drying USB flash drive Water (molecule) Desert Thermal power station Climate of the United Kingdom Tenshinhan Instant coffee Refrigerator Pok__mon types Blackjack Ice cream Atari 8-bit family Queen (band) GunZ The Duel Naruto jutsu Kitchen Kurt Angle Commodore 64 Boss (video games) Debugging EIA-708 Casting Montgomery Burns Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Babe Ruth Water Pump It Up Theory of conduct The Price Is Right Professional wrestling match types System/34 Guilty Gear Happy Tree Friends BBC Micro AMD Wire wrap Acorn Electron Coffee Fog Glossary of climbing terms System/36 Embedded system Tofu Diablo II Futurama (TV series - season 5) Computer virus Computer Washing machine Blood (computer game) Degree Fahrenheit Ocean thermal energy conversion Knight Rider Hey Jude Ra (board game) Gambling Dishwasher Hard disk Diving suit Bob and George Glacier Claudio Ranieri Ice Steam engine Freezing Transformer Ice resurfacer Jumpstart 3rd Grade Pinball Rail terminology Prisoner's dilemma CPU design Friends NTFS Ecco the Dolphin Air conditioning Fan (implement) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind True Crime: Streets of LA Computer chess Non-native pronunciations of English Food preservation The Shining (film) Equine conformation Ballpoint pen Gilding Fire extinguisher Sea ice Sonic the Hedgehog Thunderstorm Arimaa Social rule Precipitation (meteorology) Windows XP Drawing

which graphics card is better my laptop has a nvidia geforce go is this better than a nvidia fx plus and if not is it worth it or possible to upgrade or return the laptop its new fx is the designation nvidia used for its high performance cards in the series the cards came out in the series gpus are quite newer go is for mobile and granted it is not their high performance series but it should have as much or more capability as the fx however if you are thinking of a graphics upgrade i strongly reccomend spending the extra swapping the go for a gs or gs each of which is an series gpu and supports directx for next gen vista gaming higher number is not always an indication of best performance and you should always do a google search on your cards before you buy sites like pc world do benchmark tests on cards as they come out check the date of the article to know when the chip may have come out  GeForce 6 Series GeForce 4 NVIDIA GeForce GeForce FX Graphics processing unit PlayStation 3 Graphics card Windows Vista 3dfx GeForce 3 GeForce 256 IBM PC compatible Xbox DirectX Shader Doom 3 OpenGL PC Engine Vertex and pixel shaders Windows XP Game programming Nintendo Revolution PowerVR NForce2 Overclocking Mac OS X DDR2 SDRAM Xbox 360 PCI Express NForce4 Scalable Link Interface S3 Savage PowerBook ThinkPad Far Cry PlayStation 2 Mac OS X v10.4 PlayStation Portable FLOPS Cg programming language Universal Serial Bus Atari ST Personal computer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC NForce Dawn (demo) PowerBook G4 Pentium 4 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer bus IPAQ SoundStorm IBook Cyrix VIA Technologies Athlon Deus Ex: Invisible War AMD Supercomputer Benchmark (computing) Microprocessor Autodesk Media and Entertainment Silicon Graphics Amiga Windows 2000 Apple IIGS PowerPC Poker jargon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Atari 8-bit family History of Microsoft Windows Bluetooth S3 Texture Compression Glide API Betting (poker) World of Warcraft Hard disk Windows XP Media Center Edition Source engine FIFA Series Apple Intel transition Transmeta World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Technology demo Frame rate Slot machine Sega Dreamcast Need for Speed

can an external hard drive be used as the primary master i want to buy a hard drive but instead of installing an internal hard drive i just want to use an external one can i use an external hardrive as my primary master also reason i want to get a new hard drive is becuase when i start my computer it says smart failure predicted on primary master can i fix this instead of having to buy a hard drive some motherboards with built in usb ports will allow you to boot from usb device but it wouldnt be radically common what you should be able to do is create a boot disk either a cd or floppy that will otherwise instruct the pc to then boot from usb but in short yes its possible to run from a usb hard drive  Hard disk USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Universal Serial Bus AmigaOS BIOS Knoppix Modchip Floppy disk Redundant array of independent disks Computer bus Linux Serial ATA IMac Personal computer Partition (computing) Puppy Linux PlayStation 2 LiveCD Atari 8-bit family IBM PC IPod A600 File Allocation Table File system Computer virus Atari ST DOS Power Macintosh G3 FreeDOS Desktop computer Windows XP Digital photography IBook AMD Disk cloning Commodore 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore PET MicroATX Commodore International Apple IIGS Windows 2000 Memory card FireWire NeXT Desknote Apple II family Computer case Flash memory Secure Digital card Timeline of computing 1990-forward Architecture of Windows 2000 RS-232 Sound card Amiga PlayStation 3 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Computer forensics PDP-11 Nintendo Entertainment System Sharp Zaurus ZX Spectrum Digital audio player Bootable business card Commodore 128 Xbox Computer storage Zip drive Drive letter assignment Data remanence Surveillance PC card Xserve SCSI Disk storage Mac mini VMware MS-DOS PowerPC Amstrad CPC System/34 BBC Micro System 7 (Macintosh) Disk image MIPS Magnum History of Microsoft Windows Memory Stick Ethernet IBM Personal System/2 Disk operating system Embedded system Tandy 1000 Peripheral SAM Coup__

floppy disks they are all games and i would like to see if i want to play them they ask if i want to format the dick your operating system is prompting you to format the disk because it cannot detect any existing format one of a few things have happened either the disks have gone bad or the drive is not recognizing the correct disk type to read i am going to assume you are looking at disks first of all make sure that they are disks for a windows dos pc if the disks are for an apple macintosh you will not be able to read them properly in a pc if the disks have gone bad you may be able to try a disk recovery program like norton utilities to try to recover them the other thing that might happen is that your drive is not recognizing the disk size correctly depending on how old the disk are they may be one of three sizes k m or m most modern drives will recognize k and m the m format was used for a short period of time and then fell out of favor also if the disks are old and are k format sometimes the tracking gets off and the drive heads are no longer able to find the data there is a program available called spinright by steve gibson at www grc com that can also analyze most disk media and find out what is wrong hope this helps  Floppy disk File Allocation Table Apple II family Redundant array of independent disks DOS File system Computer virus Disk formatting IBM PC compatible Data recovery MS-DOS Backup Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Disk image NeXT Commodore 64 Disk storage Disk magazine Atari 8-bit family USB flash drive Commodore DOS Commodore 1541 CP/M Embedded system File format Atari ST Data remanence Commodore International TRS-80 System 7 (Macintosh) Computer forensics Debugging Booting AmigaOS Partition (computing) Macintosh Finder Apple Computer Compact disc Pretty Good Privacy Virtual memory BIOS Disk operating system Norton Utilities Forth programming language Apple IIGS Library (computer science) Microsoft Early IBM disk storage Mac OS Punch card Hierarchical File System Blue screen of death Read-only memory IBM PC Timeline of computing 1990-forward History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Atari DOS Copy protection IPod Btrieve System/34 Newline Disk cloning Mouse (computing) MAME Personal computer Linux Macromedia Flash Windows XP System/36 Original Amiga chipset C programming language Cache Computer file System 6 Amiga ZX Spectrum Files-11 X86 DOS Comparison Master Control Program LiveCD ZIP (file format) IBM 1130 Zip drive Famicom Disk System Optimized Systems Software Quizbowl DBASE Timeline of computing Digital photography OS/2 DVD History of operating systems

audio keeps jumping whenever i go on utube or yahoo music or listen to anything on the computer the sound keeps jumping whenever i play cds on my pc they sound fine it's only when i listen to stuff on the internet help i agree with richard when you listen to streamed music you are basically listening to the music online from their server and the music has to be buffered before you hear it so for example when you see the message buffered then its a good time to start listening to the music in question as by the time you reach of that song the buffering will be at or in other words finished were as when you listen to a song through your media player on the desktop the music is being played directly from your hard drive so the music is in real time and thats why your music wont jump on your p c the faster your internet connection the quicker your music will buffer online and the better music streaming you will experience some media players have audio quality options try lowering yours and see if theres a improvement i hope this helps good luck mate  Windows XP Video game music ITunes MP3 Modem Copy protection Compact disc Digital audio player High fidelity Compact audio cassette Linux Bluetooth Online music store Vorbis Chess Musical Instrument Digital Interface ITunes Music Store Sound recording MiniDisc Laserdisc Apple Computer Windows Vista Hard disk Internet radio Mixtape Common Unix Printing System Transmission Control Protocol Gramophone record Sampling (music) Walkman Multitrack recording Quake III Arena Podcasting Timpani FairPlay X Window System Karaoke MDAC Steam (content delivery) Asynchronous Transfer Mode Last.fm Xiangqi History of Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks MSN Messenger BZFlag E-mail spam Final Fantasy XI Commodore 64 MMORPG Sony RealNetworks Floppy disk Laptop Computer Xbox I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Desktop computer Digital photography Dorama OpenBSD John Cage Apple IIGS Emacs Voice over IP Windows Server 2003 Buffer overflow Volleyball E-mail Google Oscilloscope Microsoft Enterprise content management Internet protocol suite House music Cache This Week in Tech Halo 2 Bubble Bobble Flute Windows 2000 Amstrad CPC Radio drama Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Internet Apple Macintosh Electronic music Loudspeaker ZX Spectrum AmigaOS Forth programming language Boards of Canada Pipeline (Unix) Mac OS X Neverwinter Nights BBC

how can i get windows to read and write to a mac os x formated external usb hard disk contrary to what the above posters have said you can in fact work with your os x formatted disk windows just doesn't support it out of the box look for a program called macdrive it allows windows computers to recognize and use mac formatted disks i'm not sure what other programs of its kind are out there but you may want to look around since macdrive costs a bit of money i'm currently using it on my parents' mac mini so that when it's booted into windows using boot camp we can still work with files on the mac partition of the hard drive best of luck  Apple Macintosh File Allocation Table Hard disk Floppy disk IPod USB flash drive AmigaOS Linux Computer virus LiveCD Windows XP Partition (computing) Windows 2000 DOS Apple II family Computer forensics NTFS Virtual memory Disk cloning USB mass storage device class Flash memory MS-DOS System 7 (Macintosh) FreeDOS Universal Serial Bus Macintosh Finder Redundant array of independent disks Apple Computer Mac OS X Windows 3.x TRS-80 Stardock Atari ST Library (computer science) Mac mini NeXT Disk image Knoppix Portable Document Format ITunes Screenshot Hierarchical File System PlayStation 2 HFS Plus Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Operating system BIOS Commodore 64 MAME Timeline of computing 1990-forward Architecture of Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) Dual boot Windows 95 Read-only memory Xbox Creative Zen Power Macintosh G3 Mandriva Linux TeX QuickTime RAM disk Online music store Common Unix Printing System Macromedia Flash History of operating systems IMac Drive letter assignment OpenOffice.org Unicode File format Newline PlayStation 3 Digital video recorder AppleScript Classic (Mac OS X) Data remanence PDP-11 Personal computer Microsoft Word Ghost (software) Emacs PlayStation Portable NTLDR Windows registry BASIC programming language System/36 Memory Stick Commodore DOS Computer multitasking Copy protection Mac OS X v10.4 History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS 8 Windows Server 2003

whenever i connect something to my usbs my computer freezes when i connect something besides a mouse or keyboard how to fix it could be your antivirus if you connect a device with a lot of files on it and you have your antivirus set to actively scan new files it will scan everything on whatever you connect mice and keyboards don't have files in them so they don't get scanned and the more is on the device the longer it will take to scan it not much you can do about it without leaving yourself open to viruses  Anti-virus software Mouse (computing) Computer security Universal Serial Bus Computer virus Rootkit Bluetooth OS/2 IMac Digital photography Windows 2000 Windows XP Image scanner Apple Desktop Bus USB flash drive Computer surveillance Trojan horse (computing) AmigaOS Computer Apple Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Device driver Filename extension Skype Television WordStar KVM switch Spyware Opera (web browser) Dialer Apple Macintosh ZX Spectrum IPod Game controller Internet security Norton AntiVirus USB mass storage device class Control Panel (Windows) Microsoft Windows RS-232 Windows Vista Screenshot Apple IIGS AlphaSmart Password Barcode reader ACCESS.bus Computer hardware Ebook Screensaver Laptop Digital audio player Atari 8-bit family Computer keyboard Steam (content delivery) Network address translation PlayStation Portable Zone Labs Double-click (computing) Digital Visual Interface Digital Mydoom Digital circuit Digital camera Sinclair ZX81 Malware Computer forensics Computer and video games Serial port Southbridge (computing) SCSI System/36 Firewall (networking) Booting Architecture of Windows 2000 Virtual Network Computing Gmail Memory Stick Xerox Alto System/34 Mac mini Floppy disk Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Proxy server File system Macro Finale notation program BIOS Geographic information system AirPort Port (computing) Creative Nomad Computed tomography Cheating in Counter-Strike PlayStation 2 Secure Digital card Common Unix Printing System

any problems w your hp dvd rewritable drive mine won't play most commercial dvds i sent it in to be fixed and it worked for one day now it won't play them again i can make data dvds just fine now the warranty is over and they won't touch it anyone else have similar probs w this drive i can burn cds and data dvds just fine dvds bought in a store rarely work hp customer service is pitiful they try to run you in circles until the warranty is up so they won't have to fix it they even have a special phone line just for this defective drives that really says something about that product never again will i purchase hp products i have the hp dvd and have problems to i bought and used it to burn dvds but never tried a regular cd r of course just after warranty expired i tried to make cd r only to find out it doesn't work i went through every possible troubleshooting possibility plus with hp support who knows way less about computers and their own product than i do they eventually looked up a trouble memo or whatever he called it and said that device is listed as defective but you are out of warranty so they know theres somthing wrong but just don't care now in your case are you sure you have the mpeg codecs required to run dvd movies try downloading and installing power dvd i know you said it worked once though so then it does seem like it must be the dvd drive and not the software so i'm not surprised you have a problem with this hp product i wish i could tell you how to fix it but i can only assume it's broken you should tell them that you sent it in under warranty to be repaired but they failed to do so therefore they need to actually repair it or replace it just escalate up to a supervisor try to get through to a customer service center in the us if you reach one in india you will not get anywhere because they simply don't give a sh t  Warranty Windows XP Digital rights management Warez DVD Computer virus Blu-ray Disc Copy protection Video codec MP3 Xbox Knoppix Digital photography ITunes Compact disc Debugging High-definition television Steam (content delivery) AmigaOS Windows 2000 Embedded system H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Floppy disk USB flash drive Voice over IP Bluetooth Linux Sega Dreamcast Surveillance Copyleft TiVo Digital video recorder QuickTime Modem Apple Computer Electronic commerce MAME IPod Modchip Movie projector Customer relationship management Software testing Commodore 64 IBook Best Buy Enterprise content management Video CD LiveCD Online music store Skype Karaoke Atari 8-bit family Xbox 360 Data General Redundant array of independent disks Trademark Spyware Programming language Call centre Broadband Internet access Overclocking Leasehold estate Hard disk MDAC Taxicab MiniDisc Computer Failure rate Product liability Auto insurance Objective-C Mach kernel Toyota Prius Pretty Good Privacy Mozilla Firefox BSD license BlackBerry Domain Name System Atari ST Amazon.com Ethernet System/36 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hubble Space Telescope Ashton-Tate Musical Instrument Digital Interface Password SAS System Billboard Hot 100

does upgrading video card make any difference i am building a computer for basically internet use no gaming it is reasonably high end in components but not sure at what point getting a better video card is a waste since it is not for gaming would a cheap card work just as well as a high end graphics d gaming card you know the old saying it is only as fast as the slowest component don't want to waste money but don't want any bottle neck also i have pci express slots and would use that for the video card you want to get a dedicated video card that does not use any of the system memory beyond that since you plan to do no gaming anything more would be a waste i would personally recommend this one http www newegg com product product aspx item n e if you go anything less you are starting to get into the area of ones that have cheap parts anything more and you are wasting your money considering your needs this will be a good card for vista if you plan to get that since if you use aero this will handle it without any slowdowns  Windows Vista Personal computer Computer bus GeForce 4 Amiga Radeon PlayStation 2 Power Macintosh G3 PC motherboard Overclocking Computer and video games GeForce 6 Series Apple II family Windows XP Graphics card PlayStation 3 Computer IBM PC compatible 3dfx Nintendo Revolution HyperCard Computer hardware IBM PC Peripheral Component Interconnect Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME PC Engine Nintendo Entertainment System History of Microsoft Windows GeForce FX Redundant array of independent disks PCI Express Atari 8-bit family Computer and video game genres Nintendo GameCube Sound Blaster Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories ZX Spectrum Apple IIGS Final Fantasy (video game) Laptop Windows 2000 Sound card Mac OS X v10.4 Star Trek Customizable Card Game Galactic Civilizations Atari ST SGI Octane Mac OS X Industry Standard Architecture OpenGL Uniform Resource Locator Video game music Universal Serial Bus Copy protection IEEE 802.11 Intellivision Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Macintosh Commodore 64 History of computer and video games CPU design Embedded system Acorn Electron Electronic commerce Game Boy Advance Video game developer Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Microsoft Windows Slot machine Graphics processing unit Xbox Neopets Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Risc PC Ragnarok Online Sega Saturn IMac Timeline of computing Contract bridge Computer-aided design Blackjack Nintendo Xserve Home computer Hubbert peak theory MSN Messenger Winning Streak Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mahjong Creative Technology Secure Digital card PowerPC PlayStation Portable Desktop computer Amstrad CPC Advanced Squad Leader Sheepshead

video card decision nvidia geforce gt oc vs nvidia geforce gts both bfg tech the has a mb mem interface the is the has superior stats almost everywhere else but is approx more which should i get teno is correct the is a high end series of cards while the is just midrange the gt is much faster than the gt so normally this would be a no brainer win for the but the gts model seems to be a different story it might actually be worth going with the newer gts and having the dx support for whenever that actually begins to matter currently it doesn't in that price range don't forget the radeon x which is still the performance king now if you were talking a gt vs the gts that's a different story the series cards are awesome performers  NVIDIA Radeon GeForce 4 GeForce GeForce 6 Series GeForce 2 GeForce FX 3dfx Radeon X Series Graphics card GeForce 7 Series GeForce 3 GeForce 256 Doom 3 DDR2 SDRAM Counter-Strike Graphics processing unit Apple Macintosh IMac Xbox Dawn (demo) OpenGL Windows Vista Voodoo 5 NForce2 IBM PC compatible NForce Far Cry Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic PCI Express PowerVR Scalable Link Interface Technology demo S3 Savage Dodge Viper Autodesk Media and Entertainment Shader EMac Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Power Macintosh G3 SkyOS Apple II family PlayStation 2 Windows XP Media Center Edition HyperTransport Hard disk Holden Monaro Blackjack Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within Quake III Arena Vertex and pixel shaders Yu-Gi-Oh!

how come quad core processors aren t making their way into commercial desktops yet the only companies that make quad core desktops that are affordable and ibuypower and velocity micro velocity micro is barely affordable but quad core chips are for a ghz chip so cheap nobody really wants to fry eggs on their desktops at this time basically quad core is struggling massively with things as the first line in my answers suggests they are hot little bunnies in a commercial dataroom this isn't much of an issue as they tend to be air conditioned and super cool anyway at home in your bedroom under a desk they become a neat way of making an insurance claim home software just isn't designed to take advantage of even dual core in a big way let alone quad the applications and os need to know how to get at the additional processing power otherwise there really is just no performance advantage we'll see them in time but to be perfectly frank i would rather run a dual board with dual gpu than spend the money on quad cores  Microprocessor Central processing unit AMD Supercomputer CPU design ATI Technologies 3dfx PowerPC RISC Dual-core Floppy disk IMac Cell (microprocessor) Radeon IBM PC compatible Athlon VIA C3 GeForce 6 Series Laptop History of computing hardware (1960s-present) PlayStation 3 Computer Apple Macintosh NVIDIA PowerPC G4 Transmeta Graphics processing unit Celeron Desktop computer Sun Microsystems Personal computer 64-bit Xeon CPU cache Home computer Super Nintendo Entertainment System MIPS architecture Nintendo Revolution Pentium D Acorn Computers Xbox 360 Pentium Pro IBM POWER Apple Intel transition Windows XP Overclocking Extreme Programming Power Mac G5 Transistor Embedded system Mac OS X v10.4 Mac OS X Gas turbine Commodore International X86 Apple IIGS Commodore 64 Desktop publishing W.

nothing on monitor after installing new video card ideas i had to buy a new pc it came with vista yuk and it had an onboard video adapter or something vista is bad enough as far as memory goes so i bought a nvidia geforce gt w mb pci e to help free up my pc some btw if you run vista you better have gb ram ok so i installed the new card loaded the new drivers from the cd which were the same as the latest on the web believe it or not and then rebooted fine i didn't even think about switching where my monitor was plugged in from the motherboard to the new card but maybe it doesn't matter anyway it booted up fine and i had the nvidia control panel available but it seemed like it locked up on occasion yesterday after a lockup reboot i didn't see the nvidia cp i checked the card resituated it to make sure it was fully inserted correctly but then device manager did not recognize it so i reinstalled the drivers but when i plug my monitor into the card i see nothing on my screen why sounds like your onboard video card is taking priority over your new video card try going into bios and turning the onboard card off and then save and reboot your computer make sure your monitor is switched from your onboard to your new card after you do the bios switch and reboot  Windows 2000 ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Booting 3dfx Personal computer Modchip Universal Serial Bus Graphics card Apple Macintosh BIOS Radeon Commodore 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Knoppix Apple II family Graphics processing unit AmigaOS Fritz-chip GeForce 7 Series Xbox Blue screen of death PlayStation 3 Commodore 128 IPod Power Macintosh G3 Microsoft Windows Sega Dreamcast Atari 8-bit family Amiga FreeDOS Computer bus IMac PCI Express Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System History of operating systems Upper Memory Area System/36 GeForce 4 Computer hardware PC motherboard NForce4 Overclocking ZX Spectrum Atari ST Desktop computer NForce2 Surveillance Windows Server 2003 Apple IIGS Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Scalable Link Interface NForce Sound Blaster Floppy disk GeForce FX System/34 Secure Digital card Computer forensics History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 Sega Saturn Game Boy Advance Federal Standard 1037C Advanced Technology Attachment Color Graphics Adapter GeForce 2 Ethernet DirectX OpenGL Mac OS X Windows 3.x Sound card Computer virus Device driver Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bluetooth PlayStation Portable System 7 (Macintosh) Hard disk Computer Peripheral Component Interconnect Old World ROM Cyrix STS-61 Power-On Self Test

what is d mark i heard its supposed to show you your graphics card's performance how do i use d mark and what is a benchmark i have a gts mb btw its a benchmark from futuremark a benchmark is a score the higher the better you fire the prog up and it goes thru a series of tests then gives you the score good for experimenting with overclocking and drivers even not overclocked if d mark locks up when running it you have driver issues or something if you click online result browser at end of test you can go to the website and save your scores and compare them to others with the same card or cpu and see how you fare you will have to get a username password for that free sometimes the highest cpu or video card clock or latest drivers does not give you the highest scores it does not yet support vista so don't bother downloading it its massive if you have vista you can also fire it up and click demo and it makes nice eye candy if you want to show off your video card a good tool for overclockers to test the clock if d mark doesn't lock up then the clock will usually run windows and most games without a prob here s the website with the downloads and info http www futuremark com  Overclocking Radeon Windows Vista Windows XP IBM PC compatible Mac OS X v10.4 GeForce 6 Series ATI Technologies Video game music Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 3 Commodore 64 Macromedia Flash NVIDIA IPod Minesweeper (computer game) BitTorrent Opera (web browser) Benchmark (computing) Linux Athlon PlayStation Portable Mozilla Firefox CPU cache GeForce Gmail Xbox 360 Spyware PlayStation 2 Doom 3 GeForce 2 Phishing AmigaOS Pentium 4 3dfx Screenshot History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Sega Dreamcast Uniform Resource Locator Password Celeron Atari ST Java programming language RISC NiGHTS Into Dreams Nintendo DS Internet fraud Object Desktop MAME CPU design Trusted computing Gaia Online RuneScape cheats Game programmer Secure Digital card Nintendo GameCube MMORPG Xbox Cheating in Counter-Strike Atari 8-bit family Game programming DirectX Cross site scripting Portable Document Format FLOPS GameFAQs Prank flash Windows 2000 Oracle database X Window System Wget Nintendo Revolution Central processing unit Game show World Wide Web GeForce 7 Series Windows 3.x Computer and video game genres Novell NetWare Amiga History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Mandriva Linux Microsoft Front side bus MDAC Grand Prix Legends OpenGL Streaming media Mozilla Application Suite Graphics card Stopping e-mail abuse

new geforce fx graphics card on dell b i am wanting to get a new graphics card for my dell b preferably the geforce fx mb pci slot there is a lot i need to know does my computer have enough power supply to run it will my intel integrated graphics card get in the way can it be disbaled will the integrated adapter get in the way of a new graphics card if these are all big problems should i forget about a geforce what good quality graphics card or descent can i get that runs on a lower power supply please leave you suggestions i appreciate the help a whole lot the fx card requires at least a watt power supply and luckily for you that is the power supply that is built into the computer so you are ok as far as power supply the integrated graphics card will not get in the way it is integrated into the motherboard as the name suggests and will not block the pci slot when you install the card into the pci slot you will have to plug the monitor into the the card not where it was plugged in before in order to use the card you will have to disable the integrated card to do this you will have to click on start and then control panel if you have the category view click on performance and maintenance and then system otherwise just click on system go to the hardware tab and click on device manager search for the integrated graphics card right click and click disable this will cause the display to become messed up but as soon as you hook it up into the graphics card it will be fine the graphics card you wish to buy is a bit outdated however the computer you have does not have an agp or pci express slot so the geforce fx is probably the best card you can buy for the system and you will be able to run most newer games with the card good luck  Personal computer GeForce 6 Series 3dfx ATI Technologies PC motherboard PCI Express Computer bus Graphics card NVIDIA Peripheral Component Interconnect Windows Vista Radeon GeForce 4 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis GeForce FX Windows 2000 GeForce 7 Series Universal Serial Bus IBM PC AmigaOS Windows XP Laptop Graphics processing unit Computer hardware Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 Radeon X Series Apple Macintosh Commodore 64 IMac Power Macintosh G3 Mouse (computing) Expansion card Amiga Amstrad CPC IBM PC compatible Industry Standard Architecture Apple II family Xbox Computer and video games Mac OS X PlayStation 2 Apple IIGS SGI Octane PowerPC Object Desktop Motherboard Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Sound card Nintendo GameCube OpenGL TurboGrafx 16 Timeline of computing 1990-forward GeForce 2 Scalable Link Interface USB flash drive Redundant array of independent disks Screenshot PC card ATX Game Boy Advance NForce2 Server Ethernet Microsoft Windows NForce4 Architecture of Windows 2000 Overclocking Wi-Fi VIA Technologies Digital photography Capacitor plague Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Cisco PIX Linux kernel Linux Telephone exchange History of operating systems IBM Personal System/2 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Microprocessor Far Cry Spyware Central processing unit ZX Spectrum Commodore International Palm OS

on a geforce gt graphics card what does the gt stand for and also whats the difference between gt and gs in the name geforce gt the gt actually stands for gigatonne a metric measure of mass which is why the gt is more powerful than the gs however the gs stands for general speed and this is reflected in their speed difference with the gt then on to the difference between the two cards the gt has better clock and memory speeds although the video memory is the same and the stream processors used to be called pixel pipelines in the and series of nvidia cards are more in the gt than the gs the gtx is basically a supercharged version of a gt and also the gtx ultra such as the geforce gtx ultra is normally the fastest card in that family although gs cards are normally scorned at they are actually quite good ok the clock speeds are not as fast as the gt or gtx but if your using the card for watching videos and playing less demanding games these are ideal i hope this helps good luck mate  GeForce 6 Series GeForce 7 Series Radeon GeForce 4 NVIDIA PlayStation 3 GeForce FX Radeon X Series GeForce 2 3dfx GeForce 3 GeForce 256 Overclocking Xbox IMac Graphics processing unit RISC Counter-Strike Central processing unit Windows Vista Nintendo CPU cache Apple Macintosh Pentium 4 Cell (microprocessor) NForce2 Atari 8-bit family Nintendo Entertainment System Voodoo 5 Apple II family PC Engine Yu-Gi-Oh!

a quick queston about my wireless router hi everyone after today's thunderstorm my wireless router has gone dead i've tried unplugging and replugging it but it is stll not working i was wondering if i needed to get a new one or there were ways to fix it first thought is it got hit by over current or voltage spike will it turn on at all you could check to see if the ac adapter is what got damaged check the voltage of the adapter and see if you have another like it important to match the voltage exactly if you can do that and the router still will not work then i would have to say that it is damaged and you will need to buy a new one while you are at it you should have a good surge protector on all your computer equipment not the ones but spend at least it will be worth it in the long run tripp lite makes some nice products http www tripplite com products suppressors protectit cfm  Universal Serial Bus Federal Standard 1037C Cisco Systems Router Wi-Fi Volt Lightning rod Electricity Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Circuit design Web crawler Overvoltage Differentiated services Operational amplifier CMOS Poker jargon Embedded system Denial-of-service attack Transistor Impedance Oscilloscope Wood router Diode Radiation hardening Nickel-cadmium battery Tesla coil Network address translation Xbox Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cathode ray tube IEEE 802.11 Lightning Welding Impedance matching Membrane potential Transformer Electricity meter Vacuum tube Electric power transmission Overclocking M16 (rifle) Circuit breaker 3Com Corporation Hewlett-Packard Floppy disk Spark gap Internet protocol suite Communications protocol Lightning safety Debugging Telegraphy Personal computer Switched-mode power supply Internet Alternator Incandescent light bulb Galactic Civilizations Overhead powerline Potentiometer CPU cache Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Lineman (occupation) Spark plug Nintendo DS Gauge theory Dimmer SCSI Electronic amplifier Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Battery electric vehicle MAC address Internet Group Management Protocol Mobile ad-hoc network Paintball Wireless LAN Power strip Electrophysiology GunZ The Duel Bluetooth Internet fraud Global Positioning System Electrical generator PlayStation Portable Fuse (electrical) Transmitter LAN party Wind turbine Final Fantasy XI Capacitor plague Drill bit Overhead lines Action potential Chess 2005 Kashmir earthquake Chess strategy and tactics Microprocessor Battery (electricity) HyperText Transfer Protocol Password Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory

laptop won't read dvds when i insert a dvd into my laptop the drive spins up the led flashes and then finally nothing happens if i check my computer it takes forever for anything to show up and if after minutes the drives show up sometimes they don't the optical drive is reading as being empty now here's the weird part it can read cds without an issue and burn cds dvds without a problem these cds and dvds can be read by any other machine with a combo drive but only the cds can be read by the laptop if i stick one of the burned dvds in it again it spins up the led flashes and finally does nothing i'm getting to the point where i want to ghost my system re install the os and see if that makes a difference before that however i want to know if somebody has an idea what's wrong with it i'm currently running a legal copy of windows xp professional on it the drive is fine it seems to be a software issue i've gone through the process of making a drive image and re installing the os to make sure right now it is reading dvds but i'm also in the process of adding applications and doing updates hopefully one of these will eventually break my system making it possible to see what happens it possible can be a defective drive reinstall the drivers for it first if it has worked before then i recommend re formatting to get your computer back to the factory settings  Windows XP USB flash drive DVD Floppy disk Laserdisc Compact disc Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible IPod Windows Vista Copy protection Apple Macintosh Blu-ray Disc Digital photography SUSE Linux Booting File system Linux Computer PlayStation 2 PowerBook G4 CD-ROM IBook AmigaOS Rootkit Knoppix Microsoft Windows Disk cloning Enterprise content management Gramophone record Warez Movie projector Embedded system Laptop Computer virus Universal Serial Bus Sega Dreamcast Flash memory Mouse (computing) Redundant array of independent disks Blue screen of death PowerBook Digital rights management PlayStation Portable Atari ST Debugging Xbox 360 Screenshot Computer forensics LiveCD Surveillance Digital audio player Multitrack recording Xbox Modchip Bluetooth Automatic number plate recognition Spyware File Allocation Table Personal computer Sound recording CD recorder Software bug Btrieve Nintendo Revolution Adobe Photoshop Television DualDisc Domain Name System MDAC NTFS Backup Oscilloscope X Window System Windows registry OpenBSD DOS 64-bit Casting Expert system Mach kernel Apple Computer Virtual memory CPU design BIOS Master Control Program Computer bus MiniDisc C programming language Macromedia Flash Optical character recognition DR-DOS

does anyone know where i can buy a usb hub and a pentium mhz processor i believe it is called i need the usb and the pentium in order to have my mp player work whenever i plug in the device it says new hardware found so i try to install the player and it says error while trying to install i contacted the company and microsoft about this but nothing helps what you really need is the usb the speed of your computer shouldn't make a difference for loading music onto an mp player the mhz is the speed of a computer and by today's standards that's pretty slow so any computer should work just fine its whether or not you have usb that is the holdup it sounds like you can go to system information and it should tell you exactly what you have on your computer hardware wise go to start control panel performance and maintinence system information you can buy a usb card and put it in your computer that will give you usb slots but as far as the computer speed once again i don't think that matters its just what they recommend sounds like a new computer is in store for you though  Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh USB flash drive Timeline of computing 1990-forward Windows 2000 PlayStation 2 IPod Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer bus Xbox Windows XP PC motherboard Pentium III Secure Digital card Hard disk Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 RS-232 History of Microsoft Windows Booting IBM PC compatible Computer hardware Floppy disk Commodore 64 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Power Macintosh G3 Xbox 360 IBook NVIDIA Nintendo Entertainment System Pentium M ZX Spectrum AMD Apple II family USB mass storage device class Athlon Overclocking CPU design Modem AirPort MicroATX RISC IBM Personal System/2 Pentium 4 FireWire Apple Computer Pentium Pro Central processing unit Game Boy Celeron Ethernet TRS-80 Color Computer Cyrix PCI Express PlayStation Portable Commodore International Virtual memory Plug-and-play Apple IIGS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Dreamcast Computer Redundant array of independent disks Personal computer Embedded system Atari ST Linux kernel System/36 Software-defined radio Mach kernel Pentium II Knoppix Nintendo GameCube Digital rights management Microprocessor IBM PC Computer and video games Mandriva Linux NX bit Two-factor authentication Palm OS AmigaOS NForce4 MSX HyperTransport Burroughs B5000 Pentium D Nintendo 64 Architecture of Windows 2000
