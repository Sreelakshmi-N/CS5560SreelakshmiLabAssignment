who enjoyed rush hour i just saw it yesterday and thought it was the best of the rush hours lots of fresh jokes that car chase sequence was also insane with all the complexities of the final installments of this years trilogies this should be a welcome change of pace probably the worst of the series but really not bad highly predictable were as i told the people i was sitting with who was behind it all and who the accomplices were the movie in a whole is about an hour and twenty minutes it has pretty humorous parts throughout and some good action scenes but in all honesty they could have been better the chemistry between the two leads is still there which makes these movies fun in the first place this was an unneeded yet entertaining entry into the series but it is basically the love child of the first two the outtakes as usual are the best part of the film to wrap it up if you enjoyed the first two you will probably enjoy this one as well sure you can see everything coming from a mile away but it still makes you laugh and still entertains take this for what it is and you will have a good time  Joker (comics) Blooper Anime Back to the Future The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Late Night with Conan O'Brien Good Morning, Vietnam Shaggy dog story Manos: The Hands of Fate Back to the Future Part II Martin Lawrence Fast bowling The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Paul Is Dead Once Upon a Time in the West Meta-reference Serial Blackadder The Aristocrats Machinima The Simpsons Scooby-Doo Eddie Murphy Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker The Blues Brothers Taxi Driver Something Awful The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Married... with Children Roger Ebert's most hated films Care Bears Our Gang Comedy film On Her Majesty's Secret Service Beavis and Butt-head Mojave people About a Boy Avenue Q Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Saturday Night Live Elijah Wood Sketch comedy Infidels Back to the Future trilogy Whose Line Is It Anyway?

rush hour is it funny is it as good as one and two note only answer if you have seen one and two compare with all the complexities of the final installments of this years trilogies this should be a welcome change of pace probably the worst of the series but really not bad highly predictable were as i told the people i was sitting with who was behind it all and who the accomplices were the movie in a whole is about an hour and twenty minutes it has pretty humorous parts throughout and some good action scenes but in all honesty they could have been better the chemistry between the two leads is still there which makes these movies fun in the first place this was an unneeded yet entertaining entry into the series but it is basically the love child of the first two the outtakes as usual are the best part of the film to wrap it up if you enjoyed the first two you will probably enjoy this one as well sure you can see everything coming from a mile away but it still makes you laugh and still entertains take this for what it is and you will have a good time  Anime Manos: The Hands of Fate Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Blooper Comedy film Good Morning, Vietnam The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Martin Lawrence Machinima The Ashlee Simpson Show Our Gang Joker (comics) Milton H.

did anyone see the bourne ultimatum if so what were your thoughts about the movie i absolutly loved it i thought it was awsome the only thing was was that i think they couldve built the girls character a little better but what do yall think they are suposed to make another movie i forget what it will be called though but this was the best movie of the year for me the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films it goes further to play the anti bond theme bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography stunt work to the script to acting the film starts out in a flurry as bourne is running from the moscow police the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off or does it the time is a little muddled here but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone they aren't his target from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player noah vosen who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs pamela landy is back as well as nicky parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year if not the best action trilogy ever  The Bourne Supremacy (film) James Bond Goldfinger Jason Bourne The Man with the Golden Gun Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Reservoir Dogs On Her Majesty's Secret Service Moonraker The Bourne Identity (film) Dr. No Sin City GoldenEye Kill Bill The Bourne Ultimatum EastEnders Die Another Day Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Jackass: The Movie The Blues Brothers Action movie Memento (film) Friday the 13th (film series) Austin Powers John Woo Bourne, Lincolnshire Stunt True Grit Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Casino Royale (2006 film) Casablanca (film) The Matrix Reloaded Motion picture rating system Bullitt Silent Hill Film soundtrack MDA (television) Back to the Future trilogy For Your Eyes Only The Apprentice 2 The Shawshank Redemption You Only Live Twice Babylon 5 Quentin Tarantino The World Is Not Enough Back to the Future The Bourne Identity James Bond music Serial Never Say Never Again Mary Poppins Ocean's Twelve Batman Forever From Russia with Love Friends Boba Fett The Bourne Legacy Grand Theft Auto III Kevin Smith Thunderball The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Machinima Matt Damon Star Wars Hellraiser The Simpsons Something Positive Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Star Trek: Enterprise The Legend of Zelda series Retcon Taxi Driver Dead Like Me 24 (television) Phoebe Halliwell 11:14 Genre fiction Poker jargon The Matrix Batman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Tag The Invisibles The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Ginny Weasley Die Hard Scenes from a Memory Grant Morrison The Italian Job Full Metal Panic?

can a year old watch the new transformers movie my husband really wants to take our son to see the new tranformers movie and i'm not sure if he's old enough i know he's allowed what i am trying to figure out is from the people who have seen it is it appropriate for a year old he has seen the first two harry potter movies but i wouldnt let him see the third because it gets much scarier than the first two any help is appriciated thanks if you do not want him to watch prisoner of azkaban than this is probably out as well since all kids are created differently i cannot say for certain if it would be okay for him to view this film some four year old can handle a little violence and language while others will leave the theater quoting the bad words i would say as a general rule that i would wait for dvd he will be a little older it will not be in a dark room so he will be less likely to be frightened because i could see a few spots where he might get a little scared also you could take the time to point out and teach him the lessons that the film makers are trying to point out explain to him that language like that is for adults and that he doesn't have to worry every time he sees an airplane because he is scared that it will transform into a monster and get him good luck and have fun with your kid it is important that in today's society we actually spend some time with our kids your husband should be commended for wanting to spend time with his son and i think going to the movies is a great outing it stimulates conversation and it usually leads to a lifelong of movie going that they both will cherish forever  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Motion picture rating system Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) The Shining (film) EastEnders Blood purity (Harry Potter) Vegeta Humphrey Bogart Invader Zim Mystery Science Theater 3000 Yu-Gi-Oh!

are the indian movies more realistic or the english movies more realistic the english i have to agree with naz indian movies are very corny how can you get lost in a story when in the middle the characters stop and sing for like minutes it's like a movie is supposed to create reality that you get so caught up in that you forget about the real world for two hours so what happens in indian movies is that you get lost in the reality of a movie for a while and it's all good until it gets to a dramatic scene and then boom they stop and sing and start to dance around in corny synchronized dancing and then you remember oh yeah i'm watching a movie with aishwarya rai and two other movie stars it kills the fact that when you watch a movie a good indicator of a good movie is that you're supposed to forget that you're watching a movie english movies are good because they engage you in the reality of the story until the very end you forget that nicole kidman is superstar actress nicole kidman until the very end when the credits roll they don't kill the reality of the movie by inserting corny song and dance numbers here and there like in indian movies  Nicole Kidman Aishwarya Rai She Loves You Stanley Kubrick Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Usher (entertainer) Actor Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Digimon Tom Cruise Sting (musician) Film soundtrack Moulin Rouge!

what did you think of aishwarya rai's love scene in shabd was it necessary or do you think it was done in an artistic and sensual way that it was required for the film i think it was completely wrong for the film genre we all know how pretty she is and perhaps part of her allure was her refusal to sell out in this way it's a big step over the line from no on screen kisses to simulating sex even if there is no nudity excepts a male nipple artistic and sensual sound like an apology the film has become known for those scenes rather than the main storyline of the extra marital affair and the reasons behind it a great original plot device as far as i know i hope that the rest of the cast have better luck from now on than the main male lead sanjay dutt  Aishwarya Rai Soap opera Bish__jo game Hentai Nudity Censorship in Australia Madonna (entertainer) EastEnders Computer and video game genres Human sexual behavior Bollywood AVN Awards Batman Forever Motion picture rating system Anime Serial Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind David Bowie Pornography Iago Munnabhai M.B.B.S.

is breakfast at tiffany's a good movie reccommendations please i just want to know is it a good movie or not how so thanks aloha from down unda short answer yes long answer do you wanna know our answer or do you wanna let us decide for you here's a coupla comments a source audrey hepburn the it girl of the s april author misslv i've loved breakfast at tiffany's since i was nine even before i completely understood about holly's profession i was captivated by the grace and magic that was audrey hepburn george peppard plays paul varjak a writer who has to earn his living through a wealthy socialite patricia neal as her kept man audrey who plays holly golightly is a gold digging call girl who is looking for the right rich man to marry though you would think these two would be unflattering characters they are both very charming and put on phony personas especially in holly's case in order to survive you have to marvel at how a woman like audrey could look so good in anything she wore at the beginning of the movie when she first meets peppard she's only wearing a simple white shirt that she wears as a nightgown or at the party scene when she first comes out and greets her friend o j berman wearing nothing but a sheet made up to look like a dress gorgeous it's a marvelous piece of acting when holly first meets paul in her apartment and she's talking about how she has to get ready to meet one of her clients in jail sally tomato and she's talking about her profession looking at herself in the mirror getting dressed asking paul to find one of her shoes etc and then voila the famous basic black dress and hat with the wide brim very stylish and in the scene she is given much to work with the way she has to juggle the dialogue and the action of what she is doing all at once very natural and sophisticated at the same time audrey is very believable as holly because her character is someone who is pretending to be sophisticated hanging around with phony people but really comes from humble beginnings once in a while you will hear in her voice the country girl drawl and you will see through the facade of holly golightly who she really is george peppard is also very handsome and believable as the starving writer who also has to sell himself out in order to earn a living many complaints have been made about mickey rooney and the stereotypical portrayal of the landlord mr yunioshi yes it is stereotyped but nonetheless i still thought it was funny the party scene is one of the best in the movie hilarious wonderful score by henry mancini of course it's a classic scene when holly pulls up in front of tiffany's in the new york taxi drinking coffee and eating a danish in front of the window new york city itself is like a vibrant interesting character in the movie i could go on and on and to top it all off it's a very romantic love story about two people who find happiness in the crazy mixed up world we live in a classic recommended to anyone who loves old hollywood cinema audrey as holly absolutely september author jslack from usa this comment may contain spoilers those who know holly golightly from the truman capote autobiographical sketch disguised as a novella may be dismayed that wholesome gorgeous audrey hepburn plays her as an irresistible fashion plate but could marilyn monroe really have been this good miss hepburn the epitome of early s chic creates a character that seems the essence of an era when naughtiness was implied but not spelled out and happy endings and no sour tastes prevailed it's a running the gamut performance she's charming sexy devious funny tender hysterical and vulnerable and audrey hepburn it is perhaps her most famous performance and one of her greatest capote changed many things names incidents genders but this is obviously a memorial to his beginnings as a new york writer with george peppard who doesn't look remotely like a writer and especially not like capote but who fills the bill quite nicely as spectator and eventual romantic leading man blake's love for nyc is apparent throughout henry mancini's score is a classic and all the supporting players except mickey rooney at his most shameless are good there are unforgettable moments a wildly hilarious party sequence a shoplifting scene inside a five and dime and a superior feel good scene inside tiffany's with a kindly salesman john mcgiver the film finally takes on added universal dimensions about the need for love and the delusional lifestyle we may resort when we don't find it and more at

your opinion on directors changing once they get famous tarantino anderson read for more info it was hard to pick a title i ll explain im not talking about versatility like spielberg who directed e t and schindlers list im talking about this examples tarantino first three films were crime related very similar then kill bill im not a fan but i know most people liked it aronofsky he does pi and requiem for a dream very similar in style then the fountain p t anderson boogie nights and magnolia very similar in style then punch drunk love what do you think should they keep doing what they do best or do you like their new movies im sorry phliburt but i dont think the departed is the best scorsese film although i enjoy it next to his works with deniro the departed is at best acceptable yes you re right about peter jackson i forgot to include him in my examples directors have to be as concerned with being pigeon holed as much as actors do if they continue to turn out one genre of movie then the producers start to believe that is all that they can do but it is the versatility of a director that marks the masters above the rest of the pack if they do the same style over and over then they get control of a niche market and do not reach the diverse audience pool soon they have hard time getting budgets because they have such a definitive group of fans one director who has done things that are quite different is tim burton his nightmare before christmas and batman were very different than big fish but all are very good movies  Quentin Tarantino Tim Burton Pulp Fiction Martin Scorsese Batman Begins Cinema of the United States Schindler's List John Carpenter Academy Award for Directing Batman Forever Steven Spielberg Paul W.

can i use a classical song for a movie so i was trying to figure out a way to use music in a movie i'm making with out paying tons of money and one of my friends thought that i could use some classical music like mozart and what not because they songs pre date copyright laws is this true it is called public domain all music falls into public domain after a period of time the laws specify the period of time they do not grant permanent copyright to anyone most governments allow copyright to extend to years after the death of the composer the usa and eu countries observe a year period all rules have exceptions but mozart is long dead and his works are considered pd in his home country germany which is the guide used by the wto governing commercial use in other countries however this does not allow you to take a cd recording of his music and use in a movie that is because the recording company has a claim on the recording of the music both the composition and the recording have to be pd to be used rights free here is a website that has what you want http www music tvandfilms com  Public domain Copyright Copyright law of the United Kingdom United States copyright law Fair use Copyright infringement Crown copyright Intellectual property Freedom of speech European classical music Japanese copyright law Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Trademark Warez Copyleft Romantic music SCO-Linux controversies Australian copyright law World Trade Organization Ludwig van Beethoven Sonata (music) Software patents under TRIPs Agreement Fr__d__ric Chopin Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights GNU General Public License Software patent debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Grammy Award Felix Mendelssohn Tonality Patent Baroque music Eldred v.

the ending of the remake of planet of the apes please explain after waisting precious hours of my life watching the remake of planet of the apes i am completely puzzled about the ending the original was absolutely brilliant with one of the best endings ever seen in a movie but this remake was just an action movie with great costumes and the worst ending one could possibly think up why is there a bunch of monkeys on earth when he gets back to earth if he is back on earth maybe he is on a different planet that looks like earth but why does this planet have the monument of george washington looking like an ape did he cause a distortion of the space time continuum and it warped earth hope that someone can clarify the ending and put me out of my bewilderment thanks o he didn't go to another planet he just went to an alternate future and then went to that planet's past so he went to an past with all of the things of earth except the human like abraham lincoln as show are apes dumb ending though what a ripoff of the old movie almost as bad as the sequels of the original  Planet of the Apes (1968 film) Science fiction film Escape from the Planet of the Apes Time travel Planet of the Apes Planet of the Apes (2001 film) Beneath the Planet of the Apes Chrono Trigger Conquest of the Planet of the Apes Retcon Star Trek: The Motion Picture 3rd Rock from the Sun Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction Doctor (Doctor Who) 2001: A Space Odyssey Futurama (TV series - season 5) Lavos Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Sequel Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Taylor (Planet of the Apes) Space Quest Supergirl Bob and George Ecco the Dolphin Incarnations of Immortality StarCraft Episode VI Planet of the Apes (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Ferengi Spaceballs Unicron Vegeta Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) The End of the World (Doctor Who) Shockwave (Transformers) MAD Magazine The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Invader Zim The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Earth (Noon Universe) Star Wars Solar eclipse The Star Wars Holiday Special Philip J.

the new harry potter movie who's seen the new harry potter movie well i've heard from a few that it's not as good as the past four is this true what's your opinion on the movie in relation to the other hp movies better or worse for those of you that have read the book how's it in relation to the book better or worse overall did you like it was it worth seeing or not compared to the other movies it was slightly above par however in comparison to the book it was extremely worse obviously because of a time constraint and fitting it all into minutes they had to cut out important things and change a lot of stuff so that it would fit together better it would have been impossible for them to make it as good as the book though i feel they could have done better they did not do horrible i liked it but would not buy it and i think that if you are a fan than it is worth seeing otherwise i would suggest you do not see it  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Money in Harry Potter J.

how can i avoid bathroom breaks during a movie this probably sounds a bit dumb but whenever i go see a movie at the theater i always get really thirsty and end up drinking a lot then i end up needing the bathroom before the movie is over i hate to miss parts of the movie and i hate being 'that person' you know the one that disturbs everyone else because they have to get up to go pee lol i'm sure they make the air dry in theaters to encourage you to buy drinks i stopped eating popcorn because that made me more thirsty any suggestions on how to curb my thirst without drinking gallons of water soda i'm going to the movies tonight and i really don't wanna be in this situation again i always make sure i go before the movie last time i went to the movies was for the simpsons i tried holding it because it'sonly a short movie and i was in sooo much pain by the end lol i always go before the movie and then i just sip on the drink throughout the movie but i don't do popcorn to dry i eat nachos instead but also if it is a longer movie you might not want to get a drink or popcorn or get a smaller drink you could try eating candy instead take some hard candies in your pocket that will make you salivate but it won't make you hungry at least that works for me i live off hard mints and butterscotch at work a lot  Movie theater Fecal incontinence Soft drink Ron and Fez Happy Tree Friends The Shining (film) Homer Simpson Popcorn Treehouse of Horror V Sola fide Make money fast Bulk vending Shaggy dog story "Weird Al" Yankovic Drinking Dental caries Tea Cosmo Kramer Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Coffee The Cure Bart Simpson Wine The Ashlee Simpson Show Wedding Crashers Jackass: The Movie Traumatic incident reduction The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hungry ghost Taxi Driver Drowning Hamster Tooth Hiccup Can't Hardly Wait Ramen Coca-Cola Marathon (sport) Loss leader Subliminal message Hansel und Gretel Poker jargon RuneScape quests Drive-in theater Sin City The Jazz Singer Beavis and Butt-head Little Britain Who Shot Mr. Burns?

anyone think the new simpsons movie was crap i went to see it and it left me totally unimpressed it wasnt crap but then again it wasnt good just like a normal episode strung out to last the duration ok so there was a few scenes such as the shot of the huge mob carrying flaming torches that looked great and could only have been done on a film screen but apart from that i was suprised at how little i was drawn into the story i noticed that the tv show however short drew you in and you felt at home with the characters but in the movie they fitted all the regulars apu etc in but you didnt feel any connection with them just faces that appeared said a witty line and went i think we have grown to used to the simpsons on the small screen and on a cinema screen it wasnt as intimate could they have done it better i doubt it i find it hard to believe anyone could have come up with a credible storyline for a simpsons movie its all been done over the numerous seasons i even believe the show should take a break from tv for a year or two to allow the world to move on and the cast crew to recharge their batteries groening seems obsessed with having it go on and on non stop just to break records if it were off tv for a while imagine the build up of interest and storylines to cover when it came back anyway the movie wasnt good or bad it was the worst type of movie that doesnt raise any feelings in you totally bland i agree all the best clips were shown on tv so many folks have said that  The Simpsons Science fiction on television The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Fantastic Four Futurama Doctor Who Digimon Canon (fiction) The Ashlee Simpson Show Meta-reference Whose Line Is It Anyway?

for people who have seen the movie the painted veil y is it called the painted veil im mean nothing in the movie tht had anything to do with a veil before it was a film it was a novel the title is meant to be a metaphor for the way the heroine viewed the world she lived behind a painted veil and thus saw the world askew when it was lifted she realized that she had depth and empathy but it also enabled her to love truly and to find real intimacy which she tragically lost so lift not the painted veil is meant to be a sort of warning but i think its one that the poet hoped wouldn't really be heeded i'm no poet so thats the best that i can expain it here's the sonnet lift not the painted veil which those who live call life though unreal shapes be pictured there and it but mimic all we would believe with colours idly spread behind lurk fear and hope twin destinies who ever weave their shadows o'er the chasm sightless and drear i knew one who had lifted it he sought for his lost heart was tender things to love but found them not alas nor was there aught the world contains the which he could approve through the unheeding many he did move a splendour among shadows a bright blot upon this gloomy scene a spirit that strove for truth and like the preacher found it not  Jon Secada Simone Weil Wassily Kandinsky In Search of Lost Time Adam Mickiewicz Children of Dune Love Mulholland Drive (film) A Course In Miracles Obi-Wan Kenobi Brett Whiteley Urantia Darth Vader English literature The Deadly Assassin Sri Aurobindo Epistemology Medea (play) Philipp Melanchthon Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Storytelling Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Friedrich Schleiermacher John Howard Yoder Bhagavad Gita Eastern Orthodox Church Karen Horney Irony Motion picture rating system Raiders of the Lost Ark Parallax Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reality Pok__mon Abilities Charmed Grace Cossington Smith Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Fernando Pessoa Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Enneagram The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Autostereogram Cyberspace Victor Hugo Alfred Hitchcock Dante Gabriel Rossetti Dutch literature Care Bears Memento (film) The Marshall Mathers LP Religious Society of Friends The Truman Show Camouflage Dialogue The Cantos One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Bob Woodward Out-of-body experience Casablanca (film) Buffy the Vampire Slayer Maison Ikkoku James Henry Leigh Hunt Aesthetic Realism Kill Bill I, the Jury Narcissism Eug__ne Delacroix Portuguese literature Cube (film) Philo The Chronicles of Amber Color Jean Grey Numerology Incarnations of Immortality Summa Theologiae Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Mystique (comics) Love of Life Scenes from a Memory Cupid and Psyche Paranoia Agent Jacques-B__nigne Bossuet Days of our Lives Yehuda Halevi Storm (comics) Anubis The Matrix George Eliot Philosophy of language The NeverEnding Story (film) Kender Cigarette Smoking Man Thomas Carlyle Meaning of life Poetry

in bourne ultimatum did it bother anyone how much they shook the camera i really liked the bourne movies but it seemed like they really shook the camera a lot in the third one there were so many times i wished they would just hold the camera still so i could see what was going on i know they do it to make the scene feel more intense but it really bugged me in this movie other than that it was a great movie did the camera shaking bother anyone else i thought it was a great movie too but i agree that the camera work was shaky however a lot of filmmakers nowdays are using more hand held shots instead of mounting cameras on a dolly steadi or glidecam i had a little bit of a headache by the end of the movie but it was so good i thought it was definitely worth it  Steadicam Filmmaking Cinematography The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Documentary film Matt Damon Binoculars Forced perspective Film director Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Film The Daleks' Master Plan IMAX James Wong Howe Martin Scorsese Tracking shot Das Boot Back to the Future Amateur astronomy Kill Bill Quentin Tarantino The Ashlee Simpson Show Independent film Dolly zoom The Truman Show About a Boy The Bourne Identity (film) Camera Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Bullet time Stanley Kubrick Death Race 2000 All Aussie Adventures Columbine High School massacre Grip (job) Avenue Q Computer animation The Great Train Robbery (1903 film) Reservoir Dogs Rent (musical) Innerspace 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.

movies money i just wanted to know how the movie money making works for example if a big budget movie such as transformers took like million dollars to make but made millions dollars in the box offices how come movies studios says they still barely make a profit until dvds come out can you say completion bond there are about a hundred thousand things producers have to pay for that the general public has no clue about completion bonds cost money the mpaa symbol costs money prints and advertising cost money flying actors and directors to new york to appear on david letterman costs money insurance for all that costs money interest on whatever loans the production costs money postage to ship all those copies of that film costs money postage to send everybody their paychecks costs money cell phone bills that have been stacking up since the beginning of pre production costs money then you've got every person in those credits turning in last minute non budgeted receipts for gas construction materials hotel rooms the wrap of the location production office and it goes on and on and on and on are we forgetting about all the trashed hotel rooms and busted rental cars a few of the less responsible members of the crew left behind i've heard of cases of producers claiming the movie didn't turn a profit at the box office because they were trying to get out of paying some of the folks who had negotiated percentage deals on the box office profits but it's more likely that all of the above and more is costing the production enough money that they really aren't turning much of a profit until it hits dvd  Insurance United States Postal Service Economy of the United States MPAA film rating system Microeconomics Film Internet fraud United Artists Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards James T.

what era did the potc movies take place like somewhere in the s or early s i must know thanks here i found a very helpful site lots of info i believe the general consensus is that they take place around the late th century early th century more specifically we don't really know however in a giant earthquake basically levelled port royal a pirate town la movie tortuga until then after which it became a respectable british settlement as we see in the movies ergo we can assume they are set after or rather at least years after as to give it a chance to rebuild actually according to wikipedia take that as you will the city was destroyed again in this time by fire so we can assume sometime after at the earliest  Port Royal Napier earthquake Bratislava Castle Stave church Skopje RuneScape quests 1906 San Francisco earthquake Szombathely Mayag__ez, Puerto Rico Insurance Apple Computer Toledo City Tortuga Colchester The Bible and history USS Wickes (DD-75) Cosmological argument Elis Prefecture Buccaneer Library of Alexandria Pittsburgh Pirates Exosquad characters 1755 Lisbon earthquake Fortress Louisbourg Super Metroid New town __zmir Charleston, South Carolina Alexandria World Series New York City Domain Name System Ontology Ra (board game) Cleveland Browns Sandakan Britannia (Ultima) Ur Bretton Woods system Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl USS Tortuga (LSD-26) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Babe Ruth Ierapetra The Internet Movie Database Atari 8-bit family Troy Pittsburgh Steelers Good Friday Earthquake Norway national football team History of the Caribbean Consensus decision-making Nishapur Doomsday argument Viking Pensacola, Florida The Nightmare Before Christmas San Francisco Giants Portuguese Creole History of London Kobe Oakland, California Final Fantasy IV History of Crete Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Piracy in the Caribbean Los Angeles Dodgers Transformers series BattleTech Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Kefalonia Timpani Lex Luthor Mount Etna San Francisco, California Heraklion TradeWars 2002 Et-Tell Neopets Denizli Province Napier, New Zealand Geology of the British Isles Mobile weapons Final Fantasy magic Star Trek Customizable Card Game Corinth Haarlem Canada Education in Portugal Montreal Philippi Palace of Westminster RuneScape locations Florida Keys Pirate Advance Wars: Dual Strike Tennis Elbl__g USS Tracy (DD-214)
