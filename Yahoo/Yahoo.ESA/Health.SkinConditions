overnight acne does anybody know a overnight acne cure that worked for them ive heard lemon juice and egg whites nobody seems to have personal expereince with this i need somthing for acne or acne scars well i'm pretty sure you can't get rid of all your acne overnight and you definitely can't cure it overnight but isopropyl alcohol salicylic acid toothpaste neosporin all seem to work well i would say dab some alcohol or salicylic acid onto the pimple wait until it dries then put toothpaste on it let it stay on for a few hours then wash your face and splash it with cold water to close the pores and lessen the redness then put neosporin on the pimples and sleep with it on if you're afraid the neosporin might come off due to tossing and turning put small band aids over the pimples all of that helps with the size and redness of the pimples you should definitely see an improvement by the next day they might not be completely gone but they won't be as bad use a daily regimine wash your face with hot water opens the pores then pat it dry use an astringent sea breeze works best on a cotton ball and apply it to your face wait til it dries then splash your face with cold water about times to close the pores so that no bacteria gets into them change your pillowcase every other day to avoid getting the bacteria from your hair transfered to the pillowcase and onto your face use the regimine morning night and use one of those spot treatments for problem pimples it's best not to use all of them all night i would say that salicylic acid and toothpaste work best actually figure out what works best for you also whiteheads are easy to take care of you can pop them without getting scars first apply a hot washcloth to it and then pop it and make sure that all of the pus comes out it may start to bleed put neosporin on it and a band aid and it should be gone tomorrow hope i helped  Psoriasis Salicylic acid Halitosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Yarrow Cleanser Crohn's disease Common cold Scar Poker jargon Sento Dandruff Tattoo Tea Smallpox Tooth Alcoholics Anonymous Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Car washing techniques Vinegar Wart Textile manufacturing The Cure Babe Ruth Menstrual cup Tofu Egg (food) Mouth ulcer Rosacea Social rule Breakfast Capercaillie Dairy Wound Sulfuric acid Carnivorous plant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Leaf Sea-Monkey Aloe Soy protein Hypoglycemia Hyperthermia Wood Coffee Customs and etiquette of Japan Leon White Tooth enamel Skin Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sake Aerial (dance move) Jazz Food preservation Astringent Anemia Wine making Sauna Lemon The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Herpes simplex virus Urinary incontinence Laws of cricket Puberty Foodborne illness Eczema Stomach cancer Scabies Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Plastic Earwax Sydney Riot of 1879 Health insurance Fire extinguisher Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hot sauce Hemp Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fluoride therapy Red Hot Chili Peppers Yoghurt Thermal power station 1957 World Series Jon Secada Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Naval mine Stoma Gastroesophageal reflux disease Dental caries

a cry help wat should i do i've got a very dry skin with sensitivity wat cream should i use any idea i hate it like that that make's me look ugly the prob is that it's just my face i have been there done that it can be very embarassing but it can be helped first of all you'll want to use a moisturizer that is hypo allergenic fragrance free and non comedogenic these three terms mean that most of the things that irritate sensitive skin are not in the ingredients of the product i have tried different products including cetaphil and eucerin my current course of action is to put eucerin cream on my face and then pat it dry after it sits for a few minutes the cream doesn't absorb very well then i use a baby lotion i found at a drugstore to lock in the moisture you could also try other brands such as oil of olay or neutrogena just check the ingredients make sure to apply the lotion or cream right after you get out of the shower to lock in as much moisture as possible also try a cooler shower hot water dries skin out to summarize the best thing you can do is look for non irritating moisturizers and test them out and see what is best for you my skin was at one point almost scaly and it was embarassing after some trial and error work i've finally found the right combination for me i would avoid vaseline at first because it is very greasy and could cause breakouts use this as a very last resort i can't promise you that your skin will improve overnight but in a week or two you will hopefully see noticeable improvement good luck  Eczema Psoriasis Shaving Shampoo Urticaria Urinary incontinence Ice cream Explosive material Acne Scabies Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Glycerin Manicure Aloe Massage Dandruff Sunscreen Stomach cancer Cosmetics Tattoo Animal testing Perfume Essential oil Coffee Diaper Ammonia Pubic hair Baldness treatments Instant coffee Hyperthermia Cleanser Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Otitis externa Hemp Crohn's disease Shoe polish Sulfuric acid Pasta Plastic Grape seed oil Breastfeeding Dietary fiber Tocopherol Leather Diving suit Depilation Houseplant Hamster Air conditioning Sento Allergy Cleveland Browns Dairy Dialysis EastEnders Weather lore Upholstery Medical analysis of circumcision Teen Girl Squad Hay fever Veganism Idli Ultraviolet Dairy product Menstrual cup STS-59 Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Motor oil Comet Skin Asthma Wood Zinc Friends Hydrogen peroxide Food Hypoglycemia Curry Onion Radiation therapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knife Cruising (maritime) Butter Diode Capsaicin Sorghum Herpes simplex virus Soft drink Poker jargon Bacon Multiple chemical sensitivity Baking Homeopathy

to have sensidine gell tooth paste the only toothpaste with out that chemical but its also in loads and loads of bath products it makes my skin itch so badly beacuse i have ezcma but i can't seem to find anything without it help please at the mo i can only use aqeous cream from boots and it means i can't use soap either so if you know where i can get products without it i'd be very happy thx for the help i'm glad someone recognises that some of us and my denstist says its becomong very common are allergic and need things without that stupid chemical i havn't found any soaps or bath bubbles with out it yet even in holland and barret you can make your own quite easily and for not much money body scrub grapeseed extract mixed with brown sugar or use almond oil if not allergic or dead sea salt oil as above and lavender or rosemary or add essential oils like peppermint etc peppermint scrub espesh good for tired feet for these recipes you can use simple soap simple brand soap has nothing added whatsoever and is approved by excema society shower gel bars of simple soap twin pack p bottle of glycerin ml ltrs water drops of essential oilsof your choice put everything in the stock pot except oils bring it to the boil and simmer until the soap dissolves leave until it is cool enough to safely handle add whatever essential oils you decide on and decant into suitable containers this can be a bit thick but if you put it in the shower with you to warm the bottle up or stand it in a mug of hot water it is okay ask in healthfood shops about shea butter and use it to make luxury hm soap promise this sounds harder to do than it actually is all natural castile olive oil based soap or simple soap distilled water tbsp all natural unprocessed shea butter tbsp finely ground almonds optional but a nice addition for a gentle exfoliating soap with a nice scent a grater a double boiler or a small pot that can be placed inside of a bigger pot small plastic food containers for molds a mixing spoon a drying rack begin by setting some tap water to boil in the double broiler or big pot grate your castile soap until you have two cups full add this to the inner double boiler or the small pot with cup of distilled water melt it over medium high heat stirring frequently until the soap is completely melted and stringy when you pull up the spoon remove it from the heat add the shea butter and almonds stirring gently until the mixture is well blended pour into small plastic food containers and let dry and harden for several hours they should pop out when completely hard place on the drying rack and allow soap to set for weeks turning regularly throughout the day to prevent the bars from warping then simply wrap them in plastic wrap to preserve them or use them in your next

what makes mosquito bites swell up and itch i've heard different theories that they inject a type of posion as they mosquitos suck blood i've also heard it's because we're allegric to the bite i don't know if any of those are true or if there's something else entirely mosquito bites swell and itch because the mosquito injects a tiny bit of venom when she bites it's always a female they use the blood for the incubation of eggs rather than to consume the venom is there as an anticoagulant so that the blood flow does stop and she can get all she needs unfortunately it also makes us itch and for some people who are sensitive there's quite a bit of swelling as well i suppose it could be considered an allergy but the amount is so tiny that it's not a life threatening one the greater hazard from mosquito bites is disease transmission of course thank heaven for deet  Mosquito Allergy Spider Malaria Anopheles Tick Snake Tarantula First aid Venom (poison) Head louse Group A streptococcal infection Mast cell Tsetse fly Tuberculosis Jurassic Park Hay fever Eczema DDT Vampire Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shark Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Heartworm Hematophagy Rattlesnake Diabetic retinopathy Chagas disease Leech DEET Black widow spider Biological pest control Itch Flea Conjunctivitis Myocardial infarction Snakebite (bite) Intravenous therapy West Nile virus Diabetic nephropathy Plasmodium Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cirrhosis Bedbug Traumatic brain injury Platypus Ebola Deep vein thrombosis Onchocerciasis Malignant melanoma Psoriasis Anticoagulant Antivenom Decibel Scabies Hypoglycemia Bladderwort Ultimate Spider-Man Marilyn Monroe Chronic fatigue syndrome Rebreather Hemorrhoid Sexually-transmitted infection Loa loa filariasis Bird Bubonic plague Emphysema 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Cocaine Yellow fever Blood Lassa fever AIDS Asthma Safe sex Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Coagulation Bone marrow transplant Food allergy Scorpion Reduviidae Functional magnetic resonance imaging Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma MP3 Blood donation Hemorrhagic stroke Thimerosal Sulfasalazine Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Treehouse of Horror V Frog Wuchereria bancrofti HIV test Volcano Red blood cell Blood transfusion Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Carpal tunnel syndrome

i use opti free replenish to clean and store my soft contact lenses but seem to have a problem even though i am on prescription meds for eye allergies i am still getting mucusy sp strings and chunks in my eyes making wearing contacts almost impossible do you think it is the opti free replenish i think i want to try just cleaning them with a contact lens soap and rinse and store them with saline any suggestions could be that you are allergic to the chemicals in replenish i had an allergy to it and after i changed to another type the symptoms disappeared you can definately try using the daily cleaning regimen with your contacts to see if it helps remember even if the doctor recommended a certain brand of solution you can still try others they are your eyes after all even after trying different solutions it could be that your eyes are just really sensitive at this time of year and maybe you should use your glasses until your allergies clear one last thing to consider is that you may have an eye infection as mucousy matted eyes are a cardinal symptom of this a trip to the eye doctor can rule this out they have the capability to check for this right in the office hope this helps  Contact lens Allergy Eczema Hay fever Tattoo Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical prescription Common cold Tuberculosis Glasses Keratoconus First aid Medicine Body piercing Diabetic retinopathy Psoriasis Paracetamol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Homeopathy Mouth ulcer Sulfasalazine Insomnia Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Intraocular lens Breastfeeding Menstrual cup Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Herpes simplex virus Cat Urinary incontinence Migraine Colorectal cancer Eyeglass prescription Food allergy Hamster Cancer Latex allergy Pneumonia Fecal incontinence Sinusitis Malaria Eye Sento Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome AIDS reappraisal Jala neti Presbyopia Basophil granulocyte Charles Darwin's illness Acne Dishwasher Addiction Rabies Prostate cancer Parkinson's disease M__ni__re___s disease Al-Razi Hypersensitivity Textile manufacturing Sunglasses Clinical depression Clomipramine Nasal irrigation Lung cancer Caving Multiple myeloma LASIK Cannabis (drug) Protein Digital photography Hard water Nutrition Aspergillosis Optometry Dog Computer virus Ultraviolet Methylsulfonylmethane Hypoglycemia Mastocytosis Urticaria Gmail Breast cancer Violin Folic acid Vulvovaginal health Autism Immunoglobulin E Halitosis Candidiasis Bicycle lighting Alcoholics Anonymous Sleep apnea

best over the counter acne solutions a product you can just buy at walmart kmart walgreens or rite aid that wont burn a hole in your pocket but i've been looking at some of these ingredients and they're the icky kind like propylparaben fragrance propylene glycol disodium edta sodium laureth sulfate etc these things are bad for your skin but i dont know why they put them in there but if you could find a good product that will help clear my skin and not mess it up with chemicals like that it'd be great thank you i will be picking a best answer to be honest since you are a female i suggest that you attack acne from inside out since it is a skin condition any topical solution that you put on the surface of your skin will only control it and most times they don't work and acne will still appear and your money will be wasted on a product that won't entirely save your skin that is why i recommend that you take birth control pills the last time i bought acne medication was in january and it was the whole clinique skin solutions set and spent around this was after i was using proactive for about yrs and my acne still would come back every now and then the clinique set worked but the acne came back anyway i decided to talk to a dermatologist and she said that a cheap and effective way to treat my acne was by taking birth control because it regulates hormones the reason why teens break out because theirs are raging that was in march and by the second week my acne was practically gone i haven't had an out break since and my clinique collection was given to a male friend of mine i suggest that you try this because as long as you use creams they won't stop your face completely from getting an occasional break out and removing acne scars cosmetically is expensive  Scar Psoriasis Puberty Tattoo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Isotretinoin Shampoo Rosacea E number Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baldness treatments Cosmetics Hydrogen peroxide Sulfuric acid Eczema Skin Wal-Mart Glycerin Hydrochloric acid Minoxidil Dermatology Urinary incontinence Naval mine Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Moisturizer Propylene glycol Microeconomics Prostate cancer Friends The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Circumcision Cancer 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Scarification Malignant melanoma Social rule Medical prescription Ozone depletion Hormone Organic peroxide Animal testing Soap RuneScape quests Sewage treatment Hypertension Tocopherol Dialysis Birth control Retinol Asthma Alcoholic beverage Antiretroviral drug Homeopathy Ammonia Anabolic steroid Michel Foucault Condom Swimming Nutrition Meat Loaf Economy of the United States Hidradenitis suppurativa Health insurance Chocolate Sodium hydroxide Keloid Medical analysis of circumcision Pharmaceutical company Endometriosis Phenol Samurai Deeper Kyo Edible salt Fire extinguisher H2G2 Amineptine Outsourcing Breastfeeding Second Battle of the Atlantic Wound healing phases Comfrey Plastic surgery Taxi Driver Tofu Avenue Q Ice cream Childbirth Turmeric Mercury (element) Organic food Iron Plutonium

how does a blind person know what clothes match when they are getting dressed tyrone is on the right track there are a variety of ways to do it sometimes it depends on the individual i work with children that have disabilities one year i worked in a classroom in which of the class was visually impaired we worked closely with the comission for the blind to adapt daily living skills for these children and this was one of the areas here are some things we did if the person is already learning braille you can embroider the name of the color on the tag or inside the material somewhere as long as the embroidery is in the same place so the person knows where to find it if this is not done it can add to dressing time if the person does not know braille you can embroider shapes or a dot system into the clothing this way the person knows to match a square with a square or two dots with two dots so on and so forth you can also sew different textures into the inside of the material for example if you go to a craft store they are alwats willing to donate scraps you can take a little piece of velvet and sew it into two different articles of clothing that would match hope this helps  Braille Blindness Textile manufacturing terminology Embroidery Color blindness United States dollar Sewing Clothing Tactile signing Knitting Musical notation Mental retardation Hearing impairment Dyslexia Assistive technology Kimono Gurkha Contingent Undergarment Disability Academic dress of Oxford University Aphasia Mattress Comanche Camouflage Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Upholstery National Library for the Blind Pottery Colours, standards and guidons Carpet Dice CPU cache GED Morse Code Autism Marching band Cross-stitch Arabic alphabet Computer Blind musicians Color Textile Sniper Drawing Rigging Typewriter Wallpaper group Shirt Asperger syndrome Storyteller System Victorian fashion Necktie Learning disability Korean art Diaper Computer accessibility Culture of Korea Tofu Sea Scouts (BSA) Strap-on dildo Quilt Light-emitting diode Technology Mixed martial arts Drama Glossary of firefighting equipment Art Gaia Online Pixel Team Fortress Classic Opportunity rover Kilt Visual perception Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Explosive material Academic dress Ribbon Flag Amish Cephalic disorder Wood carving Scientology beliefs and practices Copyright law of the United Kingdom Sento Volleyball Billiards Casting Cognitive science Symmetry Tai shogi Quantum dot Ammunition Kayak Sewing machine Tag National Federation of the Blind Boy Scouts of America Bayeux Tapestry

do i have a disorder i have toenail fungus and every time my toe nails grow somewhat of a nail i tear it off and i end up bleeding a lot first of all stop tearing at your toenails if you do have a fungus under the nail you run the risk of infecting your hands by opening the area and having some bleeding you are opening yourself up to a much bigger infection as well when you think of the enviornment that your toes are in damp dark and dirty shoes you have to be careful i would not suggest seeing your doctor for lamasil as it is an oral drug for fungus and has to go thru your whole body to get to your toes and can damage your liver and kidneys it should be as a last resort what i suggest is trying footlogix nail tincture it is an awesome product that you spray at the end of your nail and it penetrates the nail bed to get to the problem you have to use it until the nail totally grows out sometimes that can take months depending on your normal rate of growth it is worth the wait it has clotrimazole which is an anti fungal i think that perhaps your tearing the nail is a nervous habit because of the fungus and if your nails were looking better perhaps you wouldn't do that anymore  Nail (anatomy) Nail disease Pneumonia Diabetes mellitus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Callus Athlete's foot Urinary incontinence Malaria Ringworm Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Chlorpromazine Traumatic brain injury Fungus Prostate cancer Aspergillosis Gout Medicine Eczema Tobacco smoking Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Cephalic disorder Coeliac disease Antiretroviral drug Folic acid First aid Crohn's disease AIDS Turner syndrome Stroke Diseases of the honeybee Childbirth Shock Herpes simplex virus Radiation poisoning Chronic fatigue syndrome Cirrhosis Glycogen storage disease type I Leukemia Bone fracture Rabies Chemotherapy Immunosuppressive drug Hepatitis C Multiple sclerosis Alcoholism Tocopherol Wound Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Insulin Fancy rat Diabetic neuropathy Antibiotic Breastfeeding Lichen Blood Chagas disease Dog Paget's disease of bone Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Clomipramine Obstetrics Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Group A streptococcal infection Cytomegalovirus Kidney Erythropoietin Mycotoxin Organ transplant HIV Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cerebral palsy Sexually-transmitted infection Anal sex Terbinafine hydrochloride Stopping power Vitamin C Medical analysis of circumcision Methamphetamine Hepatitis Dialysis Ulcer Addiction Manicure Intravenous therapy Hair Subdural hematoma Mycosis Lung cancer Kenny McCormick Oral contraceptive Crimson Chin Bleeding Prolactinoma Fire fighting Glucocorticoid

help with odd skin and pimples treatments make it worse i have a rather annoying problem i dont have really bad acne or anything just a few spots on chin and forehead but theyre often big red and painful and no matter what i put on them it seems to make it worse rather then better for example i got benzyl peroxide cream and use it on pimples but if i get even a little on skin that doesnt already have a pimple one pops up same with other acne creams or herbal remedies its really annoying cause i cant use face washes or anything to actually prevent them can only spot reduce when theyre all big and already ick im wondering if anyone can recommend what to do or why this happens any help would be oh so appreciated i think the problem is bacteria in your skin those pimples are a sign that you have constant problems with acne bacteria is inside and your body is dealing with it all the time that's why sometimes they are bigger sometimes smaller depends on how strong is your body's immune system at the time but the fact that it doesn't go away means you need to help your body to deal with it permanently also you said when you used certain treatments more pimples came out this could be that bacteria is already inside just you can't see the acne with your eyes and when you used products it all came out you should know that when i start treatments acne is always more severe in first few days when the skin is clearing then it gets better and better and eventually it's gone for good my treatment is natural and kinda special so i can't really talk about it over the internet because i need to see the skin with my own eyes and check many facts before i start no persons have the same skin so my treatment is always different from person to person but i always try to deal with the root of the problem not just with acne but what i can tell you is this acne is a sign that something inside the body isn't working as it should our skin is the first indicator of body's energy imbalance weak body's immune system lack of certain nutrition or unhealthy lifestyle it can also be genetics so i don't know the reason for you but there's much you can do to help your own body deal with acne and believe me no product is as good dealing with acne as your own body drink clear water no soda drinks no sugar added drinks clear water is what your body need for proper functionality if you were used to drink soda or other drinks try and drink just clear water effects on acne will be seen in months our body has a delay when we live unhealthy it takes time for problems to show on our skin same goes when we live healthy it takes time before positive effects are seen water can help if it was the root problem for acne daily workout routine this is essential because your body needs good blood flow in areas where acne is forming so more nutrition gets there more anti body cells to kill the bacteria and more toxins get flushed away when needed remember to clean your face with clear water no soap after the exercise because sweat can cause acne too effects are seen in weeks healthy lifestyle this is the most important healthy food reduce stress relaxing activities and your mental condition depressions and constant stress causes eventually causes acne breakouts it also causes hormonal inbalances and metabolism problems effects are seen in months but change of lifestyle is a permanent solution to many problems not just acne your body and you will always be grateful for any little effort you put into changing your lifestyle to be of better quality highly recommended product to help fight with acne is clearpores http www clearpores com clicks clickthrough html a it's natural causes no side effects and deals with acne where it forms that means from the inside and out it totally outranks any other products on the market hope my advice helped if you have more questions i'll be glad to answer you can check my website at http www easynaturalyou com find my contact info and write me an email for nutritional help to deal with acne i only help personally because i need more info about your lifestyle and if possible photos of skin but it can be

my months old son has water filled bulb like boils all over his head and few on his body is this chicken pox the boils are filled with some fluid and looks transparent when consulted a doctor he said it is some infection but i still doubt if it is something else he also runs temperature which reduces with a dose of paracetamal drops and is back after to hours please specify how chicken pox rashes looks like and suggest how to treat him it sounds more like chicken pox than infection the infection your doctor mentioned is likely to be impetigo which causes small blisters which spread very quickly and need treating with antibiotics and cream if your doctor thought it was infection why didn't he prescribe something for it this sounds odd to me i would change doctors he seems to have left you confused which is not doing his job if it's chicken pox which it sounds like especially the fever keep doing what you are doing and give daily warm baths with bicarbonate of soda in just buy the regular stuff you use for baking from the shop and tip plenty in the water nothing else in the water but that this eases itching soothes the pox and helps dry them out to speed up the healing process calamine lotion at other times is also good for treating the blisters apply with cotton wool dabbing gently keep an eye on him the blisters will continue to appear for a few days then will start to heal i would double check with another doctor though just to be sure that it is chicken pox and not something else find out if any other children are suffering that you have been in contact with this is the only way he will have picked it up  Eczema Group A streptococcal infection Smallpox Psoriasis Chickenpox Syphilis Common cold Stomach cancer Herpes simplex virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sunburn Zinc Mouth ulcer Conjunctivitis Fecal incontinence Chicken Medical prescription Carbon dioxide Dialysis Aloe Sexually-transmitted infection Allergy Scabies Otitis externa Guinea pig Tuberculosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cystoscopy First aid Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Fancy rat Yarrow Menstrual cup Cocaine Tattoo Domestic rabbit Lyme disease Marburg virus Dairy Doxepin Chocolate Manicure Osteoarthritis Gonorrhoea Chlorpromazine Traumatic brain injury Diarrhea Escherichia coli O157:H7 Water purification Gout Sauna Textile manufacturing Traditional Chinese medicine Pneumonia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Social rule Omega-3 fatty acid Anthrax Hay fever Hyperthermia Mattress Electrophysiology Hypothermia Onion Hydrochloric acid Lupus erythematosus Urticaria Ice cream Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sento Thermal power station Massage Antibiotic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Asthma Folic acid Vitamin C Al-Razi Homeopathy 28 Days Later Cephalexin Candidiasis Hard water Childbirth Agar plate Diving Hydrotherapy Insomnia Cirrhosis

can someone explain this to me please i've been using neutrogena acne wash and a rough sponge to get rid of the acne on my back it wasn't working but i kept using it anyway because i thought it just took time i ran out of the solution so i decided to use shampoo and the sponge until i had a chance to get to the store after one shower of using shampoo to clean my back my acne cleared up a lot then just to experiment i used the neutrogena again and with just one shower i had really bad acne again why is it that something specialized for back acne is making my back worse and something as simple as shampoo is actually helping can someone just explain this to me please i'm glad i finally found something that works but i just need to know why the difference is that sometime acne soaps especially those that do not contain benzoil peroxide cover the skin with a silght film usually from the oils that are used to make the base of the soap this can actually keep the medicinal properties of the soap from penetrating the skin in order for it to be effective shampoo doesn't contain any of these base oils and it is more effective in stripping oils from the body and drying out the skin thats why you normally get that squeeky sound when your hair is really clean because all of the natural oils have been stripped there could also be a very slight chance that you are allergic to something contained in the soap even though most promise to be non allergenic  Shampoo Acne Dandruff Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sento Allergy Tattoo Cleanser Scar Puberty Hair coloring Rosacea Skin Urinary incontinence Soap Menstrual cup Hay fever Washroom Moisturizer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Urticaria Fecal incontinence Hydrogen peroxide Wok Androgen insensitivity syndrome Organic peroxide Baldness treatments Wound Asthma Benzoyl peroxide First aid Ranma __ characters Car washing techniques Minoxidil Theory of conduct Hydrotherapy Manicure Aloe Leather Procter & Gamble Textile manufacturing Body piercing Patent medicine Sponge Social rule Transformer Soap opera Soap bubble Hair conditioner Senescence Japanese toilet Yarrow Disinfection Sterilization (microbiology) Multiple chemical sensitivity Explosive material Jessica Simpson Motor oil Stomach cancer Glycerin Carbon dioxide Blood Simple Massage Old wives' tale Plastic Isotretinoin Extreme Programming Drill bit Strap-on dildo Luminiferous aether Dishwashing Birth control Second Battle of the Atlantic Clothing Sulfuric acid Otitis externa Sebaceous gland Dry cleaning Earwax Tarantula Nudity Seborrhoeic dermatitis Solvent Water (molecule) Chocolate Vinegar The Dalek Invasion of Earth Blackjack Iron Perfume Piccolo Junior Saga M16 (rifle) Cruising (maritime) Dialysis Philosophy of space and time Knife

blackhead medication question k well yesterday i went to the doctor for the blackheads on my nose and she prescribed me the benzoyl perozide wash clindamycin phosphate topical lotion and tretinoin cream i really didnt think that my acne was that bad to be prescribed three medications but im not sure what to use first because i have sensitive dry skin i dont want this stuff to make it worse the best thing to do is use the benzoyl peroxide wash in the morning or whenever you take a shower and then apply the topical lotion at bedtime put the cream on if your skin becomes dry use the benzoyl wash every other day you dont have to use this every day you can do every other to keep skin from drying out your acne probably isnt that bad the doctors use this stuff because its like having a mild infection and your body cant fight it of so once you take care of it it wont keep coming back once your skin is really good and clear you should maybe only use the stuff twice a week  Psoriasis Benzoyl peroxide Eczema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Rosacea Organic peroxide Scabies Manicure Stomach cancer Medical prescription Skin Tattoo Medicine Shaving Osteoarthritis Clindamycin Dialysis Scar Retinol Urinary incontinence Wart Allergy Group A streptococcal infection Dermatology Wound Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dandruff Doxepin Bleeding Cosmetics Urticaria Conjunctivitis Body piercing Aloe Pneumonia Tocopherol Androgen insensitivity syndrome Moisturizer Common cold Prostate cancer Clomipramine Hydrogen peroxide Jock itch Maprotiline Ethics Radiation therapy Homeopathy Childbirth Fibromyalgia Hay fever Halitosis Acetone peroxide Milton H.

im really sun burned on my neck chest and uper back and im wondering how long will this all go away i got soccer tryouts in days and im putting solarcaine which is an aloe vera product so ive been putting it on like every minutes will this sunburn be gone in days cold water is the best only first aid when you burn yourself minutes under the tap and no less never ice or vinegar or milk or butter or green tea or mustard or toothpaste or sunscreen or semen or vaseline or tomatoes or vanilla extract or yogurt or sour cream or egg white or egg yellow or lavender oil or cocoa butter or salt or tea bags or potato or shaving cream or olive oil or baking soda or banana peel or petroleum jelly or whipped cream or avocado or bacon grease or corn starch or turmeric or lemon juice or curd or pickle juice or soy sauce or urine or talcum powder or mashed strawberries or exfoliating scrub or mayonnaise or peroxide or bleach or deep heat or ketchup or red grapes or hairspray not until the skin is fully healed ibuprofen or aspirin will help but large burns are often accompanied by stomach ulcers so tylenol panadol is best for pain if you are gonna tough it out drink plenty of water or energy drinks that don't have caffeine gatorade i would advise that you cover the burnt area with white soft paraffin white petroleum or aqueous cream bp check the links below and see if you can find a local equivalent wash the burn and reapply every hours cover with cling wrap if you wish to cover with clothes this will stop your clothes getting covered with paraffin and maintains the burn cling wrap alone is also ok if you can't get hold of any paraffin it acts as a protective artificial skin helping retain moisture and protect from further damage and pain aloe is good coz it remoisturises but that moisture can be quickly lost as the skin can't contain fluids so put aloe on and then the paraffin on over the top if there is broken skin leave out the aloe just paraffin http www doorone com au xgs aqueous cream ns linkin id http www pharmacyonline com au david craig paraffin g p html http www cvs com cvsapp cvs gateway detail prodid previousuri cvsapp cvs gateway search page query white petrolatum activecat email if you still have questions send photos feedingthedogcustard hotmail com finally if you are really worried go to a hospital that has a burns unit or plastic surgeons serious sunburn i e blisters and all other burns should be seen by a burns trained doctor or nurse  Coffee Fecal incontinence Japanese cuisine Breakfast Mayonnaise Peruvian cuisine Genericized trademark Barbecue Jewish cuisine Hot dog Pizza McDonald's Soft drink Potato Dairy Food preservation Tattoo Cheese Mouth ulcer Chocolate Plastic Psoriasis Acne Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Africa Bread Sunscreen Petroleum Sauce Fish and chips Sandwich Cha chaan teng Pancake Mango Soul food Soap Hydrochloric acid Cantonese cuisine Kit Kat Starch Milk Salad Cuisine of Malaysia Cocoa First aid Gout Yoghurt Water Eczema Caffeine Cold Stone Creamery Cuisine of the Southern United States Carbon dioxide Malignant melanoma Acetic acid Hot sauce Hyperthermia Bacon Chili con carne Essential oil Turmeric Breastfeeding French fries In-N-Out Burger Dim sum Vinegar Fire extinguisher Comanche Soy milk Jelly Belly Stomach cancer Ultraviolet Hydrogen peroxide Potato chips Russian cuisine Perfume Sugar Potassium Cuisine of Brazil Dairy product Tooth Wine Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Argentina Flour

my year old has a rash that comes and goes in minutes he has been unwell latley anyone else experience this he had one episode of vomitting on thusday and has had very little appetite since then which is not like him at all he's been drinking plenty he has develped a transient rash in the last h its basically there one minute and gone the next one minute he looks like he is covered in tiny hives and then they dissapear anybody with info would really be appreciated most rashes in that age group are due to viral infection in fact viruses are known for causing a rash in all age groups since he's had an episode of vomiting is off his feed and not himself this is most likely what ails your toddler most viruses run their course between one and two weeks and will vanish as mysteriously as it appeared as long as he isn't running a fever above f that will not come down with tylenol and is drinking plenty of fluids he will do fine he will probably not eat much and won't really be very sociable but after a few more days will start getting back to his usual self after a few days they begin to feel more like themselves although the rash may still come and go although it's frightening the viral infections usually aren't a major problem and they bounce back pretty well of course you can always have things checked out by your pediatrician for confirmation just don't be surprised when or if the peds tells you that yes it's a viral rash and no they don't know which one is causing it and no there's nothing you can do about it except wait for his body to kick virus tail end just offer favorite foods and plenty to drink try to keep him comfortable and running about in undies or the diaper is the usual prefered way for most kids with a rash it shouldn't really bother him much unless he gets hot or sweaty if he does happen to fuss about an itch a cool water bath with either baking soda or a handful of oatmeal will usually soothe that just trust your gut you'll know if he's really sick as long as it's just the rash and off his feed he'll be okay  Diarrhea Breastfeeding Pneumonia Common cold Ebola Urticaria Group A streptococcal infection Hepatitis First aid Cirrhosis Foodborne illness Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Cytomegalovirus Smallpox Hepatitis C Infectious mononucleosis Marburg virus Roseola Fecal incontinence Virus Shaggy dog story Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Hyperthermia Diseases of the honeybee The Shining (film) Jackass: The Movie Antiviral drug Treehouse of Horror V Hypoglycemia Dengue fever Mosquito Fancy rat Eczema Rotavirus Yellow fever Poliomyelitis Influenza Prostate cancer Spanish flu Measles Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Electrophysiology HIV Theory of conduct Computer virus Norwalk virus group Time Out of Mind Lassa fever Hay fever Marilyn Monroe Drowning Monkeypox Haven (TNG episode) Encephalitis Conjunctivitis Paracetamol Herpes simplex virus Dehydration Syphon Filter Gastroenteritis Rubella Vomiting HIV test AFI 100 Years series Sauna Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an H5N1 Have I Got News For You StarCraft Episode VI Ex-gay Charles Darwin's illness Infantilism Syphilis Rasheed Wallace Chickenpox Meme The Amazing Race Milton H.

i pick at my zits constantly which causes scaps why can i not resist the temptation of letting them heal i don't know but i had the same problem i just got so self conscious of red spots all over that i made myself stop quite difficult actually just don't look at yourself when you go to take a shower or wash your hands etc try this for one week do not pick at your face unless there is an obvious white zit in which case you may pop but only that nothing else make sure to wash with soap in shower exfoliate and moisturize you'd be surprised how much your face will heal in a week maybe then you'll get some incentive to stop picking it worked for me d  Acne Psoriasis Social rule Soap Milton H.

i know gross but i have a question on head lice last night i discovered that my daughter had head lice i went and bought the lice shampoo and the lice and nit comb and she patiently sat there for two hours while i combed out as many nits as i could today i cleaned the entire apartment and bagged what needed to be bagged i was checking her head all day for lice but only saw the nits then i decided to go through with the lice comb again and there were hatched lice in her head everyone told me that she should be fine after the shampoo and that i only needed to get rid of the nits afterward i can't give her another treatment this close so does anyone have any ideas i don't even know if i should let her sleep in the bed that i vacuumed and sprayed thanks for any advise you can give the lice meds only kill the hatched lice not the nits that is why you comb them out before they hatch unfortunately the ones you miss will hatch and thus another treatment is necessary my daughter had lice when she was and we got rid of them without the use of chemicals this is what i learned and did lice can hold their breath hours to loosen the nits spray a mixture of white vinegar and water on her hair mix it to a percentage that does not irritate her skin with us it was about parts water part vinegar treat yourself as well they are easily spread they prefer clean scalps so those that use lots of hair products tend to be safer my hubby and son shaved their heads they prefer it that way anyway and lice like to hide in hair so the guys were safe i am told that with a blacklight in a dark room you can see the critters heard about this after the fact so i cannot guarantee this killing the lice mayo spoils quickly so we used a really thick cheap conditioner saturate roots of wet hair with conditioner cover with a shower cap and pin in place leave on for hours we slept with it on wash and then nit comb for nits and dead lice then rewash do this every four days for days whew sounds exhausting doesn't it i am against chemicals as much as possible and my daughter has suuuuuuper sensitive skin that would have reacted to the pesticide this worked for us and i recommend it to everyone good luck  Crab louse Head louse Diseases of the honeybee Fancy rat Shampoo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pediculosis Hair First aid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coffee Guinea pig Gypsy moth Embalming Pneumonia Textile manufacturing Depilation Sento Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drowning Dialysis Bedbug Baldness treatments Vinegar Louse Acne Ultraviolet Eczema Migraine Haircut Baldness Otitis externa Mattress Malaria Minor Harry Potter Beasts Common cold Herpes simplex virus Hyperthermia Multiple chemical sensitivity Social rule Avenue Q Rebreather Light-emitting diode Blood Simple Sin City Hamster Oh My Goddess!

rash on back of hand hello just yesturday a rash appeared on the back of my hand it appeared after i had sum red spots n my hand which looked llike very open pores in my skin i scratched it for a few seconds and a rash appeared on the back of my hand anyone no what this could be there are many ways a person can get a hand rash but all have some aspects in common the skin is exposed to something irritating it reacts with a rash hand eczema is another name for the same thing most hand rash cases are called contact dermatitis because they are caused by contact with substances found in the environment a powerful irritant like some industrial chemicals acids or cleaning fluids are obvious causes of contact dermatitis more often the irritant is milder and the problem starts out as dryness of the hands a few of the more common irritants are over drying due to frequent hand washing soaps cleaning agents or even ingredients in skin and personal care products the inflammation appears as redness swelling and itching the skin looses its ability to serve as a barrier and keep the outside world out it allows more outside irritants in until all the irritants are removed the skin will not heal once skin becomes red and dry even so called harmless things like water and baby products can irritate skin further this is a cumulative irritant dermatitis in that it is not one big irritant but a lot of small ones  Dandruff Rash Acne Psoriasis Coeliac disease Allergy Conjunctivitis Fecal incontinence Hard water Tattoo Scabies Group A streptococcal infection Soap Skin Urticaria Hay fever Shampoo Pepper spray Body piercing Urinary incontinence Smoke-screen Pneumonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diaper Hydrochloric acid Multiple chemical sensitivity Moisturizer Sulfuric acid Diarrhea Hydrogen peroxide Crohn's disease Itch Intravenous therapy Glycerin Haloalkane Wound Otitis externa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Champagne (beverage) Candidiasis Jock itch Biotin Corrosion Scar Limonene Cleanser Cancer Ammonia Beryllium Cellulitis Mosquito Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Latex allergy Carbon dioxide First aid Yarrow Carpal tunnel syndrome Aloe Pulmonary alveolus Hand grenade Hydrogen chloride Fancy rat Lupus erythematosus Lyme disease Smegma Enzyme Manicure Inflammation Erysipelas Textile manufacturing Callus Scarification Dairy Creosote Hamster Radiation therapy Ultraviolet Rooibos Hemorrhoid Dexamethasone Common cold Cytomegalovirus Rosacea Reiter's syndrome Dimethyl sulfoxide Sunscreen Mustard gas Arsenic trioxide Chlorine Food allergy Riot control agent Raney nickel Aspartame

is laser surgery for acne scars ok for teens if the scarring is not to severe i would ask a dermatalogist about a dermabrasion treatment instead of this drastic and costly method when i was a teen and had a moderate to severe bout of acne they did a treatment on my facial area that involved some dry ice wrapped in gauze and a solution that gently removed several layers of the external skin this treatment was repeated several times in the course of two months and i also was prescribed a topical medication called retinae gel that was applied every night this also produced a simalar effect and made the scarring very minimal your age is on your side as to the effects of the acne not being permanent your skin regenerates at a much faster pace that that of person who normally gets this type procedure done adult middle age the best deffense against scarring is not to pick or further irratate the acne with harsh cleansing regimes and keeping your skin hydrated drinking plenty of water at least oz day sorry if there is some mispelled words spell check hanging  Scar Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Tattoo Rosacea Dialysis Radiation therapy Plastic surgery Diabetic retinopathy Isotretinoin Keloid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Scarification Skin Wart Mouth ulcer Prostate cancer Herpes simplex virus Cirrhosis Hypoglycemia Intersex surgery Pneumonia Manicure Psychosurgery Wound Urinary incontinence Retinal detachment Medicine Hyperthermia Eczema Endometriosis Epilepsy Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Malignant melanoma Hydrochloric acid Fluoride therapy Baldness treatments Spanking Penis Shaving Growth hormone deficiency Moisturizer Wound healing phases Dehydration Ultraviolet Clinical depression Osteoarthritis Depilation Bipolar disorder Breast cancer Decompression sickness Cleanser Hemorrhoid Halitosis Triage Hiking Body piercing Stuttering First aid Aloe Torture Gastroesophageal reflux disease Welding Cephalic disorder Earring Psychiatric hospital Baldness Sleep apnea Adverse effect (medicine) Action potential Phimosis Transsexuality Bone marrow transplant Hearing impairment Fasting Conjunctivitis Narcolepsy Shampoo Soap opera Infantilism Ulcerative colitis Tourette syndrome Allergy Gypsy moth Penis enlargement Suture Body modification Insulin Sewage treatment Otitis externa Euthanasia

strange rash resembles description of numular excema but no itching help about years ago i developed a head to toe rash literally that resembled chicken pox except there was no itching and i had already gone through chicken pox as a child ever since then i've been prone to periodic bouts of a rash that starts out like a few red bumps almost looks like acne except it isn't the bumps level out spread in diameter and the worst ones look almost like a cigar burn on my skin that can last for several weeks loads of fun let me tell you i've gone all natural or as natural as i can with laundry detergents and household cleaning products i don't do as well with my food as i should and that's one reason for this post if anyone else suffers from a rash that fits this description is there anything you can do to alleviate the symptoms are there certain foods to avoid that can excaberate the condition again it sounds pretty much like numular excema when i read the description but there is never any itching involved when i break out i go to my doctor who prescribes a steroid to rid of the rash etc we haven't been able to really figure out what is causing it she was assuming i had taken a medication i was allergic to but that wasn't the case she suggested to write down exactly what i eat each day and watch for signs of a rash i ate wendy's that day drank a smoothie from sonics ate homemade lasagna that night w mozzarella and ricotta cheeses just to see if i'd break out again i duplicated exactly what i ate that particular day and had no outbreak go figure i still don't know what causes it i've dealt w it for about the same amount of time sometimes it's just a tiny rash other times i wake up in the morning and have a head to toe breakout which is embarrassing when i go to work the steroid prescrip makes it go away pretty fast  Acne Allergy Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Conjunctivitis Lupus erythematosus Urticaria Cheese Scabies Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Smallpox Syphilis Rosacea Rash Insulin Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Ben Johnson (athlete) Crohn's disease Food Diarrhea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Hypoglycemia Mouth ulcer Cellulitis Candidiasis Ron and Fez Hamburger Anabolic steroid Dieting Doxepin Dandruff Menstrual cycle Multiple chemical sensitivity The Shining (film) Prostate cancer Common cold Asthma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Milton H.

this sounds grosss how do you get rid of blisters my feet are covered in them from marching and i need to know how to get rid of themm help the most important thing is cleanliness sometimes small blisters can be left alone but if they're likely to rupture or become torn open it's better to do it yourself under clean conditions you'll need a pin or needle if you happen to be diabetic or otherwise have access to sterile needles this is best sterile gauze pads rubbing alcohol and band aids if it isn't sterile clean the needle or pin you can soak it in diluted bleach if you rinse it very well with water afterward soap and water is better than nothing but you can also pour some of the rubbing alcohol over it some people hold the needle in a flame until it is red hot and let it cool use pliers to hold it and use sterile gauze to wipe some of the black carbon accumulation off of it if you use this method clean your feet with soap and water and then wipe down the affected areas with rubbing alcohol all of this cleaning may seem excessive if you aren't used to it but an infection will be very painful and will delay healing by quite a while it's much easier and safer to take the appropriate precautions now gently press the fluid in the blister to one side and pierce that side with the pin or needle pierce it from the side not from the top so you don't risk stabbing the very sensitive skin below the blister that would obviously be very painful and would risk drawing blood which would only complicate matters use a sterile gauze pad to gently press the fluid out of the blister ideally the skin on top of the blister will protect the underlying area as it heals so don't cut it away cover the entire area with a band aid fluid may accumulate again so you may have to drain it again in a day or two it's a good idea to to put on neosporin or any other anti microbial ointment you have if it repeatedly refills or if there are any signs of infection increased redness in the area or increased pain a cloudy white ish fluid or possibly swelling or feelings of heat in the area you might have better success by carefully removing the covering layer of dead skin use medical scissors if you have a pair or nail clippers if you can maneuver them well either way clean them well first so you can apply the ointment directly to the affected area keep it covered with a bandage since the blisters are on your feet you might want to use some sort of padding in your shoes until they aren't so painful you can use moleskin molefoam lamb's wool or other padding you can find at a pharmacy or supermarket just be sure to put them over the bandage not directly on top of the blisters if necessary you can put the padding around the blisters rather than directly on top of them to reduce painful direct pressure  First aid Body piercing First aid kit Psoriasis Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Agar plate Brewery Pneumonia Textile manufacturing Breastfeeding Earring Decompression sickness Callus Aloe Traumatic brain injury Hiking Skin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Upholstery Equine conformation Vampire Manicure Sunburn Hydrogen peroxide Gout Scarification Knife Hyperthermia Bong Childbirth Bleeding Fire fighting Sexually-transmitted infection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Common cold Swimming Insulin Cocaine Diabetes mellitus Casting Naruto jutsu Tuberculosis Prostate cancer Acne Ultraviolet Penis Stroke Sento Motor oil Ulcer Urinary incontinence Coffee Diving Turner syndrome Epidural Malaria Professional wrestling holds Cephalic disorder Cellulitis Welding Safe sex Drowning Diabetic retinopathy Crohn's disease Herpes simplex virus AIDS Mattress Mouth ulcer Medical analysis of circumcision Disinfection Diseases of the honeybee Cirrhosis Domestic rabbit Blood donation Sterilization (microbiology) Nail (anatomy) Wok Fire extinguisher Clothing Violin Theory of conduct Chronic fatigue syndrome Human sexual behavior Wart Seismic retrofit

i have the worst sunburn how do i fix it when i have no access to aloevera or vinegar help thats pretty much it and i cant buy anything my mom would freak if she found out it is bright red against my pale pale white skin please help would coldish water work there is no immediate cure for sunburns but the pain can be relieved by hydrating the skin this is done by applying products containing aloe vitamin e or both using the product solarcaine will help do not use any products with lidocaine as it can prevent healing and damage skin citation needed drinking fluids can aid in hydration and eating high protein foods will assist tissue repair analgesics such as acetaminophen e g tylenol or ibuprofen e g advil can also reduce pain one method to treatment involves applying a clean washcloth soaked with cool milk like a cold compress since the lactic acid will help reduce inflammation and the cool towel will soothe the pain blistered skin with or without open sores should heal on its own as with any other open skin wound it is best to avoid lotions or other directly applied ointments however antibacterial solutions and gauze can prevent skin infections the best treatment for most sunburns is time given a few weeks they will heal overall the most important aspect of sunburn care is to avoid the sun while healing and to take precautions to prevent future burns  Aloe First aid Herpes simplex virus Mouth ulcer Tattoo Gout Stomach cancer Osteoarthritis Common cold Conjunctivitis Zinc Dialysis Acne Wound healing phases Hemorrhoid Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Sunscreen Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Body piercing Scar Ultraviolet Alzheimer's disease Sunlight Breastfeeding Otitis externa Skin Crohn's disease Massage Milk Analgesic Eczema Migraine Tuberculosis Vitamin D First aid kit Hydrochloric acid Folic acid Tooth Essential oil Malignant melanoma Insulin Tofu Gastroesophageal reflux disease Multiple sclerosis Food preservation Herpes zoster Cirrhosis Coeliac disease Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Tooth enamel Ibuprofen Gelatin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pain Wound Blood Swimming Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Welding Hepatitis Sulfuric acid Wart Nutrition Fibromyalgia Traumatic brain injury Colorectal cancer Malaria Radiation therapy Nitroglycerin Rheumatoid arthritis Vitamin C Althaea (genus) Rosacea Urinary incontinence Cocaine Pneumonia Medicine Acetic acid Solar power Tocopherol COX-2 inhibitor Fancy rat Neuropathy Lactic acid

why do mosquito bites itch more when they are exposed to hot water hi mosey bites itch more when exposed to hot water because of the nerve endings the mosey bite has already caused an allergic reaction on the skin causing it to itch when hot water touches the skin the body sends blood to the surface of the skin which causes the skin to itch so combine the two together and you get one complete itchy mess to help take an antihistamine piriton works really well especially before bed as the heat of the bed clothes will have the same reaction and apply ice cubes to the affected area it really is soothing also wear cotton clothes over the affected area if poss as this helps the skin to breath properly hope it stops itching soon  Eczema Psoriasis Urticaria Mosquito Allergy Tattoo Itch Scabies Conjunctivitis Rosacea Fecal incontinence Chlorpromazine Hyperthermia Tarantula Angioedema Scar First aid Decompression sickness Mastocytosis Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Acne Lyme disease Malaria Sauna Insulin Swimming Rash Callus Drowning Autoimmune diseases 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Wound Crab louse Massage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sento Nitroglycerin Common cold Erogenous zone Pneumonia Local anesthesia Happy Tree Friends Bedbug Hiking Mattress Undergarment Anaphylaxis Clothing Vampire Sulfasalazine Jock itch Sulfuric acid Anopheles Carbon dioxide Hypothermia Latex allergy Asthma Fire fighting Water Onchocerciasis Tofu Hiccup Loa loa filariasis Ice hockey Cramp Multiple chemical sensitivity Diving suit Electroshock gun Doxepin Diving Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Wax play Weathering Explosive material Drill bit Siphon Dualism (philosophy of mind) Sweating Homeostasis Corrosion Cephalexin Ringworm Aspartame Group A streptococcal infection Temperature Nasal congestion Enzyme Gastroesophageal reflux disease Tick Final Fantasy magic Bleeding House dust mite Menstrual cycle Reflexology Treehouse of Horror XV

i have poison ivy from the tops of my feet to my hips how can i get rid of it and or stop it from spreading i heard chlorine helps clean it up can i go in a pool i live on a farm and poison ivy is every where i only got it once before and it was just a few little bumps and they didnt itch that much but now i have big splotches all up my legs oh do you have my sympathy i've gotten into it times this year there are a lot of products that work well for me after the second time of getting into it i finally did some research on effective products chlorine won't necessarily clean it up but will dry it out there's a product called tecnu that is really good burt's bees makes a poison ivy soap one of the main ingredients is jewelweed which is an old time remedy jewelweed actually grows near poison ivy tall ish plant with green leaves with orange yellow trumpet like flowers cvs also makes a poison ivy soap but it did nothing for me i've learned the hard way about getting into it and have found that i absolutely must stay away from it make sure that you wash everything that has come into contact with it including gloves and garden tools do not burn the plant getting it into your lungs can kill you and a pharmacist told me years ago that you can even get into it in the winter as the oils will be in the snow where it grows you can use chemicals to get rid of it but we've found the best way is to pull it up making sure to follow the underground roots it grows just under the surface and will sprout up in many locations from one central location taking benadryl or generic product will help with the itching although it might make you sleepy and no it's not contagious to another person although people will avoid you once they see the rash it's the urishol oils in the poison ivy that cause the rash another person cannot get the rash from you unless still have the fresh oils on your skin which is highly doubtful  Chlorine Poison-ivy Eczema Dandruff Weed control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Perfume Rash Aloe Psoriasis Sulfuric acid Poison Scabies Japanese tea ceremony Escherichia coli O157:H7 Soap Chemical warfare Leather Tattoo Fire fighting Yarrow Ivy Poison Ivy (comics) Cheese Carbon dioxide Hemp Toxicodendron Comfrey Allergy Cannabis (drug) Peanut Sewage treatment Hay fever Disinfection Dioxin Renewable energy Essential oil Diving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Use of poison gas in World War I Body piercing Flax Vegetarianism Cigarette Fancy rat Shampoo Eucalyptus Urticaria Organic farming Wound Cannabis cultivation Sento Veganism Mosquito Kosher foods Textile manufacturing Mango Jute Drowning Maize Stinging nettle Rose Hydrochloric acid Prostate cancer Pesticide Stomach cancer Energy development Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bong Foodborne illness Tobacco Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Smallpox Group A streptococcal infection Water purification Plastic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Doxepin Carnivorous plant Dishwasher Diaper Ringworm Kava Callus Fruit tree propagation Shrek 2

can i cure this skin problem on my nose without surgery i'm in florida it's a common ailment here first it was a bleeder then a bump then skin roughed up further on the nose i know doctors around here like to cut and chop on those but are there any alternatives they say it's skin cancer and if i don't have surgery on it now and then i might die well why don't people in other locations get it then they do get skin cancers especially in coastal areas my mother and step father have both had cancers removed from their forearms both are avid fishermen and spend a lot of time on the water in the sun as far as i know they really have to remove the cancerous cells from your skin to prevent further growth and spreading removing plugs as they call it is generally considered the best means of doing this when dealing with skin cancer i don't think they'd waste their time with any other treatment since removal would solve the problem and the meds and procedures associated w cancer treatment are not very good for us to use unnecessarily spending as much time in the sun w o appropriate coverage and block re applied as needed skin cancer is part of the risk you take living where you are just like learning protecting oneself from frostbite and hypothermia in minnesota in the winter is part of living there  Cancer Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Malignant melanoma Stomach cancer Colorectal cancer Acne Lung cancer Ultraviolet Hiking Psoriasis Breast cancer Metastasis Eczema Cervical cancer Mesothelioma Cancer of the larynx Fecal incontinence Publicly funded medicine Hypothermia Pneumonia Scar Medical analysis of circumcision Oncology Actinic keratosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human skin color Tuberculosis Intersex surgery Urinary incontinence Allergy Radiation therapy Renal cell carcinoma Folic acid Testicular cancer Keloid Organ transplant Cephalic disorder Phimosis Circumcision Soft tissue sarcoma Plastic surgery Esophageal cancer Equine conformation Sunburn Penile cancer Tobacco smoking Wound History of male circumcision Sunscreen Genital wart Skin Dialysis Manicure Herpes simplex virus Ovarian cancer Tattoo Chemotherapy Stem cell Common cold Androgen insensitivity syndrome Surgery Acupuncture AIDS Endometriosis Nuclear power Brain tumor Stroke Baldness Sewage treatment Human papillomavirus Skin graft Smallpox Skin cancer Breastfeeding Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Decompression sickness Childbirth Bacteria Adjustable gastric band Alternative medicine Acromegaly Experimental cancer treatment Transsexuality STS-114 Growth hormone treatment Dentistry Abortion debate Comfrey Castration Depilation Vitamin D Theory of conduct Asbestos Cryptorchidism

why do insect bites feel better after you itch them i have been bitten a few times over the last couple of days on my ankles and feet why oh why is it such a relief when you actually itch them although after a while they itch even more insects pump chemicals into the skin to stop us reacting to them as they pump away our blood part of the chemical stops the blood clotting the other numbs the spot down to prevent us swotting the insect as it feeds i am talking about bites from insects midges gnats mosquitoes flies fleas mites ticks and bedbugs as opposed to stings wasps bees and hornets the sting is due to venom like a poison which the insect 'injects' into the skin you may not notice the bite although some insect bites can be quite painful particularly from a horsefly however saliva from the insect can cause a skin reaction a weal which is like a small fluid filled lump and is very itchy it may develop immediately after being bitten a weal lasts about two hours but is often followed by a small itchy solid lump papule which develops up to hours later this can last for several days before fading away these lumps occur when our body attacks this saliva and that causes the itching to start when you scratch you spread the chemicals away from the bite under your skin and they numb new areas of skin before being attacked again by our body but now you have spread the chemicals to a wider area so its more intense also the act of touching reduces the signals reaching the brain about that region of skin touch uses the same system of nerves and the brain now has two different sources to play with thus the itching is also reduced as the brain cumilates the data once you stop touching the spot the brain is free to concentrate back on the sole source of data comming in from your nerve ends of the skin that was bitten occasionally a skin infection develops following a bite particularly if you scratch a lot which can damage the skin and allow bacteria germs to get in infection causes redness and tenderness around the bite this may gradually spread and sometimes can become serious antihistamines tablets may be useful if you have lots of bites you can buy these at pharmacies or get them on prescription antihistamines block the action of histamine this is a chemical which is released in sites of skin reactions and contributes to the itch and inflammation individual bites can be treated with crotamiton ointment which you can buy at pharmacies is soothing when rubbed onto itchy skin a steroid cream may be useful to reduce any inflammation for example hydrocortisone which you can buy at pharmacies or get on prescription a doctor may prescribe a stronger steroid cream in some cases  Itch Spider Acne Hay fever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Scabies Group A streptococcal infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Intravenous therapy Hematophagy Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Rosacea Asthma Gout Urinary incontinence Puberty Pneumonia Pain Insulin Prostate cancer First aid Wound healing phases Mast cell Medical prescription Stroke Bedbug Multiple sclerosis Malaria Tattoo Local anesthesia Carpal tunnel syndrome Cancer Common cold Autoimmune diseases Fecal incontinence Fertility awareness Cocaine Radiation therapy Mastocytosis Paracetamol Homeopathy Cellulitis Chlorpromazine Glucocorticoid Methamphetamine Tick Inflammation Decompression sickness Poison Fibromyalgia Rabies Urticaria Enzyme Epidural Breastfeeding Histamine Insect Gypsy moth Angioedema Eye Massage Lupus erythematosus Folic acid Tarantula Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Migraine Biological pest control Clinical depression Doxepin Scar Honeybee Heartworm Medical analysis of circumcision Onchocerciasis Anthrax Otitis externa Herpes zoster Medicine Herpes simplex virus Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Tocopherol Antihistamine Fancy rat Diabetes mellitus

i have one single raised bump on my lip it's exactly like a big bite because it became swollen and now itches or burns but the placement is so exact that i just can't be sure the bump is on the left side of my top lip exactly where a cold sore would be except it's completely different or at least i think i've never had a cold sore but i know they usually drain and this is just a bump its red and a little uncomfortable could it be that it's a bug bite and lips are really sensitive because it's been two days and the skin is still feels a tiny bit numb and slightly swollen any ideas of what it could be oh and by the way it's not herpes think raised bump thanks a cold sore usually tingles more when it is in the development phase what you are describing sounds more like a routine pimple except on the lipline you would feel some numbness because of the way the lip is wired in for sensation it's also not unusual for pimples on the lipline to cause swelling in the lip in the area it could be a bug bite but most bugs don't really care to get that up close and personal to you and the face is pretty sensitive so it's hard for them to do most biting insects prefer a less sensitive area i'd suggest applying moist heat to the spot use a damp clean washcloth heated in the microwave hot as you can stand as often as you can apply it it will make things look redder and more swollen at first as more blood supply shows up to fight you may also notice slightly more numbness and pain as well with heat if it's a pimple you should notice it begin to form the familiar whitehead in a day or so just keep applying the heat until it drains when that happens the pain numbness and swelling will usually go away pretty quickly in the meantime avoid lipstick and makeup in the area also fight the urge to poke prod or squeeze a pimple in that area can rupture beneath the skin quite easily and infect the inside of the mouth and lip you can also bruise that area a lot easier than other places and it will hurt like you wouldn't believe heat will also soothe it it if becomes obviously a cold sore it may take a day or so more before you can say with certainty which it's going to be if it seems not to be doing the usual pimple formation then you can find medicines that will help with a cold sore and if it's not identifiyable in a couple days then a trip to the doctor might be in order to determine exactly what is going on my money is on it being a pimple in an odd spot they do happen there just not as common as other locations on the face  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Acne Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Herpes simplex virus Oral sex Equine conformation Thermoregulation Mosquito Stomach cancer Group A streptococcal infection Penis Carpal tunnel syndrome Urinary incontinence Cocaine Poker jargon Prostate cancer Strap-on dildo Tattoo Conjunctivitis Radiation therapy Erogenous zone Diabetic retinopathy Bruise Skin Dialysis Sento Body piercing Drill bit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diving Lyme disease Surveillance Aconitum Androgen insensitivity syndrome Vacuum tube Lip balm Mattress Welding Pain Malaria Gout Fecal incontinence Glossary of partner dance terms Chronic fatigue syndrome Unreal Professional wrestling slang Fancy rat Stroke Aerial (dance move) Rosacea Violin Intravenous therapy Volleyball Common cold Snake Conspiracy (TNG episode) Social rule Hamster Smallpox Trumpet Massage Menstrual cup Keloid Hay fever Herpes zoster Theory of conduct Cellulitis Goose bumps 2000 Australian Grand Prix AFI 100 Years series Essential oil Loudspeaker Transmission (medicine) Pneumonia Sense Epidural Skateboarding trick Tick Cat Addiction Bong Virus Dairy Humphrey Bogart Dundas Square Boom Town (Doctor Who) Self-harm Domestic rabbit Time Out of Mind Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders

dark patches around mouth patches around my mouth on the top and bottom and its completely noticable compared to the rest of my face im thinking it might be because i use nair on my upper lip and it could be because of that if it is can the dermotologist give me anything to remove it ive stopped using the nair recently but is there a way i can actually permanently remove it edit it could take a few days for the patches to disappear so be patient if they're still there after a week then go see a doctor it could be an allergic reaction to the nair if that's the case then a dermatologist can only recommend that you stop using the nair i think that you should find some other method of hair removal  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Tattoo Acne Eczema Scar Stomach cancer Embouchure Maprotiline Prostate cancer Lupus erythematosus Nair Malignant melanoma Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hangul Syphilis Baldness treatments Bong Body piercing Pubic hair Drug test Urticaria Dentures Antihistamine Radiation therapy Hay fever Chlorpromazine Clomipramine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Baldness Medical analysis of circumcision Psychiatric hospital Oral sex Mouth ulcer Laser hair removal Ulcerative colitis Terri Schiavo Drowning Haloperidol Skin Harmonica Breast cancer Coeliac disease Depilation Adjustable gastric band Insulin Casting Tuberous sclerosis Myocardial infarction Breech birth Hair Doxepin The Inside Medical prescription Alopecia areata Tasmanian Devil Amineptine Patch (computing) Poker jargon Double bass Antipsychotic Tooth Bladderwort Vitiligo Computer virus Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Windows XP Trimipramine 1957 World Series Asthma Hair coloring Matriarchy Dexamethasone Rosacea Pools of Darkness Journey (band) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Epilepsy Multiple chemical sensitivity Promethazine Wisdom teeth System Shock 2 Shock Guinea pig Ebola Thermoregulation Capecitabine Melanin Chiropractic Charles Ives Gag (BDSM) Propranolol Violin Folic acid Mink Sleep apnea Obstetrics
