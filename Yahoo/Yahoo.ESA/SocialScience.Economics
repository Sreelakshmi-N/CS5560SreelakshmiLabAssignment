as the rich get richer does that necessarily mean that the poor and middle class get poorer from econ governments and banks must limit the amount of in circulation because the more there is the less it's worth so if we have more millionaires becoming billionaires aren't they are taking bigger slices of the same pie put another way if a company pays a ceo bonus out of its profits then employees don't get bonus whether or not their work was necessary to produce the profit or let's say bill gates gets profit for every sale of a software package he earns but million people then have less and in a few years will probably have to spend it again to upgrade as it becomes obsolete maybe bill gates was a bad example i certainly didn't mean to imply that there's something wrong with buying the powerful software but will it put food on the family as a certain politico would say if i bought million worth of software and didn't have enough left over to buy food and pay the rent would i still be wealthy i think you should move onto econ the whole money economic pie idea is a joke let me give you a scenario if you have a millionaire in your community that was also philanthropic and gave money to the schools churches etc and that also sat in on boards of economic development or what have you for that particular city does he she take from the pie at that point or is he she making more pies for the money to redistribute itself now let's look at the concept of being paid what you design it's called a right to ownership this also applies to owners of a corporation such as bill gates he may not be the sole designer of all the microsoft products anymore but he still owns the producing corporation all of it's factories and so forth so the concept is the same what you create or what you own you should be paid for that's what free enterprise is about i find it to be interesting how it's always employees that reference the infernal pie economic scale as a means to supplant the wealthy and how entrepeneurs always understand that there is no pie but there are bakeries for lack of a better word though i truly can understand where you're coming from with this i used to despise the wealthy it's one of those things that happens with you grow up in a common'wealth' and all of it's political corruption with primo examples of wealthy and dirt broke with no middle class and used this pie example all the time now that i've been educated on how real economics and free enterprise actually works through working directly with millionaires i understand that all the rhetoric and theory my business and economics profressor's taught me in college just simply isn't true  Microeconomics Wealth Economic inequality Anarchism and capitalism Flat tax Surplus value American individualist anarchism Tax Public policy Productive and unproductive labour Gross domestic product Wealth condensation Privatization Intellectual property Inflation Labor theory of value Bill Gates Stock Amway Microsoft Socialist economics Commodity FairTax Ashton-Tate Socialism Law of value Karl Marx Political economy Property (ownership right) Copyleft Primitive accumulation of capital Criticisms of socialism Ownership Andrew Carnegie Keynesian economics Democracy Wheel of Fortune George Soros Enron Corporation Free trade Unemployment Criticism of libertarianism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Warren Buffett Monopoly (game) Trickle down effect CPU design Millionaire New Deal W.

econ question explain what allocative efficiency is and how it is achieved in pure competition allocative efficiency simply means that everyone who wants what is being produced given the supply and demand curve gets it in a sense it means that there is no social dead weight loss in a market scenario this is achieved in a perfect competition because the price and quantity of the product produced is at the market equilibrium price is at the marginal cost for producers meaning as much of a product is being produced as is economically plausible and the lowest possible economically efficient price given the current consumer demand curve so both producers and consumers are satisfied  Supply and demand Economics Microeconomics Labour economics Monopoly Law of value Neoclassical economics Welfare economics Capitalism General equilibrium Externality Natural monopoly Austrian School Tariff Commodity Inflation Monopsony Stackelberg competition Keynesian economics Free market Deflation (economics) Monopolistic competition Bertrand competition Labor theory of value Price discrimination Cournot competition Marginal cost Future energy development Supply-side economics Surplus product Efficiency wages Prices of production Tax Profit maximization Subsidy Political economy Common Agricultural Policy Marginalism Criticisms of socialism Production, costs, and pricing Hydrogen economy Socialist economics Privatization Free trade Price Strategic management Progressive tax Anarchist economics Biodiesel Production possibility frontier Anarchism and capitalism Experience curve effects East Germany Aggregate demand Pricing Competition Gross domestic product Value FairTax Economic equilibrium Incentive Agricultural policy Real estate economics Theory of the firm Fusion power Labor-power Opportunity cost Capital accumulation Surplus value Electricity market Economic rent Monetarism Scarcity Economy of India Profit Management information system Production theory basics Exchange value Alcohol fuel Economic shortage Capital asset pricing model 1973 oil crisis Inefficiency Use value Oil depletion Value added tax Capital controversy Economics glossary Behavioral finance Hubbert peak theory Energy development Robin Hahnel

econ question why does the short run marginal cost curve eventually increase for the typical firm in general terms marginal cost at each level of production includes any additional costs required to produce the next unit if producing additional vehicles requires for example building a new factory the marginal cost of those extra vehicles includes the cost of the new factory in practice the analysis is segregated into short and long run cases and over the longest run all costs are marginal at each level of production and time period being considered marginal costs include all costs which vary with the level of production and other costs are considered fixed costs a long run cost function describes the cost of production as a function of output assuming that all inputs are obtained at current prices that current technology is employed and everything is being built new from scratch in view of the durability of many capital items this textbook concept is less useful than one which allows for some scrapping of existing capital items or the acquisition of new capital items to be used with the existing stock of capital items acquired in the past long run marginal cost then means the additional cost or the cost saving per unit of additional or reduced production including the expenditure on additional capital goods or any saving from disposing of existing capital goods note that marginal cost upwards and marginal cost downwards may differ in contrast with marginal cost according to the less useful textbook concept  Production theory basics Microeconomics Labour economics Production function Economics Inflation Opportunity cost Neoclassical economics Supply and demand Monopsony Marginal cost Tax Monopoly Keynesian economics Law of value Gross domestic product Transformation problem Productive and unproductive labour Real estate economics Capitalism Production possibility frontier Natural monopoly Welfare economics Anarchism and capitalism Theory of the firm Capital controversy Management information system Commodity Economic growth Surplus value Waste management Monetary policy Externality FairTax Anarchist economics Capital accumulation Marginalism Function (mathematics) Economy of Russia Gold standard Political economy Intellectual property Solar cell Profit maximization Consumption of fixed capital Light rail Organic composition of capital Islamic banking Oscilloscope Free trade Corporate finance Principal-agent problem Unemployment Exogenous growth model United Kingdom corporation tax Economic calculation problem Information Services Procurement Library Model (economics) Diminishing returns Wealth Deflation (economics) Measures of national income and output Solar power satellite Intermediate consumption Heckscher-Ohlin model Fuel injection Compensation of employees Privatization Value added tax Labor-power Progressive tax De Lorean DMC-12 Constant capital Digital circuit Insurance Grid energy storage Future energy development Economic rent Economy of India Public good Production, costs, and pricing Growth theory Battery electric vehicle Application-specific integrated circuit Algorithm Trade union Taxation in the United States Alcohol fuel Hyperinflation

is there some sort of a movement underway to destroy the united states economy i don't know how many of you have noticed but the price for a barrel of crude has now creeped above less than away from that until now only talked about mark with that said do you realize that if some sort of major geo political event took place and suddenly drove the price up to a barrel the u s economy would be destroyed overnight now i know the that the price we pay at the pump is largely market driven but don't these greedy b who control these markets realize that if they destroy the economy there won't be a market left for them to manipulate and furthermore do you think they even care afterall most of them have already made their millions on the backs of the everyday consumer but i guess they just want more and more huh for nc if the price for a gallon of gas would rise to even the level i'd probably have to declare bankruptcy and i suspect that there are millions of others out there in the same boat as me so what do you say to that the occam razor suggests that there is no such movement simulation modeling of a commodity market where investments are large and irreversible and the finished product is not perishable suggests that the market should behave the way it does even in the complete absence of collusion if you are good at math this could be an interesting read fridrik m baldursson modelling the price of industrial commodities economic modelling volume issue august pages abstract the theory of irreversible investment under uncertainty and the theory of competitive storage are combined in a rational expectations model of the price formation of industrial commodities in continuous time an endogenous price zone arises from the opening and closure of capacity at boundaries of the price zone dynamics of the price process within the price zone are determined by competitive speculation the model is scaled to the dimensions of the aluminium market and solved numerically simulated prices and inventories exhibit characteristics similar to the real series volatile prices asymmetric adjustment of production to price changes and long inventory cycles end of quote also before you moan about the supposedly tough life in the u s take a hard look at europe where gasoline prices on any given day are more than twice as high as they are in the u s japanese gas prices are not far behind either so if the movement you are alluding to does exist its primary targets must be europe and japan not the u s  Microeconomics Supply and demand Capital accumulation Labor theory of value Keynesian economics Petroleum Law of value Free trade 1973 oil crisis Economy of the United States Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Economy of Nigeria E85 Deflation (economics) Nuclear power Hydrogen economy Commodity markets Prices of production Natural monopoly Supply-side economics Gold standard Capitalism Economy of the People's Republic of China Alcohol fuel Gasoline Hubbert peak theory Hyperinflation Economy of Japan Economic relations of Japan Economy of Russia Monetary policy Economy of Kuwait Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economy of the United Arab Emirates Bretton Woods system Exchange value Tax Monopoly Kyoto Protocol Surplus value Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina Gross domestic product Economy of Ghana Economy of Pakistan Money Asian financial crisis Mutual fund Biodiesel Economy of Romania Euro Say's law Economy of Chile Commodity Economy of Peru Labor-power Management information system Economy of Venezuela Futures contract Hurricane Rita Carburetor Strategic management Hard disk Economy of Brazil Economy of Belgium Economy of Norway Economy of Africa Eugene Fama Economy of the Netherlands Future energy development CPU design Just In Time Heckscher-Ohlin model Karl Marx Technical analysis Economy of Germany Balassa-Samuelson effect Model (economics) Great Depression Emergence Economy of Georgia Bond Oil depletion Diamond Implications of peak oil Monetarism Neoclassical economics Solar system

what does vietnam spend its budget on does anyone know or have a link to somewhere that shows the categorical expenditures of vietnam's budget i researched this information a couple years ago but i lost the resources that i found so i will have to give you what i know off the top of my head vietnam's communist government is not a trusted source for actual revenue and expenditures because the previous administration was renowned for pocketing government funds for their own self interests furthermore there are numerous state run businesses that are quite profitable and add to the government's overall profit and loss another answer you received is obviously incorrect concerning vietnam's military spending vietnam military expenditure is relatively low compared to other countries i believe military expense was about or less than half of a b bomber the largest government expenditure is energy vietnam doesn't produce enough electricity to sustain itself and imports most of it from china lots of money has been spent and will be spent on improving domestic energy production in trying to keep up with their rapidly increasing economy transportation is supposed to be a large expenditure in vietnam as roads and and mass transportation is highly inadequate however the former transportation minister had siphoned much of his expenditures and payoffs for his personal use lots of money is spent on influencing foreign business and money to operate and invest in vietnam foreign companies are the preferred employers because they pay better and provide more opportunity for advancement i know the information i've provided is a bit vague and general but i hope this will help you find more specific information that you're looking for  Economy of India Economy of Pakistan Economy of Nigeria Microeconomics Economy of Russia Inflation Economy of Venezuela Tax Economy of Norway Economy of Ghana United Kingdom corporation tax Nuclear power Social Security (United States) Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of South Africa Bretton Woods system People's Republic of China Privatization Economy of Singapore Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Free trade Coalition Provisional Authority Great Depression Insurance Energy development Economy of Belgium Measures of national income and output Deficit spending FairTax Economy of the Czech Republic History of the United States (1980-1988) Vietnam Capitalism Economy of Chile History of the United States (1918-1945) Finance Economy of Sierra Leone Indian Railways Future energy development Economy of Greece Life insurance Hyperinflation Government debt Economy of the United States Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economy of Colombia Manitoba Hydro Publicly funded medicine Economy of Belize Economic history of Japan Marshall Plan Economy of Trinidad and Tobago Economy of Mexico Oil boom Economy of Peru History of North Korea Celtic Tiger Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Economy of Iceland Economy of Egypt Niger Income trust Economy of Romania Economy of the Central African Republic Economy of Rwanda Surplus value Margaret Thatcher Economy of Fiji Toronto-Dominion Bank Microcredit Economy of Nepal Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Cuba Amtrak Economy of Bahrain Capital accumulation VIA Rail Corporate finance PE ratio Canadian and American economies compared Economy of Taiwan Reaganomics Economy of Sri Lanka Economy of the People's Republic of China Alcohol fuel Supply-side economics Poker jargon Economy of Lithuania

economics help i have an economics exam tonight i am studying for and will have a question similar to this one i am lost on this can someone help i cant figure out how to draw the graphs on the computer either which we will do in class here is the example question p g and the purex co meet in vegas to form a laundry detergent cartel a illustrate graphically how the cartel would be administered regarding price and output b do you think this laundry cartel would be stable c the westport company decides to manufacture laundry detergent and is invited to join the cartel how would this very efficient producer affect the cartel agreement modify your cartel graph to show the change well it's difficult to draw graphs in this little answer box so i will forego that and instead try to offer you some helpful suggestions a cartels operate just like monopolies they try to maximize profits the profit maximizing price and quantity comes at the output level where marginal revenue mr equals marginal cost mc market equilibrium the intersection of the supply and demand curves always occurs at the perfect competition solution where price p equals mc the monopoly solution will always be at a higher price and lower quantity than the competitive solution note the curves do not shift b cartels are theoretically extremely unstable why first of all they are illegal that means leaving a paper trail is very unwise and so most occurances of cartels involve under the table deals and or verbal contracts obviously these illegal contracts are not legally binding as a result each firm in a cartel has great economic incentive to undercut its partners a small amount with a lower price and steal the entire market share thus taking all of the profits one can see however that if this continued eventually both firms would undercut each other until they reached the point where p mc which is the competitive solution and the cartel has essentially been destroyed c naturally an efficient producer has lower costs than its competitors implying a lower marginal cost this will in turn change where the monopolistic solution of mr mc is also having a lower cost be a part of the cartel shifts the supply curve to the right as well as the monopolistic quantity i believe however that the price of the cartel will still remain the same but profits will be higher with the lower cost  Price discrimination Externality Monopsony Inflation Keynesian economics Privatization Capitalism Profit maximization Tariff Illegal drug trade Cournot competition Economics Production function Bertrand competition Welfare economics Free trade Law of value Stackelberg competition Monetary policy Efficiency wages Prices of production Tax Model (economics) Labor theory of value Profit Monopolistic competition Public good Neoclassical economics Progressive tax Coercive monopoly Incentive Principal-agent problem Opportunity cost Perfect competition Oligopoly American individualist anarchism Phillips curve Transformation problem Supply-side economics Airline Anarchism and capitalism Criticisms of socialism Capital controversy Predatory pricing Surplus value Production theory basics FairTax Experience curve effects Free market Economic growth Commodity Economy of Russia Gold standard Contract Hubbert peak theory Theory of the firm Trade union Arbitrage Competition Production possibility frontier Intellectual property AMD Enzyme Strategic management Economic history of Britain Outsourcing Nuclear fusion Dynamical system DVD Exchange value Antitrust Collusion Nuclear power Reaganomics Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Space elevator Management information system Labor-power Future energy development Internal ballistics Glossary of graph theory Government-granted monopoly Exogenous growth model United States Postal Service Wal-Mart

what type of market is best for profit perfectly competitive markets oligopoly or monoplies the above answers are not correct economic theory states that firms operating in markets other than perfectly competive markets will be able to price their products above marginal cost but this does not mean they will earn economic profits indeed an oligopoly or a monopoly will need to spend money to protect their markets theory suggests that these firms will be willing to spend up to the amount of their excess profits which means that economic profits will be driven to zero this would be true even if the law protected these firms the firms would lobby politicians which costs money this is just another mechanism to drive economic profits to zero  Monopoly Microeconomics Perfect competition Capitalism Supply and demand Oligopoly Monopsony Natural monopoly Profit Stackelberg competition Labour economics Competition Privatization Public good Free trade Labor theory of value Externality Predatory pricing Law of value Price discrimination Capital accumulation Profit maximization Inflation Intellectual property Economic inequality Coercive monopoly Insurance Economics Tariff Price war Capital controversy Tax Bertrand competition American individualist anarchism Monetary policy Surplus value Criticisms of socialism Publicly funded medicine Exploitation Keynesian economics Prices of production Capitalist mode of production Theory of the firm Monopolistic competition Efficiency wages Marginal cost Bank Experience curve effects Production function Economy of the United States Incentive Strategic management New Deal Islamic banking Network effect Gross domestic product Transformation problem Social cost Economy of Russia Collusion Model (economics) Planned obsolescence Antitrust Corporation Government-granted monopoly Outsourcing Economy of India Johann Heinrich von Th__nen Socialist economics Investment bank History of the United States (1918-1945) United States v.

what are the factors that can affect the economic growth a land factors natural resource endowments if a country has diamonds or oil etc it helps but the land factor is not enough to give growth on its own and it is the least important of the growth factors b labour factors labour skills and abilities education and training the more of these the better for growth but it should be of the right kind india for example has been accused of training far too many lawyers and not enough agricultural specialists labour enthusiasm or motivation the more of this the better for growth however it is not easy to know how to stimulate motivation declaring war on someone usually seems to increase it although the british invasion of iraq did notseem to be popular or have a motivational effect labour numbers the more the better if they have the skills etc and the country does not start out with a large labour surplus more workers are less useful in china or india than they would be in the uk or the usa managers ability training and enthusiasm the higher the better c capital factors more machinery and equipment good for growth higher rates of investment good for growth because it means more machines etc will be available remember that social investment like docks and harbourscan pay off too higher rates of saving good for growth because the country can invest more in the short term it could harm output if it means that consumers are suddenly not spending as much but it is generally good for the long term technical progress good for growth and is the main source of growth in rich developed countries  Capital accumulation Gross domestic product Surplus value Capitalism Free trade Wealth Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Industrial Revolution Economy of Belgium Economy of Africa Economic growth Keynesian economics Economic relations of Japan Economy of Romania Economy of Singapore Microeconomics Economy of Chile Economic inequality Exogenous growth model Labor theory of value Economy of Russia Economy of South Africa Economy of Norway Tax Progressive tax Division of labour Monetary policy Unemployment Future energy development Economy of Venezuela Economy of India Economic history of Japan Surplus product Economy of Pakistan Economy of the United States Celtic Tiger Economy of Fiji Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Nigeria Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plantation Economy of Israel Economy of the Philippines Production theory basics Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Nepal Supply-side economics Economy of the United Arab Emirates Minimum wage Economic history of Britain Economic development Labour economics Deflation (economics) Economy of Cuba Five-Year Plan Economy of Papua New Guinea Education in the People's Republic of China Technology Economy of North Korea East Asian Tigers Green Revolution Economic history of Spain Constant capital Labor-power Economy of Taiwan Socialist economics Famine Capital (economics) Economy of Argentina Law of value Exploitation Reaganomics Economy of Japan History of North Korea Trade union Commodity Economy of Finland Monopoly History of the United States (1918-1945) Human capital Economy of the Netherlands Economy of Ghana Sustainable agriculture Economy of Asia Capitalist mode of production Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Deforestation Tariff Education Economy of Mexico Prices of production

how does comparative advantage exist today another question i dont get comparative advantage ricardo's principle relies on a variety of implicit assumptions that are debatable such as that there is no or a low cost for transportation and that the advantages of increased production outweigh externalities such as environmental contamination or social inequities opponents of free trade often point out that globalized communications and transportation unavailable in ricardo's time invalidate the assumption of capital immobility and cause capital to gravitate toward absolute advantage though proponents would point out that modern low cost transportation only makes the assumption more sound it has also been argued that comparative advantage may reduce economic diversity to risky levels free trade advocates would dissent however and say that modernization has decreased transportation and logistics costs through inventions such as the airplane or the internet which were unavailable in ricardo's time making his theory ever increasingly sound furthermore despite the increased movement of capital differences in capacities of production are still wide in fact free trade creates a wider gap of production in many areas despite the larger increases it makes in absolute wealth in theory as long as a country has one more worker one more machine or one extra source of natural resources comparative advantage will still apply as to perfect competition supporters of free trade claim that perfect competition is the result of universal free trade not its precondition for free trade advocates comparative advantage is what a capitalist country must embrace to gain an advantage in an existing mercantilist world on a final note gottfried haberler showed in the s that ricardo's thinking on comparative advantage could also be expressed in neoclassical terms of opportunity cost  Economics Law of value Political economy Microeconomics Economic inequality Liberalism Labor theory of value Intellectual property Neoclassical economics Supply and demand Wealth Economic growth Model (economics) Heckscher-Ohlin model Balassa-Samuelson effect Left-wing politics Democracy Sociocultural evolution Organic farming Postmodernism Trade Keynesian economics Capital accumulation American individualist anarchism Goodness and value theory Comparative advantage Prices of production History of economic thought Minimum wage Socialism Free market Inflation Neoliberalism Publicly funded medicine Privatization Strategic management Productive and unproductive labour Anarchist economics FairTax Supply-side economics Libertarianism Mercantilism Growth theory Exploitation Monopoly World government Unemployment Adam Smith Division of labour Ethics Criticisms of socialism Petroleum Austrian School Transformation problem Anarchism and capitalism Energy development Tariff Criticism of libertarianism Gross domestic product Economy of Africa The Wealth of Nations Biodiversity Technocratic movement Surplus product Fair trade Anarchism and society Progressive tax Culture Determinism Marginalism Voter turnout Conservatism Economic history of Britain Affirmative action David Ricardo Intellectual capital Surplus value Commodity markets Cultural relativism Anti-globalization Socialist economics Overpopulation Labour economics Freedom of speech CPU cache Anarchism Economy of Norway Trade union Non-aggression principle

should economics be moved to business finance section i know universities are split on ones that put economics in the school of business and some put it in the school of social science which do think is more appropriate the answer lies in the definition of economics if economics is defined as study of nature properties laws composition and classification of wealth economics becomes a true material science it becomes a mirror image of chemistry unfortunately economics is defined as study of mankind in the ordinary business of life this definition gives importance to application of wealth and ignores nature properties composition laws and classification of wealth therfore economics is a social science had the economists thought of underlying principle of double entry book keeping i e law of conservation of wealth which states that wealth can neither be created nor be destroyed but can be changed from one form to another we would not have seen chapter titled creation of wealth in economics economists say that wealth is one that has value in use and value in exchange in financial statements we come across terms like loss depreciation goodwill that may may not have value in exchange are they not wealth if they are not why are they shown in financial statements if loss is not wealth why is measured in units of wealth what are the units of non wealth if loss is wealth what is the use of inserting words value in exchange in the definition of wealth can law of conservation and law of equilibrium operate independent of one another are equivalent weight of chemistry and price of economics same when matter changes from one form to another we call it chemical reaction what is term for cahnge of wealth from one form to another economics is a pure material science but we have not studied it on the lines of chemistry chemistry is study of nature properties laws composition and classification of matter  Economics Chemistry Science Wealth Capitalism Political economy Thermodynamics Biodiversity Entropy Temperature Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surplus value Productive and unproductive labour Mass Logic Free market Intellectual property Model (economics) Physical science Property (ownership right) Physics The Wealth of Nations Self-organization Supply and demand Public policy Transformation problem Many-worlds interpretation Constitution of India Labor theory of value Software engineering Soil science Dynamical system Corporate governance Organic chemistry Mathematics of general relativity Explosive material Insurance Gross domestic product Keynesian economics Free trade Scientific method G__del's incompleteness theorem Emergence Liberalism Intelligent design History of chemistry Philosophy of language Prices of production Special relativity Philosophy of mathematics Quantum mechanics Clifford algebra Species Materials science Jewish principles of faith Causality Phase (matter) Lattice (order) Mineral Ethics Coercion Anarchism and capitalism Republic Atomism Energy Game theory Chinese University of Hong Kong Leasing Determinism Supernova Real number Adjoint functors Group theory Equivalence principle Function (mathematics) Gravity State Classical mechanics Estoppel Water (molecule) Category theory Petroleum Music Economy of Russia Economy of India Analytical chemistry Nuclear fusion Surplus product Tax Exchange value Commodity History of economic thought Occam's Razor

how does economy affects health in the philippines you could say that there is a correlation between economy and health by categorizing two things direct and indirect effect directly when economy is bad there will be less flow money which means people will have less money due to less jobs and slowing businesses things such as health care becomes secondary issue when people are desperate for money to get by next day not planning for next years they want to find a reliable source for steady income more than finding a hospital to spend the money that they don't have also most importantly standard of living will drop which means health for overall nation may drop as well indirectly you can say that there will be less money spent by the government or local agencies to improve the living for its citizens also infrastructures and capital investment will be slower which will ultimately effect the health  Gross domestic product Economy of the United States Publicly funded medicine People's Republic of China Government debt Capitalism Health insurance National Health Service Ethical consumerism Privatization Economy of India Tax FairTax Free trade Hyperinflation Elections in the United States Deflation (economics) Economic inequality Keynesian economics Unemployment Microeconomics Surplus value Economy of Africa Nuclear power Deficit spending Freeters Canadian and American health care systems compared Business cycle Political economy Medicare (Canada) Money supply Capital accumulation Economy of the Philippines Marshall Plan Flat tax Measures of national income and output Globalization Tax cut Debt Balassa-Samuelson effect United Kingdom corporation tax Reaganomics Human height Monetary policy Economy of Russia New Deal Asian financial crisis American Red Cross Canada Health Act Insurance Famine Israeli Arab Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Microcredit Economy of South Africa Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Information warfare Arturo Frondizi Wealth Labour economics Celtic Tiger Economy of the Republic of Ireland Corporate governance Organic farming Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Outsourcing Social Security (United States) Economic history of Japan Mixed economy Economy of Nigeria Security (finance) Consensual crime Republika Srpska IS/LM model Economy of Saudi Arabia Segregated cycle facilities Ozone depletion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mergers and acquisitions Minimum wage Coalition Provisional Authority Dot-com Social issues in the United States Warren Buffett Local food Jet engine Great Depression in the United Kingdom Sonar Monetarism Economics Bretton Woods system Bond Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Vivian Solon

ringo loves playing rock and roll at high volume ringo loves playing rock and roll at high volume luciano loves opera and hates rock and roll unfortunately they are next door neighbors in an apartment building woth paper thin walls what is the externality here what command and control policy might the landlors impose could such a policy lead to an ineffiecient outcome in this scenario the rock and roll music is the externality in the form of a cost obviously ringo gets utility from playing rock music because he likes it and luciano pays a cost of having to listen to music he does not like the optimal social outcome is found when we are able to find the length of time of ringo playing his music where the difference between his utility and luciano's cost is greatest why is this a problem ringo has no economic incentives at the moment to care about the costs his music imposes on luciano and so will play music to the amount where his utility is maximized which will most assuredly be more than the socially optimal amount the landlord can impose one of essentially two policies in this scenario he can tax ringo for playing music or he can subsidize him the only way to have the socially optimal outcome is to tax ringo for his music playing the exact amount that luciano is cost for the music playing the simulated effect then is that ringo finds his optimal level of music playing as if he were paying the same cost as luciano any other tax or any subsidy will result in an inefficient outcome although certain taxes may result in a more efficient outcome than without any tax  Microeconomics Externality Inflation Supply and demand Public good Privatization Progressive tax Tariff FairTax Monopsony Capitalism Welfare economics Free trade Corporate governance Health insurance Principal-agent problem Economic inequality Unemployment Model (economics) Subsidy Taxation in the United States Social cost Web crawler Alcohol fuel Agricultural policy Nuclear power CPU cache Minimum wage Economy of Russia Intellectual property Libertarian economic views E85 Environmental economics Economy of the United States Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Efficiency wages Keynesian economics Utilitarianism Economics Public transport Overpopulation Pigovian tax Labour economics Land use forecasting Supply-side economics East Germany Surplus value Public policy Gross domestic product Strategic management Opportunity cost Kyoto Protocol Law of value Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate finance Economy of India The Beatles' influence Bureaucracy Political economy Variable universal life insurance Nuclear power phase-out Goodness and value theory Oil boom Criticisms of socialism Trade and development Solar cell Free market Wind power Deflation (economics) Capital accumulation Game theory Insurance Unemployment types Trade Global warming Neoclassical economics Compiler optimization Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Labor-power Health care in the United States Future energy development Common Agricultural Policy Canadian and American economies compared Turbocharger Renewable energy development Social justice Fire fighting Optimization (computer science) Credit card History of Russia Education in the United States Utility Timpani Profit Behavioral finance

what is keynesian economics giving the real short answer the key to keynesian economics is the theory that the government can by the amount of government expenditures and tax policies act either to increase total gross domestic product by cutting taxes and raising expenditure i e running a deficit or to decrease total gross domestic product by raising taxes and cutting expenditure i e running a surplus in the keynesian theory by using these two tools taxes and spending the government can keep the economy going at a smoother keel minimizing both inflation and unemployment  Keynesian economics Inflation Gross domestic product Reaganomics Deficit spending Supply-side economics Economy of the United States Great Depression Aggregate demand Trickle down effect New Deal Tax cut Microeconomics Business cycle History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Russia Monetarism Economy of Pakistan Tax Economy of Ghana Fiscal policy Government debt Model (economics) Hyperinflation Tariff Measures of national income and output Economy of Norway Economy of India Say's law Unemployment Deflation (economics) Monetary policy John Maynard Keynes Labour economics Gold standard Wealth Economic history of Spain Economic history of the United States Economics Economy of Venezuela Surplus value FairTax Balanced Budget Amendment Neo-Keynesian Economics Growth theory Economy of Colombia Deficit Economy of Paraguay U.S. public debt Social Security (United States) Economy of Brunei Economy of Denmark Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of Sweden Economy of France Taxation in the United States IS/LM model Economy of El Salvador Supply and demand Economy of South Africa George W.

which states in the usa allow metric only labeling the first yard when the roman empire passed into history about six hundred years after the time of christ europe drifted into the dark ages for six or seven hundred years mankind generally made little progress with regard to standardizing measurement sometime after the magna carta was signed in the thirteenth century king edward i of england took a step forward he ordered a permanent measuring stick made of iron to serve as a master standard yardstick for the entire kingdom this master yardstick was called the iron ulna after the bone of the forearm and it was standardized as the length of a yard very close to the length of our present day yard king edward realized that constancy and permanence were the key to any standard he also decreed that the foot measure should be one third the length of the yard and the inch one thirty sixth king edward ii in reverted back to the seed concept of the ancients and passed a statute that three barleycorns round and dry make an inch however seeds as well as fingers and feet were no match for a world that soon was to emerge from the ignorance and unrefined practices of the dark ages the first meter as the scientists were experimenting in their laboratories practical tradesmen were making themselves permanent standards in during napoleon's time the french government adopted a new system of standards called the metric system based on what they called the meter the meter was supposed to be one tenth millionth the length of the distance from the north pole to the equator when measured on a straight line running along the surface of the earth through paris with the meter now determined as the basis of the metric system other linear units of the system were set up in decimal ratios with the meter with this system all units are in multiples of ten ten decimeters in a meter a hundred centimeters in a meter and a thousand millimeters in a meter in the other direction there are ten meters in a dekameter a hundred meters in a hectometer and a thousand meters in a kilometer compared to the yardstick the meter is just a little longer inches long the french government thought it had an infallible system of weights and measures that would be easy to use and would be embraced by everyone but people were accustomed to thinking in terms of yards inches pounds and quarts at first the new meter as a measure of length proved confusing most frenchmen thought in the old familiar terms doing some mental arithmetic to convert one quantity into another and after nineteen years napoleon finally was forced to renounce the metric system however in france again went back to the meter this time for good hoping to make it universal throughout the world while france was evolving the metric system england also was setting up a more scientifically accurate determination of the yard where the french relied on the assumed constancy of the earth's size as a basis for the permanency of their standards the british turned to the measured beat of the pendulum galileo already had learned the secrets of a pendulum he found that the length of time it took for a pendulum to complete a swing depended upon the length of the pendulum itself the longer the pendulum the slower it swung he also found that a pendulum a little over inches long would swing through its arc in exactly one second since a pendulum always behaves exactly the same way under the same conditions here was another unchanging distance upon which to base a standard measurement in the english parliament legalized a new standard yard which had been made in it was a brass bar containing a gold button near each end a dot was engraved in each of these two buttons these two dots were spaced exactly yard apart the same act that legalized this bar as the standard for england also made the provision that in the event it was lost or destroyed it should be replaced using the pendulum method to determine its length a few years later copies of both the english yard and the french meter standards were brought to the united states the english system of measuring was almost universally adopted in the united states in spite of repeated requests in congress there was no legal length standard in the u s until more or less authentic copies of the british copies of the yard were used as length prototypes in the treasury department decided to admit as a legal yard the distance between the lines and of a certain bronze bar inches in length bought in in england for the federal survey department when the british yard bar which was destroyed in was replaced in a new bronze copy no was sent to the united states which became the legal american yard standard converting the united states since the mid nineteenth century the united states has made several attempts at converting over to the world standard on may the united states became a charter member of the metric club having signed the original document the treaty of the meter in paris they were the only english speaking nation to do so since then nations have signed this treaty including all the major industrialized countries in the us congress passed the metric conversion act and although made with good intentions the treaties acts established institutes and passed legislation have yet to push through the change the us remains the last holdout while the rest of the world is pretty much standardized on the metric system of measurements when it comes to mandatory use the united states has company in its foot dragging great britain liberia and burma are right there along with the united states some international organizations have threatened to restrict u s imports that do not conform to metric standards and rather than trying to maintain dual inventories for domestic and foreign markets a number of u s corporations have chosen to go metric some motor vehicles farm machinery and computer equipment are now manufactured to metric specifications you will be seeing more and more of your customers in the us using the metric system in their purchases with you as their customers make more and more original specifications in metric

can anyone explain what is happening in global business today the fed is injecting new money into the economy why are they doing this how do interest rates relate to this why is the stock market going down because of this who if anyone does all of this help what is the prognosis they are basically injecting money into the economy so they dont have to lower rates because they fear the lowering of rates would cause a surplus of money in the economy causing inflation to rapidly increase they are walking a tightrope and every once and a while get tipped one way or the other if they are forced to raise rates because of inflation it reduces the amount of money in circulation and can inhibit growth or cause a recession or even worse a depression that is why they are always on the tight rope  Inflation Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) Federal Reserve Deficit spending Monetarism Reaganomics Money supply Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Supply-side economics Unemployment Surplus value Asian financial crisis Economy of Pakistan Arthur Laffer Tariff Economy of Chile Say's law Great Depression Economic history of the United States Capital accumulation Business cycle Bretton Woods system Debt History of the United States (1918-1945) Gross domestic product Privatization Economy of Colombia New Deal Economy of Argentina Growth theory Economy of the Philippines Microeconomics U.S. public debt Recession Economy of Venezuela Economy of the People's Republic of China Economics Economy of the Netherlands Pound sterling Law of value Hydrogen economy Euro Social Credit Economic relations of Japan Hubbert peak theory Yield curve Tax cut Money History of the United States (1980-1988) Economy of Sri Lanka Capitalism Labor theory of value Economy of Turkey Labour economics Progressive tax Bond Economy of Africa Economy of Romania George W.

how does the median voter theory affect economics on a micro level what economic expectations an informed voter should have we must know what is medoan voter theory if at all it may affect politics and political economy and not economics proper median voter theory also known as the median voter theorem and the median voter model is a famous voting model positing that in a majority election if voter policy preferences can be represented along one dimension i e if every voter's political ideology can be pinpointed on a line and preferences are normally distributed if a voter always votes for the politician that commits to a policy position closest to their own preference and if there are only two politicians then if the politicians want to maximize their number of votes and are prepared to choose policies purely to achieve this they should both commit to the policy position preferred by the median voter this politician strategy is the nash equilibrium of the game see game theory it results in both politicians receiving half the votes and if either candidate deviates to commit to a different policy position the deviating candidate receives less than half the vote the theorem was first articulated in duncan black's article on the rationale of group decision making and popularized by anthony downs's book an economic theory of democracy earlier thinkers such as condorcet and harold hotelling hinted at similar formulations although hotelling's model in his paper stability in competition had a huge mathematical mistake its main idea that politicians would compete to be the most middle of the road was adopted as other models with the same thesis were invented but did not receive widespread recognition for the identification of this simple idea that is nonetheless easily observed in modern elections the median voter theoery have implications for micro economics like when a product's product provision entails fixed costs it will be made available only if a sufficient number of people want it some products are produced and consumed locally so that provision requires not only a large group favoring the product but a large number nearby just as one has an incentive to sort into community whose median voter shares his preferences for local public goods product markets may provide an analogous incentive to sort into a community whose consumers tend to share his preferences in private goods using zip code level data on chain restaurants and restaurants overall this paper documents how the mix of locally available restaurants responds to the local mix of consumers with three findings first based on survey data on chain restaurant patronage restaurant preferences differ substantially by race and education second there is a strong relationship between restaurants and population at the zip code level suggesting that restaurants geographic markets are small finally the mix of locally available chain restaurants is sensitive to the zipcode demographic mix by race and by education hence differentiated product markets provide a benefit proximity to preferred restaurants to persons in geographic markets whose customers tend to share their preferences the median voter theory has also implications for public economic policy choices like setting tariffs on international trade public choice theory is simply economics applied to a market with peculiar property rights just as in the economic analysis of an ordinary market individuals are assumed to pursue their separate objectives rationally just as in that analysis one may first make and later drop simplifying assumptions such as perfect information or zero transaction costs the property rights on the public market however are different from those on the private market they include the right of individuals to vote for representatives of representatives to make laws of government officials to enforce the laws of judges to interpret them and so on one of the ways in which different public choice theories differ from each other is in what they take to be the equivalent of the firm on the political market and what it is assumed to maximize consider the entrepreneurs on the political market to be elected politicians and limit my discussion to the market for legislation this is a simplification of the political market and only one of several possible simplifications but it provides a convenient way of sketching the theory  Economy of Russia Liberal Democrats (UK) Strategic management Normal distribution Prices of production Politics of the United States Monetary policy FairTax

do unions just make things cost more for everyone this is somewhat of a tricky question because it depends on which side of the fence you are viewing it from unions have done a lot to improve working conditions and raise wages but most generally this does cause prices to increase because there is not a corresponding increase in production for a simple example if one person can produce one product in an hour for which he is paid an hour the company basis their price of the product on that cost plus other operating expenses if the union now comes along and say the production person must be paid and hour the money to pay the worker must come from someplace perhaps the company can cut some expenses elsewhere or lay off another worker to offset the increase if so then price of the product would not go up if not then we pay more this is a real tough question but another question is the long term effect unions have on the economy if businesses feel they can not meet the demands some bad things can happen the business can close they can ship the jobs out of the country they can import workers from other countries or they can automate more and replace workers with machines we have seen a lot of this with mining steel railroads auto makers and air lines as a few examples however we can not always blame the unions because there may be other factors involved as well the simple answer is more pay for the same production does generally equal higher prices but there is not always a simple answer to this  Labor theory of value Microeconomics Tax Tariff Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Inflation Minimum wage Supply and demand Gross domestic product Unemployment Economics Trade union Hyperinflation Wal-Mart Privatization Capitalism Free trade Outsourcing Principal-agent problem Labor-power Progressive tax Economic inequality Monetary policy Law of value Labour economics Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Russia Call centre Welding Commodity Model (economics) Balassa-Samuelson effect Mutual fund Offshoring Sweatshop Efficiency wages Monopsony Political economy Health insurance Productive and unproductive labour Opportunity cost Social Credit Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Great Depression Price discrimination Industrial Revolution Monopoly Ford Motor Company Life insurance Surplus labour Economy of the United States Canadian and American economies compared Arbitrage Graduate school FairTax Industrial engineering Supply-side economics Economic growth New Deal Gold standard Nuclear power Commodore International Criticisms of socialism Economy of India 1973 oil crisis Airline Eight hour day Hydrogen economy General equilibrium Kyoto Protocol Transformation problem Externality Corporate finance Extreme Programming Energy development Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment types Future energy development Technocratic movement Education in the People's Republic of China Social Security (United States) Working time Wealth Congress of Industrial Organizations Compensation of employees History of the United States (1865-1918) Subsidy Social Security debate (United States) Value added tax Taxation in the United States Personal rapid transit

what is consumer awareness india consumer awareness in india the consumer movement in india is as old as trade and commerce in kautilya's arthashastra there are references to the concept of consumer protection against exploitation by the trade and industry short weighment and measures adulteration and punishment for these offences however there was no organised and systematic movement actually safeguarding the interests of the consumers prior to independence the main laws under which the consumer interests were considered were the indian penal code agricultural production grading and marketing act drugs and cosmetics act even though different parts of india exhibited different levels of awareness in general the level of awareness was pretty low an average indian consumer is noted for his patience and tolerance perhaps because of these two traditional traits and due to the influence of the mahabharata the ramayana and the bhagavad gita he considers the receipt of defective goods and services as an act of fate or unfavourable planetary position in his horoscope when a new television or refrigerator purchased by him turns out to be defective from day one he takes it reticently blaming it on his fate or as the consequence of the wrongs committed by him in his previous birth very often he is exploited put to avoidable inconveniences and suffers financial loss it is rather paradoxical that the customer is advertised as the king by the seller and service provider but in actual practice treated as a slave or servant goods are purchased by him along with the label items once sold by us will never be received back under any circumstances whatsoever this unethical illegal and unilateral declaration has to be viewed in the light of the practice in developed countries where the seller declares in case you are not fully satisfied with our product you can bring the same to us within a month for either replacement or return of your money this will clearly indicate the level of consumer consciousness however things are changing slowly but steadily and the momentum has increased considerably since the establishment of consumer courts and due to the efforts of a number of consumer organisations and the media the next millennium will witness a high degree of consumer awareness and the concepts of comparative costs consumer preference resistance abstinence and consumer choice will become vital aspects of the economy an analysis of the data from the consumer courts in different states shows that there is a direct relationship between literacy and consumer awareness statistics relating to kerala and bihar will justify this the question to be considered is what can the government do to improve the position  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Capitalism Economy of India Inflation Gross domestic product Intellectual property Free trade Tax Trade union Contract Trademark Ethical consumerism History of the United States (1918-1945) Appeal Supply and demand Prices of production Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Advertising Monopoly Abortion debate Vegetarianism Privatization Democracy Illegal drug trade Economy of Russia Famine Coercion Labor theory of value United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card Technical analysis Divorce FairTax Food and Drug Administration Mahatma Gandhi Simone Weil India Short selling Internet fraud History of the United States Hinduism Economy of Pakistan Liberalism Tariff Capital punishment First Amendment to the United States Constitution Crime Arturo Frondizi Constitution of Ireland Law of value Surplus product Relationship marketing Keynesian economics Publicly funded medicine Ramayana Anarchism and capitalism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Balassa-Samuelson effect Ecology Political economy History of South Africa in the apartheid era Capital accumulation Productive and unproductive labour Fair trade Ottoman Empire Government of India Act 1935 School of Salamanca Plame affair Freedom of speech Gold standard Supply-side economics Kyoto Protocol Lawrence v.

how does the median voter theory affect economics on a macro level what economic expectations do you have as an informed voter economist often use the hot dog stand example to illustrate the effects of this theory on economic policy suppose that we have a long beautiful beach with lots of sun bathers scattered along that beach a hot dog vendor shows up and wants to pick the best location for her business where should she locate the answer is that she should locate herself in the exact middle of the beach which minimizes the walking distance for all possible consumers now suppose that a second hot dog vendor shows up at the same beach where should he locate the answer is right next to the first vendor he will take all the customers to one side of the beach and the first vendor will take all the other customers what does this have to do with politics politicians will locate near the middle of all issues if the median voter theorem is correct this means that there will be no serious differences on economic issues assuming that voters are distributed evenly along the political spectrum however the world is more complicated than the assumptions in the theorem there are many political issues and voters are often lumped in certain segments pro life or pro choice for example  Economics Single Transferable Vote Microeconomics Bayes' theorem Bayesian inference Labor theory of value Democracy Bell's theorem Liberal Democrats (UK) Normal distribution Wealth Keynesian economics G__del's incompleteness theorem Prior probability Supply and demand Voter turnout ELO rating system Arrow's impossibility theorem Insurance Model (economics) Determinism Political economy Outsourcing Tactical voting Land use forecasting Bulk vending Inflation Halting problem Many-worlds interpretation Welfare economics Probability Liberalism Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Labour economics Contract Big Bang General equilibrium EPR paradox Politics of the United States Software engineering Economic inequality Free trade Transformation problem Modified Newtonian dynamics Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Logic Politics of the United Kingdom Prices of production Annuity Democratic Party (United States) Self-adjoint operator Ethics Monty Hall problem Instant-runoff voting Public choice theory Left-wing politics Axiom of choice Linear regression Black hole Propositional calculus Natural monopoly Institution Energy development Kolmogorov complexity Gravity Natural deduction Complexity classes P and NP David Levy (Israeli politician) Political spectrum Business ethics Kenneth Arrow Neoclassical economics Microsoft Random walk Price discrimination General relativity Tariff Social Security debate (United States) Mathematician Privatization Carl Friedrich Gauss Rational expectations Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Gerrymandering Geocoding Property (ownership right) U.S. Electoral College Sampling (statistics) Monetary policy Lebesgue integration Mathematical model Australian electoral system 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Referendum Interpretation of quantum mechanics Heckscher-Ohlin model Precautionary principle Redundant array of independent disks

what are the practical importance of price elasticity of demand for the government please explain in economics terms although there are five elasticities of demand perfectly elastic perfectly inelastic inelastic elastic and unit elastic the first two elasticities of demand hardly existed anyway i think the importance of price elasticity is for the government to intervene the price by imposing price ceiling or price floor depending on the situation if the price elasticity of demand for a particular item is inelastic it is most likely to be a necessity thus when the price of the good is set too high due to some factors the government is able to intervene by imposing a price ceiling to protect the consumers when the price elasticity of demand for a particular item is elastic it is most likely to be a luxury sometimes when the price is set too high the demand for that good will drop which in turn will affect the suppliers at that time the government can impose a price floor to protect the suppliers thus by knowing the price elasticities of demand the government is able to understand the impact of the price on the demand of the consumers and therefore enable it to intervene  Supply and demand Microeconomics Elasticity (economics) Inflation Monopoly Labour economics Keynesian economics Tax Real estate economics Tariff Pricing Capitalism Economy of the United States Natural monopoly Publicly funded medicine Great Depression Monopsony Giffen good Protectionism Progressive tax Economics Perfect competition Luxury good Price discrimination Health insurance Free trade FairTax Free market Economic relations of Japan Value added tax Excise Economy of India Economic shortage Unemployment Law of value Subsidy Equine conformation Price skimming Economic calculation problem Minimum wage Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Neoclassical economics Monetary policy Asian financial crisis Collision Yield curve Economic rent Labor theory of value Daewoo Capital accumulation Sticky (economics) Externality Black market Taxation in the United States Electronic commerce Information Services Procurement Library Gross domestic product Balassa-Samuelson effect 1973 oil crisis Shrimp farm Auction Organic food Economy of Sri Lanka General equilibrium Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Advertising Implications of peak oil California electricity crisis Contract Viscosity Common Agricultural Policy Commodity Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Model (economics) Welding Momentum Ceteris paribus Management information system Economic history of Canada Mercantilism Oligopoly Gold standard Prices of production East Germany Gold as an investment Coercive monopoly Price gouging Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Use value Industrial Revolution Food and Drug Administration Quality of service Liberalism RuneScape economy Privatization Wal-Mart Outsourcing Political economy

basic economics guide anybody like to recommend a basic economics guide book you know for stuff like how banks work why recessions occur the stock market that kind of stuff mainly so i can expound a little bit on important economic related events in u s history right now i am limited to knowing that say there was a panic in but i don't necessarily know why there was a panic thanks for help i would say your better off not getting a university grade economics text as your likely to get bored first before you learn anything useful also i don t think your after need the maths just enough word economics to cover the background as i mention at the end the most import book you could read for this era circa is adam smiths wealth of nations all economics of that time is based of it modern introductory books for lay people are the best place to start there are many out there and for the most part they are exceptionally well written and enjoyable reads better than economics for dummies at any rate despite that i would recommend that teach companies audio book on economics as the best introduction as it is easier to listen than read http www teach com ttcx coursedesclong aspx cid id pc business and economics an alternative book as opposed to audio would be charles wheelan s naked economics don t let the casual wording fool you into think that he is dumbing down along with that i would recommend some background reading to get a flavour for the subject the worldly philosophers by robert heilbroner is a good introduction to the people behind the subject although it focuses a little to much on the people rather than their ideas freakonomics would be a nice read although it doesn t real cover the big macro stuff very well though reading a magazine such as the economist free articals on www economist com would help when reading anything in economics bear in mind that bias is exceptionally common for example mises org would be a good introduction but it might prejudice you against people like john maynard keynes also in economics was still very much in its infancy so modern economic thought was still in its infancy you should definitely read the wealth of nations by adam smith as for this time it was the gold standard in the subject and hugely influential also look out for works by adam smiths contemporaries the phyisocrats ricardo and malthaus would be useful background reading for thought of the time as well though it requires me to don a flam retardant suit i would also recommend some karl marx as while his conclusions are barmy as an economic historian he is first rate  Economics Capitalism Liberalism Political economy Mercantilism Supply-side economics The Wealth of Nations Inflation John Maynard Keynes Labor theory of value Adam Smith Philosophy Supply and demand Gold standard History of science Monetarism Microeconomics Federal Reserve Free market Law of value Karl Marx Socialism Wealth Postmodernism Book of Mormon Modernism Socialist economics Labour economics Historical materialism Theory of conduct Immanuel Kant Capital accumulation MP3 Say's law GED Objectivist philosophy Economic growth American individualist anarchism Surplus product Productive and unproductive labour Marxism Free trade Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel History Leo Strauss A Course In Miracles Theodicy Education Property (ownership right) Great Depression Robin Hahnel Game theory Exploitation Prices of production Intelligent design Jean-Jacques Rousseau Bretton Woods system Tool (band) Macroeconomics Trade Intellectual property Gold as an investment Douglas Adams Republic Goodness and value theory Ludwig Wittgenstein Austrian School Guild David Hume Max Stirner Karl Popper Hyperinflation Philosophy of business Classical economics Guide for the Perplexed Education in the United States American Conservatism Philosophy of science Robert Heilbroner Declaration of Independence (United States) Scientology beliefs and practices Tao Te Ching Social class Unemployment Jacobo Arenas Insurance Louis Althusser

why do of the world poepulation controle of the worlds money in classical economics its called the rule or pareto principle taken to an extreme an excellent book on the subject is the winner take all society but to answer your question let's look at it another way why is the lower or so poor extreme wealth concentration is an indication that a society is not well balanced and that there is the potential for social disruption over time good examples include pre imperial england france tsarist russia imperial china and prussia typically this is due to a couple of issues there is insufficient capital being placed into the marketplace for by the lower of people there is sufficient capital but it is not being reinvested in productive ways which would tend to redistribute it there is sufficient capital but due to taxation or other factors food fuel inflation etc the situation of individuals is heading in a negative direction in our society there are additional concentration factors the winner take all effect why buy some very good opera singers recording of an aria from the local university when you can have placido domingo or luciano pavarotti consequently the dollars get concentrated towards their labels and themselves rather than distributed more evenly across the marketplace of opera singers the placement marketing effect coke or pepsi it's a choice but really the difference is between one black brown fizzy over sweet drink and another ginger ale guys are on their own because it's the illusion of choice offered by coke or pepsi this makes both coke and pepsi rich and leaves everyone else to rd bench in the marketplace  Microeconomics Inflation Wealth Capitalism Welfare economics Capital accumulation Economic inequality Soft drink Economics Tax Free trade Luciano Pavarotti Free market Privatization Progressive tax Monopoly New Coke Liberalism Socialist economics Surplus product Flat tax Gross domestic product FairTax Political economy Pepsi-Cola Coca-Cola Democracy Organic farming Social class Gold standard Intellectual property Libertarian economic views Taxation in the United States Economic anthropology American individualist anarchism Supply-side economics Law of value Philosophy of business Criticism of libertarianism Keynesian economics Externality Corporate governance Libertarianism Bureaucracy Mercantilism Famine Economic growth Bond Socialism Hyperinflation Criticisms of socialism Incentive Model (economics) Left-Right politics Ethics Wealth condensation Bank Argentine Currency Board Dieting Deflation (economics) Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Industrial Revolution Coercion MMORPG Productive and unproductive labour Balassa-Samuelson effect Market failure Conservatism Diet soda Illegal drug trade Affirmative action Public good Monetary policy Land reform Republic Overpopulation Economy of Russia Grade (education) Open-source software Anarcho-capitalism Voter turnout Left-wing politics Economy of the United States Neoclassical economics Fuel injection Strategic management

will western countries ever break their dependency on oil will it even reduce the answer is not yet the infrastructure in the west is too reliant on oil for the west to break their reliance in the short run our production and capital relies on the supply of global oil to work effectively and efficiently while it is the most environmentally friendly thing and will have the most social benefits in the future if we do use more renewable and eco friendly fuels then it will take a very long time to implement firstly there is not likely to be any regulation very soon by the governments or corporations to say that they must cut down on the use of oil in production many are concerned more with their own self interest by way of profits or economic growth rather than the sustainable use of scarce factor resources available secondly the western corporations and governments are somewhat disinterested in investing in such areas as research and development r d and innovation and invention especially in an 'anti oil' campaign although a lot of headway could be made in the unexplored venture for alternative resources to use this is due to the smear campaign that would follow that their aims would not strengthen but weaken the west this however is due to the narrowmindedness of humanity which cannot see beyond the reaches of their own reinforced bubble which shields them from any guilt they might feel as their descendants are forced to search for alternative fuels in future years because we were too ignorant to do it in this day and age thirdly it would take time for the conversion to be implemented from oil to such alternatives as biofuels which are so much harder to produce as they use up crops such as maize which are necessary in the west therefore the state should take the opportunity cost into lesser account than the future social costaccount the opportunity cost of the decision is that it might degrade our productive ability for a matter of years however the social cost would be for an improved economical infrastructure for future generations which will ensure that they are able to take advantage of renewable resources before we are forced to once all non renewable resources are used up i feel i must maintain that as long as western powers stay in iraq it is clear that oil is part of the agenda if not all of it this evidently displays the greedy behaviour of governments to obtain such resources for personal gain by abusing others unjustly i fear that the only way that we will become independent from the addiction our industrialised states have developed is to go cold turkey unfortunately the only way i can see any of the g forgoing oil is if it all runs out by which point the world economy will slump dramatically it is better to plan for the future than to improvise when we get there in the long run so long as the correct institutional and infrastructural amendments are made independency or at least a reduced dependency which will prolong the supply of oil for more important purposes than making plastic commodities which will later be landfilled is attainable  Microeconomics Capitalism Free trade Privatization Energy development Nuclear power Economy of Africa Alternative fuel Renewable energy Capital accumulation Alcohol fuel Inflation Biofuel Oil depletion Corporate governance Hubbert peak theory Commodity markets Deflation (economics) Economy of the People's Republic of China Organic farming Implications of peak oil Political economy Law of value Petroleum Economics 1973 oil crisis Economy of Colombia Hydrogen economy Economy of the United States Anarchism and capitalism Nuclear energy policy Economy of South Africa Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nuclear power phase-out Economy of Norway Sustainability Strategic management Economy of Russia Surplus value Globalization Unemployment Economic history of Japan Economy of Pakistan Intellectual property Economic growth Energy crisis Economy of Ghana Microcredit Overpopulation Technology Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Corporate social responsibility Gross domestic product Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Sewage treatment Opportunity cost Gold standard World government Green Revolution Tax Economy of Belgium Economy of Brazil Economic inequality Agriculture in Australia Wealth Industrial Revolution Agriculture Keynesian economics Waste management Monetary policy Biodiversity Economy of Venezuela Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of the Republic of Ireland United Nations Solar power Economy of the Philippines Monopoly Rise of Nations Corporation Trade and development Wind power Worldwide green parties Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Commonwealth of Nations World Bank Group Economic history of Spain Economy of Singapore Supply and demand Primitive accumulation of capital Public policy Economic relations of Japan

what are some factors that cause the us dollar to rise against most other currencies especially the euro does the us dollar generally rise against other currency's when the stock market tanks i noticed that the us dollar rose against the euro today at the same time the stock market indexes dropped does this mean that investors are keeping their money in cash or buying usd when they are pulling out of stocks i'm quite new to all this and trying to learn it seems that the usd can become stronger when the fed increases the interest rates but what are some other factors that could cause it to fluctuate on a daily or weekly basis finally what direction do you think it's going over the next few weeks months and years generally when the interest rate rises the currency appreciates speculators will try to buy assets with the higher interest rate and to do so they will need to buy the domestic currency this increase the demand for the currency causing it to appreciate ie its price increases the stock market tends to go down when interest rates go up as it makes borrowing more costly for firms and future profits have to be discounted more what causes the daily fluctuations well a lot of it is speculations and people and firms will have changing needs for foreign currency depending on international trade these changes in demand and supply of currency and so the price of a currency relative to another another factor to take into account is inflation if inflation is higher in one country its currency may depreciate nominally to keep things balanced in real terms i also suggest that you google a term called uncovered interest parity most fluctuations are down to it maybe google dornbusch overshooting as well my opinion is mixed inflation is still a worry in the uk and europe and so interest rates may have to rise here the sub prime crisis is drying up liquidity although the crisis is having a global impact it has affected the us the most and so the fed may be reluctant to raise rates at the moment furthermore if confidence is severely affected there might be a flight to bonds particularly us treasury bonds causing a appreciation on the other hand central banks are resorting to injecting reserves which can have the effect of diluting strength sorry this is confusing but the sub prime problems have made things very unpredictable at the moment my guess is that in the long term the dollar will have to depreciate further much research indicates that a random walk does a better job of predicting currency fluctuations that most macroeconomic models the exception to this is when you have information over flow which professional traders handling the big orders will do but the amateur will not  Keynesian economics Money Pound sterling Gold as an investment Interest Federal Reserve Fiat money Derivative (finance) Government debt Futures contract Economy of India Law of value Bank Short selling Economy of Sri Lanka Central bank Model (economics) Supply and demand Economics Mutual fund Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Corporate finance Financial markets Economy of the United States Capitalism Free trade Economy of Africa Economy of Venezuela Great Depression Technical analysis U.S. public debt Devaluation Reaganomics Economy of Nigeria Rational pricing Economy of Brazil Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Security (finance) Mergers and acquisitions Stock market PE ratio Economy of Europe Australian dollar Speculation Finance Currency Enron Corporation Economy of the United Kingdom Social Security debate (United States) Ford Motor Company 1973 oil crisis Citigroup Economy of Argentina Business cycle Rational expectations Commodity markets Tariff History of the United States (1918-1945) MMORPG Economic relations of Japan Real (currency) Black Wednesday Economy of Cuba Purchasing power parity Mortgage Stock

why countries currency value changes what are all the factors that determine the currencies value the short answer is gross domestic product and levels of imports and exports a healthy economy that brings income both to the people and to the government tends to have a higher currency valuation it's also relative to the countries with which trade occurs for instance the british pound right now is valued at about pound to every us dollars the dollar is so low because our imports have been steadily increasing while our exports have been decreasing there's also the question of foreign investment in american stocks bonds property etc the more foreign companies own of america the lower the value of american assets back when clinton was president things happened to be a lot better and the dollar was even valued higher than the pound the economy was in a much better state and the citizens were also spending a lot more of their earnings which then fed the economy to keep it healthy a couple of other things that affect the value of a currency is the actual amount of physical currency that exists and the gold stored in fort knox in the us and the current value of gold in the world market the us treasury burns in old bills per day while they print generally the same amount in new bills the balancing of these helps keep things stabilized we can choose to put more physical money into circulation but this can affect inflation and lower the value of the dollar the whole thing with gold is that it's a valued resource that always has some value and one that tends to increase or remain stable rather than decrease in value of course the more demand there is for a currency the higher the value of the currency relative to that of other nations  Monetary policy Gross domestic product Bretton Woods system Gold standard Pound sterling Asian financial crisis Economy of Russia Hyperinflation United States dollar Economy of India Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Microeconomics Debt Bond U.S. public debt Euro Money supply Gold as an investment Argentine Currency Board Economy of the United States Government debt Money Capitalism Supply-side economics Economy of Pakistan Supply and demand Arbitrage Economic inequality Economy of Chile Law of value Currency PE ratio Legal tender Economy of Colombia Economy of Brazil Arthur Laffer FairTax Renminbi Economic history of Spain Economy of Romania Economy of Africa Economy of Cuba Federal Reserve Economy of Argentina Economy of Papua New Guinea Economics Exchange rate Monetarism Economy of Guyana Yield curve Economy of Ghana Economic relations of Japan Free trade Tax Tariff Reaganomics Progressive tax United States Fiat money Economy of Hungary International Monetary Fund History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of the Philippines Surplus value Balance of trade Economy of Fiji Marshall Plan Economic history of Britain Trade Economy of Kuwait MMORPG Kazakhstan Economy of Singapore Economy of Belgium Gold Labour economics Neoliberalism RuneScape economy Security (finance) Property tax Economy of Peru Wealth Central bank Economy of Israel El Salvador Commodity markets Economy of the Czech Republic Romania Political economy Minimum wage

since so many homes are in foreclosure where are those families moving too a lot of them are moving into apartments or renting houses others are moving in with friends family members until they can get their finances back in order to be able to afford a new rental it really depends on their financial status at the time they moved though if the foreclosure victims are still in trouble they'll probably have to move in with friends or family until they get a job get over their medical disability or overcome the financial hardship with little or no income they won't be able to live on their own again but some homeowners get their finances back in order and just don't have any options left to stop foreclosure these homeowners can probably begin saving up for a security deposit and start paying rent on a new apartment or house they won't be able to purchase a new house but they can find a landlord that will let them rent to own if nothing else unfortunately a number of foreclosure victims have nowhere to go and end up homeless but i would imagine this is a small percentage of homeowners but a real financial crisis can result in the inability to keep the house with no other options hope that answers your question foreclosurefish http www foreclosurefish com  Housing cooperative Mortgage Insurance Rent control 401(k) Rent (musical) Great Depression Property tax Public housing Predatory lending Real estate bubble Taxation in the United States Annuity Freeters Homelessness Home insurance Leasing Apartment Renting ACORN Rental agreement Economic rent Mobile home Microeconomics Abigail Folger Leasehold estate FairTax Apartment building Parasite singles Mortgage-backed security Tax exemption Money Habitat for Humanity International Divorce Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation HyperText Transfer Protocol Unemployment Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jack Layton Monopoly (game) Gentrification Avenue Q Harlem Deflation (economics) Kibbutz Stuyvesant Town Accounting methods Government National Mortgage Association Inflation Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Hyperinflation American Psycho Money supply Contract White flight Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Microcredit Unreformed House of Commons Timeshare Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Probation officer Mediation The Inside Warren Buffett Cosmo Kramer Progressive tax Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interest Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Gross domestic product Karl Rove Friends Knots Landing Foreclosure Life insurance Electronic commerce Blackburn Rovers F.C.

how do you decrease the unemployment and underemployment rate of a third world country aside from putting up businesses please look into the economic history of that nation and see what sector must really be developed and see what are its strength like if it's got good land then agriculture or if nice people then the service industry unemployment and underemployment are usually rampant because the government oversees areas that could be developed its nice to allocate as much as possible the national budget in the development of array of sectors but if its much cost productive if you channel them into a few sector but to which the following governments need to development as well the problem nowadays is merely politics one government would develop this and then the next would do another usually happens if from different parties its this dirty politics that downplay everything really them and their political ambitions and not to mention the graft and corruption if the politicians and the power players would just learn about efficiency and teamwork for sure there'd be a decrease in unemployment  Economy of India Unemployment Economy of Russia Economy of Paraguay Economy of Peru Capitalism World economy Privatization Economy of Ghana Economic development Gross domestic product Economy of Belgium Keynesian economics Economy of Romania Trade union Economy of Nicaragua Economy of Costa Rica History of the United States (1918-1945) Inflation Economy of the United States Economy of Papua New Guinea Microeconomics Economy of Mexico Economy of France Economy of Venezuela Economy of Singapore Ferdinand Marcos Economy of Bangladesh Economy of Nigeria Political corruption History of the People's Republic of China (3/4) Economy of Norway Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economic history of Spain Economy of Africa History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985) Economy of Pakistan Economy of Croatia Economy of Honduras Economy of Zambia Economy of Finland Economy of Sweden Economy of Guyana Economy of South Africa Economy of Hong Kong Economy of the Central African Republic Underemployment Zambia Unemployment types Economy of Senegal Economy of Niger Economy of the United Arab Emirates Economy of Taiwan Publicly funded medicine Economy of Tunisia Great Depression in the United Kingdom Economy of Jamaica Capital accumulation Economic history of Japan East Germany Economy of Iceland Economy of Fiji Galactic Civilizations Agricultural policy Economy of Indonesia Tax Economy of Sierra Leone Economy of Slovakia Economy of Colombia Economy of Denmark Economy of Libya Common Agricultural Policy Canadian and American economies compared New Deal Economy of Lesotho Economy of Israel Economy of Sri Lanka History of the Soviet Union Deflation (economics) Economy of Bolivia Economy of Germany Opportunity cost Economy of Greece Bangladesh Economy of Mozambique History of post-Soviet Russia Economy of Trinidad and Tobago Economy of Morocco Economy of Macau Economy of Zimbabwe Economy of Saudi Arabia Economy of the Republic of the Congo Minimum wage Economic history of Britain Economy of the European Union Economics

tariffs how do they work i understand that tariffs are a tax on imported goods but that's about all i understand do foreign countries have to pay us more money in order to sell their goods here or is the price s of the foreign goods sold here raised if a tariff was put on a certain product foreign product and the u s sold the exact same product how much of a difference in price would there be i also have another question that pertains to this i know that tariffs are put on foreign goods in order to encourage citizens of this country to buy domestic goods why doesn't the government just not allow certain foreign countries to sell their stuff here i know it's a dumb question but i'm just really confused and have been for a long time about the tariff thing please help tariffs work by forcing the exporter to pay additional taxes to the government in order to import the good into the country these costs then get passed along to the consumer in the form of higher prices so yes foreign countries have to pay the government to allow their goods into the country and consumers pay more in order to buy the imported goods tariffs generally tend to raise the price of all products that have the tariff on them whether they are foreign or domestic foreign firms pass on the cost of the tariff to their customers as much as they can and this allows domestic firms to either sell more here at a lower price or increase the price of their goods to match keeping the difference for themselves so it is hard to say how much a tariff would increase the price of goods because there are a number of different variables at play certainly the price would go up by no more than the tariff amount since if any firm did this both domestic and foreign competitors could undercut their prices in fact in the long term tariffs could actually bring the price down by encouraging domestic production while protecting it from competition eventually or so the theory goes once the domestic producers are strong enough to compete then the government could drop the tariffs and let everyone compete on a level playing field the u s in theory believes in the free market and to ban legal foreign products would certainly be challenged in court so it is easier to simply apply tariffs to imported goods than to outright ban them most imported goods do not have a perfect substitute so to ban products would cause a backlash from the public while in some cases tariffs may be useful to promote certain industries they are very costly to the economy the supply of product is reduced and the price is increased resulting in the demand being less than what the market would supply at a given price  Monopoly Tax Economics Inflation Capitalism Agricultural policy Monetary policy Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) Privatization Supply-side economics Labour economics Gold standard Natural monopoly Bretton Woods system Common Agricultural Policy Great Depression Hyperinflation Economy of India History of international trade Globalization FairTax Externality Economy of the United States Economy of Chile Value added tax Mercantilism U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Minimum wage Public good Political economy Balassa-Samuelson effect Subsidy Law of value Ford Motor Company Canadian and American economies compared Labor-power Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Commodity Economic relations of Japan Publicly funded medicine Capital accumulation Economy of Pakistan Airline Progressive tax Economic growth History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of South Africa Fair trade Competition Health insurance Illegal drug trade History of the United States (1789-1849) Heckscher-Ohlin model Insurance Asian financial crisis Prices of production American individualist anarchism Black market Food and Drug Administration Advertising Surplus value Economy of Nigeria Mutual fund Economy of Cuba Famine Japan-United States relations Economy of Belgium Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of Colombia Economy of Poland Intellectual property Trade and development Free market Public policy Outsourcing Economy of Romania Taxation in the United States Great Depression in the United Kingdom Bond Economic history of Spain Economy of Norway Productive and unproductive labour Growth theory Perfect competition Adam Smith General equilibrium

wat are the characteristics of business cycles the business cycle or economic cycle refers to the fluctuations of economic activity about its long term growth trend the cycle involves shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid growth of output recovery and prosperity and periods of relative stagnation or decline contraction or recession these fluctuations are often measured using the real gross domestic product despite being named cycles these fluctuations in economic growth and decline do not follow a purely mechanical or predictable periodic pattern the main types of business cycles enumerated by joseph schumpeter and others in this field have been named after their discoverers or proposers the kitchin inventory cycle years after joseph kitchin the juglar fixed investment cycle years after clement juglar the kuznets infrastructural investment cycle years after simon kuznets nobel laureate the kondratieff wave or cycle years after nikolai kondratieff even longer cycles are occasionally proposed often as multiples of the kondratiev cycle edit juglar cycle in the juglar cycle which is sometimes called the business cycle recovery and prosperity are associated with increases in productivity consumer confidence aggregate demand and prices in the cycles before world war ii or that of the late s in the united states the growth periods usually ended with the failure of speculative investments built on a bubble of confidence that bursts or deflates in these cycles the periods of contraction and stagnation reflect a purging of unsuccessful enterprises as resources are transferred by market forces from less productive uses to more productive uses cycles between and the s in the united states were generally more restrained and followed political factors such as fiscal policy and monetary policy automatic stabilisation due to the government's budget helped defeat the cycle even without conscious action done by policy makers edit politically based business cycle models another set of models tries to derive the business cycle from political decisions the partisan business cycle suggests that cycles result from the successive elections of administrations with different policy regimes regime a adopts expansionary policies resulting in growth and inflation but is voted out of office when inflation becomes unacceptably high the replacement regime b adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth and the downwards swing of the cycle it is voted out of office when unemployment is too high being replaced by party a the political business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of any hue is elected it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence it then adopts an expansionary policy in the lead up to the next election hoping to achieve simultaneously low inflation and unemployment on polling day the business cycle is the rises and falls of the economy this maintains neutrality between supply and demand business cycles as we know them today were first identified and analyzed by arthur burns and wesley mitchell in their book measuring business cycles one of their key insights was that many economic indicators move together during a boom or expansion not only does output rise but also employment rises and unemployment falls new construction and prices typically rise during a boom as well conversely during a downturn or depression not only does the output of goods and services decline but employment falls and unemployment rises as well new construction also declines in the era before world war ii prices also typically fell during a recession since the fifties prices have risen during downturns though usually more slowly than during booms in many ways the term business cycle is misleading cycle seems to imply that there is some regularity in the timing and duration of upswings and downswings in economic activity most economists however believe otherwise booms and recessions occur at irregular intervals and last for varying lengths of time for example economic activity hit low points in and the trough was then followed by eight years of uninterrupted expansion for describing the swings in economic activity therefore most modern economists prefer the term economic fluctuations just as there is no regularity in the timing of business cycles there is no reason why cycles have to occur at all the prevailing view among economists is that there is a level of economic activity often referred to as full employment at which the economy theoretically could stay forever full employment refers to a level of production at which all the inputs to the production process are being used but not so intensively that they wear out break down or insist on higher wages and more vacations if nothing disturbs the economy the full employment level of output which naturally tends to grow as the population increases and new technologies are discovered can be maintained forever there is no reason why a time of full employment has to give way to either a full fledged boom or a recession business cycles do occur however because there are disturbances to the economy of one sort or another booms can be generated by surges in private or public spending for example if the government spends a lot of money to fight a war but does not raise taxes the increased demand will cause not only an increase in the output of war materiel but also an increase in the take home pay of government plant workers the output of all the goods and services that these workers want to buy with their wages will also increase similarly a wave of optimism that causes consumers to spend more than usual and firms to build new factories will cause the economy to expand recessions or depressions can be caused by these same forces working in reverse a substantial cut in government spending or a wave of pessimism among consumers and firms may cause the output of all types of goods to fall

labor unions what are they all about they serve as a mediator of interest between members and those who employ them typically unions are seen as the antithesis of the 'corporation' often referring to that age old golden rule 'ye who owns the gold makes the rules' thus labour unions are seen to provide a necessary counter balance to the concentration of corporate power vested in employment decision makers edms if unions work for workers who do they work against just as workers and their bosses don't always see eye to eye shareholders and edms aren't always acting in unison either in business school this disharmony is known as principal agent discord ie when the edm is not behaving as the shareholder would in certain situations this 'misalignment of agenda' is usually derived from and perpetuates unclear financail planning or poor ongoing financial measurement and it serves to maximise edm utility over and above the rewards allocated to managers' by shareholders according to profit productivity customer satisfaction etc such 'imperfect' information between edms employees and shareholders is called a market failure in the economic sense unions therefore are required to provide a collective means of overcoming the market failure caused by the natrual human instincts of edm representitives to discretely or otherwise 'feather the nest' of self interst however corporations are not alone in their battle against this principle agent discord unions too have a concentration of power that must be managed and this usually lies within the union decision makers udms who are just as suceptable to conflicting personal and official intersts despite the near perfect alighnment of both worker and shareholder interests in the long run hence we have the frustraions that each view each other udms workers blame edms corporations for poor employment engagement when shareholders typicllly want the same thing as the work force ie productive employees and on the other hand edms put blame on unions for archaic use of labour over more efficient capital etc etc etc and so edms and udms play shareholders union members off one another to boost non production orrientated goals overpopulated headcounts which leads to lower productivity and lower pay for a greater number of union subscribing employees but larger management membership bonuses for edms udms alike so in shortened form unions are an imperfect force to counteract the principal agent discord between shareholders and corporate management designed by their nature to dilute the concentration of imperfectly administered economic power decision making away from management and towards an otherwise diluted body of members employees update we outsiders do trust that there is a great deal of knowledge within groups such as owners managers shareholders and customers unfortunately there is also a gap between the actions of one and the effect on the other managers are managing on behalf of the owners and controlling the employees the employees 'serve' the management and control the quality of the products or the customer experience in the short term etc customers control then the success of the owners without directly rewarding the workers tipping in restruarants is a direct attack on this problem and can be relied upon to seek their own interests efficiently enough given a choice ie that the company is not a monopoly we know from america's democracy passion that a misalignment of servitude feedback and control leads to hedgemony the magnitude of the feedback control inefficiency dictates the propensity to create a centralisation of power and in a perfect economy market there is no need for the centralisation of power at all economies of scale considered so we trust the owners to make good decisions on what rewards them profitability we trust managers to make good decisions that reward them bureaucractic security dirty word or not workers to reward them longevity and customers based on their rewards the problem and need for unions imperfect as they are arises when the workforce is stuck between the consumer is king and the executive is power as generally workers have no direct link to the choices in the output they make to the consumer or to the peolpe who actually emplyoy them the shareholder hence unions collect them together and bargain for workers rights although usually to the detriment of the owner and the customer and so ultimately against the worker himself the problem rests with the people charged with managing the mismanagement of information  Monopoly Labour economics Supply

globalization i'm conducting a survey for school and hope maybe you can help i need to show a survey of how many are for globalization and how many against it please also include why or why not thanks in advance ah here we go the beauty of adam smith's invisible hand over the market place is that no transaction ever occurs unless both sides profit from the situation globalization and outsourcing jobs benifits everyone involved there is no looser in economics for example when nike outcources its shoe making jobs to india everyone benifits the people in india are obviously making more money there than they could anywhere else because if not then they would not have chosen to work there even though the wages seem low to us by their standards they are very high because if they were not then nike would find noone willing to work for them period its just logic oh and even child labor in rd world countries is good because studies have shown that if they were not working for nike they would likely be child prostitutes or something similar they would not magically go to school rather than working if we stopped hiring children they would just find other jobs much worse ones most likely now people might think that the thousands of jobs overseas are taking away from americans who need the jobs well that may be true but if you look at the bigger picture even those people are benifiting because they can now buy cheeper shoes and are in a way earning money by not having to spend as much on shoes and the few lost jobs here benifits more people in america than it hurts globalization allows for specialization in trade which is very very good even if america is better at producing both computers and shoes than say india is everyone still benifits from trade america can have the workers in india who are not as skilled making shoes and have the people who are more skilled with computers spending their time making computers rather than shoes i hate for this to be too long but you can apply any other anti globalization theory to this logic and you will see that everyone benifits from globalization or else it simply would not occur you must look at the big picture that is adam smith's invisibal hand in action i hope this helps you  Unemployment Capitalism Outsourcing Sweatshop Free trade Economic inequality Economics Inflation Supply and demand Great Depression Division of labour Trade Labor theory of value Exploitation Trade union Capital accumulation History of economic thought Microeconomics Commodity Labour economics Wal-Mart Law of value Anarchism and capitalism Keynesian economics Principal-agent problem Globalization Nike, Inc.

the federal reserve is facing a huge problem what will they do if the federal reserve fails to increase interest rates inflation devaluation of dollar will occur and if they do increase rates a recession will occur neither is good for americans what do you think they will do your question gets right to the heart of the delicate balancing act that is monetary policy in fact their mission statement includes conducting the nation s monetary policy in pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices exactly how and when to raise interest rates is an ongoing debate among economists in a perfect interest rate setting scenario the reason for rising prices is soley due to a threat of an overheating economy too much money so the fed should just tweak the interest upward anytime you see massive speculation rising prices e g housing stocks that is usually a sign of too much money but prices can rise for other legitimate reasons like political unrest e g middle east raw material shortages e g steel cartels e g oil disasters e g katrina in these cases prices are rising for reasons other than too much money in fact these rising prices will actually put a drag of their own on the economy so what to do if there are legitimate non monetary reasons for rising prices the fed should let it run it's course and for the economy to adjust if there is speculation behind rising prices the fed should do a little jaw boning to get it under control show concern express interest rates may rise etc be on guard of inflation bias this is a situation where consumers and businesses don't change behaviors in response to rising prices and just pass it on this happened in the s when this happens where labor and business contracts have built in cpi price increases higher inflation becomes ingrained and is difficult to tame without a major shock remember the recession if the fed sees evidence of inflation bias creeping in then a tighter money supply is almost mandatory unfortunately adjusting interest rates based on national averages is a shot gun approach half the country will be above the average unemployment half below so the interest rate change will be too high for half the country and too low for the other half this is where fiscal policy can help by shifting government spending to under performing areas and away from over performing areas but it is unlikely politicians would take such an even handed approach they are all after what's best for their districts and rich districts tend to have more political pull and more pork this perpetuates a lopsided economy of winners and losers but now we're getting into political issues which is outside the scope of your question  Capitalism Economy of Venezuela Economics Economy of Pakistan 1973 oil crisis Arthur Laffer Deficit spending Unemployment Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money supply Gross domestic product Great Depression Phillips curve History of the United States (1964-1980) Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 History of the United States (1980-1988) Economy of Nigeria Economy of Africa Economy of Belgium Privatization Free trade Economy of India Economic history of Spain Labour economics Economic relations of Japan Federal Reserve Say's law Argentine Currency Board Business cycle Hubbert peak theory Tariff History of the United States (1918-1945) Capital accumulation FairTax U.S. public debt Consumer price index Law of value Central bank Economy of the Netherlands Economy of Ghana Economic history of the United States New Deal Model (economics) Money Economy of Romania Stagflation Social Security (United States) Fiat money Economy of Sri Lanka Canadian and American economies compared Minimum wage Economy of Suriname Economy of Colombia International Monetary Fund United States dollar Government debt Economy of Brazil Balassa-Samuelson effect Economy of Chile Energy crisis Neo-Keynesian Economics Economy of the Czech Republic Marshall Plan Labor theory of value Divorce Wealth Economy of Haiti Overpopulation Economy of Sweden Pound sterling George W.

how much does time cost per minute how much does time cost per minute i heard the saying time is money so i was wondering how much it really was calculated and stuff how many dollars or cents per minute on average like from birth to death and from the count of rich and poor people etc how much is time per minute this old saying is based on opportunity cost everyone's time is worth something different and there is no actual gauge of what it is generally if you're willing to go to work for a specific wage you are estimating that you can't get a better deal on your time so you show up if you are bill gates your time is very valuable since you can be doing things that generate lots of income if you are a bum on the street your time is not very valuable since no one will pay you much for it if you made a year then you think your time is worth less than per hour based on a hour work year otherwise you would be unwilling to work for someone else since your best alternative would make you more please note that this only applies to time in monetary terms if you were dying how much would you give for another few hours with your family the value of time is very subjective and can't be accurately computed your wages act as a decent estimate though since they are greater than the value that you would place on your own time  Economic inequality Microeconomics Inflation Blackjack Hyperinflation Minimum wage Gross domestic product Taxation in the United States Capital accumulation United States dollar Labour economics Opportunity cost Economics Progressive tax Supply and demand Unemployment FairTax Life insurance Flat tax Capitalism Surplus value Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Money Insurance PE ratio Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Fuel injection Poker jargon Ra (board game) Law of value Tax protester Trip distribution Welfare trap Social Security (United States) Canadian dollar Economy of Russia New Deal Public domain Annuity ELO rating system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Doomsday argument Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Live 8 Corporate finance Consumer price index Estoppel Gold standard Gauge theory Public policy Bay Area Rapid Transit Tide Interest Personal finance Make money fast Conscription Act of Parliament Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Property tax Mode choice United Kingdom corporation tax Education in Romania Welfare economics Contract Betting (poker) Wage Depreciation Trade union Wal-Mart Arthur Laffer Transformation problem Supply-side economics Social Security debate (United States) Euro Donald Trump Food Stamp Program Rich Mullins San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Philippine peso Education in the People's Republic of China Legal tender English plural Publicly funded medicine Julian day British national identity card Sweatshop Austrian School Credit card Unemployment benefit Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals) Light rail Principal-agent problem Hipparchus (astronomer) New Zealand dollar Wealth condensation

why are environmental impacts caused by economic activity not considered as part of any economic decisions our political systems continue to be driven by short term electoral considerations and rarely if ever on long term social and environmental concerns we all well and truly know that without our environment we cease to exist but your policies are always based and measured on short term economic outcomes whilst you pay only lip service to environmental requirements as and when it becomes popular and consequently worth a vote or two without an enviroment capable of sustaining human life we will have no need to be rich and prosperous the first political leader to bite the bullet and take his her party forward with due regard to the future of the planet and not the next election results will be seen as a real leader yawnnnnnnnn tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wealth Political economy Sustainability Democracy New Zealand National Party Sustainable development Political party Capital accumulation Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand Worldwide green parties Famine United States Senate Inflation Deflation (economics) Liberal Democrats (UK) Economics Euroscepticism Unemployment Voter turnout Politics of the United Kingdom New Zealand Labour Party Capitalism Politics of Canada Referendum Public policy Insurance Progressive Conservative Party of Canada The Skeptical Environmentalist Biodiversity __lvaro Uribe Bob Hawke History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991) Environmental economics Elections in the United States Democratic Party (United States) Global warming Politics of Hong Kong Politics of Germany Bob Rae Richard Bassett Canadian House of Commons Conservative Party (UK) Privatization Social Credit Party (New Zealand) Corporate finance Australian Labor Party New Zealand Parliament Liberal Party (UK) Economic growth Alliance (New Zealand political party) Criticisms of socialism Northern Territory legislative election, 2005 Election Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Politics of Belgium Corporate social responsibility Supply-side economics New Zealand general election, 2002 Democratic Party (Hong Kong) Single Transferable Vote Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Republican Party (United States) Local government in the United Kingdom Government debt Commodity markets Politics of France Model (economics) Left-wing politics Australian legislative election, 2004 U.S. presidential election, 2004 Liberalism Nuclear power phase-out History of the United States (1789-1849) Radicalism Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Social Democratic Party (UK) Predestination Voluntary Student Unionism Strategic planning Economy of the United States Presidential system Chen Shui-bian Non-governmental organization Australian Greens Politics of Ontario Australian electoral system Externality Overpopulation World Bank Group Campaign finance reform Strategic Environmental Assessment Alexander Lukashenko Newfoundland and Labrador RESPECT The Unity Coalition Geography Bundestag (Germany) U.S. presidential election, 2008 Labour Party (UK) Politics of the Republic of China

i need an explanation for why printing money is bad for governments i'm trying to explain to my friend that the government can't just print money make everyone in the country billionaires he's having some problem understanding that money has to be backed up by something tangible like gold fish i realize there are many theories about that so just simplified examples will suffice now he can go to a farmer and try to trade the arrowheads for wheat to make bread but the farmer wants blankets not arrowheads so my friend finds a weaver and trades him arrow heads for blankets he then trades the blankets to the farmer for a certain amount of wheat now what if instead of arrowheads which are very sharp and could cut him as he carries them my friend made a note for every arrowhead he had that's notes he would write if he wrote notes he couldn't meet the demand people would be out an arrowhead the problem is that he thinks of paper money as having intrinsic value he'll understand the arrowhead example has difficulty applying it to a broad economy and probably w good cause lol perhaps if you think of it this way paper money simply facilitates the ease of trading goods and services between people there is only so much demand for all the goods and services generated in an economy so that if you suddenly start printing money you get more money chasing the same amount of goods and services this causes the value of the money to go down thereby causing the price of all goods and services to go up wealth cannot just be generated out of thin air and there is a certain equilibrium this is what we call inflation in other words the more extra money the government prints the more it devalues it's currency your friend could make everyone millionaires if he wanted to by getting the government to print all this extra money however ask him if he would would rather be a millionaire in a worthless currency or have an average amount of money in a strong currency there is no advantage to increasing your amount of money if it's buying power diminishes at an equal rate  Inflation Hyperinflation Microeconomics Money Gold standard Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Fiat money Capitalism United States dollar Economics Bretton Woods system Supply and demand Keynesian economics Monetarism Gross domestic product Law of value Supply-side economics Money supply Balassa-Samuelson effect Commodity Trade Labor theory of value Capital accumulation Gold as an investment Reaganomics Banknote Currency Great Depression Economy of India Tariff Devaluation Free trade Privatization Economy of Russia Asian financial crisis Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Surplus value Exchange rate New Deal Economy of the United States Bond Intellectual property Economic history of Britain Prices of production RuneScape economy History of the United States (1918-1945) Free market Globalization Tax Unemployment Political economy International Monetary Fund Argentine Currency Board Labour economics FairTax Economy of Africa Mercantilism Economy of Colombia Model (economics) Surplus product Economy of Pakistan Canadian dollar American individualist anarchism Economy of Venezuela Transformation problem Euro Federal Reserve Roman currency Anarchist economics Productive and unproductive labour Australian dollar Economy of Mexico Gresham's law Heckscher-Ohlin model Social Credit Philippine peso Growth theory Marshall Plan Theory of conduct Yield curve Economic growth Wealth Capital controversy History of post-Soviet Russia Economy of Norway Welfare economics Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Fractional-reserve banking Purchasing power parity

animals in america have a higher standard of living than humans in other countries isn't that disgusting what do you think i personally think it is abhorrent how so many people buy little toys and clothes for their pets when there are people out there who aren't having their basic needs food and shelter met not saying that if ppl stopped doing this that we would solve world poverty but doesn't this stuff disturb you it disturbs me as it is an example of how disconnected we become from our actions as the world keeps getting smaller if everyone did stop buying cutesy things for their pets someone in a developing nation might well lose their job so that action may not be the wisest course but the way that the couple of bucks you spend on a chew toy is divided is a real problem it's usually the middlemen who end up taking a lot of the profit of offshore made goods avenues like 'fair trade' agricultural goods or stores like villages are a way around this disparity for a small percentage of those in developing countries promised but not enacted aid packages like the millennium development goals should also be realized such actions and aid is not only for those people 'over there' but is in our own best interests failed states are everyone's problem peace  Free trade Poverty W.

why does the fed reserve charge the govt treasury interest when the govt can print its own money maybe i'm completely confused with how the fed reserve system functions i can understand the fed printing money to say replace damaged currency from small banks but why are they entitled to charge the government interest for money which is instantly paid right back to them secondly where does the money generated from interest go any help would be greatly appreciated the federal reserve is not government it is private operated by the various commercial banks in the united states then it does not charge interest rates it sets interest rates as part of its role as central bank to influence the flow volume and direction of money supply in the country it is charged with managing the country's monetary policy which works hand in hand with the federal government's fiscal policy how it spends our taxes in influencing economic conditions hope that helps  Monetary policy Money supply Central bank Inflation Money Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Monetarism U.S. public debt Bretton Woods system Government debt Bank United States Department of the Treasury Deflation (economics) Argentine Currency Board Supply-side economics Economy of India Fiat money Economy of the United States Money creation Euro Keynesian economics Tax Reaganomics New Deal United States dollar Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hong Kong dollar Currency Fractional-reserve banking Asian financial crisis Bank of England Economy of Pakistan Independent agencies of the United States government U.S. ten-dollar bill International Monetary Fund Security (finance) Coalition Provisional Authority Milton Friedman Marshall Plan Capital accumulation Australian dollar Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Economy of Nigeria United States Secretary of the Treasury Gold as an investment Hong Kong Monetary Authority History of the United States (1918-1945) Gross domestic product Economic history of the United States Economy of El Salvador Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Legal tender Privatization Yield curve Bond Pound sterling Debt Economy of Sri Lanka Capitalism Student loan Sri Lanka NESARA History of post-Soviet Russia Exchange rate Deficit spending European System of Central Banks Economy of Ghana Jack Lang (Australian politician) Insurance Philippine peso Government of India Public education Corporation Taxation in the United States Say's law Business cycle United States Postal Service FairTax Economic relations of Japan Anarchism and capitalism Federation Real (currency) Economy of Norway Economy of Chile Canadian and American economies compared Macroeconomics

how do i determine certain popular currency quotes how do i determine certain popular currency quotes for example the exchange rate of gbp and usd is normally gbp usd the exchange rate of aud and usd is normally aud usd however the exchange rate of sgd and usd is normally usd sgd so i want to know the popular currency quotes for the following exchange rate pairs aud and gbp eur and aud nzd and gbp eur and nzd gbp and eur thank you that's a good question there is a hierarchy in ranking currencies there is some logic involved but the ranking is mostly traditional in the forex market the world's most important currency was traditionally prior to wwii the british pound therefore the gbp was always placed first in currency pairs ie gbp usd when the u s became the world's most important country after wwii the cross was never changed to usd gbp gbp usd is still used exclusively some british dominions were so closely linked to the u k that their currencies also took precedence in pairs such as aud usd and nzd usd this was despite the fact that australia's and new zealand's economies were not even comparable in size to the u s you will almost never see usd nzd quoted in the forex market in the market the canadian dollar is always quoted as usd cad but at the consumer level it is often quoted the other way around as cad usd when the euro came into existence it was decided that since it was the national currency of many wealthy powerful developed countries such as france germany and italy it should take precedence even over the british pound and the us dollar therefore the euro pound cross is quoted as eur gbp not gbp eur and it is eur usd to answer your other pairs they are gbp aud eur aud gbp nzd eur nzd you might find them quoted in reverse in local newspapers or on local tv but those are the official pairs  Pound sterling Canadian dollar Foreign exchange market CFA franc Exchange rate New Zealand dollar New Turkish lira Australian dollar Real (currency) Eurozone Jamaican dollar Argentine peso Table of historical exchange rates Romania Uruguayan peso Mexican peso Indian Rupee Norwegian krone Philippine peso Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

i have a question regarding perfect competition i've been taking some econ classes and came across the condition of p mc price marginal cost in a perfectly competitive industry that means all the firms are making zero profit if that is the case why would the firms even continue to operate they might as well spend their time on something else thanks d you have to remember that in perfect competition there are no fixed costs so people have no investment they have to recoup and the cost of labor is included in marginal cost what price equals marginal cost refers to is that no one makes any economic profit that is no one makes anything more than the cost of the materials and their time workers can't go do something else that would make them economic profit since people could costlessly switch over to making whatever it is and if they did nothing they couldn't pay for food which is also sold at marginal cost also firms in perfect competition are just individuals producing and selling their own goods this assumption is important because if people could band together and realize economies of scale they could make economic profit compared to those doing it all themselves the people can't go do another market because they would still not be making any economic profit since the industry they went into would also be perfectly competitive people just like materials are interchangable in the perfectly competitive model and there are no differences between any markets people are earning money but they are simply being paid the value of their time so they work because they don't want to starve or be homeless or lack the other things that society regards as essential to life but they can't get amass wealth or invest  Labor theory of value Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism Capital accumulation Labour economics Economics Monopoly Free trade Natural monopoly Surplus value Inflation Profit Economic inequality Perfect competition Externality Economy of Russia Prices of production Monopsony Political economy Privatization Progressive tax Tax Neoclassical economics Marginalism Gross domestic product FairTax Welfare economics Economic growth Criticisms of socialism Heckscher-Ohlin model Model (economics) Tariff Wealth Productive and unproductive labour Stackelberg competition Individualist anarchism American individualist anarchism Insurance Keynesian economics Transformation problem Commodity Minimum wage Theory of the firm Economic anthropology Labor-power Economic rent Intellectual property Organic composition of capital Price discrimination New Deal Capitalist mode of production Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Capital controversy Efficiency wages Deflation (economics) Marginal cost Great Depression Economic calculation problem Economy of the United States Principal-agent problem Unemployment Islamic banking Public good Economy of Nigeria Ford Motor Company Economy of Africa Karl Marx Cournot competition History of economic thought Constant capital History of the United States (1918-1945) Mutual fund Austrian School General equilibrium Economic history of Japan Economy of Norway Flat tax Primitive accumulation of capital Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Anarchist economics Opportunity cost Strategic management Rational pricing Management information system Corporate finance Hyperinflation Supply-side economics Nuclear power Bertrand competition Industrial Revolution Corporation Free market Bretton Woods system Unemployment types

what is the possible employment rate of a community well technically full employment is extremely improbable and uncommon the possible potential employment rate is really the natural rate of unemployment the natural rate of unemployment consists of two types of unemployment frictional and structural frictional unemployment is unemployment that results from people being temporarily displaced from jobs they are qualified willing and able to work but they have recently been fired or quit their job for whatever reason obviously they do not find another job instantly and there is a period of time when these people are unemployed hence frictional unemployment structural unemployment is the result of structural changes in the national economy if the auto industry for example is declining there will be national firms cutting costs and closing down factories displacing workers these workers are also well qualified willing and able to work but have now been fired without true fault however they are still unemployed and so structural unemployment is still factored into the natural rate of unemployment the natural rate of unemployment is unemployment that is both plausible common and well naturally occuring it is also always present and never equal to so therefore the possible levels of employment are never greater than natural rate of unemployment at least in the long run  Unemployment Unemployment types Full employment Inflation Unemployment benefit Economic inequality Underemployment Efficiency wages Working time Principal-agent problem Canadian and American economies compared Economy of Belgium Capitalism Explosive material Insurance Offshoring Economy of Russia Minimum wage Phillips curve Keynesian economics Economy of the United States Privatization Economic history of Japan Reaganomics Monopsony Compensation of employees Termination of employment Great Depression in the United Kingdom Welding Say's law Economy of Venezuela Great Depression Economy of Sweden Celtic Tiger Taxation in the United States Division of labour Education in the People's Republic of China Social Security (United States) Surplus labour Technocratic movement Exploitation Wal-Mart Tariff Economy of India Free trade Australian labour movement Economics Maritimes Economy of France Economy of Sri Lanka Economy of Haiti Economy of Pakistan Graduate school Wage slavery Capitalist mode of production Economy of the Netherlands Microeconomics Capital accumulation Current Population Survey Law of value Israeli Arab CPU cache Intelligence quotient Deficit spending Outsourcing Economic history of Canada Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Anarchism and capitalism Fire extinguisher Anarchism and society Diamond Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Germany Economy of Croatia George W.

do we really need two pence pieces if two pence pieces were taken out of circulation and the monetary value made up with extra pennies and pence pieces would this create any significant problems it seems to me that p pieces are largely unnecessary as a denomination two individual pennies don't exactly take up that much more space in your pocket than a single p piece the main concern that the central bank would have is the psychological effect of changing the currency the longer the currency all stays the same the more psychological confidence people tend to have in it this is actually why the us kept the traditional greenback look far too long the federal reserve system was more concerned with losing confidence than in counterfeiting  Euro Legal tender Gold standard Money Canadian dollar British coinage Pound sterling Australian dollar Monetary policy Fiat money Currency Money supply Hyperinflation Irish pound Coinage of the Republic of Ireland History of the halfpenny Inflation Philippine peso New Zealand dollar Deflation (economics) History of the English penny (1154-1485) Asian financial crisis Hong Kong dollar Romanian leu Bretton Woods system Government debt Monetarism Argentine Currency Board Renminbi Banknote U.S. one hundred-dollar bill Ringgit United States Note Shilling U.S. ten-dollar bill Gresham's law Supply-side economics Comorian franc Federal Reserve Jamaican dollar CFA franc Mexican peso U.S. five-dollar bill Central bank U.S. twenty-dollar bill Markka Liberty Dollar Great Depression U.S. fifty-dollar bill Debt Bank Economy of the United States Bank of England British Fifty Pence coin Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Microeconomics Supply and demand Real (currency) Rupiah Iraqi dinar U.S. two-dollar bill Fractional-reserve banking Cent (currency) Deutsche Mark Economy of India Slot machine Reserve Bank of India Large denomination bills in U.S. currency Article One of the United States Constitution International Monetary Fund Magic (illusion) Exchange rate Penny Red Banknotes of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Russia Gold Money creation Decimal Day Hong Kong Monetary Authority A Course In Miracles Rufiyaa Dime (U.S. coin) Psychology Euro banknotes U.S. public debt Counterfeit Central processing unit Polymer banknote Capital accumulation Nickel (U.S. coin) English plural Yen Economics Infantilism Bank of Canada Numerology Warez

why does usa export goods to japan provide economic reasons please in the simplest sense nations trade for similiar reasons why states counties cities individuals and even you trade it appears to make you and the seller better off i buy shoes from china because they are the cheapest at the best price even if i make bicycles and shoes better than you it pays for me to make bicycles and you to make shoes because then i can make more bicycles which i make relatively better this is the idea of comparative advantage this idea assumes that for some reason one person is better at something than another as if we were a little nation of idiosyncratic shopkeepers with inherent skills and artistic flair in reality information can be bought and sold and except for high tech goods most goods could be made by most people in most countries so unless a country restricts trade the jobs will go to those with the lowest wages it so happens that we subsidize our farm exports and i think this is our main export to japan japan actually does make cars better than the us and in order to sell their cars which they subsidize i think they buy our goods so to answer your question in a long winded way the reason why usa exports goods to japan is in part due to comparative advantage and in part due to government regulation  Free trade Microeconomics Law of value Supply and demand Capitalism Inflation Gross domestic product Minimum wage Trade Economics Bretton Woods system Tariff Capital accumulation Great Depression Protectionism Tax Japan-United States relations Gold standard Subsidy Agricultural policy Economy of the United States Corporation Measures of national income and output Utility cycling Economy of Mexico Arbitrage Heckscher-Ohlin model Neoliberalism Externality Hyperinflation Canadian and American economies compared U.S. public debt Offshoring Price discrimination Monetary policy Social Credit Asian financial crisis Economy of Fiji Sweatshop Economy of Singapore Economy of Belgium Scientology beliefs and practices Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Chile Monopsony Economy of Cuba Financial markets Health insurance Economy of Colombia Economy of Norway History of international trade United States Shrimp farm Economy of Venezuela Publicly funded medicine Monopoly Deflation (economics) Labor-power Yugo Slavery Stock market Value added tax Ford Motor Company FairTax Strategic management Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Europe Kyoto Protocol Intellectual property Airline Economy of Bolivia Exploitation Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Contract Economy of Switzerland Recumbent bicycle Mercantilism Economy of Taiwan Technology Classified information Unemployment Commodity American individualist anarchism State Filling station Internet fraud ITunes Music Store Economy of Rwanda Surplus value Sugar Toyota Camry Bicycle lighting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Romania

why did someone turn this answer in as a violation someone asked this why are there so many very poor people in mexico i answered this way why was it considered a violation from a history of latinos in america by juan gonzalez mexico and other parts of latin america suffer from the most uneven distribution of wealth in its history before the s latin americans generally protected their domestic industries through heavy government ownership high tariffs and import substitution mexico pursued that policy from to it averaged annual growth rates of more than percent with manufacturing output and real wages for workers growing consistently then came the debt crisis mexico was gradually pressured by u s controlled international financial institutions to adopt neoliberal free trade policies this included selling public assets and increasing exports to pay its debt the government sold off most of its state owned companies and privatized the banks instead of bringing prosperity privatization deepened the chasm between the rich and the poor new mexican billionaires emerged real wages plummeted and mexicans lost their jobs the term free trade seems positive at first glance won't increased trade with the u s bring increased prosperity to mexico history shows that most major industrialized nations did not practice free trade during their early periods of economic growth including the u s they used high tariffs to protect their domestic industries from foreign competition as mexico was doing before the free trade agreement only when countries such as england and the u s gained advantage over all other countries did they begin advocating free trade despite this historical record neoliberal economists in the advanced industrial nations continue to praise the fall of tariffs and the growth of free trade in places such as mexico in reality of all the trade in the world is between multinational corporations and one third of it represents multinational trading with their own foreign subsidiaries as a result the largest private traders and employers in mexico today are not mexican firms but u s corporations if free trade leads to greater prosperity why has economic inequality soared and poverty deepened in virtually every third world country that adopted neoliberal free trade policies source s harvest of empire by juan gonzalez this is nearly the exact theme of my senior thesis last year and everything you said is true probably some neoliberal uneducated schmuck who shops at walmart and works for exxon mobil turned you in  Gold standard Economy of Chile Chile Trade Economic inequality Economic history of Spain Economy of Belgium Economic history of Japan Mercantilism Great Depression Economy of Nigeria Canadian and American economies compared Great Depression in the United Kingdom Economy of Sri Lanka Gross domestic product Argentine Currency Board Monetary policy Microeconomics History of post-Soviet Russia Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Liberalism Anti-globalization Wal-Mart Economy of Haiti Protectionism New Deal Foreign policy of Japan Economy of Argentina Economy of Norway Economic history of the United States Origins of the American Civil War Supply-side economics Mexico North American Free Trade Agreement Economy of Singapore Unemployment History of the United States (1865-1918) Trickle down effect Economy of Venezuela Tax Economy of El Salvador Economic history of Britain Agricultural policy Inflation Economic growth Rise of the New Imperialism History of international trade History of the People's Republic of China (3/4) United States Fair trade History of the United States Balassa-Samuelson effect Keynesian economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Trade union Economy of Cuba Economy of Brazil History of Chile Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement Daewoo History of Argentina Shrimp farm Reaganomics New Imperialism History of Brazil Economy of Europe Economy of Indonesia 1973 oil crisis Economy of Bangladesh Minimum wage World government

how is free market capitalism diffrent from facism or social democracy in what ways do they differ in each others respects from conventional capitalism after all capitalist institutions like stock markets private companies ect can exist comfortablely as far to the right as fascism or as far to the left as social democracy these are all generalizations but hopefully point out some differences free market capitalism relies on the self interests of the purchaser of goods and services to select those goods and services that are of good quality and affordable in this way all vendors of the goods or services have an economic incentive to improve quality and reduce prices socialism says that for many goods and services capitalism is not the best model social programs hence the name socialism requires a pooling of resources and a requirement to relegate profits to a secondary position universal health care is an example and while not perfect arguably it produces a healthier population overall than the capitalist model democratic socialism is socialism in which the people rather than a central government decide which programs and to what extent those social programs will be exempt from the need to be self sustaining through profits i e the capitalist model fascism is the theory that a single controlling authority that has knowledge of all the facts should dictate social policy under fascism the western model of capitalism doesn't work interestingly the application of fascism is closer to the theory of communism than it is to socialism  Capitalism Socialism Privatization Free trade Intellectual property Microeconomics Inflation Keynesian economics Fascism Social democracy Public policy Publicly funded medicine Anarchism and capitalism Free market Unemployment Natural monopoly Labor theory of value Political economy Criticisms of socialism Monopoly Liberalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supply-side economics Ownership Anti-communism Left-wing politics Health insurance Gross domestic product Anarchism and society American individualist anarchism Democracy Planned economy Law of value Economic inequality Supply and demand Corporate governance Karl Marx Economy of Norway Conservatism Economic calculation problem Sociocultural evolution National Health Service Economy of Russia Corporation Economy of India Network effect Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Organic farming Insurance American Conservatism Corporate finance Socialist economics Political spectrum Social justice Right-wing politics Wal-Mart Globalization Strategic management Annuity Organic food History of the United States (1918-1945) State Nazism Commodity Communitarianism Anarchist economics Capital accumulation Libertarianism Market failure FairTax Price discrimination Left-Right politics Libertarian socialism Software engineering Productive and unproductive labour Socialism with Chinese characteristics Economy of the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Market economy Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Economy of Pakistan Graduate school Economy of South Africa Individualist anarchism Hyperinflation Psychology Model (economics) Worldwide green parties History of the People's Republic of China (2/4) Monetary policy Trademark History of economic thought Management

how can feelings of boredom come from winning the lottery winning the lottery is filling up on the outside material things but that doesn't fill up the inside feeling fulfilled at peace etc sadly too many people believe if they just had more money a bigger car a bigger house etc they'd be happy when they get these things they're often dismayed to find they are still not fulfilled well maybe temporarily until the novelty wears off but they are left empty on the inside mother teresa said it best when she went to the states and said she felt more sorry for americans than she did those in calcutta because in the states she saw a spiritual poverty many were lonely unfufilled and disconnected from each other this can of course be extended to include other developed nations in calcutta she said the needs were easy to meet if a person was hungry give them food if they need shelter give them a bed whereas a poverty on the inside is a much deeper need and harder to fill  Mother Teresa Happiness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sant Thakar Singh Lottery Grandview, U.S.A.

why does capitalism fail why does communism fail what was called 'communism' was nothing more than state capitalism in other words the transfer of the means of production from the capitalist class to a state bureaucracy did not result in the workers control of the means of production hence the exploitation of labor persisted albeit in a heavily regulated centrally planned state so this leads to just one question 'why does capitalism fail' according to marx increased investment in and growth of constant capital factories machines land buildings raw materials relative to variable capital labor reduced the margin of surplus labor time with respect to total capital constant capital plus variable capital since surplus labor time is the source of surplus value and since profit equals surplus value divided by total capital then the tendential fall in surplus labor time relative to total capital results in a tendential fall in the rate of profit mathematically marx put it as follows since p s c and c c v where p rate of profit s surplus value c constant capital and v variable capital then an increase in c relative to v means an increase in c relative to s which means a decrease in p even as investment in constant capital increases productivity i e the margin of surplus labor relative to regular labor and thus of surplus value relative to variable capital it reduces profits i e the margin of surplus value relative to total capital the capitalist then responds by investing more in raising productivity which in turn reduces profits further and so on and so forth in a vicious cycle of diminishing returns this tendency eventually leads to a catastrophic breakdown in the capital cycle of course one can stave of these crisis by imperialism imperialism produces fresh influxes of profits now a days this influx is produced by combination of forcing odious debts upon third world counties by lending to corrupt dictators who keep the money but the debt is transferred to the population engineering favorable conditions to the industrial capitalists of third world economies through neoliberal trade policies and some new school what i call fake facade imperialism like in iraq  Economy of Russia Inflation Capital accumulation Constant capital Microeconomics Karl Marx Law of value Marxism Labor-power Bretton Woods system Prices of production Transformation problem Commodity Economy of Pakistan Tariff Economic relations of Japan Organic composition of capital Socialist economics Deflation (economics) Economy of Norway Industrial Revolution Unemployment Political economy Tax Surplus labour Primitive accumulation of capital Economic growth Globalization Production theory basics Capitalist mode of production Marshall Plan Economy of the United States Gross domestic product Economic inequality Class struggle American individualist anarchism Economy of Africa Socialism Progressive tax Productive and unproductive labour Wealth Economics Value product Business cycle Economy of India Supply-side economics History of the Soviet Union Economic history of Spain Monopsony Exogenous growth model Privatization Production function Economy of the People's Republic of China Gold standard Growth theory Economic history of Britain Economy of Taiwan Monopoly Hyperinflation Supply and demand Anti-communism Exploitation Economic calculation problem Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Great Depression Economic history of Japan Economy of Venezuela Neoliberalism Argentine Currency Board Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia History of economic thought Rise of the New Imperialism Virtuous circle and vicious circle Social Security debate (United States) Libertarian socialism Bank Economy of Chile Anti-globalization Economy of Colombia Deficit spending Corporate finance Free market Minimum wage Economy of Brazil Working time

why in many jobs does it seem the lower one's position the harder one's work i don't think she meant harder as in more physically challenging i've been in jobs where the entry level positions have the more mentally challenging jobs as well the days where specialists were promoted are over talent won't ever make you a manager many companies don't even allow people to become managers and hire people directly to managerial positions straight out of college because they were business administration or psychology majors or had previous management experience management of people is a trade in itself and managers and administrators shouldn't be looked at as being above you so much as they are in a different line of work people in higher positions do honestly have simpler day to day tasks the trade off is that they're accountable for the actions of everyone in lower positions when you do something wrong they do something wrong even if they could do nothing to prevent it it's actually scary having people working for you that know ten times as much about their job as you do and a good manager knows the way to earn the respect of their employees is to focus on the administrative aspects of their job give their employees the room and materials they need to do their job and keep everyone else out of their way a good manager isn't a slave driver he's the guy that makes it possible for everyone else to do what they're good at all that said the other benefit to not being a manager is that once you're experienced and skilled enough you can work for whoever will pay you the most money and the few bad managers out there that are full of themselves aren't your problem anymore get good enough at what you do and you can triple their salary and feel good about yourself because you did it the hard way  Unemployment Theory of conduct Outsourcing Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Corporate governance The nature of God in Western theology Capitalism Division of labour Procrastination Economics Game programmer American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Strategic management Scientology beliefs and practices Transactional analysis Microeconomics Graduate school Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Inflation Offshoring Final Fantasy XI Baseball Minimum wage Enron Corporation Economic inequality Extreme Programming Arturo Frondizi Wal-Mart Air traffic controller Productive and unproductive labour Labour economics Toronto Raptors Social rule Professor New Deal Monetary policy Workplace democracy Tariff Gross domestic product Efficiency wages Social Security (United States) Health insurance Sweatshop Principal-agent problem Volleyball Labor-power Salary Martial art Keynesian economics Newcastle United F.C. 401(k) Anarchism and capitalism Chess strategy and tactics Professional wrestling slang Tai Chi Chuan Arguments for and against drug prohibition Capital accumulation Economy of Africa Windows XP Plame affair Insurance Israeli Arab MMORPG Master of Business Administration Vicente Fox Anarchism and society Unemployment benefit Guild Redundant array of independent disks Exploitation Intelligence quotient Electronic commerce Credit card Great Depression Customer relationship management W.

the rich keeps getting richer and the poor just keeps getting poorer my question is how can the poor get out of this cycle and start moving into the average sides of things middle class and beyond the poor guy's way of thinking is rooted in the deeply ingrained belief that they do not deserve prosperity they do not deserve better so it is easier to complain and find excuses to justify being poor it is easy to say they are discriminated against or any other lame excuse especially when they want great earnings in exchange for very little work out of two guys working in the same office doing the same job if one goes the extra mile stays late to help sometimes enrolls in optional training courses offered by the company while the other one who leaves at pm sharp because they do not get paid overtime or refuses to take additional training is the first to complain when overlooked for promotions raises or bonuses poor people expect others to help them especially if others have more money than they do think poor and you will remain poor instead of slaving away for a minimum wage find a creative way to earn money yes it involves work but if you find a way eventually you will have more time and more money poor people tend to repeat the same patterns that kept their parents poor they tend to repeat the same mistakes and stay in the same place they need to break out of that noxious environment girls in slums for example most of them expect to have an abusive father or other male relatives they expect probable sexual abuse by their relatives or boyfriends they expect repeated teen pregnancies they expect an irresponsible and absent biological father in each case they expect the fact that they will probably not finish high school and that they will end up working in a fast food joint or as prostitutes or whatever as long as this information does not change they are well programmed and headed in that direction we are deserving of so many things we just don't dare believe it is true or possible  Economic inequality Capitalism Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China Flat tax Minimum wage Friends Domestic violence EastEnders Capital accumulation Microeconomics Abortion debate Simone Weil Make money fast Public policy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Days of our Lives Keynesian economics The Amazing Race Wealth Principal-agent problem Rape Poker jargon Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Poverty Anorexia nervosa Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Economy of Africa Affirmative action Prisoner's dilemma Alexander Technique Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Wealth condensation Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Arbitrage Anarchism and capitalism Tax Craps Technical analysis Wal-Mart The O.C.

why is it that a closed economy can have goods market equilibrium and yet have a large degree of unemployment using the keynesian model well my guess would be that because there are no external factors influencing the closed economy's aggregate supply and demand like international imports and exports the economy can usually have a pretty steady equilibrium but because there are no imports and exports and the shipping industry is a huge industry there are fewer job opportunities thus creating a higher unemployment rate  Economics Microeconomics Inflation Supply and demand Unemployment Aggregate demand General equilibrium Gross domestic product Bretton Woods system Labor theory of value Minimum wage Neoclassical economics Neo-Keynesian Economics IS/LM model Gold standard Great Depression in the United Kingdom Economy of the United States Say's law Law of value Capitalism Monetarism Reaganomics Austrian School Model (economics) Deflation (economics) Macroeconomics Phillips curve Monetary policy Economic growth Growth theory Economy of Russia Economic inequality Economic history of Canada Economy of Japan Free trade Rational expectations Economy of Venezuela Economy of India Economy of Pakistan History of the United States (1918-1945) Free market Economic equilibrium Business cycle Canadian and American economies compared Mercantilism Economy of Colombia Economy of Sri Lanka Economy of Africa Aggregate supply Progressive tax Economy of Senegal Industrial Revolution Economy of Taiwan Trickle down effect Economic history of Spain Hydrogen economy Capital accumulation Economy of Haiti Economy of the Philippines Economy of Argentina Subsidy World economy Economy of Norway Great Depression Economy of Malta Monopsony Economy of Fiji Economy of Israel Supply-side economics Underemployment Economy of Germany Prices of production Economy of the Netherlands Economy of Sweden Economy of Cuba Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Economy of Chile Economy of New Zealand Economy of Ecuador Economy of Egypt Economy of Nicaragua Economy of Paraguay Economy of Iceland Tax Economy of Armenia Efficiency wages Deficit spending Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economy of Italy Economy of Slovakia Post-Keynesian economics Economy of France Economy of Macau

is there a correlation between income and number of children per household i have noticed from my experience that families with lower incomes seem to have more kids than those with seemingly more income has anyone else thought this is there a connection there is a clear connection between this and it's not a recent phenom even in days before birth control the wealthy had generally much smaller families today birth control has created negitive population growth in affluent nations that and stresses of every day life then you have the old life is so miserably why bring a child into this life kind of attitude there is even a group that seeks to wipe humanity off the face of the earth somebody besides terrorists i mean forget the name of the group but their stated goal is the elimanation of mankind the age old theory was that the poor needed larger families to survive as the children were put to work as soon as they were able the larger the labor pool the better chances of survival though the rationale was weak even in older days today in the us for example the rationale doesn't fit at all true children do cause a bit of poverty having a child is not cheap many people are limited by child care in the pursuit of very demanding careers so they put it off until it's too late some folks just don't want to have children at all mostly it's they wait until they are older to have children but something goes wrong the plumbing ceases working or they never find the just right time and the next thing they know they are and still childless there is a deeper connection it's not abundance of food i've seen many a poor american with four or more children who looked like they at the neighbors the folks down the block and a car on the way over to wherever i saw them so there is something else environmental that goes with affluence which turns off something in our chemistry and reduces or elimanates fertility  Overpopulation Wealth Peter Singer Capitalism Birth control Simone Weil Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Keynesian economics Human Abortion debate Eugenics Economic inequality Childbirth Goodness and value theory God Human nature Supply and demand Vitamin C Randomness Economics Economy of Africa Modernism Socrates Flat tax Piccolo Junior Saga Philosophy of language Urbanization Origin belief Unemployment Equine conformation Guns, Germs, and Steel Karen Horney Meaning of life Law of value Urinary incontinence Biology and sexual orientation Ecology Capital accumulation Sociocultural evolution Soul Nicomachean Ethics Humphrey Bogart Social psychology Infantilism Derek Parfit American individualist anarchism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Theodicy Poker jargon The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Daylight saving time Free trade Future energy development Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sant Thakar Singh Redundant array of independent disks Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Wood Extinction Altruism Time Out of Mind A Course In Miracles Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia John Howard Yoder The Origin of Species Tamriel Elephant Physical attractiveness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anarcho-primitivism Nuclear magnetic resonance Organic farming Philipp Melanchthon Liberalism Transsexuality Paradox Technocratic movement Margaret Sanger Social rule Cephalic disorder Jacobo Arenas Objectivist philosophy Shifting cultivation Gold standard Iraq disarmament crisis Jon Secada

how much money is in the world an estimate just curious i saw something the other night on vh about guys who work for wallstreet and take home billions and billions a year for their salary i understand that new money is made every day but not a lot or that would cause inflation making the prices go up etc i know that we have different currencies so that's why i asked for an estimate in us dollars if you can otherwise i'll find a converter or something i think it'd be in the area of trillions of dollars but i really have no idea the answer to this depends upon exactly what your question is if your question is something like what is the total amount of money earned by all the people in the world in a year then the answer is very roughly trillion dollars the sum of the gnps gross national product for all the countries of the world note to the picky i realize that the gnp and gdp differ and that neither of those is the sum of earnings but i'm assuming that we're talking to a non economist here if your question is about the total price of all the things in the world rather than annual income spending then the amount is much higher but i don't know what it is probably around ten times as much trillion a third possible interpretation of your question is how many dollars are there if i counted up the physical dollars i don't know how much that adds up to but keep in mind that there are nowhere as many physical dollars in circulation as there are dollars being spent your boss pays you and you take those dollars to the grocery store and spend them and then the grocery store employees take those to the clothing store and so on if you get paid per year that doesn't mean that there are little green pieces of paper in fact the federal reserve board in the u s uses at least different measures of money the least important of which is the number of little pieces of paper and coins another includes money in checking accounts even though those dollars are electronic not paper metal the problem gets even more complex because using money to measure everything can be misleading someone once calculated the value of ecosystem services fresh water clean air etc as approximately trillion per year which was about the same as the world gdp per year trillion at the time but that's misleading the ecosystem services have an effectively infinite value because without them we are all dead another problem is that gnp gdp doesn't count volunteer work and doesn't count work by homemakers stay at home wives or husbands and farmers who grow just about as much as they eat buying or selling very little are calculated as adding almost nothing to the world gdp that's why you see numbers such as the average per person income in chad is per year obviously these people would all be dead if they were living on per year much of their work and food simply isn't counted in the economy yes i know that a lot of people in chad are dying or already dead but even more of them would be if they were truly living on per year and gnp gdp is a measure of activity not benefit so it includes the cost of cleaning up pollution putting people in jail etc even though those are really costs not benefits so it's difficult to answer your question without pinning down the exact meaning again if you want total annual income of all the people on earth it's very very roughly trillion so your guess of trillions of dollars isn't a bad guess  FairTax U.S. public debt Surplus value Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Economic growth United States dollar Labor theory of value Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India Economic inequality World economy Taxation in the United States Euro Gold standard Economy of Belgium Money Arthur Laffer Flat tax Social Security (United States) Economics Monetary policy Economy of the People's Republic of China Economy of Fiji Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of Nigeria Pound sterling Genuine Progress Indicator Labour economics Bretton Woods system Law of value Economy of Egypt Wal-Mart Future energy development Economic history of Japan Economy of Venezuela Wealth Derivative (finance) Economy of Mexico Double counting Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Chile Asian financial crisis Growth theory Supply-side economics Economy of Macau National Kidney Foundation Singapore Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of Romania Annuity Economy of Africa Keynesian economics Economy of Kuwait Purchasing power parity Compensation of employees Normal distribution Government debt Argentine Currency Board Economic history of Spain Economy of Colombia New Deal Value of Earth Economy of Argentina Trade Supply and demand Economy of the Central African Republic Kyoto Protocol Theory of conduct Canadian and American economies compared Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake People's Republic of China Wheel of Fortune CPU cache Bank Value added Currency Economy of Norway Insurance Interest Alcohol fuel

rhenan capitalism and italy why has italy been the worst performing g country in recent years read this one year old report and think about what helps discipline and efficiency of non discriminating competitive markets for everything including labor but excluding few unavoidable social goods or corrupt fascists govts that distribute favours and capable of protecting the lazy and the incompetent in the name of protecting the weak and the poor march ''economic brief italy's weak economy'' by the organization for economic cooperation and development o e c d figures that were published on march in the annual organization's factbook confirm that italy's economy is in a crisis although the same sources say italian companies expect that the situation will improve five years down the road as pinr argued the present government has proved unable to perform significant reforms in its last year before the elections so that a continuation of the country's malaise and poor economic performance was inevitable such a framework is reflected by national and international statistics g d p figures for the last quarter of highlight the lack of growth coupled by a fall in consumer spending and investments moreover analysts have pointed out that high inventories may be bad for output prospects because businesses could end up drawing on stocks to meet demand at the expense of an output incr whose poor performance has reflected the sluggishness of its three core economies germany france and italy which account for of euro area gdp all three suffer from europe's familiar troubles of excessive labour and product market rigidities too high public spending and taxes and too much regulation yet last week's news that italy fell back into recession in the first quarter of while france and germany picked up suggests that italy has even graver problems than the bigger two those problems are spread wide across the economy business and politics as this week's oecd report on italy highlights again the country's slow economic growth mainly reflects its structural failings the miracle years of the s and s created an economy that depended heavily on small manufacturing firms many of them concentrated in the north and in such specialist areas as textiles furniture machine tools food processing and white goods such companies needed a low cost base to sustain competitiveness in times of inflation this was secured by devaluations of the lira that get out is no longer available now that italy is using the euro it also happens that these industries are the ones most vulnerable not just to competition from the rest of europe but increasingly from asia notably china it is no surprise that italy's textile firms are in the forefront of those demanding new protection from brussels against chinese exports makers of furniture and white goods are suffering similarly and italian companies are losing market share to chinese rivals not just in europe but in world markets too no wonder businessmen in italy are feeling ever more pessimistic even as they struggle to cope with a somnolent economy they can also point to a string of recent steps that have undermined their own confidence as well as that of foreign investors see article things began to go visibly wrong two years ago when trouble still unresolved erupted at fiat the country's flagship carmaker and when italy's retail banks arrogantly sold high risk bonds to their customers as if they were safe the bonds were issued by argentina and by two italian firms cirio and parmalat the country defaulted while the two food groups went bust the fraud that brought down parmalat showed that italy's system of corporate governance was rotten the regulatory response though quick at first became sluggish once politicians thought a crisis had been averted although parmalat has been rescued prosecution of those who nearly destroyed it has been less than zealous this reverses a slow trend for such companies to become independent of the political graft and favours that once made italy pay a big premium to borrow in international markets mr scaroni now has a chance to prove that he can resist political interference just as mr mincato did but eni's shareholders will be watching nervously to see how the company behaves under its new management similarly foreign investors are waiting to see whether the extraordinary saga of two attempted takeovers of italian banks by foreign ones ends happily ie the foreigners win or in farce at this point the outcome remains hazy but the bank of italy and consob italy's stockmarket regulator have so far displayed a disturbing mixture of protectionism and sloth italy's poor performance has not only damaged business it has also undermined living standards that is the main reason italians are turning away from the centre right coalition led by silvio berlusconi that has been in office since although mr berlusconi got better news from local elections in sicily this week see article other recent elections have confirmed that his government is now deeply unpopular distracted by legal matters dependent on his fractious coalition partners mr berlusconi has delivered too few reforms though his personal business interests have prospered his cure for italy's public finances has been mostly one off measures such as tax amnesties the budget deficit is now ballooning again he has managed to cut taxes a little but nothing like as much as he once promised he has made some changes to pensions and social security but in general his reform efforts have been too little too late ease what is even more worrisome for italy is that the country lacks good results in almost every key field to be competitive in the globalized economy whereas both western powers especially the u s the u k the scandinavian countries spain and in part also germany and asian rising stars such as china south korea and india are showing strength areas where italy is lacking include basic scientific research innovation in high tech and labor productivity also disappointing is the lack of strategy to reduce the country's alarming energy dependence during the election campaign marked by bitter competition between the ruling right of center majority and its left of center challengers political leaders have once again evoked foreign countries' policies to reverse the negative trends since a social crisis may erupt when liberal oriented labor rules are actually implemented the next government will need to work hard to avoid being destabilized by predictable harsh criticisms should substantial reforms be rapidly introduced and a new optimism surface expect foreign investors to compete for taking the best advantage out of it read also the review in the economist as follows for a while the country's ills have seemed merely part of those of the wider euro zone

why is the us dollar falling against all other major currencies since the last couple of years is it due to policies of the us govt to decrease the large trade deficit or some other reason actually what i want t know is what specific policies are being followed by the us to devalue its currency is is printing excess dollars or money market intervention by the fed reserve or something else also the obvious way to repay federal deficits trade deficits is to devalue the currency owed this way they don't have to raise taxes or appear to cut spending since they can just put an inflation tax on the entire population the anger at chinese currency manipulation is based on our politicians being upset that the chinese have bought more and more dollars driving up demand and price for usd artificially undervaluing the yuan is the same thing as artificially overvaluing the dollar its a long way down well international demand plays a huge part in the value of the product deficits of all types reduce investor demand don't want to buy into a company that lives off the credit card low interest rates reduce demand obviously they continue to increase the supply at a rapid pace they use 'tough talk' with the chinese to decrease their demand when they say let the yuan float they're really saying let the dollar fall so its a combination of government spending patterns consumer spending patterns diplomacy and monetary policy there are probably other mechanisms that i'm not thinking of too oh yeah gdp growth is sluggish some estimates say we'll be beat by japan and the eu for the first time in a long time when it comes to economic growth as a of gdp this also reduces demand in american backed assets equities and therefor reduces demand for dollars another thing thats unrelated to any of our policies is the world currency reserves have already been mostly built up in dollars with the eu proving a viable alternative those government money managers are looking to diversify their savings by selling dollars and buying euros until they reach a safer balance the more you diversify an investment the less likely you are to lose money and the last few years have been the first chance for people to diversify into a third currency as strong as the yen or dollar well there's also the international oil markets they've been denominated in dollars for a long time and that increases demand for dollars you need dollars to be in the market profiting off that industry some oil producers are switching to a euro based market and this has the effect of increasing demand for euros  Bank Economy of Belgium Economy of Nigeria Economic relations of Japan Government debt Economic history of Spain Bond Great Depression Economy of Brazil PE ratio Free trade Economy of Colombia Money Deficit spending 1973 oil crisis Capitalism Economy of Venezuela FairTax Economy of Suriname History of the United States (1980-1988) Fiat money Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Economy of the European Union Foreign exchange market Devaluation Australian dollar Economy of El Salvador Economy of Argentina International Monetary Fund Currency Economy of Cuba Economy of Africa Canadian and American economies compared Social Security debate (United States) Tariff Privatization Economics History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Senegal Economy of Hungary Tax Economy of Guyana Economy of South Africa Economy of Brunei Economy of the Netherlands Arbitrage Progressive tax Interest Economy of Macau Economy of Lebanon Romania Security (finance) George W.

would the only way to end poverty in the united states and beyond be the following to limit the salary of the higest paid employee owner to x the salary of thier lowest paid employee the rich could still stay rich and i'm not saying they don't earn it and there is no limit to how rich they could get the only thing that would limit that is how well thier company is doing and the whole country would be in a better place all round if everyone had a piece of the pie that the elite have and notice i said salarys not company profit the companies would not go bankrupt nor would the c e o s but the ceo's would have less but by no means nothing they just couldn't go out and buy the mona lisa as long as thier employees couldn't afford the gas is it the only way probably not is it a good way probably many of the answerers cringed at the idea of limiting incomes and its effect on incentives and on hard work however much of this country's growth occurred when we in fact had lower employee owner ratios i think in the 's when a average income family could often afford to live with one bread winner and it was not impossible for them to also purchase a home the ratio was much smaller than it was today possibly smaller than what you are suggesting people should be rewarded for hard work but oddly enough that should not be only criteria if you want a healthy economy it is important to have a large middle class to to be able to afford all those things that capitalists make and many of today's billionaires a point made famously by warren buffet end up giving their money to charity or arguing that people like him should pay more taxes it is hard to imagine that someone like warren buffet would work less hard if some of the money that he donated to charity would be taxed away or given to his employees  Microeconomics Capitalism Progressive tax Flat tax Economic inequality Capital accumulation Mutual fund Tax Anarchism and capitalism Warren Buffett Ownership Wealth condensation Minimum wage Inflation Salary cap FairTax Stock Deflation (economics) Surplus value Health insurance Taxation in the United States Reaganomics Unemployment Criticisms of socialism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Free trade Insurance Tax cut Wealth 401(k) Supply-side economics Supply and demand Donald Trump Money Gold standard Annuity Investment bank Outsourcing Intellectual property Life insurance Steve Jobs Public policy Economy of Russia Live 8 Publicly funded medicine Economy of Africa Keynesian economics Credit card Poker jargon Economy of the United States Principal-agent problem Working time Mergers and acquisitions Airline Compensation of employees Instant-runoff voting Kyoto Protocol Great Depression Labor-power Economics Google Offshoring United Kingdom corporation tax Commodity Tax bracket Paradox PE ratio Unemployment benefit Debt Canadian and American health care systems compared Surplus labour Say's law Monetary policy Trade Arthur Laffer Final Fantasy XI Primitive accumulation of capital Enron Corporation Labour economics Wheel of Fortune Tuition Capitalist mode of production Article One of the United States Constitution Social class Sweatshop Economy of India Serfdom

has nuclear power ever been economical i hope to hear from some real economists with real statistics don't forget to include the waste issue yes i have heard of europe and asia are you familiar with chernobyl chelyabinsk and sellafield actually for the very first time nuclear power appears to be economical right now fpl group is buying reactors for million dollars the worth of a nuclear plant is very complex based on its age output and operating history years ago units were selling for well under million so what's changed all of the original calculations for building a nuclear power plant were based on run performance that were never obtained until the last five years life cycle waste and decommissioning costs are actually pretty well integrated into the value of the plant each reactor comes with a bank account that slowly amasses more money that is reserved for post shutdown activities when point beach was recently sold it was disclosed its decommissioning fund contained million now reactors are still tremendously expensive to build and there is a lot of uncertainty regulatory political operational and economic associated with building new plants but existing plants when they run well are generally adored by the accountants at an energy company or at least that's what my company's accountants tell me this issue is not a trivial yes no kind of thing but the answer is big no if you look at past performance and yes if you look at current performance  Nuclear power Nuclear power phase-out Nuclear power plant Energy development Future energy development Nuclear energy policy Pebble bed reactor Nuclear fuel cycle Boiling water reactor Sellafield Chernobyl accident Hydrogen economy Iran's nuclear program Microeconomics Magnox Alternative fuel Capital accumulation Radioactive waste Inflation Economy of Pakistan Manitoba Hydro Fusion power Bechtel Corporation Three Mile Island Environmental concerns with electricity generation Global warming Fast breeder CANDU reactor Alcohol fuel Privatization Pressurized water reactor Wind power Gross domestic product Mutual fund Insurance Bank Monetary policy BNFL Iran and weapons of mass destruction Inertial confinement fusion Renewable energy RBMK Money supply ITER United States dollar Power station Nuclear proliferation Biodiesel Economy of the United States Tennessee Valley Authority Asian financial crisis Gold standard Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant Atomic Energy of Canada Limited Dounreay National Kidney Foundation Singapore Cold fusion Economy of Nigeria Deflation (economics) Technetium Organic farming Gold as an investment SCO-Linux controversies Surplus value Life insurance Electric power transmission Hyperinflation Money Temasek Holdings Shutdown Hanford Site Economy of Russia United States Naval reactor Nuclear technology Safety engineering SL-1 Nuclear Regulatory Commission Ontario Power Generation Tax Computer Void coefficient Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Energy Policy Act of 2005 Commodity markets Hubbert peak theory Software patent debate Indian Navy Hedge fund Economy of Iceland Biodiversity Model (economics)

the australian reserve bank controls the money supply and the lending rate isn't that a conflict of interest as far as i can gather the reserve bank puts additional money into circulation by purchasing a promisary note from one of the banks sort of like an iou the bank promises to repay the cash with interest at some point then the bank has extra cash to lend on the other hand the reserve bank controls the base interest rate for lending thus supplying more money puts pressure on inflation then the reserve bank responds by increasing the interest rate what the can someone shed some light on this thankyou all very much for your answers i am not just infering that the reserve bank can make money by manipulating the money market there are other reasons for doing so i'm sure more than i could personally imagine one example is to devalue personal savings through inflation yes it is a glaring conflict of interest it is modeled after the highly successful scam perpetrated by wealthy bankers in the us namely the federal reserve bank go to google videos and search for the movie zeitgeist that's a very good primer in modern politics the movie is thoroughly researched has a good pace good music and is incredibly informative highly recommended it will shed light into this very dark area  Inflation Money Monetary policy Bank Money supply Gold standard Hyperinflation Supply-side economics Central bank Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Fiat money Money creation Bond Federal Reserve Monetarism Citigroup Argentine Currency Board Asian financial crisis Mortgage Microeconomics Keynesian economics Privatization Economy of the United States Australian dollar United States dollar Government debt Pound sterling Arthur Laffer Euro Confidence trick Annuity Devaluation Say's law Credit card FairTax Islamic banking U.S. public debt Tariff Deficit spending Exchange rate Free trade Taxation in the United States Economy of India Social Security (United States) Bank fraud History of the United States (1865-1918) Finance Tax Financial markets Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Reserve Bank of New Zealand Economy of Pakistan Security (finance) Expert system Investment bank Marshall Plan Wheel of Fortune Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bank of England Password Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Wall Street 1973 oil crisis Surplus value Reserve requirements Insurance Mergers and acquisitions Economic relations of Japan American individualist anarchism History of the United States (1918-1945) History of post-Soviet Russia Commodity Economy of Argentina Usury Economy of Brazil Reaganomics Model (economics) Baccarat Money market Life insurance Capital accumulation Economy of Ghana Supply and demand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation PE ratio Hubbert peak theory

question about econmics comparable worth is the name of a movement that began in the s to determine the worth of different jobs and then to adjust relative wage rates to the relative worth of those jobs the movement gains most of its support from the belief that women are unfairly discriminated against in the labor market the jobs at which most of them work e g secretaries and nurse are widely and unfairly regarded as women s jobs and so are allegedly paid less than their comparable worth the comparison is with jobs traditionally held by men a can a job have an inherent worth can you think of any question where the worth of a job is not its value to some particular party in a specific situation b imagine a medical clinic with medical doctors one nurse and one laboratory technician is it plausible to suppose that an additional nurse or lab technician could have more worth to the clinic in such a situation than an additional doctor c the worth or value that influences decisions is always marginal worth or value why is a secretary worth more to the economics department if it employs only one than if it employs eight describe a situation in which the worth of a secretary to the economics department would likely be greater than the worth of an economist fully armed with a ph d d why will an employer who follows the maximizing rule of chapter do more if marginal revenue want to pay each employee a wage equal to his or her marginal worth what would be implied by the assertion that an employer was paying employees less than their marginal worth a anytime jobs are limited by outside intervention the job will not be paid an efficient wage b sure it is probably likely given your desciption that the marginal value product of a dr is lower then the nurse however it must be viewed from a stand point that a doctor can do everything a nurse can do but a nurse can not do everything a doctor can do that is from a legal standpoint c again their is diminishing value to work done by a secretary hiring gains a large benefit the th will not it is very difficult to compare the marginal value of a professor vs a secretary a phd can teach do research bring in grants a secretary can not d the problem is informational if the employer is paying a wage less then the marginal product value then the employee is in error why is the employee taking the wage if the employee has no other option for work then they are being paid their marginal value as determined by the market otherwise some other firm would hire them away for a wage just above what they are receiving now  Microeconomics Unemployment Labour economics Economic inequality Monopsony Economics Inflation Supply and demand Efficiency wages Trade union Principal-agent problem Affirmative action Tax Minimum wage Capitalism Division of labour Paralegal Exploitation Progressive tax Wal-Mart Labor theory of value Labor-power Free trade Theory of the firm Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Price discrimination Keynesian economics Publicly funded medicine Unemployment types Conscription New Deal Welfare economics Insurance Medicine Anarchism and capitalism Monopoly FairTax Abortion debate Law of value Nurse American individualist anarchism Monetary policy Prostate cancer Outsourcing Tariff Supply-side economics Externality Say's law Mediation Immigration to the United States Economy of the United States Surplus labour Pharmaceutical company Education in Portugal Production theory basics Economic rent Neoclassical economics Civil rights Capital accumulation Employment Criticism of libertarianism Offshoring Public good Single Transferable Vote Surplus value Production function Education in the People's Republic of China Privatization Software engineering Strategic management Taxation in the United States Free market Capital controversy Graduate school Psychology Intelligent design Expert system Gross domestic product Anarcho-capitalism Roe v.

impact on software proffesionals due to the rupee rise in india hi what will appen to the people working in big companies like ibm intel etc are they going to loose the job the initial impetus for the outsourcing of jobs to india was because of the high level of education of workers the fact that most spoke english and the fact that they were much less expensive than american software engineers there are a couple of factors that are slowing down the outsourcing trend now first of all as you mentioned the indian rupee is appreciating against the dollar this reduces the benefit software companies get when they can pay employees in rupees instead of dollars second of all and probably more importantly indian workers are demanding higher wages there are only a limited number of software engineers india can produce every year and as more companies come to depend on them the cost of their services gets bid up they are still much cheaper than u s software engineers but the gap is closing the third factor is that u s firms are realizing that outsourcing all of their functions offshore is not always the right move dell for example had to bring their corporate technical support back to the united states after they got complaints from their customers there is also the time difference to consider companies don't like to have to wait an entire day to resolve issues because it's night in india and everyone is asleep i do not think that in the end indians who are already employed will lose their jobs due to any of the factors i have mentioned above what will happen is that fewer jobs will be moved to india in the future as u s companies rationalize their operations the wages of indians won't be as high as if the exchange rate of the rupee had remained constant against the dollar but there will still be jobs  Call centre Economic inequality Economy of India Minimum wage Inflation Microsoft Free trade Wal-Mart Labour economics Economy of Russia Trade union Monetary policy Unemployment Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Natural monopoly International Computers Ltd CPU cache CPU design Insurance Microeconomics Arbitrage Efficiency wages Redundant array of independent disks Offshore outsourcing Celtic Tiger Indian general elections, 2004 RISC Health insurance Mainframe computer IBM Software engineering Working time Tariff Supply and demand Mutual fund Labor theory of value Capital accumulation Indian Rupee Principal-agent problem Academic publishing IBM PC compatible Progressive tax Compiler optimization Economy of Sri Lanka Price discrimination Social Security (United States) Canadian and American economies compared Education in the People's Republic of China Flat tax Information Technology Infrastructure Library Central processing unit Sweatshop Intel Strategic management Voter turnout Electrical engineering Rational Unified Process Life insurance Digital photography Wind power Asian financial crisis Keynesian economics Temasek Holdings AMD Deflation (economics) Shrimp farm Customer relationship management Taxation in the United States Affirmative action Reliability engineering Xerox 401(k) Economic history of Japan Monopsony Social Security debate (United States) Tax Canadian and American health care systems compared FairTax Airline Tata Consultancy Services Apple Macintosh Immigration to the United States Freeters Balassa-Samuelson effect Yield curve Demographics of Japan Microcredit Jet engine Pentium 4

does anyone else think the minimum wage raise is a horrible horrible idea seriously folks take a long hard logical economic look at it and tell me how it wouldn't hurt the economy although one might think that making employees more expensive would mean that employers higher less of them the actual effect is often too small to be measurable you might ask yourself why it is the us went through significant periods of growth with a real higher minimum wages than today it is simply not that significant also it gives owners an excuse to try to raise prices they may come to the conclusion that all similar will raise prices due to the increase in the minimum wage although this won't cause a sustain inflation as one answerer suggested it might make a few prices rise a bit and although some firms are just on the margin of breaking even and will go out of business at the slightest increase in costs many firms make short term profits and can absorb the higher labor costs there is another argument which has to do with the transfer of wealth to the poor the poor save less than the middle class or rich so a minimum wage increase stimulates overall spending which increase aggregate demand which can lead to higher growth  Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Minimum wage Unemployment Monetary policy Economic inequality Economics Gross domestic product Capitalism Wealth Monopsony Progressive tax Microeconomics Labour economics Flat tax Capital accumulation Trickle down effect Supply and demand Economic growth FairTax Free trade Unemployment types Say's law Surplus value Supply-side economics Deficit spending Privatization Law of value Reaganomics Anarchism and capitalism Efficiency wages New Deal Principal-agent problem Outsourcing Labor theory of value Phillips curve Tax Model (economics) Labor-power Economy of Russia Criticisms of socialism Wealth condensation Balassa-Samuelson effect Monetarism Economic history of Japan Arthur Laffer Gold standard Hyperinflation Business cycle Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Taxation in the United States Wal-Mart Growth theory Great Depression Capital controversy Economy of Africa Argentine Currency Board Production function Economic calculation problem American individualist anarchism Economy of Norway Socialist economics Economy of Sweden Tariff Natural monopoly Economy of the Republic of Ireland Mutual fund Aggregate demand Economy of Venezuela Working time Free market Insurance Economy of Pakistan Monopoly Exogenous growth model Theory of the firm Productive and unproductive labour History of the United States (1865-1918) History of the United States (1964-1980) Money supply Economic rent History of economic thought General equilibrium Asian financial crisis Neoclassical economics Measures of national income and output Diseconomies of scale

why is joint profit mzximization not a nash equilibrium explanation for the difference between the nash equilibrium prices and those that maximize joint profit why is joint profit mzximization not a nash equilibrium let me illustrate the answer with a simple example suppose that you and i are the only producers of a valuable commodity we can earn higher profits if we agree on a price rather than compete with each other but once we agree on a price we each have incentives to secretly cheat for example if i secretly offer buyers the opportunity to buy the product at just cent below the agreed price the one you are offering to the market i can capture all the market buyers rather than just half of them you have the same incentives so the agreed price the one that maximizes joint profits is not a stable equilibrium  Microeconomics Supply and demand Capitalism Economics Labor theory of value Tax Monopoly Ford Motor Company Commodity Price discrimination Surplus value Free market Privatization Incentive Capital controversy Ultimatum game Anarchism and capitalism Arbitrage Monopsony Efficiency wages Game theory Inflation General equilibrium Law of value Keynesian economics Free trade Prisoner's dilemma Technical analysis Neoclassical economics Economic equilibrium Transformation problem Investment bank PE ratio Cournot competition Eugene Fama Bertrand competition FairTax Stackelberg competition Prices of production Evolutionarily stable strategy Bretton Woods system Enron Corporation Rational expectations Market economy Profit Progressive tax Islamic banking Mutual fund Natural monopoly Model (economics) Stock market Call option Put option Commodity markets Futures contract Economic rent Criticisms of socialism Rational pricing MMORPG Tariff Welfare economics Topps Day trading Stock Pricing Mergers and acquisitions Deflation (economics) American individualist anarchism The Market for Lemons Karl Marx Economic calculation problem Internet fraud Capital accumulation Strategic management Phillips curve Predatory lending Gold standard Socially necessary labour time Monetary policy Wal-Mart Minimum wage ITunes Music Store Profit maximization Marginal cost American Motors History of post-Soviet Russia Perfect competition Externality The Wealth of Nations Illegal drug trade Principal-agent problem Model (abstract) Productive and unproductive labour Economic inequality Google

why doesn't the u s start making more products here in the states it seems we are dependent on imports from other countries namely china to the point where as many have said it would literally cause our country to collapse economically if we halted imports from china alone why do we depend so much on other countries why don't we start making products here wouldn't it be better in the longrun even if it may not be as cheap i'm no economist but it just seems like the best way plus we'd create a whole lot of jobs we couldn't afford the products if they were made in the usa because its unlawful to pay anyone under an hour in the usa which in alot of other countries is not the case for example as of a year ago i'm not sure if they joined fair trade yet or not starbucks bought its coffee for a pound from ethiopia then turned around and sold it in the states for a pound the other thing that people commonly fail to mention is that at the moment china is deflating its exchange rate meaning the yuan when exchanged for us dollars buys less here then it does in china they do this because other wise i would be cheaper to produce in other parts of the world the only thing that china could do to collapse our economy is to nationalize all the factories which some communist countries have been known to do before this is scary because international corperations seam to think that the factories they own in china work the same way it would in the west they have complete control over them when in fact they don't  Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system Asian financial crisis Renminbi Capitalism Monetary policy Productive and unproductive labour Trade Free trade Gold standard Hyperinflation Economy of Cuba Pound sterling Great Depression Economy of Europe Sweatshop People's Republic of China Capital accumulation United States dollar Inflation Law of value Economy of Africa Currency Microeconomics Euro Surplus value Tariff Yugo Debt Economics Wal-Mart Exchange rate Starbucks Fiat money Arthur Laffer Political economy Offshoring International Monetary Fund Arbitrage Economy of Taiwan Economy of Chile Economy of the United States Economic history of Britain Economy of Russia Canadian and American economies compared Economy of the European Union Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of Venezuela Agricultural policy Economy of Hong Kong Hard currency Marshall Plan Anarchism and capitalism Derivative (finance) Say's law Surplus labour Petroleum Labour economics Flat tax Economy of Mexico Dairy Great Depression in the United Kingdom Dot-com Cotton 1973 oil crisis Purchasing power parity Economy of India Anarchism and society World economy Economy of Pakistan U.S. public debt Charles Ponzi Economy of Haiti League of Nations Economy of Rwanda Money Kyoto Protocol Surplus product Asia Ford Motor Company Theory of conduct Economy of Macau Anarchist economics Friends Commodity Make money fast Hong Kong dollar Economy of Albania Pakistan Economy of Sierra Leone Economy of Nigeria Keynesian economics Supply-side economics Intellectual property Agriculture

what are the implications of shortage of economic resources suggestion of shortage of economic resources in economic theory you never have a shortage of anything what you have is a higher price that balances supply and demand if supply is reduced the price goes up but there is no shortage shortage implies that someone who wants to buy the resource can not obtain it in a well functioning market anyone can buy the resource if they are willing to pay for it for example people often ask what will happen when the world runs out of oil oil will never run out in the physical sense but production may decline the price will then increase to balance demand with the reduced supply  Supply and demand Inflation Oil depletion Economics Implications of peak oil Energy crisis Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Microeconomics Say's law Keynesian economics Labour economics Law of value Overpopulation Free trade Petroleum Future energy development Economy of Russia 1973 oil crisis Economic shortage Famine Surplus value Bretton Woods system Monopoly Economy of Pakistan Great Depression Political economy Monopsony Externality Capitalism Biodiesel Commodity Deflation (economics) Supply-side economics Economy of Ghana Monetary policy Unemployment Surplus product Economic calculation problem Oil shale Price gouging Capital accumulation Common Agricultural Policy Hydrogen economy Solar power Gold standard Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Production function Black market Tariff Economic equilibrium Economic relations of Japan Money supply Economic history of Spain Economy of Belgium Economy of Africa East Germany Labor-power Economy of Haiti Protectionism Prices of production Monetarism Labor theory of value Technical analysis Progressive tax Capital controversy Natural monopoly Oil industry Privatization Economy of Brazil Economy of Venezuela Real estate economics Planned economy Gross domestic product Health insurance Yield curve Aggregate demand Technocratic movement Market clearing Market economy Alcohol fuel Debt Austrian School American individualist anarchism Free market General equilibrium Marshall Plan Reaganomics Economy of Zimbabwe Welfare economics Ford Motor Company Consumer goods in the Soviet Union Energy Policy Act of 2005 Organic composition of capital Nuclear power Economy of Georgia Euro Commodity markets Electricity market
