spurs the most least liked dynasty when we think of dynasty we first think of the lakers with magic and kareem and the bulls with mj and scottie pippen the last dynasty we probably think of is the spurs they won championships out of years and are only th in selling merchandise they didn't even sell all their playoff tickets which is unheard of i don't hate the spurs but i'd look forward more to taking a crap then to watch one of their games people who don't enjoy watching the spurs play know very little about basketball for those who like to watch fast breaks and reverse dunks and rainbow jumpers and what not the reality is its all worth two points the spurts play excellent fundamental basketball they play smothering defense move the ball well and they shoot high percentage shots but they're not a high profile team with a flashy star their colors are silver and black two very regular colors but they are an extrordinary basketball team i'm not a spurs fan but i love to watch them play  NBA Finals Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Clippers Houston Rockets Scottie Pippen Rasheed Wallace Basketball National Basketball Association Julius Erving Utah Jazz Larry Bird New York Knicks Dennis Rodman Steve Nash 2005 NBA Finals Robert Horry Indiana Pacers San Antonio Spurs Yao Ming Los Angeles Lakers New Jersey Nets Emanuel Gin__bili Phoenix Suns Dream Team Chick Hearn Lakers-Celtics rivalry Karl Malone National Football League 2004 NBA Finals Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Detroit Pistons January 2005 in sports Kobe Bryant Orlando Magic Volleyball Water polo David Robinson (basketball player) Tracy McGrady SBC Center Charles Barkley New Mexico Lobo Basketball Los Angeles Kings Luther Head Denver Nuggets New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Toronto Raptors Major League Baseball television contracts Portland Trail Blazers Milwaukee Bucks American Football League Shaquille O'Neal Chinese Basketball Association Boston Bruins Hank Aaron Cincinnati Bengals Continental Basketball Association Golden State Warriors ESPN25 John Starks Three-point field goal Hartford Whalers National Football League Lore Jerry Lucas Minnesota Timberwolves Jerry West Tennis Boston Celtics Dikembe Mutombo New York Giants Pat Riley Brent Barry Oakland Athletics Danny Ainge Super Bowl Women's National Basketball Association Magic Johnson NBA Draft Hakeem Olajuwon Carolina Panthers Lisa Leslie St. Louis Rams Houston Astros Horace Grant December 2004 in sports Texas Rangers (baseball) Steve Kerr Phil Jackson Larry Brown College basketball Eddy Curry Leeds United F.C.

laker fans i have a question so if we did keep caron butler and chucky atkins where would we have played those two guys sure phil jackson will make atkins come off the bench but what about butler c chris mihm pf lamar sf walton sg kobe pg smush where would butler go or would phil jackson make smush sit on the bench which he should've done and make butler and kobe the starting back court since he's in love with tall guards in the backcourt but then again we would've had a thin front line cuz devean george foot and turiaf heart were injured and bynum was a rookie coming so imagine today was what woulud you have done with the roster with atkins and butler traded them away for someone else keep them but if we did we would've been thin in the center spot you guys do know next to kobe and lamar luke walton is the best at understanding the triangle offense phil jackson loves this guy he gave him plenty of playing time in his rookie season which phil jackson rarely does why do you think with phil jackson's recommendation the lakers just signed walton to a year million deal he won't start or play well for another team but for phil jackson's offense he is the perfect fit and he's very valuable in his system the question would not be where they would go i agree with the trade to get kwame even though he is a stiff because he may have worked out the problem is that the lakers kept devean george instead of caron if you keep caron instead then you have your third scorer devean never materialized into that third scorer both made almost the same amount of money at that time and the lakers let devean walk the following year so if they planned to get rid of him anyway why not do it then mitch cupcake should have known the kobe was working out with caron and they have a genuine good relationship it was obvious from the start whenever kobe was out caron took over like kobe used to do when shaq went out those two jelled on the court and off caron allowed kobe time to heal and rest because he could score with the best of them mitch paid no attention to this and didn't ask kobe how he felt about it until after the trade was made if i had a choice of starters caron would have started before walton thus giving the lakers more scoring power walton could then be inserted for either to keep the flow of the triangle as far a chucky he could score but he couldn't play d the idea of the trade was good it was just one player off  Kobe Bryant Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers New York Knicks Steve Nash Indiana Pacers Phil Jackson New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets NBA Finals 2004 NBA Finals Toronto Raptors Michael Jordan New York Giants Carolina Panthers Gary Payton (basketball) 1986 NBA Draft July 2004 in sports Boston Bruins Yao Ming Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series Minnesota Timberwolves Katelyn Faber National Football League Toronto Blue Jays Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Babe Ruth Kwame Brown Larry Bird Orlando Magic Basketball Leeds United F.C.

is there a deadline to sign draft picks in the nba if so what is it because i want to know when yi has to make a decision there is no deadline there is usually no problem in the nba because the first round picks are slotted to make a certain amount of money according to when they were drafted it is a rule in the collective bargaining agreement therefore there are usually no hold outs because you are going to make the same amount of money this situation is different because yi doesn't want to play and will just stay in china instead of milwaukee i don't think he will sign unless he gets traded so i wouldn't count on him being in the nba any time soon  NBA Draft National Basketball Association New York Knicks Los Angeles Clippers Salary cap Indiana Pacers 2004-05 NHL lockout New Jersey Nets National Football League 2004 NBA Finals San Antonio Spurs Women's National Basketball Association Toronto Raptors Minnesota Timberwolves Poker jargon Portland Trail Blazers Chicago Bulls Reserve clause 1986 NBA Draft Cleveland Cavaliers Steve Nash New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Orlando Magic 1957 World Series Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) Shawn Kemp June 2004 in sports Atlanta Hawks NFL Draft Karl Malone NBA Finals Terrell Owens Golden State Warriors Milwaukee Bucks Larry Bird 1994 baseball strike Pat Garrity Detroit Red Wings Winning Streak Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong Minor league baseball $ale of the Century Utah Jazz Pat Riley Glenn Robinson Blackjack Slot machine Cotton Fitzsimmons Betting (poker) Philadelphia 76ers July 2004 in sports World Trade Organization Wilt Chamberlain Moses Malone Allan Houston Houston Rockets Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bush v.

what do you think about reggie miller possibly returning to the nba should players come back or move teams just so they can try to win a ring i mean isn't that what every team is doing every year anyway so what if year old reggie miller wants to come back year old charles oakley wants to come back too maybe the celtics could sign him larry bird isn't doing much but running the pacers into the ground maybe he wants to don the green and white again i think year old rober parish and year old kevin willis are available to be your backup centers and if that falls through beg bill walton to give up the commentary job he sucks at to be a celtic again it's funny because miller doesn't make them better or worse classic case of what happens when rich people get bored  Indiana Pacers New York Knicks Boston Celtics Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Clippers Reggie Miller NBA Finals New Jersey Nets Philadelphia 76ers Dream Team Toronto Raptors Buffalo Bills Houston Rockets January 2005 in sports Continental Basketball Association 2005 NBA Finals Pittsburgh Steelers Bill Walton Three-point field goal Carolina Panthers The Malice at The Palace Reggie Jackson December 2004 in sports New York Jets Orlando Magic November 2004 in sports 1986 NBA Draft Cheryl Miller Kevin McHale Green Bay Packers ESPN25 World Series Phoenix Suns Detroit Pistons Detroit Tigers Charles Barkley Rick Carlisle Major League Baseball television contracts Cleveland Browns February 2005 in sports Celtic F.C.

stand pat or make moves although the issue is filled with controversy jo's recent media storm has caught a lot of attention of those in la to some its proof that the fo brass doesnt have the balls to make big moves happen anymore and to others it was a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel that give hope back into possible championship contention now i know the fo has been pretty incompetent when it comes to building around kobe but next season is just as intriguing as this season because kwame's retarded contract is off the books with his ridiculous contract gone it give the organization a substantial amount of money to sign a decent free agent jo will opt of his contract after this season and seeing as how much he loves la i think he would take a pay cut to sign with the lake show and be a fine replacement for kwame that way we keep lo andrew bynum and as far as im concerned javaris crittenton so what do we do fans and haters gut the team to bring jo now or stand pat well trading for him is only going to make the lakers lose the small amount of talent they have and while jermaine o'neal is a good play he is not equal to the other o'neal shaq obviously as far as a presence and teams really fearing him waiting and hoping he will opt out and sign with the lakers isn't a sure thing either though it's really a toss up i think it's go for the sure thing or take a chance  Shaquille O'Neal Kobe Bryant Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers NBA Finals Steve Nash New York Knicks Indiana Pacers New York Giants Wheel of Fortune Katelyn Faber National Football League Poker jargon New Jersey Nets Oakland Athletics Orlando Magic English cricket team Super Bowl XXXVI Houston Rockets San Antonio Spurs American Football League Detroit Tigers Salary cap Buffalo Bills Major League Baseball television contracts St. Louis Rams 2005 World Series Bowl Championship Series Minor league baseball Tris Speaker New England Patriots Pat Riley Philadelphia 76ers Utah Jazz Pittsburgh Steelers Boston Red Sox Gary Payton (basketball) Newcastle United F.C.

is jo really worth players hes a true pf foward and all but the pacers are asking way too much for him lamar puts up those kinds of numbers infact lamar has more assist and rebounds than jo so i really dont think oneal is worth that much lakers were when they were healthy all they need is a defensive presence like ron artest don't you agree nope but since the pacers have the player the lakers want or the only player that might apiece kobe then the pacers have the leverage in this trade personally i would hate to see lamer go and you're right dude is averaging the same rebounds maybe less points but way more assists that j o but i think the reason why j o might be worth players is that he is a proven allstar year after year but still though i've heard that bird might want the whole entire laker frontline bynum lamar and walton for j o and maybe another player i would honestly do this only if it includes granger which is highly unlikely for the pacers i just wish they do something soon because the offseason for the lakers is really boring me plus kobe will be on jimmy kimmel on wednesday or thursday so tune in my laker compadre that is if you are a laker fan  Indiana Pacers Los Angeles Clippers Kobe Bryant New York Knicks Chicago Bulls NBA Finals Larry Bird San Antonio Spurs Detroit Pistons Yao Ming Steve Nash Los Angeles Lakers 2005 NBA Finals New Mexico Lobo Basketball 2004 NBA Finals Orlando Magic Toronto Raptors Rasheed Wallace Ron Artest Michael Jordan Shaquille O'Neal Rick Carlisle Wilt Chamberlain Gary Payton (basketball) Reggie Miller Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Ben Wallace Karl Malone The Malice at The Palace Boston Celtics November 2004 in sports Minnesota Timberwolves The NBA on ABC January 2005 in sports 1986 NBA Draft New Jersey Nets Scottie Pippen Phil Jackson Lakers-Celtics rivalry Miami Dolphins Vince Carter Miami Heat Chris Webber Dream Team Dikembe Mutombo Dwyane Wade Robert Horry Julius Erving St. Louis Rams Utah Jazz LeBron James Pat Riley Dale Davis Jerry Krause Kenyon Martin Dennis Rodman December 2004 in sports Houston Rockets Phoenix Suns Magic Johnson Hollywood Squares Jermaine O'Neal American Motors Slam Dunk Contest June 2004 in sports New York Giants National Football League Michael Cooper Jalen Rose Jeff Foster NBA Draft David Robinson (basketball player) National Basketball Association Baltimore Ravens Continental Basketball Association Dirk Nowitzki Chicago White Sox Mike Breen Chick Hearn Three-point field goal Lamar Hunt Andrew Bogut English cricket team Leeds United F.C.

what are some reasons for the changes in the nba from the 's 's era to right now what caused the big change today's league is corrupted with people like david stern and tim dohangy what happened i think one of the reason for such change that not many people have noticed is the change of team management from 's to the presence before you had better management running nba organizations like when jerry west ran the lakers and red auerbach ran the celtics these guys knew how to run the business and were able to accumulate great teams that work together after that period we entered the jordan era and mj took us on a ride for most of the 's the problem was after jordan retired you had many former nba stars retiring and taking over as either coach gm or president of nba franchises like larry bird in indiana danny ainge in boston isiah thomas in new york joe dumars in detroit john paxson in chicago michael jordan in washington and then charlotte only dumars so far was able to have some success winning a championship once with detroit after taking over as president of operations mchale has hit so many bumps in the road in minnesota jordan screw'd up as management in washington and his legacy in charlotte remains to be seen ainge didn't have much luck in boston until his former teammate mchale hooked him up with the big ticket bird had a great thing going in indiana until artest decided to blow up the team i don't think i need to mention the mess that isiah has made in new york mismanagement by these former nba players to management individuals paired with the retirement of great fundamental and quality team players like barkley stockton malone mj pippen robinson olajuwon ewing really escalated the nba into the new unknown era's the league received a new crop of talent who lacked fundamentals and played the sport for the wrong reason iverson kobe artest arenas carmelo are great individual players but they do not exactly possess the unique ability to elevate the level of plays of their teammates like how magic bird or jordan were able to deliver shaq and duncan were the only standout players of the new millenium to carry their teams towards a championship just like how the former nba greats used to do it however these players all seem to lack a certain ability to make basketball fun to watch like how bird and magic used to display and they never delivered in the finals moments like how mj did what we have today are players who play for the spotlight and the big bucks most of these players are self center with the exception of few and don't always have a team first mentality basketball has fallen off so far in the new millenium but hopefully guys like lebron james and dwyane wade will be able to carry on the torch left by mj in the 's and helping the nba reclaim some of it's glory days  Charles Barkley Toronto Raptors January 2005 in sports 2004 NBA Finals Phoenix Suns Hakeem Olajuwon 2005 NBA Finals Allen Iverson Tim Duncan Danny Ainge Continental Basketball Association Basketball ESPN25 Los Angeles Kings December 2004 in sports LeBron James Jerry Krause College basketball Julius Erving Yao Ming Minnesota Timberwolves New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets NBA Rookie of the Year Award Phil Jackson New York Yankees Boston Red Sox Reggie Miller Denver Nuggets Chicago White Sox New York Giants Joe Dumars New Mexico Lobo Basketball David Stern Boston Bruins World Series Golden State Warriors Shaquille O'Neal February 2005 in sports International League Gary Payton (basketball) Detroit Tigers Syracuse University Orange Toronto Blue Jays Kevin McHale Major League Baseball television contracts Bobby Knight San Francisco Giants Miami Heat Montreal Canadiens Moses Malone National Football League Lakers-Celtics rivalry San Francisco 49ers Milwaukee Bucks United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Stanley Cup The NBA on NBC Carolina Panthers David Robinson (basketball player) 1984 NBA Draft Babe Ruth NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Al Michaels Oakland Athletics June 2004 in sports Indiana University Bloomington Dwyane Wade Detroit Red Wings

this trade could definitely work both on paper and in real life http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash this should work because kwame brown isn't as bad as people say yes he is a bust but he can get rebounds and he doesn't have to score with kobe and jermaine taking the shots therefore bynum can go to the lakers lamar can go too because he played the pf position which jermaine will control plus the lakers have to give up a pg might as well be farmer sine the pacers need a backup the lakers lineup will be pg crittenton sg kobe sf walton pf jermaine c brown if the lakers made the playoffs last year there's no reason why they can't compete for the title with the improved roster plus the pacers got what they want with bynum and odom say the lakers throw in a couple draft picks and voila the pacers are in rebuilding mode and eager to send off jermaine that is much better than other trades people have posted however it would be better for the lakers to trade walton bynum and radmonovic for jermaine o'neal this way the lineup would be pg crittenton sg kobe sf odom pf jermaine c brown mihm this could be a dominant team since people think kobe isn't as good as he really is because of his reputation odom and jermaine can fill in the scoring and kobe can defend the perimeter while jermaine can handle the inside the only problem is indiana might want an allstar for jermaine since he was their franchise star for the past several years  New York Knicks NBA Finals Shaquille O'Neal New Jersey Nets Steve Nash Orlando Magic Chicago Bulls Yao Ming San Antonio Spurs Larry Bird New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Los Angeles Lakers January 2005 in sports Boston Celtics Jermaine O'Neal Detroit Pistons 2004 NBA Finals Allen Iverson Miami Heat Dream Team Reggie Miller Houston Rockets NBA Draft Toronto Raptors Rasheed Wallace Dale Davis 2005 NBA Finals National Basketball Association Michael Jordan December 2004 in sports 1986 NBA Draft LeBron James The NBA on ABC Baltimore Ravens Minnesota Timberwolves Philadelphia 76ers November 2004 in sports Pat Riley New Mexico Lobo Basketball July 2004 in sports Utah Jazz The Malice at The Palace National Football League Karl Malone 2005 World Series Kwame Brown Gary Payton (basketball) Phil Jackson Phoenix Suns Tracy McGrady Robert Horry Super Bowl XXVII New York Giants Denver Nuggets Golden State Warriors February 2005 in sports St. Louis Rams Wilt Chamberlain Ben Wallace Vince Carter Dennis Rodman Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Kings June 2004 in sports Lakers-Celtics rivalry Rick Carlisle Moses Malone Julius Erving Scottie Pippen Emanuel Gin__bili Slam Dunk Contest Detroit Tigers Eddy Curry Carolina Panthers Jerry West International League Cincinnati Bengals Chris Webber World Series Dwyane Wade Luther Head American Football League New York Jets Larry Brown David Robinson (basketball player) Sam Perkins Portland Trail Blazers NBA Live series Kenyon Martin Charles Barkley Dallas Cowboys

who do you think will be the better point guard in the future deron williams or chris paul i need to know every thing deron plays under a structured format in utah where every offensive defensive scheme is controlled by coach jerry sloan he has a legitimate inside threat in carlos boozer and an outside one in mehmet okur that's not a knock on deron's game because he is one hell of a competitor he can drive and finish when he needs to he can penetrator and dish it out to the open man he also can step behind the arc and nail a pointer he reminds me of a young baron davis because of their size and their style of play because deron does like to score however deron doesn't defend as well as baron or paul and doesn't get as much steals chris paul is a more slim and fast point guard in the kevin johnson isiah thomas mode where he knows how to use his basketball iq to make tough decisions on offense new orleans doesn't run a legitimate playbook like utah all the time cp is given more room to either create a shot for his teammates or himself paul is a better defender and because of his quickness he does get a lot of steals he's kind of like d wade because he doesn't like shoot 's and tends to favor shooting inside the arc or driving the basket so you can't really say out of these floor generals who is the better point guard if deron william because the next baron davis or john stockton and chris paul becomes the next isiah thomas or kevin johnson then it'll end up being a wash i think deron williams and chris paul will share the title as the top point guards in the nba in years  Basketball NBA Finals Toronto Raptors Indiana Pacers Michael Jordan Dream Team New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Karl Malone Larry Bird Steve Nash Luther Head Three-point field goal Volleyball Carolina Panthers Continental Basketball Association Yao Ming 1986 NBA Draft Houston Rockets Super Bowl XXVII United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics December 2004 in sports 2005 NBA Finals Isiah Thomas Joe Dumars Cincinnati Bengals Water polo Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of American football Detroit Pistons Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Clippers Minnesota Timberwolves Carlos Arroyo John Stockton Boxing Dennis Rodman San Francisco 49ers The NBA on NBC American football San Antonio Spurs Rugby union positions November 2004 in sports Buffalo Bills National Basketball Association Portland Trail Blazers Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXV Kobe Bryant Super Bowl III Professional wrestling attacks Shawn Michaels The Apprentice 2 Bobby Knight Kansas City Chiefs Orlando Magic Pinball Mark Calaway Professional wrestling match types Robert Horry National Football League Lore Reggie Miller Super Bowl IX Tim Duncan Emanuel Gin__bili New England Patriots Norway national football team Table tennis National Football League 2004 NBA Finals Rasheed Wallace Jerry Sloan Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XIII Team Fortress Classic Cris Carter Charles Barkley St. Louis Rams Jeff Hornacek Golden State Warriors Combine (Half-Life 2) Miami Dolphins Allen Iverson New Mexico Lobo Basketball International League Resident Evil (video game) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Magic Johnson Super Bowl XV ESPN25 Baseball Miracle on Ice

kg trade a few things i think oden durrant will be benefitted by this trade this is due to the fact that people will be so interested in seeing the 'all stars' in boston it has overshadowed the two future all stars i am more looking forward to boston playing than seattle or portland also on another note i was wondering who will be t wolves goto guy foye still young green poor fg and if ricky davis is the go to guy then you are destined for top lotto pick i dont think there is another team in the nba that does not have an all star as clearly as this team minnesota could become a team similar to the detroit pistons whom are made of good players but not great ones if the wolves could find themselves a good coach who is able to mesh all the pieces foye brewer green jefferson then you could probably be looking at the next well rounded team ricky davis will be the veteran to lead the young wolves but he has never been a great team player so eventually they would have to trade him to open up more shots for the younger players i think eventually minnesota's go to player would be al jefferson if he develops properly and injury free he should become the anchor in minnesota like how dwight howard is in orlando and chris bosh is in toronto foye will have to learn to become a better distributor more than just a scoring point guard green will have to become a better shooter than a field goal percentage guy all these factors are just maybe's and who knows if it will ever mature  Chicago Bulls Toronto Raptors Orlando Magic Los Angeles Clippers Utah Jazz Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Finals January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Toronto Blue Jays San Antonio Spurs Dream Team Carolina Panthers Detroit Red Wings December 2004 in sports Rasheed Wallace New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago Blackhawks November 2004 in sports Portland Trail Blazers Yao Ming 2004 NBA Finals Montreal Canadiens Miami Dolphins Boston Red Sox Larry Bird Steve Nash New York Giants Michael Jordan Clemson University Kobe Bryant Boston Bruins St. Louis Blues (hockey) Atlanta Flames Detroit Tigers Cris Carter Three-point field goal Gary Payton (basketball) Denver Nuggets NBA Draft 1984 NBA Draft Shaquille O'Neal Continental Basketball Association National Hockey League 2002-03 NHL season Super Bowl XXVI National Basketball Association Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim National Hockey League All-Star Game World Series Qu__bec Nordiques Buffalo Bills David Robinson (basketball player) Wayne Gretzky National Football League National Football League Lore Pittsburgh Penguins St. Louis Rams Carlos Arroyo Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl IX Norway national football team February 2005 in sports Luther Head Golden State Warriors September 2005 in sports Cleveland Cavaliers Water polo Super Bowl I Stanley Cup Salary cap Basketball NHL Entry Draft 2005 NBA Finals Georgia Institute of Technology Karl Malone Charles Barkley Reggie Jackson Chauncey Billups Ice hockey Super Bowl XI

if the celtics schould trade any one for aa center who would it be and who woulld they get the celtics need a center i heard they got pollard but hes shit who do we need they also need a point guard until rajon rondo proves he can be a true distributor however boston gave up about every decent talent west szczerbiak jefferson gerald green telfair gomes ratliff and th pick jeff green they had on that roster they also gave up current th pick and future draft picks first rounders so not only is their roster talent depth paper thin right now but they've also gave away some of their future st round bargaining chips the only tradeable pieces they still have left is rondo tony allen and maybe their nd round pick glen davis if they can find a suitor other than that there really isn't anyone else worth trading for but if they get rid of all those guys for a center or a point guard then they will have absolute zero bench productivity and that's not a good idea to have going into a minimum games playoff period the best that boston can hope for right now is that glen big baby davis and kenrick perkins will be enough to anchor the middle while rondo and allen holds down the fort at point guard but that's kind of a stretch  New York Knicks Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Clippers Indiana Pacers Chicago Bulls Orlando Magic Pittsburgh Steelers Utah Jazz Houston Rockets New York Giants New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets New England Patriots Los Angeles Kings Boston Celtics Washington Redskins Boston Bruins New Jersey Nets Carolina Panthers Atlanta Falcons 1986 NBA Draft Steve Nash New York Yankees Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Finals Jacksonville Jaguars New York Jets Philadelphia 76ers Boston Red Sox Buffalo Bills Montreal Canadiens Texas Rangers (baseball) Oakland Raiders Cincinnati Reds Oakland Athletics Washington Capitals Phoenix Suns San Antonio Spurs Portland Trail Blazers St. Louis Rams National Basketball Association Super Bowl XXVII Toronto Blue Jays Poker jargon American Football League Dallas Cowboys Houston Astros Florida Marlins Atlanta Braves 2004 NBA Finals January 2005 in sports National Football League Kansas City Chiefs Pittsburgh Penguins Ra (board game) San Francisco 49ers Los Angeles Lakers Detroit Red Wings Jeff Foster Tampa Bay Buccaneers NBA Draft Detroit Lions Salary cap Yao Ming Toronto Argonauts Philadelphia Flyers Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl I Dream Team Michael Jordan San Francisco Giants Atlanta Hawks Minnesota Vikings Cleveland Indians Super Bowl IX Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Detroit Tigers Super Bowl XXVI Pro Football Hall of Fame Golden State Warriors Jokerit Seattle Mariners Cleveland Cavaliers New Orleans Saints Kobe Bryant Babe Ruth's Called Shot Brett Favre Minor league baseball Larry Bird December 2004 in sports Chicago White Sox Mario Lemieux Screw Cincinnati Bengals 2004-05 NHL lockout Chicago Blackhawks New York Islanders Wayne Gretzky Super Bowl XVII

who's better who's a better pg nash changes the game and jason kidd does people say nash nash has won mvp's kidd should've won when he took new jersey to the finals the first time nash is great but remember he had the offense and players tailored made just to his abilities remember when he was with dallas and be for e thet he was jus considered a top pg now he's the best but if u look at it closely jason kidd can be a top pg in any sysytem and he can rebound get steals same number assisist compared the scrubs he msotly plays with other than richard i can't shoot jefferson and carter so if u look at it jason kidd is the best pg but u can make a good argument steve fuckin nash lol i agree with rey and b nut by far because their complete analysis really hits the spot nash may have won mvp awards but i don't think he was ever the best point guard to play for the suns kevin johnson was the team that kidd took the nba finals years ago with kenyon martin richard jefferson kerry kittles dwarfs in comparison to the team nash currently runs with amare matrix bell diaw barbosa even though it's true that many players have improved their careers playing with steve like bell barbosa quentin richardson joe johnson but the same can be said of jason kidd what happened to kerry kittles after he got traded from new jersey to the clippers was kenyon martin the same player after he left new jersey and signed that fat contract with denver even richard jefferson would become a nobody if he were foolishly to go anywhere else like nash those who played alongside kidd have seen their points and field goal percentage productivity increase thanks to the easy opportunity jason creates granted kidd has never won an nba title but so hasn't nash nash can shoot lights out from the perimeter but kidd can drive and finish plays or dish it to a teammate for an easy layup nash can not finish a play on his own which was exposed by the san antonio spurs in the playoffs this past season when they chosed to single coverage him with bruce bowen the spurs glued the rest of the other players to nash's teammate to make it almost impossible for the suns point guard to pass it to them if jason kidd were in that situation he'd be putting up points in a hurry thanks to the single coverage situation a point guard who can't score at will can not be a threat to penetrate and open up the perimeter for shooters on the outside when you factor in the the fact that steve isn't a reliable defender nor does he help out on the boards you will see just how valuable kidd is as an asset to his team the sun's system really catered towards nash's strength and weaknesses but it doesn't mean he is the best point guard in the nba that title belongs to baron davis  January 2005 in sports Cincinnati Bengals Jason Kidd Dream Team Indiana Pacers Utah Jazz Pittsburgh Steelers Minnesota Timberwolves Houston Rockets Miami Dolphins Shaquille O'Neal Toronto Raptors December 2004 in sports National Basketball Association Rasheed Wallace Super Bowl XXI 1986 NBA Draft 2005 NBA Finals New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets New England Patriots Buffalo Bills Julius Erving Hank Aaron Orlando Magic Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXVI San Francisco 49ers Basketball Dallas Mavericks Emanuel Gin__bili Boston Red Sox World Series Cleveland Browns NBA Draft David Robinson (basketball player) Kenyon Martin 1957 World Series Dennis Rodman Super Bowl XXIV Luther Head Mario Lemieux National Football League Lore Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City Chiefs Houston Astros July 2004 in sports Detroit Tigers Alex Rodriguez Denver Nuggets St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIX National Football League Super Bowl XXIII Water polo Robert Horry Kobe Bryant Wayne Gretzky San Francisco Giants Super Bowl XIII Charles Barkley Glossary of American football Three-point field goal Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXXIV Pete Rose 2004 World Series Baseball Super Bowl I Andr__s Galarraga New York Yankees Super Bowl XXXIII Playoff New York Jets Amare Stoudemire Slam Dunk Contest Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XVI Oakland Athletics Super Bowl X Karl Malone Super Bowl XV

good tips in playing better defense in basketball just lost a game last night because of my bad defense disappointed the team and disappointed in myself keep your knees low and bent keep your arms wide apart like you're about to hug a pound wrestler keep your feet parallel to each other but always have one foot in a higher row than the other place one hand covering the ball where the player is dribbling use left hand to cover a player dribbling with their right hand use right hand to cover a player dribbling with their left hand use the opposite hand not covering the ball to cover the player's eyes to make sure he can't see the floor keep your head and eyes at a perpendicular angle to the player you're guarding so you can see a bigger picture instead of turning your head to the right and left just to catch a glimpse of every move the player you're defending makes do not look at the ball when defending but focus on the dribbler's body position and make adjustment to make sure your body is always perpendicular to their's force the player to go a direction they are not used to or dribble with the hand they aren't comfortable with if you're defending a player who likes to drive back down and give them enough space to shoot from outside if you're defending a player who likes to shoot move close to them and suffocate them with your defense so you can force them to put the ball on the court and drive that's all i can think of right now just work on this pointers and keep these techniques in mind the next you're on the court and you should be fine good luck  Volleyball Basketball Professional wrestling holds Glossary of American football Personal foul Professional wrestling throws Baseball Field hockey Water polo Table tennis Rugby union positions Batting (cricket) Snooker Four square Rugby union Softball Professional wrestling attacks Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Pittsburgh Steelers Billiards American football Glossary of partner dance terms Swingout Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling aerial techniques Rugby league Norway national football team Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mouse (computing) Tag Paintball Tennis New York Giants American football strategy Michael Jordan Canadian football Laws of cricket Racquetball Chick Hearn Marching band Wide receiver Badminton Harrow Football Skateboarding trick Pole vault Fielding (cricket) Football (soccer) Cleveland Browns Glossary of ballet terms Rasheed Wallace Curling Poker jargon Cricket Equine conformation Eight ball Anchor Squash (sport) Suplex Airsoft San Francisco 49ers Anatomical terms of location Fencing Beer Pong Parade (military) New York Knicks Boxing Three-point field goal National Football League Lore Golf Archery Toronto Raptors Carolina Panthers Shogi Chess strategy and tactics Salute National Football League Dominoes Stereoscopy Terminal ballistics New England Patriots Glossary of climbing terms Super Bowl IX Double bass Yao Ming Super Bowl XIV Tenshinhan Taikyoku shogi Piledriver (professional wrestling) Neckbreaker Pinball Professional wrestling slang

reasons why kobe is not the best player in the world today or not in the top ever i mean i know he is the best but let's see what the haters say and don't say he's a rapist never proved he cheated on his wife that's their business he's cocky all great players are he can't win a championship with what team so give me reasons in the game though i dislike the lakers i have to admit that kobe is the best player in the world he can be a great passer except for the fact that his team sucks and he doesnt trust his teammates and rightfully so had kobe played with a real big man like kg or jo kobe can average assts easily i dont get into personal matters because that has little or nothing to do with his play on the court he is a offensive juggernaut and nobody can stop him and he is the most deadly player in the world with a basketball in his hands  Kobe Bryant NBA Finals Shaquille O'Neal Basketball Los Angeles Lakers Steve Nash Volleyball Yao Ming Michael Jordan Karl Malone San Antonio Spurs 2004 NBA Finals Phil Jackson National Basketball Association Katelyn Faber New Jersey Nets Kobe American football Tennis Los Angeles Clippers Water polo January 2005 in sports College basketball Rasheed Wallace Japan national rugby union team Julius Erving New York Knicks Slam Dunk Contest Gary Payton (basketball) Stanley Cup 2005 NBA Finals Shawn Michaels Ultimate (sport) Dream Team Norway national football team New York Giants Super Bowl XXVI Boston Celtics Cincinnati Bengals World Championship Wrestling July 2004 in sports Ice hockey Boston Bruins SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Super Bowl I Donovan McNabb Philadelphia 76ers Golden State Warriors Jerry Lucas Major League Baseball Utah Jazz Allen Iverson St. Louis Rams Tim Duncan Bobby Knight EXpanded MultiPlayer World Series Super Bowl XVII Emanuel Gin__bili Three-point field goal New Mexico Lobo Basketball Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson Cleveland Indians Wilt Chamberlain Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs National Football League Jerry West Glossary of American football Los Angeles Kings Detroit Pistons Table tennis New England Patriots J.

can boston dominate the east their stars don't have much experience with each other and they don't have playoff experience will they do good in the playoffs or just be like denver when they acquired a i as a celtic fan i still don't think they can dominate but they should definitely make a good run at the playoffs they have alot to do still but i think the big are already starting to gel and they will be able to work well with each other the main concern is whether rajon rondo and kendrick perkins will be able to hold up their end of the bargain and be productive players if they do then the finals aren't really out of reach but it will be a hard fought battle all the way p s celtics just signed f c scot pollard to a one year deal for the league vet min million  New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Pittsburgh Steelers NBA Finals Los Angeles Clippers National Football League Philadelphia 76ers New York Giants Miami Dolphins New England Patriots Houston Rockets Playoff Los Angeles Kings Boston Celtics Cleveland Browns Oakland Athletics New Jersey Nets International League New York Jets Salary cap Orlando Magic San Antonio Spurs Boston Red Sox 2004-05 NHL lockout Buffalo Bills Nottingham Forest F.C.

i believe the clippers will do good next season heres why i have a good feeling they will make it into the playoffs this year although elton brand injured his achilles he will be better around the month of feburary and will eventually work his way in al thornton will be able to contribute right away and will defintely help the clippers with his athleticism and potential they also just recently signed brevin knight he was an underrated point guard and averages about assists for game he was exactly who the clippers needed so their lineup would be elton brand pf sam cassell brevin knight pg corey maggette sf al thornton backup sf chris kaman c cuttin mobely sg frequently used bench players tim thomas quintin ros the clippers have picked up a great point guard for their needs and picked a future star in al thornton i think the clippers made excellent moves considering their salary i hope the best for the clippers next season and for those who hate on the clippers don't be hatin also elton brand is known for his hard work and determination i'm sure he'll do whatever he can to get better faster what i like your answer i completely agree if the clippers are far back by the time brand comes back then their playoff hopes seem unlikely but theres just a feeling i have that makes me feel very optimistic about the clippers next season i'm a year fan hoping for the best only if brand didn't get injured yeah when elton brand comes back he won't be the same all star caliber player he won't make an impact if he returns he could even be out the whole year because he has to rehab from surgery the clippers won't do much in the west and probably end up th place  Chicago Bulls International League Indiana Pacers New York Knicks Toronto Raptors Minnesota Timberwolves Toronto Blue Jays New England Patriots Boston Bruins Houston Rockets Pittsburgh Steelers Carolina Panthers Cincinnati Bengals Orlando Magic National Football League NBA Finals New York Giants New York Jets Mario Lemieux New Jersey Nets Steve Nash Buffalo Bills Detroit Red Wings Miami Dolphins 1986 NBA Draft Rodney Rogers Robin Ventura Kobe Bryant Cleveland Browns San Antonio Spurs NBA Draft New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Los Angeles Kings Wayne Gretzky Montreal Canadiens San Francisco 49ers Utah Jazz 2004-05 NHL lockout January 2005 in sports David Robinson (basketball player) Detroit Tigers New York Yankees Tampa Bay Lightning LeBron James West Bromwich Albion F.C.

would someone with espn insider send me the article the c's should win the east if someone could do that and email it to me i'd greatly appreciate it i was in hilton head s c at a family reunion last week when the kg trade went down so pardon me for being late to weigh in on this on a separate note two of my first cousins who were at the reunion work on tyler perry's house of payne '' and they promise me it's going to get better all i can say is they better be right anyway here goes my rant on the c's i don't care that puny inexperienced rajon rondo may be their starting point guard i don't care that kendrick perkins whose career scoring average is points may be their starting center i don't care that the celtics' bench is currently as deep as a baby pool the boston celtics of kevin garnett paul pierce and ray allen should reach the nba finals period no excuses if garnett's truly the player we think he is the player talent evaluators around the league rave about the player who should one day enter the hall of fame shouldn't pierce and allen be enough help to win the east i mean lebron james took cleveland to the finals without anything close to a second star allen iverson won the east back in with dikembe mutombo and aaron mckie as his second and third scoring options jason kidd kenyon martin and richard jefferson won the east with jason collins playing center i like garnett love the way he competes and carries himself but i'm sorry there's no reason he should not finally get to the finals okay if shaq turns back the clock and becomes something close to a dominant and force again and d wade is healthy i'll perhaps cut him some slack but how likely is that being a clevelander in my heart of hearts i hope the cavaliers get back to the finals but on paper boston's head and shoulders ahead of them and don't tell me about chemistry i understand how important chemistry is i've watched our star studded team usa crew get ripped internationally the past several years just like you have but there are several reasons why chemistry shouldn't be a problem in boston for one the celtics' new big three'' all play different positions this is not vince carter and richard jefferson or latrell sprewell and allan houston garnett's the best big man in the east dwight howard and chris bosh are still chasing pierce is a terrific scorer slasher and allen is arguably the best outside shooter in the league garnett clearly is not a ball hog and will have no problem sharing the rock pierce enjoyed playing next to chucker supreme antoine walker and allen excelled alongside glenn big dog'' robinson and sam cassell so squabbles over shots should be nonexistent in the fourth quarter there'll be no dispute about who to go to pierce and allen are the first two scoring options and kg's the third kg who's never felt like he had to take the last shot won't have a problem with that furthermore all three players are still in their prime this is not hakeem olajuwon charles barkley and scottie pippen uniting in old age or over the hill karl malone and gary payton joining shaq and kobe am i guaranteeing the celtics will win the east no i'm just saying they should and i'm saying that if they don't for any reason other than injury of course it will tell us a lot about boston's three stars particularly kg to me this will be the defining season of garnett's career this will tell us if he was really a superstar with no help in minnesota or merely an overrated stat filler who lacks that winning'' intangible pierce and allen are destined to be remembered simply as great players garnett has a chance to go higher to be remembered as more than merely great but to seal that kind of legacy he's got to get out of the east  Los Angeles Lakers Hakeem Olajuwon Los Angeles Clippers December 2004 in sports Phoenix Suns Minnesota Timberwolves Kobe Bryant Cleveland Browns New York Giants January 2005 in sports LeBron James Pittsburgh Steelers Utah Jazz Los Angeles Kings Charles Barkley New England Patriots United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Gary Payton (basketball) Shaquille O'Neal Indiana Pacers Orlando Magic Boston Red Sox Larry Bird Boston Bruins Allen Iverson San Francisco 49ers 1986 NBA Draft 2004 NBA Finals Scottie Pippen Basketball Major League Baseball television contracts Newcastle United F.C.

which nba team do you think has the best fans alright i don't even think this is close i think the lakers have the best fans by far and i don't even live in l a i went to a game there when i was on vacation and the crowd was absolutley nuts i mean they sell out every game and the fans are nuts so i gotta give it to them who do you think has the best fans don't say golden state because they only supported them for one year you've probably never been a golden state game so maybe that is why you've formulated such a bias conclusion if you were to attend one oakland's playoff game even before they beat dallas this year you could be finding yourself standing the whole game just so you won't miss out on an important play or basket the noise is just so loud you may even need earplugs the next time you attend the golden state warriors have the best fans because even though we've been through a year playoff drought but when it comes postseason time you know the fans will always be there  NBA Finals New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Philadelphia 76ers Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors San Antonio Spurs 2005 NBA Finals Utah Jazz Los Angeles Clippers Playoff Miami Dolphins Rasheed Wallace Michael Jordan Boston Red Sox Steve Nash National Football League New Jersey Nets Minnesota Timberwolves 1986 NBA Draft Los Angeles Lakers January 2005 in sports National Football League Lore December 2004 in sports Dream Team Julius Erving Super Bowl Cleveland Browns Pat Riley Yao Ming 1987 World Series St. Louis Rams New England Patriots Detroit Pistons Derek Jeter Chicago Bulls November 2004 in sports Kansas City Chiefs Phoenix Suns Detroit Red Wings Shaquille O'Neal Los Angeles Kings National Hockey League rivalries 2004 American League Championship Series Boston Bruins St. Louis Blues (hockey) International League 2005 NBA Playoffs New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Oakland Athletics Reggie Jackson Orlando Magic Denver Nuggets NBA Draft Toronto Blue Jays Vince Carter Cincinnati Bengals Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Philadelphia Eagles Minnesota Vikings Cleveland Indians 2005 World Series Emanuel Gin__bili Mario Lemieux St. Louis Cardinals American Football League Derek Fisher Oakland Raiders Chinese Basketball Association 1981 baseball strike Major League Baseball television contracts New York Jets Dallas Mavericks Curse of the Bambino Seattle Mariners Women's National Basketball Association Los Angeles Dodgers 1986 National League Championship Series Toronto Raptors Continental Basketball Association Carolina Panthers Philadelphia Flyers Chicago White Sox Cotton Fitzsimmons Baltimore Ravens Toronto Maple Leafs Super Bowl XXVI ESPN25 The Malice at The Palace National Hockey League Milwaukee Bucks Karl Malone NBA Live series

what would you have offered t wolves for kg if you were phoenix i'm sure they could have made a better offer than celtics and this would be the final piece of the jigsaw i made this a poss trade marion diaw way overpaid and two first rounders for kg no way would i take banks contract not even for kg marion for kg is not enough maybe marion and atl's lotto pick i don't think it has anything to do with how much other teams could have offered for kg when the gm kevin mchale has already made up his mind that if he was going to send his best player anywhere it would be his former team he played for think about it how else would boston be able to not include the pick in the draft before they traded it for ray allen and still be able to put together a collection of unproven players to obtain the big ticket's service the warriors have offered monte ellis jason richardson and al harrington for kg which imo is a far more proven deal than the one minnesota got i'm pretty sure if minney was persistent with it they could have squeezed or maybe more first round draft choices out of golden state they've done it before when they traded the pick and first rounders for a rookie in chris webber so i don't see why they won't do it again for an established star in kg the truth of the matter is mchale played a vital role in convincing the owner that boston offered the best value for kg mchale also probably convinced kg that boston was his only ticket out of a few more losing seasons to end his career i truly hope that boston's conspiracy ways will eventually come back to bite them in the rear end some day  Minnesota Timberwolves Steve Nash Indiana Pacers Houston Rockets New York Knicks Boston Celtics Los Angeles Clippers Golden State Warriors Phoenix Suns New England Patriots New York Giants Orlando Magic 1986 NBA Draft NBA Finals Larry Bird Los Angeles Kings Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago Bulls Boston Red Sox Toronto Raptors Dream Team Philadelphia 76ers Detroit Red Wings Carolina Panthers Mario Lemieux Philadelphia Flyers San Francisco Giants Utah Jazz Portland Trail Blazers Atlanta Hawks Pittsburgh Pirates Toronto Blue Jays Wilt Chamberlain National Football League 2004-05 NHL lockout Chicago Blackhawks Minor league baseball Minnesota Vikings Kevin McHale Chris Webber World Series Cork City F.C.

question why people dis good basketball players why do people dis great baketball players and say example pgoint gaurds say player a avergerd pts assist stls a game no ring but never had a supporting cast around him and his team never had a chance go anywhere and dudring his time fans all ways said man his team suck and den why do player b averge pts assists wins championships plays with a big man and he has an all star supporting cast his team is always favorite win the title and in the 'ship he plays the same as the season wh can't player a be better than player b player be benifeted from having a good supporting cast who' a better player since this is ho ys say bill russell who only had beat teams win a championship gets credit over guys like wilt who dominated against russelle but russell temams was better or sayin tim duncan in his prime is better than shaq and shaq averaged almost pts a game in his prime winning is important but not when the guys aren't equally talented because the fans the media the organization the coach and the players all have one major goal from the beginning of the season and that is to win a championship the goal title is often emphasized instead of the journey preseason season playoffs a player could lead the league in any or many categories win numerous mvp or defensive player of the year awards be an all star selection many times or selected for all nba team or nba defensive st team many times in their career but it would all go to waste if they never won a championship it would mean that player was a good individual player kobe anyone but he did not have what it takes to get his team over the hump what is it that separates a wilt chamberlin from a michael jordan we all know wilt was far more dominating in his days that they had to change the rules to curve his effectiveness i'm pretty sure he had at least or basketball stars on of his teams during his career but he never managed to form a dynasty the way michael has that just shows you power of team's effectiveness is far more greater than an individual talent is towards a championship i do agree with you that wilt chamberlin was a far more complete player and the most dominant center to ever play the game in comparison to bill russell but defensive wise bill was at the head of the pack because he was able to slow wilt down enough so his teammates can score more points on the offensive end if you were to put chamberlin in this day and age and you pair him up with a kobe bryant or a dwyane wade you could be looking at multiple championships or even a potential dynasty boston had too much talent back then and the luck of the irish seems to be getting them lucky most of the time because now they've added all stars to play alongside another one in paul pierce to be lucky enough to be considered not just a good but an nba great player you need to have talent and you need to be in the right place at the right time imagine if kobe never got drafted by an l a team that had a shaq in his prime at the time imagine if mj never retired imagine if shaq never got traded to miami imagine if magic never got drafted by a team that featured kareem and worthy how many players would miss out on winning an nba title so talent can only get you so far but sometimes you need a little ok a lot of luck to get far in this league sometimes that means being given the opportunity to play for a championship contending team as a rookie where you don't have to shoulder much of the burden for your team's success or it could mean being in the right place like sam cassell in houston at the right time like robert horry in his different championship teams no matter how you put it being very talented doesn't always guarantee a championship or a hall of fame status but if you're talented you're lucky and you overcome obstacles thrown in your path then your chances of becoming a successful nba legend is pretty darn good  Dallas Cowboys Rasheed Wallace St. Louis Cardinals January 2005 in sports Philadelphia 76ers Kansas City Chiefs Hakeem Olajuwon Tim Duncan San Francisco 49ers Jerry Lucas Houston Astros Allen Iverson Phil Jackson Super Bowl IX LeBron James American Football League Minnesota Vikings Golden State Warriors Wayne Gretzky Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXV National Football League Lore Baseball New Mexico Lobo Basketball St. Louis Rams Pete Rose Women's National Basketball Association Minnesota Timberwolves Cincinnati Reds Emanuel Gin__bili Norway national football team Boston Bruins Super Bowl X Continental Basketball Association Karl Malone Chicago White Sox Charles Barkley Luther Head Atlanta Braves Super Bowl XXVI Boston Red Sox Baltimore Ravens College basketball NBA Draft Dirk Nowitzki Detroit Red Wings Toronto Blue Jays New York Jets Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl VI Seattle Mariners Syracuse University Orange Super Bowl XXIII Florida Marlins International League

is there any catholic nba players probably a number possibly who were or still are active catholics eva longoria said that both she and tony parker are from catholic families you can tell who wears the pants in that family but it is naturally part of the mexican culture for those of mexican ancestry that the woman runs the family so whatever eva tells the media tony parker just has to keep his mouth shut and not dispute i do think that with eva starting to date a year old boy in tony parker has made tony parker into more of a man an example is that starting spurs point guard tony parker spent the entire fourth quarter of the close out game of the nba finals on the bench while after starting to date eva longoria tony parker has seemed to have grown seemingly a lot under the influence of eva and played in the and nba finals close out game fourth quarters although in in the fourth quarter as the spurs started out the first minutes of the close out game scoreless it was finally tim duncan who scored straight points to get the spurs on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter of the nba finals closeout game and then the argentinians two of the big three argentinians from their gold medal team took over with the argentenians ginobili and oberto scoring of the last spurs points in that fourth quarter where the spurs only scored points to win that game by point i am not so sure about tony parker being catholic although eva may have made him convert to catholicism but he could be with his chicago born and raised father and his dutch born and raised mother where in neither situation would there be a high probability of parker ever being a catholic unfortunately in france typically adult men have not seen the inside of a catholic church for probably most of the last century and in all of those beautiful french cathedrals are empty on sundays much of continental europe with the exception of small pockets like bavaria in germany germans consider bavarians like americans consider people from the state of mississippi or so i was told by a native bavarian no longer has much of an active catholic adult community as the active catholic adult communities are in the americas africa and the philippines for the most part but i am sure that there are faithful catholic adults in almost every community in the world but europe was once catholic which is now almost nothing the late atlanta hawks player jason collier went to catholic central high school in springfield ohio but that does not mean that he was catholic as many non catholics particularly athletes attend catholic high schools  San Antonio Spurs Tony Parker NBA Finals Chicago Bulls 2005 NBA Finals Emanuel Gin__bili January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Dream Team Rasheed Wallace Pittsburgh Steelers American football Tim Duncan Steve Nash Indiana Pacers David Robinson (basketball player) Michael Jordan Larry Bird San Francisco 49ers National Basketball Association Orlando Magic 1986 NBA Draft New York Giants Los Angeles Clippers World Series 2005 World Series Football (soccer) 2004 World Series Alex Ferguson Yao Ming United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics New England Patriots Satchel Paige Winter Olympic Games Toronto Raptors Minnesota Timberwolves International League Norway national football team Iron Bowl Continental Basketball Association Illinois Utah Jazz Volleyball Hispanic February 2005 in sports Robert Horry Dennis Rodman June 2004 in sports Denver Nuggets Allen Iverson Steffi Graf Poker jargon Cleveland Browns November 2004 in sports Boxing Carolina Panthers Houston Rockets Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics Oakland Athletics Andre Agassi Pete Rose Arizona State University Super Bowl XXXIII Luther Head Moses Malone July 2004 in sports NBA Draft October 4 in baseball Al Michaels Roger Federer Atlanta Hawks Chicago Blackhawks Cincinnati Bengals NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Carlos Arroyo Betting (poker) San Antonio, Texas American football strategy 1957 World Series October 16 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series College basketball Detroit Pistons Wilt Chamberlain National Football League Lore German language Pinball Water polo Sandy Koufax 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup

would this be a good trade to make the boston celtics win it all this year tony allen and brian scalabrine for tyronn lue and solomon jones from the hawks i know the celtics need a point guard but i would keep tony allen and scalabrine i think tony allen is underrated he is a good defender at both wing positions and is actually quite athletic considering ray allen's ankle injuries and average defense it helps to have a more physical defender backing him up especially during the final minutes of the game when you need a stop also scalabrine is a decent role player when he doesn't need to play big minutes lue and jones are average players at best but i think there are still veteran free agents out there that can be better pickups at their positions and a pickup from the free agent pool will not cost the celtic any more of their players  Orlando Magic NBA Finals Chicago Bulls Tyronn Lue New York Knicks Larry Bird Indiana Pacers Basketball New York Giants Water polo Gary Payton (basketball) New Jersey Nets Boston Celtics Michael Jordan Toronto Raptors Detroit Red Wings Philadelphia 76ers Volleyball Chicago Blackhawks Houston Rockets Los Angeles Clippers Steve Nash American football Dennis Rodman Wilt Chamberlain January 2005 in sports Boxing Ice hockey Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Boston Bruins Rugby union positions National Basketball Association New England Patriots New York Yankees Yao Ming Pittsburgh Steelers Rugby union San Francisco 49ers Glossary of American football Wayne Gretzky Leeds United F.C.

i believe the clippers will do good next season here's why i have a good feeling they will make it into the playoffs this year although elton brand injured his achilles he will be percent better around month into the season which isn't to bad al thornton will be able to contribute right away and will defintely help the clippers with his athleticism and potential they also just recently signed brevin knight he was an underrated point guard and averages about assists for game he was exactly who the clippers needed so their lineup would be elton brand pf sam cassell brevin knight pg corey maggette sf al thornton backup sf chris kaman c cuttin mobely sg frequently used bench players tim thomas quintin ros the clippers have picked up a great point guard for their needs and picked a future star in al thornton i think the clippers made excellent moves considering their salary i hope the best for the clippers next season and for those who hate on the clippers don't be hatin i don't think the clippers will rush brand back into the season after he has his surgery because he nba season is a marathon not a sprint they'll probably keep him out for months to give the injured achilles tendon some time to heal i injured my tendon playing b ball and it took me at least months get off a boot and crutches but in brand's case he also has to deal with his achilles so it may take a little longer the reason why the clippers won't rush him back is because why would they want to jeopardize their playoff hopes just to win a few more games at the beginning of the season but you do bring up a valid point now that they've signed point man brevin knight it should be a perfect fit on a team full of scorers mobley maggette brand t thomas and thornton knight should have no problems finding a scorers and he should have a career year in the assists categroy next season they have a decent bench and a fomidable starting lineup the one downside to this team is the age declining in performance factor cassell mobley t thomas brand and even maggette most of the key players on this team are either in their prime or declining in performance adding thornton gave the clippers some youth to build upon while brevin knight supply some leadership in the absence of livingston and cassell but the question still remains whether this groups still has enough in the tank to compete in a tough western conference that question will ride heavily on the shoulders of elton brand  Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Toronto Raptors Orlando Magic International League Houston Rockets Minnesota Timberwolves New York Giants NBA Finals Boston Bruins Mario Lemieux National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Carolina Panthers New York Jets New England Patriots New Jersey Nets Cincinnati Bengals Steve Nash Toronto Blue Jays New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Utah Jazz 1986 NBA Draft Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Cleveland Browns Michael Jordan Los Angeles Kings Detroit Red Wings Yao Ming Kobe Bryant Luther Head January 2005 in sports National Basketball Association 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXVII Playoff Miami Dolphins Wayne Gretzky Rodney Rogers Baseball Hartford Whalers December 2004 in sports LeBron James Larry Bird Women's National Basketball Association NBA Draft Bobby Knight Philadelphia 76ers Continental Basketball Association West Bromwich Albion F.C.

who is better gerald wallace or josh smith who do you think is better people definitely a tough choice but i would choose gerald wallace josh smith is definitely the better dunker and better post up player but wallace is less turnover prone and shoots a higher percentage defensively smith is more likely to guard the slower small forwards and some power forwards whereas wallace gets the assignment of the athletic wing players given the nba's recent rule changes that emphasizes speed and freedom of movement on the perimeter and given the recent influx of talent at the wing positions wade carmelo durant lebron etc wallace seems to be more valuable as a defender so given that wallace is more efficient offensively and has the ability to guard the wing positions defensively i would give him the nod over smith  Water polo LeBron James Rasheed Wallace Volleyball Toronto Raptors NBA Finals Rugby union positions Baseball Chicago Bulls Leeds United F.C.

do you think that nowitzki's game has decreased i am a dallas fan and a big supporter in nowitzki but in the past two years or so i've have seen his game decrease in certain ways don't get me wrong because i still see him as an awesome basketball player but what i'm really saying is that i've saw much better in him a little bit longer ago but i still am happy for him that he's recieved that mvp i just think it came two years a little too late what i'm also saying is his performance can be really low when it matter's the most say when he lacked his game in the nba finals i usually look at average steals per game and average blocked shots per game to tell when a player has lost a step dirk had career lows as a starter in steals and blocks per game looking at dirk's stats other than his fg his three point fg and his ft dirk had his best year in years as a nba starter in shooting but still duncan outshot dirk from the field by and nash outshot dirk by from the field while nash outshot dirk by about from three point land dirk shot his normal from the free throw line as did nash shoot right at dirk's steals and blocks per game as a starter were way down to his lowest level ever as a starter with one of dirk's worst years in rebounding and dirk's lowest three point fg output as dirk only made three point fgs for the entire regular season dirk has a rep as a three point shooter but only made three pointers over an game regular season this past year dirk had his lowest scoring average in his last three years and his second to lowest scoring average in his last last five years in summary dirk had one of his worst years ever as a starter in the nba and was given the mvp i would not disagree with your comment if dirk received his mvp two years ago in but dirk receiving the mvp for the season is ridiculous in one of dirk's worst years as a year nba starter i think that this year's mvp for dirk was a makeup call for not giving dirk the mvp two years ago while i feel that steve nash earned the mvp a year ago in with amare out all year while in steve nash had just about a career year across the board with personal bests in almost every statistical category including his highest scoring average and his most assists per game average i do not see how steve nash could receive the mvp but be denied the mvp award for nash having his best year ever in the nba during the regular season dirk's stellar year which i agree with you was in which was of mvp caliber but dirk in my opinion lost about two steps between the season and his mvp year where dirk only scored three pointers all year i agree entirely with your comments and would not object had dirk received the mvp in even though dirk's season was one of his worst as a nba starter the mvp voting in my opinion should have gone as follows steve nash tim duncan dirk i do not jump on avery johnson's bandwagon where he stated that the mvp is the best player on the best team in the league as that is the first time i have heard that definition for a mvp in any sport nash in set personal bests in points per game assists per game fg three point fg and his typical or so ft not to mention another outstanding year in rebounding nash had a career year in dirk in was at a career low in many categories near career lows in other categories and with average statistics at least for dirk in most other categories i firmly believe that the mvp award was a makeup for not giving it to dirk in but dirk did not deserve the mvp in as dallas won all of those games with a very long bench of at least players contributing in every game which resulted in dallas excellent regular season record  Cincinnati Bengals Michael Jordan David Robinson (basketball player) Donovan McNabb Luther Head Los Angeles Clippers Basketball Super Bowl XXVII Houston Rockets Shaquille O'Neal 2005 NBA Finals Wilt Chamberlain Wayne Gretzky Toronto Raptors January 2005 in sports Utah Jazz San Francisco 49ers New England Patriots World Series Mario Lemieux New Jersey Nets 1957 World Series Allen Iverson Pat Garrity Pittsburgh Steelers New Mexico Lobo Basketball Ben Wallace Andrew Bogut Julius Erving Super Bowl IX Dallas Mavericks Super Bowl XXVI Three-point field goal Baseball Toronto Blue Jays Hank Aaron Rasheed Wallace National Football League New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Super Bowl XIV Ty Cobb Sandy Koufax Super Bowl XII Chicago White Sox Super Bowl XXI Minnesota Timberwolves Dream Team Chicago Blackhawks Super Bowl XIII St. Louis Rams Kansas City Chiefs Dikembe Mutombo Volleyball Troy Glaus Super Bowl XXXVI Baseball statistics Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl V Randy Johnson Super Bowl XXV Scottie Pippen Karl Malone Batting average Buffalo Bills Jerry Lucas Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Robert Horry Detroit Tigers Gary Payton (basketball) Pete Rose Pedro Mart__nez Eurobasket 2005 Wayne Simien Julius Hodge Seattle Mariners December 2004 in sports Philadelphia 76ers Hakeem Olajuwon

lakers solution lets hear your opinion i think the best plan for the lakers is just to hold on this season and wait kobe can't opt out of his contract next summer so i say they just wait till when kwame brown's million dollar contract expires giving them cap room to sign a big free agent like gilbert arenas or shawn marion next trade off odom for key role players players such as robert horry brent barry chris duhon and boris diaw have a line up of something like gilbert arenas derek fisher kobe bryant brent barry robert horry luke walton boris diaw radmanovic chris mihm andrew bynum good plan huh this should provide kobe with a championship contender and satisfy him enough to sign a new contract since trading kobe seems like a bad idea he's never going to be happy anywhere else he needs a city like los angeles to put on his show he loves the spotlight too much and the city needs a player like him to draw a crowd and keep fan loyalty up plus after the fit he just had im not sure any other contending teams are going to want him on their team publicly bashing their players and front office or how about a line up like derek fisher jordan farmar kobe bryant brent barry shawn marion luke walton andrew bynum radmanovic alonzo mourning chris mihm i think we should wait till next year to make any trades all the good players are taken and nobody wants to let them go our best bet is have the lakers get along and play wiht passion all year and i mean the whole team we are a young team and i really think bynum will step up this year last year we were not suppost to make the playoffs according to everybody else and we did so there was an improvement i don't understand why people are talking smack kobe needs to be a better leader and help this guys grow because if he does that and then win the championship i would feel better and people will have more respect for him we could get another superstar or two then realy kobe did not lead us to the crown i know la is a demanding town but we will be ok go lakers  Dallas Mavericks San Francisco 49ers Dallas Cowboys New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Steve Nash Kansas City Chiefs Cleveland Browns New York Giants American Football League Rugby union positions Page Falkenberg Super Bowl XXVII Miami Dolphins Indianapolis Colts Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl X Super Bowl VI Dallas Stars Water polo Buffalo Bills Ravi Shastri Super Bowl XXI Indiana Pacers National Basketball Association Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl V High jump University of Texas at Arlington Super Bowl XII National Football League Lore Dirk Nowitzki Minnesota Vikings Mark Calaway Hank Stram 2005 NFL season Brian Close FC Rostov San Antonio Spurs Rugby union St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXVIII Dog agility GunBound Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXX History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) National Football League New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXI Cincinnati Bengals Michael Jordan Super Bowl I NBA Finals University of Texas at Dallas Vince Lombardi Super Bowl Norway national football team Detroit Lions Super Bowl XXV Cross site scripting Utah Jazz World Series Yao Ming Dallas Texans (NFL) Tampa Bay Buccaneers Toronto Raptors Dennis Rodman Arkansas Razorbacks Donovan McNabb Jack Charlton International cricket in 2005 Nickname Super Bowl VII Jerry Krause Pok__mon Trading Card Game Kapil Dev Clown Lance Hoyt Ice hockey All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship November 2 in baseball Mack Brown Super Bowl IX HTML element Oakland Athletics Karl Malone Grant Hill (basketball player) Super Bowl XXXVI Germ__n Figueroa Super Bowl XVII Texas Longhorn Athletics Pat Riley Badminton Atlanta Falcons ESPN25 1957 World Series Florida Marlins Ra (board game)

this is a believable trade that will make the lakers contenders again http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash just think of that starting lineup javaris crittenton sun yue kobe walton odom o'neal with a consistent bench that includes chris mihm mo evans derek fisher and ronny turiaf this could be the trade that gets them over the hump especially if sun yue or crittenton turn out to be good point guards also remember that kwame only has one year left on his contract so if larry bird doesn't think kwame is a great player who does the lakers can persuade the pacers to have million dollars off their salary by next season that helps with their rebuilding vision i really do hope they can make a trade work without giving up odom they're just one more peice away from a championship and i believe oneil's the guy crittenton actually showed great promise during the summer league hopefully the lakers just hit gold on him with this team maybe they can even lure chris webber and maybe another veteran point guard this would add alot of depth to their team great trade  HTTP cookie Homestar Runner National Basketball Association Philadelphia 76ers Gmail Allen Iverson Python programming language Ajax (programming) NBA Draft Andrew Bogut Hello world program Al Michaels Utah Jazz Teen Girl Squad Google Cross site scripting Envelope Tyler, Texas Bonnie Tyler Phishing Temple University Simple Mail Transfer Protocol HyperText Transfer Protocol New Jersey Nets Julius Erving December 2004 in sports David Stern E-mail E-mail spam Ben Wallace NBA Finals Kobe Bryant January 2005 in sports Visual Basic .NET Java programming language Web traffic EA Sports Jumpstart 3rd Grade Boston Celtics Whois Steven Tyler SAML Dikembe Mutombo Liv Tyler Denial-of-service attack Women's National Basketball Association Barenaked Ladies Direct marketing Danny Ainge Bill Laimbeer NBA Jam June 2005 in sports Friends Command pattern Quizbowl The Jim Rome Show XMLHTTP Search engine optimization AppleScript Apache HTTP Server Atlanta Hawks San Antonio Spurs David Robinson (basketball player) Anonymous remailer Easter egg (virtual) AmigaOS February 2005 in sports The Mary Tyler Moore Show Mary Tyler Moore Continental Basketball Association Extreme Championship Wrestling Intranet Anne Tyler RuneScape cheats ESPN NBA Draft Lottery Channel One News Family Guy Futurama (TV series - season 4) Memphis Grizzlies Rick Barry Stopping e-mail abuse Lakers-Celtics rivalry Facebook (website) MSN Messenger Larry Brown Indiana Pacers HTML November 2004 in sports Wilt Chamberlain Lotus Notes Patrick Ewing Boy Meets World New York Knicks Michael Jordan Basketball Denver Nuggets I2P Detroit Pistons 2005-06 NBA season

celtics comeback with the addition of ray allen and kevin garnett and the presence of paul pierce will the celtics finally stop sucking and restore their former glory i'm currently a spurs fan but i was a celtic fan during the bird era the acquisition of kg allen definitely helps but they will take time to gel maybe they will struggle in the early part of the season in terms of sucking they will definitely stop doing that in fact they will not even be remotely in the vicinity of sucking they'll be closer to the contender zip code three perennial all stars who are all known to be unselfish will guarantee a playoff spot in the relatively easy east maybe even a top seed once the celtics are in the playoffs don't be surprised if they have a deep run maybe even get into the finals if they get lucky but ultimately the nba champion will come from the west most probably the defending champion spurs  Toronto Blue Jays 1986 NBA Draft NASCAR Rookie of the Year Toronto Raptors Yao Ming Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago Bulls Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Clippers Carolina Panthers New England Patriots Indiana Pacers National Basketball Association Orlando Magic Seattle Mariners New York Giants 2005 World Series San Francisco 49ers The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award Minnesota Timberwolves Houston Rockets 1984 NBA Draft Boston Bruins Greg Maddux Starting pitcher Liverpool F.C.

ncaa question were can i find a list of ncaa schools with mens division i basketball listed by what each school specifies in law business medicine ect i would imagine that any division school would have a business school with many having an attached law school however medical schools are a different situation say like lamarcus aldridge or durrant went to texas where there is no attached medical school on campus or even a medical school in the same town with the closest medical school being miles away but going to any division or division ii or division iii school does not stop you from applying and being accepted at a medical school now where the ih w bridge just collapsed wednesday that bridge was one of two bridges to the north of the university of minnesota campus just blocks away there are also two bridges just to the south of the university of minnesota campus there were a total of about four bridges up to last wednesday within a mile or so of the university of minnesota campus point being is that the university of minnesota has an attached medical school unlike some division i schools who have medical schools in the school system but just located in a different city my point is that applying for law or medical school is that it is not necessary to attend undergraduate school at that campus or even in that university system if you want details on a specific school as what majors they offer then i would recommend that you do an internet search of that division i's official school website to find out what is offered which at most division i schools should be a to z with the law school and medical schools usually being separate detached schools whether on the same campus or in a different city in the same university system to get to something like a medical school you apply to as many as you can if you qualify as there are only a limited number of spaces so a medical school often times will not be the same as an undergraduate school for most medical students  National Basketball Association Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics Women's National Basketball Association Volleyball NBA Finals Chinese Basketball Association Dodgeball Basketball Shyness Street photography Philip Zimbardo Street basketball College basketball Netball Julius Erving Sylvia Sidney Big East Conference New Jersey Nets Andre Agassi Magic Johnson Doug Collins New Mexico Lobo Basketball Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Wilt Chamberlain Tennis court Everwood Alfred Lee Yao Ming Vince Carter Four square Playoff Moses Malone Detroit Pistons Rasheed Wallace Love-shyness Louis XV of France Roger Federer University of Kentucky Wheelchair basketball James Naismith Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics Grace Coolidge Atlantic Coast Conference Korfball Coyote Ugly (film) Badminton University of Missouri - Columbia Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University) Alexis Bledel Tag Remus Lupin Dartmouth College Bill Russell (basketball) Pat Summitt The Championships, Wimbledon Tim Duncan 2005 NBA Finals Power forward (basketball) George Mikan Lisa Leslie Mike Krzyzewski Utah State University Jesse L.

a trade i know will never happen but worth looking at http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash there seems to be a misconseption that the mavericks are happy about paying terry as much as they do for what he provides he is onttheir long term asnwer at any position and he is at best a streaky shooter yes when he's hot you'd never think of leaving him but when he's not he is a defensive liability who will jack up bad shots the lakers need fresh bodies and a shooter who is streaky is better than a shooter who always misses which is what they have now terry is still a big enough name to be appreciated in la while farmar is unnecessary piece of the lakers puzzle as he is a mediocre shooting guard and now is the third option for point guard the lakers get the fresh blood in nowitzki to get rid of the current regime of kobe who wont win very much as is while not plunging deep into the lottery the lakers cannot ever do that the league wont let them they lose got cut off the mavs wont have any excuses as they free up salary cap space while getting someone with legit playoff success who will do whatever necessary to win dallas is a godo team that would fit kobe's need to be the best player on a championship worthy team why do peopel call jason terry a superstar he used to be the best player on some god awful hawks teams but now he's on a real team and they are overpaying him majorly you all missed the point which was that they would have extra money to go out next season when a ton of top teir talent is available who would you rather have dirk and terry or kobe and gilbert arenas i dont think this would work trading superstar for another doesnt work for me because the teams are pretty much the same position as before just a difference superstar and without dirk dallas has pretty much no frontcourt you cant expect dampier and diop to hold it down without dirk and terry dallas is just kobe and howard which is just a better version of kobe and odom i mean dallas will still be a good team but i dont think they will win a ring with kobe and no dirk  Kobe Bryant Kobe New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Karl Malone Los Angeles Lakers College basketball Phil Jackson Shaquille O'Neal LeBron James Allen Iverson Randy Moss Derek Fisher 2004 NBA Finals Michael Jordan Bear Bryant Katelyn Faber Dream Team John Salley Felice and Boudleaux Bryant Joe Namath NBA Finals Shooting guard 2000s Jerry West Football World Cup 2002 Phoenix Suns July 2004 in sports Amare Stoudemire Gary Payton (basketball) Vlade Divac Tracy McGrady Orix Blue Wave New Jersey Nets Slam Dunk Contest New York Giants Tom Leykis Los Angeles Clippers Sam Perkins Vince Carter August 2004 in sports USS Robinson (DD-562) January 2005 in sports Top League Brandy (entertainer) Chuck Cooper Planet of Fire Japan national rugby union team Nicole Richie Japan Rugby Football Union Japanese baseball NBA Slam Dunk Contest Softball 2002 Tour de France ESPN25 J.

what current players in the nba do you think will be in the hall of fame tell at least note the nba does not have its own hall of fame as currently the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame is the only basketball hall of fame around with less than half of its member being nba basketball players maybe only rd of its members being retired nba basketball players something like players from every league of about hall of fame members so it is very very difficult for a nba player to get into the only basketball hall of fame so just being a many time nba all star will not get someone into the naismith memorial hall of fame without a very long and successful nba career full of nba championships nba scoring titles nba mvps etc as the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame is not a nba hall of fame and as the nba does not have a hall of fame your average many time nba all star without a very long career of over a dozen years without championships plural and scoring titles plural and mvps plural will not see the inside of the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame for many years if ever phil jackson coach to be inducted in sept nba referee mendy rudolph to be inducted in sept michael jordan karl malone tim duncan shaquille o neal hakeem olajuwon adrian dantley steve nash kevin garnett allen iverson jason kidd john stockton scottie pippen patrick ewing gary payton dennis johnson nba coach don nelson nba coach popovich nba referee earl strom nba commissioner david stern kobe bean bryant naismith hall of fame seems to be very good character conscious so it may take kobe until old age to be considered unless kobe wins a championship or two on his own and some mvps and maybe in time chris webber dirk reggie miller tim hardaway tracy mcgrady as there is no such thing as a nba hall of fame most likely the following will never be in the naismith memorial hall of fame at least based on present successes ben wallace not the type of player that the naismith hof honors being a shot blocker with nba title does not do it durant a long shot you need a long and very successful nba career to make this hall of fame robert horry no individual achievements no chance gilbert arenas a very long shot at this point needs a very successful nba career billups little to no chance at this point lebron needs a very successful long nba career carmelo needs a very successful long nba career ray allen without additional major achievements no paul pierce without additional major achievements no wade needs a very successful long nba career vince carter needs a championship or mvp living on a rep of being able to dunk will not get anyone into the hall of fame antawn jamison needs a very successful long nba career rasheed wallace no due to character issues and lack of individual achievements yao ming needs a very long and successful nba career grant hill not even close right now mutumbo not even close brent barry never bibby henry bibby or mike bibby neither never manu not even on the hall's radar screen probably too old at this point parker not on the hall's radar screen if parker can average over ppg win some more titles or win a mvp or two maybe marion not on the hall's radar screen jermaine o'neal not on the hall's radar screen derek fisher what but no dwight howard needs a very long successful nba career not on the hall of fame's radar screen josh smith needs a very long successful nba career not on the hall of fame's radar screen anfernee not really without a miracle comeback amare stoudemire needs a long and very successful nba career and more than just first team all nba not on the hall of fame's radar screen chris bosh needs a very long and successful nba career but at this point not on the hall of fame's radar screen vin baker not even on hall of fame's radar screen joe johnson never jason terry never carlos boozer needs a very long and very successful nba career deron williams needs a very long and very successful nba career

i think lakers should give up these players for jermaine this is not espn trade machine since jermaine has expressed his desire to play alongside kobe in la i propose a deal that would send brian cook jordan farmar andrew bynum and either maurice evans or sasha vujacic to indiana in return for o'neal and maybe a draft pick or some money this way indiana gets the center they need a good shooter in cook along with a young pg in jordan farmar and a good off the bench player in maurice evans or sasha vujacic what do you guys think that's a very suitable scenario that has a slight possibility to happen the main thing for the lakers is to hold on to odom while still trying to require jermaine o'neal we'll see what happens in the next couple days  Michael Jordan Shaquille O'Neal Craps Yao Ming Basketball Slam Dunk Contest Chick Hearn 1986 NBA Draft Steve Nash NBA Slam Dunk Contest Julius Erving Katelyn Faber NBA Street SLAM Magazine Shooting Nike, Inc.

is there a way that i can improve my ball handeling and crossovers in basketball every time i try to cross someone i either get the ball stolen or lose control of the ball so is there a way i can improve my ball handeling and improve my crossovers ball handling is like walking it has to feel natural and what you do when dribbling is all reaction in a basketball game find a basketball court and dribble two balls basketballs up and down the court one down and the other up then practice dribbling both balls up and down at the same time both balls rise and fall together this will improve coordination and timing and footwork dribbling thru your legs back and forth nonstop in a standstill position make sure your legs are spaced far enough apart to do it though improves dribbling and muscle coordination and stregnth when dribbling stand with your legs spread apart shoulder width and bounce the ball back and forth from the left to your right hand doing it as hard as you can in a crossover fashion standing still this will get your hands and feet used to how your body should be when crossing someone practice your crossover without anyone in front of you at all when you are comfortable going left and right incoorporate a human into your workout remember when dribbling the ball things are very important dribbling stregnth and footwork strength is valuable for so many reasons you say they keep stealing the ball are you nervous or telegraphing your crossover if they can read your body language then a faster set up for the xover is needed if your body is going one way and your feet another way then that explains the loosing the ball just give yourself enough room to cross the player up dont wait till they are in arms reach to start the move give yourself room to operate good luck  Tim Duncan New York Knicks Basketball Philadelphia 76ers San Antonio Spurs Chicago Bulls Steve Nash National Football League Cam'ron Dikembe Mutombo 2005 NBA Finals National Basketball Association Denver Nuggets David Robinson (basketball player) NBA Finals College basketball Volleyball Women's National Basketball Association Dream Team Continental Basketball Association New York Giants Hip hop collaborations Golden State Warriors Jerry Krause Orlando Magic New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Juelz Santana Babe Ruth Emanuel Gin__bili Ben Wallace Water polo Sam Barry Bobby Knight Los Angeles Clippers Utah Jazz Kobe Bryant Fort Minor Chelsea F.C.

what position do you think i should play for basketball i am wondering what position i should go for in basketball i am years old i'm ' and still growing im decent at posting up but i'm better at driving and shooting 's i am good with the ball and i have great vision on the court for assist but i'm wondering if i should go for pf or sf it is far too early for you to settle on a single position work on your entire game and if you retain your versatility it will be a benefit to you coaches high school and college are looking for people who can play more than one position it gives them flexibility especially in close games look at a guy like bruce bowen he can guard ' s' and ' s' forwards both small and power and even some post men he rebounds can drive and can shoot the ' ' primarily from the corner he doesn't get a lot of publicity but he makes the spurs really tough if you continue to develop your entire game if your versatility is well defined thru college you will find that at least one nba team will be interested another to check is adam morrison  Dallas Mavericks Steve Nash National Basketball Association Dirk Nowitzki NBA Finals Philadelphia 76ers David Robinson (basketball player) NBA Draft Utah Jazz Phoenix Suns Michael Jordan Houston Rockets New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Minnesota Timberwolves Pat Riley Dream Team 1986 NBA Draft January 2005 in sports Chicago Bulls College basketball NBA Live series Andrei Kirilenko (athlete) Boston Celtics Women's National Basketball Association Juwan Howard Chinese Basketball Association Alfred Lee February 2005 in sports San Antonio Spurs Atlanta Hawks Sam Perkins Memphis Grizzlies December 2004 in sports New York Knicks Randy Savage Indiana Pacers Tim Duncan NBA Draft Lottery Rick Barry Orlando Magic 2005 NBA Playoffs November 2004 in sports Continental Basketball Association Karl Malone Allen Iverson University of Memphis Dana Barros Larry Brown Milwaukee Bucks Denver Nuggets Patrick Ewing Yeah Yeah Yeahs New Jersey Nets Jerry West NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Basketball Detroit Pistons Bulls-Knicks Rivalry May 2005 in sports Los Angeles Clippers NBA Street Phil Jackson 2005-06 NBA season Golden State Warriors Wilt Chamberlain Expansion Team June 2005 in sports John Stockton Moses Malone Charles Barkley Larry Bird Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Hakeem Olajuwon Emanuel Gin__bili Cleveland Cavaliers Kobe Bryant 2004 NBA Finals Leicester City F.C.

who's a better shooter bob mcadoo or dirk nowitzki they have been compared a lot but who is the shooter dirk or bob i'd say nowitzki what do you guys think mcadoo and dirk are different types of players and different type of shooters coming from two different backgrounds i love pure shooters and became a big bob mcadoo fan in the ncaa final fours in when mcadoo was playing for north carolina for only one year as he came out of college early in mcadoo's one college year at north carolina he led north carolina to the ncaa final four of mcadoo averaged during the regular season points per game in his only regular season at north carolina from mcadoo was a ncaa all american in his only year at north carolina mcadoo was a big man who had an unblockable shot using his long arms to bring the ball way behind his head before he shot as only mcadoo could do mcadoo's shooting range was typically from to feet out hitting nothing but net with an unblockable shot and played about half of his career before the nba had the three point shot mcadoo almost typically shot over from the field whild dirk shot right at for the first time in dirk's year nba career in possibly because dirk quit taking three point shots in as dirk only made three pointers in this entire past regular season mcadoo's highest nba fg was significantly higher than dirk's highest which was right at and mcadoo's career nba fg was over with dirk's being dirk's first season shooting at which dirk did in mcadoo was a pure shooter and the first big man to make a career of shooting from long range however mcadoo managed to hit the boards much harder than dirk coming out of college early mcadoo was named nba rookie of the year won one regular season nba mvp award won three consecutive nba scoring championships ppg as his highest scoring average won two nba rings in four nba finals mcadoo's regular season mvp year was when mcadoo averaged ppg averaged rebounds per game far higher than anything dirk has done shot from the field higher than anything dirk has done and blocked shots per game that same year in the playoffs mcadoo's buffalo braves in the playoffs against future hall of famers forward center elvin hayes and center wes unseld and a very deep baltimore bullets team took the baltimore bullets to games in the playoffs where mcadoo averaged in that series which almost upset the heavily favored baltimore bullets while mcadoo averaged points per game and rebounds per game in that buffalo braves baltimore bullets game playoff series agains hall of fame forward center elvin hayes and hall of fame center wes unseld so it cannot be said that forward center bob mcadoo did not face stiff big man competition in hall of famers in their prime in elvin hayes and wes unseld mcadoo's nba career ranged from a young kareem abdul jabbar still in his prime and included several seasons of michael jordan's early years also nba legends of this era included kareem dr j moses malone magic bird and many more all in their primes so it cannot be said that mcadoo played in a different era against less competition unless you say that mj kareem abdul jabbar dr j moses malone magic johnson larry bird elvin hayes etc all in their primes not the ends of their careers were chump change while mcadoo played his year nba career shooting a higher field goal percentage for an entire year career than dirk's highest single season in the nba mcadoo was a pure shooter at north carolina in the nba regular season and in the nba playoffs mcadoo shot over from the field mainly at long range for a nba season career while dirk for the first time barely exceeded from the field in the regular season on very few three point attempts three point attempts this past season while shooting over from the three point line for a tremendous total of dirk scoring a nba low as a nine year starter with three pointers made this past season so in my opinion dirk got right at from the field for the first time in his ten year nba career career by not taking three pointers this past season and moving closer to the basket in the mcadoo range of to feet mcadoo's top ppg average in the regular nba season by season in the nba were ppg ppg ppg ppg ppg and ppg again mcadoo shot over in of his nba seasons compared to dirk's nba season out of nba season mcadoo's top rebounding per game averages were rpg rpg rpg rpg and rpg from to which were the kareem years at kareem's prime and mj's first several years in the nba with dr j moses malone bird and magic playing their prime nba years during this time period as far as rebounding mcadoo even got to play against wilt chamberlain and jerry west's los angeles lakers when chamberlain concentrated almost solely on rebounding mcadoo played taller than his listed height and seemed taller than listed but definitely had a very long wing span you had to see mcadoo shoot and to see mcadoo play to appreciate the difference in mcadoo's shooting and dirk's shooting as mcadoo could get his shot off over anyone in the nba with his long wing span and his great jumping ability where in high school mcadoo set a state high jump record in winning the state high jump title as a high school senior in north carolina bill russell once said about bob mcadoo he's the greatest shooter of all time period forget that bit about the 'greatest shooting big man mcadoo could fill the hole with the rock over anybody no matter how tall they were or how good a defender they were mcadoo's three nba scoring titles nba mvp and nba rings help prove this to some extent but i truly feel that bob mcadoo from the ncaa final fours to his last nba playoff game could score at will which is why bob mcadoo is in the hall of fame not only that but mcadoo was a big time rebounder too i will grant that dirk is one of the better free throw shooters in nba history compared to mcadoo's very respectable year career free throw average as mcadoo's single season career high free throw percentage was during mcadoo's mvp year at as far as a comment that dirk has a lower fg dirk has usually shot around from the point line which will not lower dirk's career or single season fg average that much plus mcadoo played of his years in the nba with the point shot mcadoo knew his limitations and pulled up just inside the point line normally to fire a to footer mcadoo was not a point shooter having played center most of his nba career as far as the comment that mcadoo did not play against competition then the same thing must be said for mj's early years as mcadoo played at the same time in the nba during jordan's early years plural and the prime years of all of the players mentioned above for the person making that comment does that mean mj's early years do not count as mj did not play against competition  Los Angeles Clippers Kobe Bryant Indiana Pacers Shaquille O'Neal New York Knicks Los Angeles Lakers NBA Finals Dream Team Houston Rockets Miami Heat

denver nuggets will be playing the sixers at philedalphia will iverson get booed like how vince carter gets booed in toronto because he left the raptors i think iverson will get booed in philedalphia because he left the sixers but i guess you really cant blame the city's for hating the players that left them didnt dr j stay with the sixers unlike iverson he wanted to go don't compare iverson leaving philly to carter leaving toronto as far as i could tell iverson never mailed it in to force a trade where as carter would put up about pts a night and was outright beligerent about it mostly because the team moved his mother's preferred parking spot at the acc if iverson initiated the trade that sent him to denver he was at least quiet about it and still played his a game to enable the sixers to get fair value for him carter supplied raptor fans with plenty of reasons to give him the treatment he gets in toronto i remember seeing an interview with a couple portland players following one of carter's worse games where they said he tipped them off to the coming play near the end of a close game i doubt iverson would ever be accused of something like that so i hope not he deserves a round of applause for past efforts but then we are talking about philly fans here so who knows  Rasheed Wallace Detroit Pistons NBA Finals New York Knicks Shaquille O'Neal 2005 NBA Finals New Jersey Nets 2004 NBA Finals Ben Wallace Toronto Raptors November 2004 in sports January 2005 in sports Steve Nash December 2004 in sports Yao Ming Chicago Bulls Dream Team Pittsburgh Steelers 1986 NBA Draft The Malice at The Palace Larry Bird Cleveland Browns Detroit Tigers National Basketball Association San Francisco Giants The NBA on ABC 2005 NBA Playoffs Utah Jazz June 2004 in sports International League Los Angeles Lakers 2005 World Series Kobe Bryant St. Louis Cardinals World Series Denver Nuggets Indianapolis Colts Emanuel Gin__bili Cleveland Indians Detroit Red Wings Pat Riley Ron Artest Minnesota Timberwolves Boston Red Sox San Antonio Spurs Michael Jordan ESPN25 Los Angeles Clippers Cincinnati Bengals Philadelphia 76ers Cleveland Cavaliers Grant Hill (basketball player) Miami Dolphins Larry Brown Knicks-Heat rivalry Water polo Tim Duncan September 2005 in sports Florida Marlins New England Patriots February 2005 in sports Continental Basketball Association Karl Malone Detroit Lions Bill Laimbeer NBA Draft Babe Ruth July 2004 in sports Super Bowl XVII Basketball Washington Wizards Free throw Miami Heat Houston Rockets Toronto Blue Jays Reggie Jackson Los Angeles Kings Joe Dumars Women's National Basketball Association Curse of the Bambino Phil Jackson Curse of the Billy Goat Cincinnati Reds Satchel Paige October 2004 in sports Super Bowl V Robert Horry 1957 World Series Portland Trail Blazers San Francisco 49ers October 4 in baseball National Football League Lore Playoff October 15 in baseball Toronto Maple Leafs Dennis Rodman New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets

what is with all of these old and retired nba players returning to play kevin willis penny hardaway and now reggie charles oakley and allan houston are thinking about returning don't get me wrong i like all of them but physically they can't perform the way they used to i think allan houston is going to make the biggest impact as a spot up shooter with a very deadly shot he'll be effective off the bench reggie can't run anymore and it will be easy for teams to put a defender on him standing at the three point line charles oakley is a joke penny's quickness is gone and i think he'll become frustrated with his limited mobility but pat riley did sign him so theres a huge chance that i'm wrong reggie miller definitely won't be coming back allan houston and penny hardaway had to leave the nba early because of injuries if they hadn't had injuries they might have already been playing charles oakley is a delusional old man  ESPN January 2005 in sports Electronic Arts Kevin Garnett December 2004 in sports EA Sports November 2004 in sports Monday Night Football George Mikan June 2004 in sports The NBA on NBC HyperText Transfer Protocol Bobby Knight Tim Duncan Minnesota Timberwolves 2004 NBA Finals October 2004 in sports April 2005 in sports National Basketball Association Larry Bird June 2005 in sports Boston Celtics Amare Stoudemire Women's National Basketball Association February 2005 in sports Sports timeline July 2004 in sports March 2005 in sports NBA Finals Madden NFL Shaquille O'Neal ESPN NFL Football Archie Moore Al Michaels Wilt Chamberlain Mullet (haircut) Michael Jordan Major League Baseball television contracts Stormfront Studios Shaun Livingston Kevin Nash Emanuel Gin__bili Dream Team August 2004 in sports Dream Job (Season 2) Power forward (basketball) Sextant Bill Simmons Around the Horn Family Guy Pete Maravich 1990s Phoenix Suns Hunter S.

how about this way trade revised trade from earlier question http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash this is a very good trade the guy above is talking about how the pacers are getting too much out of the trade of course they are they just gave up their all star and in return got two scorers in jefferson and maggette this trade is good all around because everyone gets what they want the clips get a big man in krstic to play brand's minutes while he's injured and get other role players as well especially in marcus williams who can back up the point in case brevin knight cassell and livingston all are injured and most likely they will all be because they're all injury prone the nets get the dominant big man they've always wanted everyone is happy good trade  National Basketball Association Larry Bird Basketball Continental Basketball Association Croquet Robert Horry Danny Ainge NBA Finals Yao Ming Rasheed Wallace Luther Head December 2004 in sports Michael Jordan Tim Duncan John F.

what do you think of this trade way trade http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash wow this is probably one of the greatest trades posted up here each of the important players that are traded on each team either want out or the team wants them out so that works out well the only problem is i doubt the nets would give up marcus williams they gave up eddie house to the celtics and now they won't have a legitimate backup point guard for jason kidd he's also a great player who is supposed to blossom into a beautiful pg with the mentoring of jason kidd of course i think indiana would definitely accept this trade because they obviously need to get rid of jo before he simply becomes a free agent and they get nobody for him now that i think about it the nets would most likely also accept because carter made a statement about how he would love jo on the nets and the organization needs to give up future players to possibly get to the finals like the celtics did the clippers would probably be the happiest with this trade because they git rid of maggette and everyone knows he's not wanted there kristic would also fill the void for the injured brand good trade  Toronto Raptors Yao Ming New York Knicks Minnesota Timberwolves National Basketball Association 1986 NBA Draft Rasheed Wallace NBA Finals Chicago Bulls Julius Erving Norway national football team Utah Jazz January 2005 in sports Basketball Los Angeles Clippers San Antonio Spurs Cincinnati Bengals Houston Rockets New York Giants Toronto Blue Jays Michael Jordan 2005 NBA Finals Larry Bird New Jersey Nets New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Orlando Magic LeBron James San Francisco 49ers Wilt Chamberlain Luther Head National Football League Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) Minor league baseball Jerry Lucas David Robinson (basketball player) Cleveland Browns Buffalo Bills Super Bowl V Pittsburgh Penguins Continental Basketball Association Volleyball New Mexico Lobo Basketball Allen Iverson New England Patriots Magic Johnson St. Louis Rams Emanuel Gin__bili Water polo International League Moses Malone November 2004 in sports Mario Lemieux December 2004 in sports Tim Duncan Boston Bruins Super Bowl XXXIV Phoenix Suns Jerry Krause Portland Trail Blazers Ben Wallace Dirk Nowitzki Indianapolis 500 Super Bowl IX Dikembe Mutombo American football strategy Scottie Pippen Syracuse University Orange Montreal Canadiens Chick Hearn Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Indiana Pacers Glossary of American football 1977 NBA Finals Kevin McHale Philadelphia 76ers Danny Manning 1957 World Series NBA Draft Football (soccer) positions June 2004 in sports Super Bowl XIII George Mikan Women's National Basketball Association Amare Stoudemire Arkansas Razorbacks Buck Williams Rick Barry Detroit Red Wings Miami Dolphins Eddy Curry

who is better iverson or nash must read i keep hearing ppl say nash is better than ai and can do more for a team one guy even said had nash played for philly they would have been better when i hear this i laugh nash is a great player but ai is much better you cant compare ai career of dominating for yrs and leading a weak philly team with no other allstars to a finals in which philly played the lakers tough for every game if ai played for the suns this year they would have won it all nash couldnt win it with two all stars plus the best role players in the league and for those who said nash would have made philly more sucessful because he can pass and make his teammates better please pass the ball to who who can score on philly who was there to pass the ball to when iverson tooked them to the finals and as far as iverson style of play they said all that junk about jordan in the s the bulls will never win because he takes too many shots thats just bs nash cant make a grown man hit a open shot ai is arguably better than nash standing at a towering ' ai has had an amazing career lead his team to the finals was an mvp all star mvp plays through injury and has also lead the league in scoring smallest man to do that in allan's last complete season as a sixer he average just short of points and assists per on a team with less talent than any team nash has ever played with ai has also been a exceptional team defender who can get in the lanes quickly and make numerous defensive plays with his speed and readiness ai has averaged steals in his career and nash a measly nash's assist averages were comparable to iverson's until he began playing with the suns the suns have two of the best finishers in the game in amare and marion not to mention now with barbosa if ai played consistently with these guys i think they would fare better than nash's lack luster playoff performances in which he continues to fall short especially against tony parker whom owns nash ai is better in my opinion  Los Angeles Lakers George Mikan Basketball NBA Finals National Basketball Association Boston Celtics Philadelphia 76ers Utah Jazz San Antonio Spurs Larry Bird New York Knicks Houston Rockets January 2005 in sports Phil Jackson Jerry West Pat Riley New Mexico Lobo Basketball Golden State Warriors College basketball Los Angeles Clippers Indiana Pacers Chicago Bulls Karl Malone Robert Horry National Basketball League Julius Erving Dream Team Detroit Pistons 2004 NBA Finals Kobe Bryant Denver Nuggets Emanuel Gin__bili David Robinson (basketball player) Michael Jordan Magic Johnson Minnesota Timberwolves 2005 NBA Finals Milwaukee Bucks Hakeem Olajuwon Yao Ming Reggie Miller SBC Center New Jersey Nets Shaquille O'Neal December 2004 in sports Rasheed Wallace Gary Payton (basketball) 1986 NBA Draft Tim Duncan DePaul University American Basketball League 1961-63 Dikembe Mutombo NBA Draft Steve Nash Clyde Lovellette February 2005 in sports Dennis Rodman Lakers-Celtics rivalry Three-point field goal Larry Brown Wilt Chamberlain Harlem Globetrotters Moses Malone University of Utah November 2004 in sports NBA Live series Playoff format New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Sam Barry American Football League Charles Barkley University of Minnesota Atlanta Hawks Bobby Knight Syracuse University Orange University of Arizona Women's National Basketball Association Calbert Cheaney NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Arkansas Razorbacks Sam Perkins John Salley Phoenix Suns St. John's University, New York July 2004 in sports University of California, Santa Barbara Maurice Lucas Allen Iverson Albany Patroons Orlando Magic Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bill Russell (basketball) Mike Krzyzewski Chinese Basketball Association Dwyane Wade Danny Manning Chick Hearn Pete Newell Vlade Divac NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship

if you were the celtics would you trade ray allen and paul pierce to la for kobe would you if you were the lakers what would you say to this offer if i were the celtics i would definitely go for this trade straight up i'm not a big kobe fan i don't like him but i respect his game there is no one better in clutch situations and no one can carry a team by himself like kobe can yes he is a crybaby and a ball hog but he is also a winner a great defender an unstoppable scorer and has many more years ahead of him pierce is past his prime and allen is coming off surgery making them question marks i would go for the sure thing if i were the lakers the only reason i would take this trade is if kobe demands it and is unhappy in la i wouldn't want my top gun grumbling all season long  Free throw Baseball Basketball Tim Duncan Toronto Raptors Sandy Koufax Technical foul Continental Basketball Association 1957 World Series Football (soccer) Pittsburgh Steelers Florida Marlins New England Patriots Diego Maradona Indianapolis Colts Softball Breath of Fire III Michael Jordan Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 2004 World Series Yao Ming Cincinnati Bengals American football Steve Nash Oscar Gutierrez Alan Shearer Chicago Bulls Personal foul Miami Dolphins New York Jets Rasheed Wallace Atlanta Flames Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion John Calipari Boston Red Sox St. Louis Rams Iraq War Terrell Owens Dean Smith Bowl Championship Series Paul Ince Detroit Pistons Cleveland Browns Vin Scully Norway national football team Ultimate (sport) Babe Ruth Indiana Pacers Water polo Shichinintai Chris Jericho Beyblade Emmy Award New York Giants RuneScape Mini-Games Relative clause 2005 NFL season Kevin Keegan Menachem Begin 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Paul Westphal Bobby Knight Chris Webber Baseball statistics Snooker Rugby union No-hitter Bill Laimbeer Three-point field goal Joe Paterno History of Test cricket (to 1883) Gothic metal New York Knicks Alexander Cartwright Crystal Palace F.C.

my very very early division predictions so much more could still happen as far as trades and what not but right now here are my predictions for the division races this upcoming season east new jersey boston toronto new york philly cleveland detroit chicago milwaukee indiana miami washington orlando charlotte atlanta west phoenix golden state lakers kings clippers with brand out for awhile utah denver portland seattle minnesota san antonio dallas houston new orleans memphis comments agree disagree nice work but i like boston and toronto over new jersey still if new jersey develops chemistry finds a way to get jefferson more involved and if just one post player steps up you could be right on there i like chicago over detroit and must stress that i think miami has a good chance to take their division but the three top teams there will all win less than games but all three might make the playoffs anyway in the west dallas may have a better record than san antonio but again i expect san antonio to be a better playoff team golden state and the lakers should run neck and neck again this year but i do have the warriors over the lakers the dark horse is houston as they gear up to be an up tempo team they could present real problems even for the spurs and dallas still i agree with you but would like to add that those three teams could have three of the top four records in the regular season and if phoenix falters maybe even the three best  Chicago Bulls Toronto Raptors Charles Oakley NBA Finals New York Knicks Shaggy dog story Charles Barkley The Simpsons San Francisco 49ers Salary cap Professional wrestling slang Lady Bouvier's Lover Nike, Inc. 2005 NBA Finals New Jersey Nets NBA Jam Bulls-Knicks Rivalry Poker jargon Philadelphia 76ers Redundant array of independent disks Doomsday argument The Amazing Race Airport Chess strategy and tactics Scottie Pippen Backstreet Boys 1957 World Series Theory of conduct Pinball Futurama (TV series - season 5) Frederick Forsyth Cheap Trick Buck Williams Watch Playoff format ESPN25 Strap-on dildo The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Annie Oakley Aerial (dance move) Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Allman Brothers Band Escape from New York Embedded system Who Shot Mr. Burns?

your opinion spurs or pistons who's more boring the spurs or pistons cause they have similar styles of team play similar style they both play physical and effective team defense with the pistons being slightly dirty whereas the spurs are very dirty pistons play a guard centered offense that is highly team oriented and relies on screens and offensive sets also prince sheed rip and billups take about the same no of shots and shoot from almost the same spots on the floor they're a jump shooting team who prefer the footer with of them having point range and they're not very effective at scoring inside the spurs are so radically different on offense san antonio's offense revolves around tim duncan either he scores over his man or he gets doubled and passes it out or if he fails to score over his man then the refs call a foul and he gets free throws the spurs play an inside outside game with a highly effective slasher distributing kicking out the ball and a dominate inside player much like the miami offense revolves around shaq and wade the spurs use duncan and parker only without the dunks and personality it's not our fault they have the personalities of rocks the nba is a source of entertainment it's a viewers' sport and the big statue and le boring need to at least trash talk a bit after they win to show that they've got some spunk i know that knee in the groin or foot you stuck under that jump shooter is a way of letting your actions on the court speak for you but i'd really rather hear duncan diss someone in an interview however as a comparison between the two a defensive jump shooting team with few dunks few fast breaks and not a lot of blocks gets the nod as being more boring the spurs are pretty exciting when you watch ginobili come off the bench he can flop to the floor before any opponent even noticed he came off the bench he can tumble in a heap when the other guy's feet ahead of him and moving in the opposite direction and amazingly the refs still give him free throws oh and he can also hit wild layups and knock down the lefty style horry and bowen are also prone to violence and injury of other players giving the spurs the bad attitude they need reminiscient of the pistons bad boys era parker can make circus layups and duncan can use the glass of course duncan can block shots which is always a plus because i love blocks sheed doesn't nearly block as much and they've lost ben who woulda given pistons the edge in dunking shot blocking energy plays and watching him take free throws and wondering how many he'll brick or whether his shot will even hit the rim  Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

the top two western conference powerhouses there can only be two teams at the top right now so out of the spurs mavs and suns lakers rockets jazz who gets to be number and number note not trynna hate but the suns have not been to the finals so my opinion is the mavs and spurs although the mavs have hurt themselves by losing to an th seed but i think since they have beaten the spurs they should be number two the the spurs the jazz and lakers have not been in the finals for a long time so i'm not sure if that counts what is y'all opinion the spurs are definitely number although many may say that they style of play isnt excited who needs excitedness when they have won championships in seasons although from the trend they will not repeat as champions this up coming season they should be in line to win there final championship for this decade the following season as tim duncan and the others would something to prove to the world that they are still good at what they do best playing fundamental basketball to bad that big rob wont be aroung to win his th championship then my second choice is a harder one since there are two other elite teams in the west namely the suns and the mavericks however although i like the mavs i will lean towards choicing the suns as the second power house in the west although some may say that mavs plays better defense that the suns and also the suns havent reach the nba finals which the mavs did two seasons ago and have really improved as a unite since then my choice of the suns has nothing to do with the fact that the mavs were knocked out of playoffs in the first round by a number seed however if they had return as far as the western conference finals it would have been an automatic choice of them been the nd best team in the western conference however this is the reason why i have choosen the suns as the nd best team in the west they have three all star players in nash the best true point guards in the league just added of kidd mainly because of kidd age and also ahead of baron davis as injuries after injuries has affected davis from showing how great he would have actually been secondly stoudemire is a beast in west and he suites the suns offensive style and third their is aka matrix or shawn marion who honestly am not a big big fan of but this guy is a gem although some may say its the suns style of play why he is so efficient and effective i would disagree with that this all star player of course by his consistency is capable of putting up good numbers with whatever team he plays with cause he play hard and enjoys crashing the boards the supporting cast of barbosa bell diaw jumaine jones jalen rose marcus banks and the recent acquire grant hill the suns just edge out a mavs side which includes all star nowitizki and cast such as josh howard and devin harris who will be a good player down the road plus jason terry who has proven himself as a good scorer jerry stackhouse greg buckner erik dampier desagana diop devean george and recently acquired eddie jones a fact that we all have to look at is chris webber although his all star performance is behind him if the mavs can land a big fish like him from the pistons that should increase their chances of hoisting the david obrien trophy come next year june however this is why we all watch the game cause its unpredictable and full of excitement also as a true fans of the sport we all enjoy pretending to be owners now and then and see what trade or who player can put our favourite team to the next level and win it all  Water polo Yao Ming Steve Nash Tim Duncan 1986 NBA Draft Baseball Glossary of American football January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Badminton Toronto Raptors Robert Horry Ben Wallace Chick Hearn Table tennis American football New York Giants Indiana Pacers Michael Jordan Utah Jazz Professional wrestling attacks Tennis Ultimate (sport) Poker jargon Houston Rockets Professional wrestling slang 2004 NBA Finals Fast bowling Billiards Cincinnati Bengals Eight ball New Jersey Nets December 2004 in sports Aerial (dance move) Softball Snooker American football strategy Slam Dunk Contest Ice hockey November 2004 in sports Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Mixed martial arts Canadian football Orlando Magic Super Bowl XXV Tag Three-point field goal National Football League Lore Dream Team Julius Erving Babe Ruth Super Bowl XXVII Los Angeles Clippers Paintball Football (soccer) Free throw Blood (computer game) BASEketball Tris Speaker World Series Racquetball GunZ The Duel Field hockey Rugby union Cleveland Browns David Robinson (basketball player) Internal ballistics Super Bowl XXXIV Beer Pong Team Fortress Classic Tenshinhan Wayne Simien Pete Sampras Martial art Super Bowl X The Malice at The Palace San Francisco 49ers

i love basketball and im help me i just turned and i love basketball i can do tricks ending in lay ups or close range shots but in the ymca gym i can barely get in a freethrow by jumping i hate that is there anyway i can get better at shooting a basketball because i have good form and position but still i have to resort into bad form in a game so i could get in a good pointer which i would probably miss is there any way if so please define and i was wondering do weights stunt your growth first of all using weights a lot will stunt your growth especially during your age right now i would focus more on aerobic exercises like running biking and jumping rope things that can also help you in basketball for example jumping rope really improves your jumping ability and speed as far as shooting i would suggest learning from the pros try to use the shooting positions of ray allen and allan houston both of them really have nice form and another great shooting aid especially for free throws is dr tom amberry's method here's his website http www freethrow com index htm and you can look for his video online or maybe at your local libraries ok good luck  Autograph New Jersey Nets Phoenix Suns Time Out of Mind Nottingham Forest F.C.

who do u think will get the heat starting job for pointguard next year it is mainly between jason williams and smush parker first of all i do not really consider dwayne wade a point guard but consider this last year he brought the ball up court more often then not especially when the opposition used full court pressure made the first pass to the wing to initiate the offense then moved to the off side wing after receiving the ball on the wing he looked to penetrate passing enough to register over apg which led the team was by far the most effective passer on the team at getting the ball into shaq in the low post is better at that pass than just about any pg in the league and jason williams not even close and smush parker even worse led the team in to by a wide margin largely due to the fact that he attempted the most challenging passes just like one would expect of a point guard maybe if it walks like a duck and quaks like a duck its a point guard i guess at the very least d wade is the best pg og and sf on the team by far well come on what do say about that i at least expect a few thumbs down for this my guess is the job is williams to loose but he is no longer much of scorer and can not be trusted to handle the ball that much any more either is not a very good defender and has lost a step i would give smush a chance at least he can defend and williams disappears to often and for to long as far as smush and scoring he can score that's not his problem it is that he is inattentive as a point guard and would be better as a combo guard where his inattention to detail would not be so costly fair chance that he can redeem himself paired up with wade who will take most of the pressure as he had to do with williams all year late note just trying to be controversial here and generate some debate why if williams has riley's confidence did wade bring the ball up against full court pressure more often than williams if williams is still good enough to play as a full time starting point guard in the nba did wade average apg more that williams in just more mpg and why did wade have to attempt so many challenging passes just to give the offense some semblance of flow what is it that people like so much about williams not that its his fault he played courageously and well for a number of years but has been beat up and abused and just cant be counted on anymore in any way now if you use him when match ups are in his favor thats ok he can still be effective and valuable better began to groom parker at least he plays d for the position or look for someone else maybe even a combo guard as wade really plays a lot of point anyway  NBA Finals New York Knicks Steve Nash Los Angeles Clippers Kobe Bryant Allen Iverson Yao Ming Shaquille O'Neal National Basketball Association Larry Bird NBA Draft Utah Jazz Basketball Michael Jordan 2005 NBA Finals Orlando Magic Gary Payton (basketball) January 2005 in sports Chicago Bulls LeBron James Kwame Brown Houston Rockets Phoenix Suns 2004 NBA Finals New Jersey Nets Robert Horry Indiana Pacers Boston Celtics Dream Team Denver Nuggets Jerry West Karl Malone Phil Jackson Lakers-Celtics rivalry New Mexico Lobo Basketball Detroit Pistons New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Magic Johnson NBA Live series 1986 NBA Draft Memphis Grizzlies Chick Hearn Rasheed Wallace Wilt Chamberlain John Salley NBA Slam Dunk Contest Isiah Thomas Tim Duncan Charles Barkley Los Angeles Sparks Dallas Mavericks Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Slam Dunk Contest Reggie Miller College basketball Chris Webber Miami Heat Tayshaun Prince Emanuel Gin__bili Kenyon Martin Minnesota Timberwolves Scottie Pippen Sam Perkins ESPN25 New York Giants Three-point field goal Kyle Broflovski Tyronn Lue December 2004 in sports SBC Center Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) November 2004 in sports The NBA on ABC July 2004 in sports Andrew Dice Clay Bobby Knight Pat Riley Dikembe Mutombo Dennis Rodman Katelyn Faber Continental Basketball Association English cricket team David Robinson (basketball player) Vince Carter Moses Malone National Basketball League June 2004 in sports The NBA on NBC Major League Baseball television contracts Dwyane Wade Buddy Guy David Stern George Mikan Golden State Warriors Georgia Institute of Technology Danny Ainge

most domenant of all time ok here's my question so many people say bill russell was the greatest center of all time cause of his rings not to take anything away from him granted he was a beast on d but if that were the case championship wise then rob horry would be the greatest power foreward of all time right he's got more rings then any other in my opinion when people say russell was better then wilt and shaq is the most domenant center of all time have either scored pts in a game or avg pts and rebs then when critics said all the big dipper was was a chucker the very next year he led the league in asst's name another that has done that so what i'm getting at is how can people think russle is the greatest of all time i'd like to know i think when he says most dominant he is talking about the most dominant center not the most dominant players but to answer your question i think russell is the most dominant center ever defensively i dont think he is the most dominant center overall that probably belongs to wilt i think your right russell gets more credit as a player because he was on such a stacked team wilt was always getting beat by russell's celtics that doesnt mean that russell was better just his team but russell still deserves alot of credit and is one of the best of all time still wilt was more dominant  Boston Celtics NBA Finals Larry Bird National Basketball Association Kevin McHale Indiana Pacers New York Knicks Michael Jordan Houston Rockets Chicago Bulls Basketball Julius Erving Minnesota Timberwolves Dream Team San Antonio Spurs Ramon Rivas Tim Duncan New Jersey Nets Philadelphia 76ers Salary cap Women's National Basketball Association Toronto Raptors Continental Basketball Association 2005 NBA Finals Phoenix Suns Kobe Bryant Lakers-Celtics rivalry Playoff format Golden State Warriors NBA Live series NBA Draft Los Angeles Clippers Moses Malone Gary Payton (basketball) Dennis Rodman Charles Barkley Rasheed Wallace ESPN25 Bill Walton Los Angeles Lakers Larry Brown Detroit Pistons Playoff Orlando Magic Robert Parish Steve Nash Karl Malone 1986 NBA Draft San Diego Padres January 2005 in sports NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Tag Yao Ming New Mexico Lobo Basketball Atlanta Hawks Allen Iverson Shaquille O'Neal Phil Jackson UEFA Champions League Isiah Thomas College basketball Bill Fitch Table tennis Flip Saunders University of Arizona February 2005 in sports Three-point field goal December 2004 in sports Hakeem Olajuwon National Hockey League Paul Westphal 2005 NBA Playoffs New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Norway national football team 2004 NBA Finals 2004 World Series David Robinson (basketball player) Home team November 2004 in sports Carlos Arroyo Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Tony Parker Bill Russell (basketball) Cleveland Cavaliers Football (soccer) June 2005 in sports Volleyball Magic Johnson World Series Danny Ainge San Francisco 49ers NBA Street LeBron James Portland Trail Blazers Rick Carlisle NBA Draft Lottery Los Angeles Kings Bobby Knight

who think andrew bynum is actually good well he did put up up some impressive games with the lakers but is he really good is he really worth keepin around and waiting until he reaches his prime while wasting away the best player in the game's prime in the process phil jackson himself said he's not impressed with his work ethic especially on defense he doesn't feel bynum can move his feet well problems similar to shaq where he wouldn't help out on screen and rolls what do you guys think yo i read a lot of your posts i know how you think socks is weak because hes a strictly back to the basket type center and he'll never develop to compete against the stoudemires of this league that said regardless of his downward spiral at the end of last season i think the kid has a lot of upside its just his intangibles that come to question the kid just doesnt show heart if its enough for your coach to question your work ethic it becomes pretty clear that ur desire to win becomes questionable plus socks has the best mentor guiding him to brilliance right now its all up in the air man judging from his past season he has shown that he is improving and adjusting to the nba if u remember the jermaine o neils and al jeffersons and how long it took them to develop then theres reason to believe that bynum has the potential to hit that caliber its just a matter of does he have the desire to get there his one time display of heart was when he pushed shaq and dunked on him can he consistently be as aggressive as then i also think the lakers didnt play bynum in the summer league so that he wouldnt diminish his trade value by either a getting injured or b getting schooled by bottomdweller d leaguers in front of scouts i also think the organization is so hesitant to move bynum because of how much they've invested into him they started out garnishing extreme interest by opposing teams and now its all simmered down because his hype and playoff performance has killed his value what should the lakers do with the guy stand pat or sell sell sell  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Basketball University of North Carolina at Charlotte Bobby Knight Atlantic Coast Conference Wake Forest University 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Duke University National Invitation Tournament Sam Barry National Basketball Association New Mexico Lobo Basketball John Calipari Ron and Fez Mike Krzyzewski Syracuse University Orange Jeff Mullins Big Brother (USA TV series) Football chant Michael Jordan University of San Francisco Wayne Simien New York Giants Neighbours The Dukes of Hazzard San Antonio Spurs Adolph Rupp College basketball Continental Basketball Association Freedom Hall Auburn University John R.

who wants to criticise my trade lol http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash i am just doing this for fun really its no big deal when i first saw it i thought it was the most random trade ive ever saw but then i thought about these teams and it is actually almost perfect you have to be an a i fan because you linked these two teams i am a huge allen iverson fan and a er fan so i love both these teams okay the ers hugest problem is that their rebounding is terrible and k mart is an amazing rebounder and nene proved to be a really good player from the last games of season till end of the spurs series and that dalembert has never played the way they wanted him to play denver needs a true point guard steve blake left and iverson fits better at the guard use the sixers for example when ai was guard they did terrible in his last season worst team in the nba but when andre miller came in they went on a huge run and were not too far from making the playoffs denver would take a hit for losing nene because of how he shocked the world in actually losing weight and playing like people thought he would when he was first drafted but if dalembert can play like he is supposed to it will be a far better substitute the con's of this trade are ers also dont have a point guard so louis williams or willie green would have to play times as good as previous seasons to actually be good this season for the sixers to give up almost two footers in hunter who might be ' and sammy dalembert should be hard for a kenyon martin who hasnt played in two seasons and has a monster contract and a really bad knee sixers need to plan for the future and taking nene's year million contract and kenyons year million a year contract is not going to help that goal i actually love the trade more for the nuggets than the ers but i still think it is a great trade i dont think it would work because of business issues though  New York Knicks Shaquille O'Neal Los Angeles Lakers Kobe Bryant NBA Finals National Basketball Association Steve Nash Indiana Pacers Los Angeles Clippers New York Giants Michael Jordan Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Toronto Raptors Larry Bird Continental Basketball Association 1986 NBA Draft Chicago Bulls Phil Jackson Pittsburgh Steelers Minor league baseball National Football League New Jersey Nets Houston Rockets Basketball Los Angeles Kings Boston Red Sox Utah Jazz San Antonio Spurs St. Louis Rams New England Patriots Baseball Orlando Magic Julius Erving Emanuel Gin__bili Philadelphia 76ers Microeconomics Dream Team Golden State Warriors 2005 World Series Volleyball 2004 NBA Finals Theory of conduct Poker jargon 2005 NBA Finals New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Detroit Pistons Amare Stoudemire Cincinnati Bengals Baltimore Ravens Rasheed Wallace Glossary of American football Mario Lemieux Toronto Blue Jays Katelyn Faber Major League Baseball television contracts Pat Riley Minnesota Timberwolves Boston Bruins Super Bowl XXI Moses Malone Carolina Panthers San Francisco 49ers January 2005 in sports American football Atlanta Flames Ra (board game) Kansas City Chiefs Buffalo Bills Boston Celtics Rugby union Equine conformation Arizona State University Wrigley Field Dikembe Mutombo World Series Wayne Gretzky Rugby union positions Philadelphia Phillies Miami Dolphins Three-point field goal Chicago White Sox The NBA on ABC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Chicago Blackhawks Super Bowl XXV The Jackson 5 New York Jets Playoff The Malice at The Palace Jerry Krause English cricket team Slam Dunk Contest

how does this trade look http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash samuel dalembert to lakers for bynum kwame and st round pick dalembert is an established rebounder shot blocker and an agile defender he has a decent post up game too he can average ppg rpg every night along with blocked shots i believe the lakers have enough offense already they just need an above average defender in the middle to anchor the defense i think dalembert is the answer philly gets a true back to the basket center who is fit for the rugged grind it out style of game in the east and an expiring contract with kwame this gives them cap flexibility and allows them to lock up iguodala for a long term contract next year and they get to have st round picks in next year's draft one of their own and the lakers' what do you guys think like you said dalembert can average ppg and rpg per game he has the ability but will never live up to it no way the lakers would want to get rid of bynum for dalembert they wouldn't even give up bynum for jason kidd what makes you think they will give him up for dalembert a player who has not live up to anything in the nba bynum would benefit the lakers more in the future than dalembert  New Jersey Nets Toronto Raptors Orlando Magic New York Knicks Los Angeles Clippers Chicago Bulls Philadelphia 76ers Steve Nash San Antonio Spurs Indiana Pacers Denver Nuggets Pittsburgh Steelers NBA Finals January 2005 in sports New England Patriots Minnesota Timberwolves Allen Iverson Boston Red Sox St. Louis Rams Portland Trail Blazers New York Giants National Basketball Association Houston Rockets Sammy Sosa Dikembe Mutombo Dream Team Oakland Athletics December 2004 in sports November 2004 in sports Julius Erving Los Angeles Kings Moses Malone Carolina Panthers NBA Draft Chris Webber National Football League Wayne Gretzky Michael Jordan Kansas City Chiefs Wilt Chamberlain Yao Ming Baltimore Orioles 1986 NBA Draft Buffalo Bills February 2005 in sports International League Kenyon Martin Charles Barkley Cleveland Browns New York Jets Kobe Bryant Super Bowl XXI San Francisco Giants Larry Bird Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers Norway national football team Alex Rodriguez National Football League Lore New York Mets San Francisco 49ers 1957 World Series Cincinnati Bengals Andr__s Galarraga Phoenix Suns Emanuel Gin__bili Rodney Rogers 2005 NBA Finals Philadelphia Flyers New York Yankees Terrell Owens Florida Marlins Shaquille O'Neal Boston Bruins 2004 NBA Finals Reggie Jackson Mario Lemieux Super Bowl Washington Redskins Miami Dolphins Detroit Pistons History of baseball in the United States Toronto Blue Jays Chicago Blackhawks National Hockey League Qu__bec Nordiques LeBron James New Mexico Lobo Basketball Playoff Continental Basketball Association 2004-05 NHL lockout October 2004 in sports Tim Duncan Major League Baseball television contracts

should reggie miller stay retired it was a report sayin he was thinking about joining boston what do you think i think he should realistically how is he going to contribute meaningfully let alone to the extent that he'd help the celtics in a playoff situation sure miller is one of the best clutch shooters of all time but he's been retired for a couple years and if he isn't already in his 's he's very close he's going to be a defensive liability will have trouble getting open to begin with and won't be able to play many minutes plus the celtics already have ray allen and and miller's basically an older version of allen so miller's only going to be there to rest allen and as insurance in cast of injury and because of that miller's not going to be on the floor when crunch time comes around so there goes his greatest strength obviously miller should do whatever he wants to do but i think it's in his best interests to just run a trash talking clinic and bring young players up in the fine art of talking smack  NBA Finals Basketball Oscar Robertson Steve Nash Chicago Bulls Julius Erving Tim Duncan John Stockton Michael Jordan New York Knicks Utah Jazz Boston Celtics National Basketball Association San Antonio Spurs NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Larry Bird 1986 NBA Draft Dream Team Karl Malone George Mikan NBA Draft Bill Russell (basketball) Bobby Knight NBA Rookie of the Year Award Jerry Lucas Allen Iverson Center (basketball) Hakeem Olajuwon David Robinson (basketball player) 2005 NBA Finals Baby boomer Larry Brown Wilt Chamberlain LeBron James 1984 NBA Draft Emanuel Gin__bili Indiana Pacers 1981 baseball strike Toronto Raptors Stephon Marbury Houston Rockets Robert Horry New Mexico Lobo Basketball Orlando Magic Tim Hardaway Denver Nuggets Pete Maravich Detroit Pistons Continental Basketball Association David Stern Kappa Alpha Psi Dwyane Wade Bill Laimbeer Reggie Miller NBA Live series Ben Wallace Magic Johnson Golden State Warriors Charles Barkley Carlos Arroyo Portland Trail Blazers NBA Jam Milwaukee Bucks 1981 World Series Chuck Cooper Kevin Garnett Moses Malone Jason Kidd Isiah Thomas 2004 NBA Finals Dikembe Mutombo Tony Parker Dennis Rodman Yao Ming 1990s Cincinnati Bengals Salary cap Philadelphia 76ers Muggsy Bogues Phoenix Suns Don Nelson Toronto Blue Jays Hank Aaron Cleveland Cavaliers January 2005 in sports November 2004 in sports Luther Head Major League Baseball television contracts New Jersey Nets Los Angeles Clippers Rasheed Wallace NBA Street Sunday Times Rich List 2004 Kevin McHale Sue Bird Los Angeles Dodgers Phil Jackson SBC Center Kobe Bryant Temple University

anyone think reggie miller will be able to contribute if he comes to the celtics no doubt in his day he was one of the best shooters ever yes and i'll tell you why miller averaged over ppg in his final season in pacer yellow his main game is the pt game and a player who can shoot like miller doesn't lose his touch after years also the celts need one more shooter i know i know ray allen is arguably the best three point shooter in the league but besides allen and paul pierce the celts don't really have a prime shooting option tony allen's shooting might struggle after missing most of last season with an injury and rajon rondo still hasn't proven himself as a shooter reggie will not only help the celtics on the court but will also help off of it he is one of the most class players to play in the nba and has experience that can compare to some of the elite to ever play the game he is a time all star and has been to the conference finals times ray allen garnett and pierce combine for conference final appearances he'd give the celtics support off the bench and would certainly boost the celts chances of winning their th nba title  Mental retardation Dumb & Dumber SportsCenter Dream Job (Season 1) The Wack Pack Phoebe Buffay's songs Dream Job (Season 2) ESPN Mental illness Marilyn Monroe Shaggy dog story Autism John Constantine Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Luck Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Infinity Birth weight Alfred Korzybski 1957 World Series Intelligence (trait) Autism rights movement Pinball Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Helmet Buffalo Bills Eugenics Apostrophe (mark) Rosemary Kennedy Jiddu Krishnamurti Intelligence quotient Care Bears Controversies in autism Charley Steiner This is SportsCenter Humphrey Bogart Henry H.

why is everyone so jealous of kobe bryant he's the greatest ever by far and everyone knows it however people still talk as if jordan might have been better people should let kobe be and acknowledge him as the best athlete not only in basketball but in the history of sports i think people are just jealous because he has shown far superior character and athleticism i think it's the media's fault obviously the media was mad that kobe wouldn't sell out like jordan did so the media cuts him down every chance it gets jordan was a huge sellout and kobe has more character than to put his name on junk kobe did not even go to trial for anything and they call him a rapist that's stupid if we had an unbiased media then kobe would be regarded as the greatest basketball player ever  Salary cap 2004-05 NHL lockout Flat tax Microeconomics Michael Jordan 1994 baseball strike Chicago Bulls Wheel of Fortune National Football League Knots Landing Jarom__r J__gr Supply and demand NBA Finals Capital accumulation Tax Warren Buffett Nike, Inc.

do the jordan s lack quality cause i heard the leather cracks and the bottom turns yellow is it true it's not necessarily a quality issue for the yellowing the clear ice bottoms always yellow there are other shoes other than jordans that feature this clear sole and it just yellows it is a fact of life you can prolong it from staying out of the sun or keeping the shoe out of moist places the patent leather will crease as with just about any other shoe material it probably looks worse because of the appearance of the patent basically if you are going to do strenous activity in a pair of these it will wear like any other shoe but i hope you buy an authentic pair because there are a lot of fake xi's out there  Charlotte Bobcats Emeka Okafor New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Los Angeles Clippers January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Toronto Raptors The Malice at The Palace Phoenix Suns December 2004 in sports Steve Nash Playoff Chicago Bulls Dream Team NBA Rookie of the Year Award International League National Basketball Association June 2004 in sports Cleveland Browns New Jersey Nets Charles Barkley Pittsburgh Steelers Shaquille O'Neal Yao Ming National Football League Atlanta Hawks Ben Wallace NBA Finals Miami Dolphins NBA Draft Women's National Basketball Association 1986 NBA Draft The NBA on ABC Charlotte Sting Michael Jordan Chris Webber Toronto Blue Jays 2005 NBA Playoffs Detroit Pistons Norway national football team Major League Baseball television contracts Memphis Grizzlies Baltimore Ravens Charlotte Bobcats Arena November 2004 in sports San Antonio Spurs Rasheed Wallace Boston Red Sox NBA Live series Golden State Warriors Continental Basketball Association Houston Rockets Sammy Sosa Denver Nuggets July 2004 in sports World Series February 2005 in sports 2003-04 NHL season Jason Chandler Williams Utah Jazz 2004 NBA Finals New York Giants Buffalo Bills 2005 NBA Finals San Jose Sharks Emanuel Gin__bili Philadelphia 76ers Dikembe Mutombo New York Jets John Calipari Minnesota Timberwolves Kobe Bryant Playoff format 1957 World Series The Weakest Link Minor league baseball Donovan McNabb National Hockey League All-Star Game Dallas Cowboys NASCAR 2005 World Series Syracuse University Orange EA Sports ESPN David Robinson (basketball player) Los Angeles Dodgers Portland Trail Blazers Rex Chapman Larry Bird Seattle Mariners Detroit Red Wings Wayne Gretzky Madden NFL St. Louis Cardinals Oakland Raiders Washington Wizards Chicago White Sox

nba rulings please help me i have a few nba ruling questions please answer thats all i want and only nba and don't ask why not streetball explain a turnover if you put the ball between your legs and mess up and run to go get the ball and pick it up before anyone is that a turnover if you are done your dribble and through the ball straight ahead of you and run to get it and get it before anyone else is that a turnover player a catches the ball with player b behind him player a spins around him than dribbles and goes for a lay up can you do this in the theme song of the fresh prince of bel air when will is talking about shooting hoops in his home town and he starts doing all his fancing moves just standing there can you do that after you are done your dribble can you spin the ball on your finger throw the ball up and down without letting it land on the floor and all that stuff is that legal look again at this topic for more questions please go for best answer ok well you seem pretty unsure of nba rulings in general so ill try my best to explain them all a turnover is when you commit a violation or an error and it results in the other team getting the ball for example you throw a pass and the other team catches it thats a turnover another example would be if you dribbling and then stopped and then started dribbling again the ref blows the whistle and gives the ball to the other team turnover if you are dribbling and you lose control it's ruled as a loose ball so its up for grabs if the other team picks it up its a turnover but you you pick it up it is not if you pick it up you play it from there as if you just caught a pass yes that is considered a pass to yourself and you cannot do that the other team would recieve possesion you cannot throw a pass to yourself also if you shoot a shot and it doesnt hit the rim or backboard you cannot get that either but if any other player on the court touches it then it is a live ball and you can grab it yes if you are dribbling while you spin you can only take steps without dribbling or else it is a travel which is a turnover if you keep foot planted and step in a spinnig motion turn your body like around then dribble to your side and finish the spin by continuing the rotation and stepping with the previously planted foot that is a generic spin move and that is legal you cannot move your feet unless you're dribbling and once you start dribbling and you pick it up you cannot start dribbling again so as long as you do neither of the above you are aloud to play around with the ball all you want same as as long as you dont take steps or dribble again you can do whatever your heart desires with the ball i mean that is unless the defender steals it hope i answered these fairly well  Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Houston Rockets NBA Finals Scottie Pippen Dream Team Orlando Magic Los Angeles Clippers New Jersey Nets Phoenix Suns Pittsburgh Steelers Boston Celtics Boston Bruins Reggie Jackson Dennis Rodman Michael Jordan Robert Horry World Series Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Kings Bulls-Knicks Rivalry New England Patriots Reggie Miller Portland Trail Blazers Major League Baseball television contracts Detroit Red Wings 2005 NBA Finals Pittsburgh Penguins Carolina Panthers New York Rangers Super Bowl XXVII Philadelphia Flyers Penny Hardaway October 16 in baseball 2004-05 NHL lockout Golden State Warriors 2004 World Series New York Yankees Steve Nash Chuck Cooper Miami Dolphins Montreal Canadiens Minnesota Vikings Minnesota Timberwolves Point forward Boston Red Sox Reggie White Buffalo Bills Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.

how long is the jumpsoles program need info on how long the program is i wanna get some hops before basketball season and is it wise to workout with jumpsoles and then go play some ball i think months until you start seeing some real development you have to be diligent there will be a period into it where your hops will actually decline as your muscles transform work at it every day it does work my very white friend used it and was dunking on ' rims afterwards but don't focus only on hops it's a very very small part of the game your time might be better suited to working on ball handling and footwork dunking once in a while won't make you a starter but good defense and low turnovers will definitely help  Regine Velasquez National Basketball Association Baseball Stars Manila Karl Malone Dream Team Basketball Philippines NBA Finals Dirk Nowitzki Women's National Basketball Association Eurobasket 2005 Yao Ming Kobe Bryant San Antonio Spurs Tim Duncan Lupang Hinirang NBA Live series Shaquille O'Neal New Jersey Nets Orlando Magic Los Angeles Clippers Steve Nash Michael Jordan Philippine peso Economy of the Philippines Emanuel Gin__bili Free throw Kris Aquino Pinoy rock New York Knicks Predrag Stojakovi__ Andrew Bogut Chicago Bulls Milwaukee Bucks Toronto Raptors Filipino language New Mexico Lobo Basketball Kodocha Three-point field goal College basketball NBA Draft Philippine Basketball Association Katipunan Playoff University of the Philippines Wilt Chamberlain Larry Bird NBA Street John Stockton Michael Finley Maccabi Tel-Aviv (basketball) New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 2004 NBA Finals Personal foul Shot clock Gary Payton (basketball) Julius Erving Jon Secada Arkansas Razorbacks Philadelphia 76ers Luther Head Philippine general election, 2004 Norway national football team Spanish Creole 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Buck Williams Chauncey Billups Languages of the Philippines Television network Bill Russell (basketball) January 2005 in sports Playoff format Amare Stoudemire Utah Jazz February 2005 in sports Continental Basketball Association July 2004 in sports Allen Iverson Ateneo de Manila University National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) United States Air Force Academy Exhibition game Detroit Pistons Larry Brown Tagalog language Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics June 2004 in sports Andrei Kirilenko (athlete) Houston Rockets Charles Barkley The Malice at The Palace Golden State Warriors Rasheed Wallace Constitution of the Philippines Cleveland Cavaliers Clemson University Hakeem Olajuwon Ra__l L__pez
