red sox fans come here to vent about eric gagne i know the guy was a good pitcher a few years back but ever since coming to boston only once has he not allowed a run and he has now blown the lead in like the past games he came into he just gave up a lead by giving up a homer with a man on to miggy tejada gagne needs to get his act together and tito needs to use okeydokey exclusively until gagne learns to not suck again if you need to vent about gagne too then go ahead also venting about lugo and nancy drew is ok too also all you yankee fans who will undoubtably spam up this question with hate filled comments just do it already i have a feeling the red sox picked up gagne only to prevent him from going to the yankees who desperately needed bullpen help what was wrong with timlin delcarmen snyder okajima papelbon that's a solid bullpen actually if you wanna talk stats it's the best in the majors hands down what they need is another bat to help out the ailing papi and struggling drew and maybe another utility infielder to come in when lugo makes his error every other game you gotta hope gagne will pull things together but nows not the time to test him put him in aaa pawtuckett if he's still not over that arm injury that kept him out most of this season boston sure does have the bullpen to allow francona to send him down without blinking  2004 American League Championship Series 1957 World Series Tris Speaker Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth World Series New York Yankees Alex Rodriguez Cleveland Indians Red Sox Nation Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers October 10 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Reggie Jackson Roger Clemens Pedro Mart__nez Manny Ram__rez Florida Marlins 1986 World Series October 19 in baseball Baseball Fenway Park October 5 in baseball Chicago Cubs October 12 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Robin Ventura October 7 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts October 9 in baseball Home run Terry Francona Satchel Paige October 16 in baseball Curse of the Bambino Who's your daddy?

in mlb what counts as a strike please name all things thanks a strike is and pitch that is over the plate and between the logo on the batters shirt and his knees a strike can also be called if a batter swings and misses aswell as a foul ball on an uncaught third strike with no runner on first base or with two outs regardless of whether there is a runner on first the batter immediately becomes a runner the strike is called but the umpire does not call the batter out some umpires will actively signal that there is no catch of the pitch the batter can then attempt to reach first base and must be tagged or thrown out  Softball Baseball Interference (baseball) Strike zone Baseball statistics 1957 World Series Appeal play Out (baseball) Stolen base Perfect game Baserunning First baseman 2005 World Series Strikeout 2004 World Series Hit by pitch Baseball scorekeeping Doug Eddings Infield fly Bunt No-hitter 2004 American League Championship Series Rounders Alexander Cartwright Babe Ruth Origins of baseball Knickerbocker Rules Home run St. Louis Cardinals Chicago White Sox Cricket Tris Speaker Balk 2001 World Series Squeeze play (baseball) Don Denkinger Baseball slang Box score (baseball) Satchel Paige Knuckleball Baseball field Baseball Stars Intentional base on balls Pedro Mart__nez Laws of cricket Umpire (cricket) Fast bowling Catcher Curveball Detroit Tigers 1986 World Series Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 History of baseball in the United States 2003 World Series Rookie of the Year (film) Jerry Coleman Tag Boston Red Sox Kickball Ben Sheets Unassisted triple play October 14 in baseball World Series Leg before wicket 1986 American League Championship Series Fielding (cricket) Field hockey Earned run average The Inning I-70 Series Volleyball Reggie Jackson 1986 National League Championship Series 2005 National League Championship Series San Francisco Giants Dead-ball era Basketball Ty Cobb BASEketball Derek Jeter Brad Lidge Ken Harrelson Roger Clemens Dave Henderson Professional wrestling attacks No ball Water polo Negro league baseball Beanball Sydney Riot of 1879 Vin Scully Pitch (baseball)

what's wrong with the cubs' offense lately why so many strikeouts do you think the cubs players are to blame for their recent slump do they need to relax more and be more patient at the plate will the new players from the minors help the cubs compensate for soriano's absence how difficult can scoring runs possibly be what's goign to happen if the cubs start losing or even in a row will soriano's injury haunt the cubs the rest of the year whose fault will it be if the cubs miss the playoffs simply because of soriano's injury the cubs aren't being patient at the plate everyone is trying to be the hero by hitting the ball out of the park while their power hitters can't hit the ball out of the park jones lee ramirez combined for hr's in ' that's more than the entire team this year i've heard that it takes a solid year to regain strength in your wrist after a break that could be a reason why lee's power numbers are down i think it's definitely on the players they are paid to produce starting pitching bullpen outfield defense offense they never seem to be firing on all cylinders but look out when they do after calling up eric patterson minor league prospect the cubs have used rookies this year ten is not that high a number the cubs have used at least rookies in nine of the last years including rookies in they used less than in ' and ' in the last time the cubs won the nl central they used six rookies  Chicago White Sox Toronto Blue Jays Chicago Cubs World Series Boston Red Sox Sammy Sosa Seattle Mariners Baseball 2003 World Series Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers St. Louis Cardinals Florida Marlins 2004 World Series Pete Rose New York Yankees Pittsburgh Pirates Sandy Koufax 1957 World Series Volleyball Hank Aaron Cleveland Indians Baseball statistics San Francisco Giants Cincinnati Bengals Satchel Paige Tris Speaker Baltimore Orioles Mois__s Alou Carolina Panthers Home run New York Giants Texas Rangers (baseball) Pittsburgh Steelers Softball October 4 in baseball San Diego Padres Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry International League Ty Cobb Greg Maddux Houston Astros St. Louis Rams Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XXXIV Batting average Grover Cleveland Alexander New York Mets Reggie Jackson Wrigley Field History of baseball in the United States Gary Sheffield Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim November 1 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga October 10 in baseball October 3 in baseball 1919 World Series National Football League October 16 in baseball Corey Patterson Atlanta Braves Scott Podsednik October 27 in baseball Toronto Raptors New York Knicks Miami Dolphins November 4 in baseball Super Bowl XXIV Pedro Mart__nez October 14 in baseball Hideo Nomo October 12 in baseball Stolen base 2005 World Series Michael Jordan Buffalo Bills Newcastle United F.C.

why do so few baserunners steal home any more ty cobb did it times i'll bet if you added up the final career total of every player now active it wouldn't come out to has the game changed drastically for example were pitchers more apt to wind up with a runner on rd in cobb's day thereby making it easier to steal home or has the strategy of wait for the the big inning and the homerun become so prevalent that the steal of home is considered an unwise strategy on most occasions i think the image of jackie robinson stealing home in the world series against the yankees you've probably seen the footage of yogi arguing the call is unforgettable and the steal of home is certainly an exciting play back in the day offense was down so it would be a good idea to try anything to get a run in in this day and age you need an absurdly strong chance to make it break even for example with two out the run expectancy re with a runner on third and no outs is if he makes the steal then he nets a run and then we'd expect another for leading off an inning so if he makes it it's worth runs if he fails there are no runners on and one out a re of if he steals home successfully of the time and gets out of the time he breaks even is the breakeven mark no players steal second of the time successfully with two out the breakeven mark becomes which is still very hard to make it's a rare play because it is difficult to pull off and has high risk a better play is with runners on st and rd with out breakeven of but the odds of succeeding is higher than a raw steal of home but it's an artifact of the game such as win seasons consider it a rare occurance that shows heads up play and opportunists you need a walking lead and the stars to align right  Baseball 1957 World Series Stolen base World Series Baseball statistics Poker jargon Home run Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers Ty Cobb Interference (baseball) 2001 World Series Pete Rose Batting average Reggie Jackson Troy Glaus Andr__s Galarraga Florida Marlins 2003 World Series Tris Speaker 2004 World Series New York Yankees October 5 in baseball Cincinnati Reds San Francisco Giants Grover Cleveland Alexander Nolan Ryan 2005 World Series October 4 in baseball Houston Astros St. Louis Cardinals Baserunning 1919 World Series Perfect game 2004 American League Championship Series International League Rickey Henderson Softball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Lou Gehrig History of baseball in the United States Hank Aaron Atlanta Braves Pittsburgh Pirates Willie Mays Baseball scorekeeping American football Derek Jeter October 16 in baseball Sandy Koufax NBA Finals English cricket team October 22 in baseball Volleyball Chicago Cubs October 11 in baseball San Diego Padres Box score (baseball) Oakland Athletics Seattle Mariners Cleveland Indians Norway national football team October 10 in baseball October 20 in baseball Craps Dave Henderson Major League Baseball television contracts Gary Sheffield October 7 in baseball Cricket Baseball Stars October 15 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Manny Ram__rez New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers Sydney Riot of 1879 Blackjack Robin Ventura 2005 National League Championship Series October 3 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez Satchel Paige September 20 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Baltimore Orioles Minnesota Twins October 21 in baseball

why do people hate on barry bonds so much all the steroid talk when he's never failed a test the reason which any real student of baseball will understand for his success lately is simple he hogs the plate has his right elbow all over the plate he has owned the strike zone the last years and gets walks for every homer he hits his right elbow sits right over the plate why people don't knock him back i'll never understand but they don't so he feasts on strikes down the middle he doesn't swing at the ball unless he can knock it out of the park and if he gets fooled he'll still make contact walks in a season homers a year and fewer strikeouts than homers steroids don't give you that kind of performance statistically he's locked in period they are jealous that he is so good  Barry Bonds Baseball Sandy Koufax Hank Aaron Babe Ruth World Series Pedro Mart__nez St. Louis Cardinals Baseball statistics Volleyball 1957 World Series Major League Baseball Detroit Tigers 2004 World Series Gary Sheffield Strike zone Home run Satchel Paige History of baseball in the United States Softball Mark McGwire 2005 World Series Joe Morgan Jason Giambi Ty Cobb Professional wrestling attacks Stolen base Major League Baseball television contracts Mixed martial arts Rickey Henderson Fast bowling Pitcher Andr__s Galarraga Manny Ram__rez San Francisco Giants Mo Vaughn October 5 in baseball Greg Maddux Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics Professional wrestling aerial techniques Strikeout Sammy Sosa ESPN25 Rafael Palmeiro Miguel Tejada 2004 American League Championship Series Baseball scorekeeping 2003 World Series Baseball Stars Wrigley Field Adam Dunn Ted Williams Cricket Jos__ Canseco Eddie Guerrero Dave Kingman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Double bass Ice hockey Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth's Called Shot Kirk Gibson Theory of conduct Intentional base on balls October 19 in baseball Roger Clemens New York Yankees Treehouse of Horror V Punch (strike) Fenway Park Professional wrestling holds Tina Turner Ken Griffey, Jr. Carl Yastrzemski Alex Rodriguez David Ortiz October 4 in baseball Equine conformation Terminal ballistics 2001 World Series Swingout Ted Kluszewski Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Pete Rose Troy Glaus Major League Baseball Players Association Baseball slang Homer Simpson Nolan Ryan Pinball SBC Park Aerial (dance move) Chicago Cubs October 15 in baseball Albert Pujols Bob Feller Grover Cleveland Alexander

anyone thought that a rod might not care about the record just thinking that maybe a rod has no interest in sticking around for another years just to try and become the home run king maybe in years he leaves to go enjoy his million dollars boy would the public be pi ed about that seems that people are nearly demanding that a rod right the ship by breaking bonds record what if a rod does not care to boy will you bond's haters be upset no i think he would love to break that record a rod has always been preoccupied with his image not unusual for an athlete of course this canseco book may change things since it supposedly implicates a rod  Jos__ Canseco Barry Bonds Home run Rod Stewart Avenue Q Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Scouting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rod McKuen 1988 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers One Tree Hill (TV series) Dowsing Miss Saigon Aes Sedai The Price Is Right The Isley Brothers The Invisibles Kansas City Chiefs Oakland Athletics Tooth enamel Rickey Henderson Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Kodocha Toronto Blue Jays November 3 in baseball Sports timeline Good Times Unreleased Madonna songs R-Type ROC presidential election, 2004 Grant Morrison Wayne Gretzky I Want to Hold Your Hand Babe Ruth Microeconomics Timpani Rod Laver Pete Sampras Ty Cobb Star Trek: Enterprise Thunderball Grandview, U.S.A.

have you ever wondered about this whenever barry bonds hits a home run the giants end up losing the game however when he doesn't hit a homer they win the game it's just something i noticed over the last few months most of the time it turns out like this though there are times it's the other way around i just wondered if anyone else noticed as well oh and i'm not asking about steroids so please keep it clean i don't follow baseball that much so this is just an on a whim type question same thing has happened recently with a rod when a rod was just hitting everything the yanks were losing then during his for or whatever number streak the yanks were winning there is a theory about this that teams do better without their star when the star is not producing or is not there it takes pressure off the team as a whole i know that does not make a lot of sense but it seems true sometimes the rest of the guys don't have to deal with everyone cheering for their star player and they know they can not depend on the star so they all step it up a bit barry has been the giants best hitter this year not just because of the home runs but i have no doubt the giants would probably be in contention if barry would not have come back how is a team suppose to relax and play with all that has been going on maybe they will now  World Series Barry Bonds Troy Glaus New York Yankees Hank Aaron St. Louis Cardinals Boston Red Sox October 4 in baseball San Francisco Giants Home run Willie Mays Oakland Athletics Babe Ruth Ty Cobb 1957 World Series Tris Speaker Cincinnati Reds New York Giants Satchel Paige Toronto Blue Jays Reggie Jackson Mois__s Alou Chicago White Sox October 16 in baseball Yankee Stadium Miguel Tejada Mark McGwire 2005 World Series Alex Rodriguez Pete Rose October 20 in baseball Batting average Pittsburgh Steelers Gary Sheffield October 5 in baseball Dave Kingman Ted Williams Robin Ventura October 19 in baseball October 3 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Baseball Major League Baseball Pittsburgh Pirates Seattle Mariners Sammy Sosa Atlanta Braves Volleyball Detroit Tigers October 17 in baseball Don Mattingly October 22 in baseball Polo Grounds Jos__ Canseco November 1 in baseball Chicago Cubs Interleague play 2004 World Series October 21 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Baseball statistics International League Avenue Q June 8 in baseball Negro league baseball Darryl Strawberry 2001 World Series Casey Stengel June 12 in baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Blackjack October 15 in baseball Jason Giambi October 13 in baseball October 27 in baseball Baseball scorekeeping Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry September 6 in baseball NBA Finals Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Top 500 home run hitters of all time 1981 World Series 1919 World Series October 7 in baseball Jeff Kent Curse of the Bambino Social rule November 3 in baseball Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)

protective arm gaurd i have heard that the arm gaurd barry wears is actualy a swing aid this does not suprise me i have always thought anyone wearing one would not be inhibited by it it is set up on hinges and helps him fromdropping the elbow and popping the ball up true or false false craig biggio wears the same type of armor but he doesnt even register on the all time hr list and he started just years after bonds did if you're getting this from the same article that i think you are then it also tried to say that the armor was an advantage because of it's weight and it somehow helped bonds spin into the ball the guy who wrote the article claims to be an engineer of some type but the whole thing seemed like slanted bias to me  Fast bowling 2005 World Series Equine conformation Swingout Types of bowlers in cricket Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Barry Bonds Craig Biggio Baseball Bullet Characters of Naruto Golf club (equipment) Softball Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Boxing Stryker Gulf War Darth Vader Professional wrestling holds Laws of cricket Bionicle Dragon Booster Fielding (cricket) M60 machine gun James Bond music Media bias in the United States Archery Glossary of climbing terms Anchor Radio controlled airplane Mary I of Scotland The Living Daylights Home run Professional wrestling attacks Team Fortress Classic Shotgun Football (soccer) Phonograph Tris Speaker The Covenant Ceramics Armored Core Powered armor Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 Armour Moonraker Items in the Metroid series Sesshomaru Tank classification Infantry Nunchaku Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Internal ballistics Starsiege: Tribes Tank Andre Agassi Glossary of partner dance terms Car handling PHP Polyamory Grant Morrison Suplex Cricket Lawn mower Side pass (dance move) Golf Cricket ball 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Cosmic Era list of characters Basketball Professional wrestling match types Australian rules football Babe Ruth Figure skating Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Robot Wars Thunderball Logic Quantum computer Caterpillar D9 Ontological argument Scottish clan Takeshi's Castle M16 (rifle) Dice Typewriter Tefillin Table saw Autism Brotherhood of Nod Other characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Truth Trademark Steering Python programming language Revolver Medieval warfare Vegeta Armoured personnel carrier

is danny haren the best pitcher in the al yahoo fantasy baseball ranks him the best in the american league based on his stats which are pretty darn good they rank him above johan who is probably the most dominant pitcher of the st century so far in terms of start to start baseball who is the more dominant pitcher who would win the cy young right now danny haren has many shaky starts thats the difference between him and johan everytime johan goes out to the mound he strikes out a bunch of players and usually does not give up too many earned runs ive seen haren pitch live and he can lose his concentration often and ive seen him collapse under pressure johan is just a beast on the mound and hes always a second half player if you had to give the cy young out right now i would say haren earned it over johan but it would have been very close by the end of the year johan will probably win the cy young cause thats what he does the second half of the season  Baseball Baseball statistics Nolan Ryan 2004 World Series Pitcher St. Louis Cardinals Roger Clemens 1919 World Series Sandy Koufax Johan Santana World Series International League Pedro Mart__nez Win (baseball) Pittsburgh Pirates Curt Schilling Mark Mulder Cincinnati Reds 2005 World Series Batting average Oakland Athletics Greg Maddux John Smoltz Detroit Tigers Randy Johnson Chicago Cubs 2004 American League Championship Series Satchel Paige Atlanta Braves 1981 baseball strike Major League Baseball Hank Aaron Baseball Stars Tris Speaker Carl Yastrzemski 1903 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Seattle Mariners Softball Fantasy baseball Whitey Ford Jamie Moyer Sabermetrics November 3 in baseball Houston Astros Kansas City Royals 1986 World Series San Francisco Giants 1981 World Series Major League Baseball All-Star Game Hideo Nomo Norway national football team Chicago White Sox Philadelphia Phillies Robin Ventura Playoff Bob Friend Grover Cleveland Alexander Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim October 19 in baseball Cy Young New York Mets Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Babe Ruth Cinergy Field Alex Rodriguez Reggie Jackson Bob Gibson Dennis Eckersley October 14 in baseball Fernando Valenzuela October 30 in baseball Pete Rose Ty Cobb October 16 in baseball June 2 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Negro league baseball Connie Mack (baseball) Don Newcombe November 2 in baseball Japanese baseball Montr__al Expos October 3 in baseball Florida Marlins No-hitter Tom Seaver Sammy Sosa Hal Newhouser September 28 in baseball

small market teams i answered a question about small market teams with a reference to the largest media markets in the country this challenges the notion that oakland part of the fifth biggest media market in the country and minnesota the th biggest are small market teams the smallest media markets with mlb teams are milwaukee cincinnati pittsburgh kansas city san diego baltimore and st louis thus i attempted to make the argument the cardinals are in fact a small market team that just happens to have tradition and a strong fan base going for them how exactly does mlb define a small market team and how should it and we as fans to me not having a strong regional television network does not by definition make you a small market team they are two different things i must be misinformed so can someone please rationally explain why the a's and twins should be considered small market teams in baseball thanks i don't think they look at the difference between a small market and a small fan base unfortunately and more so in hockey they look at the market to determine the feasibility of franchises and not the fan base if it was based on fan base no us city would get another nhl team same thing with baseball small fan base means a team really can't sell the property for much money which in turn doesn't give a lot of revenue for the team  World Series Major League Baseball television contracts American Football League Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers New York Yankees Major professional sports league Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals History of baseball in the United States AFL-NFL Merger Baltimore Orioles Atlanta Braves Milwaukee Brewers Pittsburgh Steelers Washington Nationals October 4 in baseball San Diego Padres Chicago Cubs Boston Red Sox Negro league baseball Minnesota Twins Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Minor league baseball Los Angeles Dodgers 2004-05 NHL lockout National Hockey League National Football League Salary cap Hubert H.

if bonds did not do steroids whouldn't he have sued for defimation becasue of the book game of shadows i mean if he did not do steroids he would obviously not want the information about him out there saying he did however if he did do steroids he would not sue becasue some investigation would be done if he did and he would be found out yes if you put it in print and it's false it's libel and bonds would be the type of person that would persue that the trouble is that it's on the part of the plantiff to prove it and bonds couldn't prove that he didn't use steroids because they used his own testimony as basis for the claim so if he attempted to sue for libel it would be equivilent to saying he lied to the grand jury about taking steroids the way to avoid all of this is for him not to have done that in the first place  Slander and libel 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ben Johnson (athlete) Barry Bonds Plame affair George Galloway First Amendment to the United States Constitution Freedom of the press Tour de France Hustler Magazine v.

so who is with me ok so barry bonds broke the record big deal how many of you are with me and by the way i am a red sox fan saying this in wishing alex rodriguez the best of luck for the next ten years i may be a bosox fan and on a personal level despise a rod but there is no denying his ability to hit the baseball and hit it hard how many hrs do you think he can finish with if he stays healthy god forbid actually may not be so far fetched he's got already in what years if he stays heatlhy he can play more either way join me in ignoring bonds' record i know i still consider hammerin' hank to be the king of kings cripes people do a little research here a rod was when he first played in a major league game he has hit all but of his home runs since the age of so essentially he has hit of his home runs over the last seasons not there are a lot of assumptions to be made for him to even make a serious run at home runs for one we have to assume that he maintains a pace of homers a season for the next years keeping in mind that he has only homers times over the last season we also have to assume that he misses little to no time due to injury he has been lucky in the sense he has only had one season where he has played in fewer than games since he established himself as an every day player most players tend to start slowing down once they reach their mid to late s he has a legit shot at catching bonds but homers seems a bit of a reach to me  Alex Rodriguez Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Seattle Mariners Chicago White Sox Ty Cobb New York Yankees Oakland Athletics Boston Red Sox San Francisco Giants Troy Glaus Andr__s Galarraga Baseball Ken Griffey, Jr. St. Louis Cardinals World Series Rickey Henderson Sammy Sosa 2004 World Series Reggie Jackson Top 500 home run hitters of all time Major League Baseball Gary Sheffield David Ortiz Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Toronto Blue Jays Willie Mays Pedro Mart__nez September 20 in baseball Robin Ventura Manny Ram__rez 1957 World Series Pete Rose Tris Speaker Hank Greenberg September 6 in baseball Cincinnati Reds Nomar Garciaparra International League October 4 in baseball 2005 World Series Pittsburgh Steelers 2004 American League Championship Series October 3 in baseball Minor league baseball Mark McGwire Baseball statistics Nolan Ryan History of baseball in the United States New York Mets Dave Kingman Stolen base October 7 in baseball October 22 in baseball Miguel Tejada Jimmie Foxx Hal Trosky October 5 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Interference (baseball) Jim Rice Chicago Cubs Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry October 20 in baseball Atlanta Braves New York Giants Detroit Red Wings Texas Rangers (baseball) Scott Podsednik Jeff Kent October 1 in baseball CPU cache Ted Radcliffe Cincinnati Bengals Cecil Fielder June 12 in baseball June 8 in baseball Mario Lemieux Ted Williams Dave Henderson September 28 in baseball Lou Gehrig Toronto Raptors Roger Maris 1994 baseball strike Carlton Fisk New York Knicks Philadelphia Phillies Ted Kluszewski Chicago Bulls Cleveland Indians Baseball Stars 1919 World Series

ruth aaron or bonds of these three who do you feel achieved the most in baseball and why i think ruth definitely had more of an impact on the game i always liked hank aaron and while i don't like him i can at least somewhat appreciate barry bonds however ruth has been retired from baseball for years and dead for will people still recall aaron and bonds as fondly as they do the babe when they have been gone for so long ruth's home runs probably saved baseball after the world series was thrown by the white sox if not for him baseball might not even exist today and if it did it most likely be a different game then we know today the livening up of the ball the abolishment of the spitball and other changes in the game were put into place simply to let people see more home runs without someone like ruth these changes very likely would have not taken place and baseball might now be a mere footnote in sports history as for his achievements he definitely ranks up there in the greatest of all time but i think what will really live on is that he was exactly the type of player baseball needed at that time while i can appreciate a lot of the later players and probably would say that there are at least a handful of players that were probably better all around ballplayers then ruth his legend and his legacy will live forever bonds and aaron will certainly be remembered but probably not with the same fondness that ruth continues to enjoy today  Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Home run Barry Bonds Baseball World Series Ty Cobb New York Yankees Boston Red Sox Reggie Jackson Major League Baseball Ted Williams Tris Speaker Lou Gehrig Atlanta Braves September 20 in baseball History of baseball in the United States Nolan Ryan October 16 in baseball Chicago White Sox Curse of the Bambino October 22 in baseball No-hitter Shoeless Joe Jackson St. Louis Cardinals Rickey Henderson September 6 in baseball Ted Radcliffe San Francisco Giants Alex Rodriguez June 12 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Red Sox Nation 2005 World Series Baseball Stars Sports timeline Negro league baseball October 4 in baseball October 7 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Cincinnati Reds David Ortiz Bowie Kuhn October 20 in baseball Chicago Cubs San Diego Padres Old Time Baseball Albert Pujols Mark McGwire Top 500 home run hitters of all time Dead-ball era October 15 in baseball 1957 World Series Jimmie Foxx October 27 in baseball Joe DiMaggio Philadelphia Phillies Johnny Bench Minor league baseball Polo Grounds Gary Sheffield New York Mets October 8 in baseball October 5 in baseball ESPN25 October 21 in baseball Roger Clemens Baseball statistics Hal Trosky Detroit Tigers Roger Maris Eddie Mathews Baltimore Orioles Yankee Stadium Sammy Sosa Los Angeles Dodgers Stolen base Jim Rice Sandy Koufax Satchel Paige Milwaukee Brewers Mickey Mantle Toronto Blue Jays Carlton Fisk Baseball Hall of Fame 2004 American League Championship Series 1986 World Series Troy Glaus

the bonds hatefest is really really tired now all i've seen is hate being spewed about the man and not one lick of congratulations people does it really burn you up that bad that barry has the hr record do you folks not have anything or anyone better to hate besides a pro athlete you don't even know would you even know or care who barry bonds was if not for the steroid scandal all you heard was 'steroids' and suddenly bonds is the anti christ if you are to villify baseball legends then do it all the way talk about how babe ruth was an alchoholic wife beater talk about how ty cobb was a proud racist you can go up and down the line and find dirt on a number of baseball heroes but all you hear is 'bonds cheated' and 'the record shouldn't count' blah blah blah people come on you make some valid points i do have a couple questions the first one would obviously be 'do you think bonds used steroids and why the second would be how do you know for sure do you know him i would also ask you the same questions about ruth and cobb i have read enough about them both to realize that you are probably right about both of them but if we take the 'innocent unless proven guilty argument that so many people have should we not say that ruth was never once convicted of battery and that cobb was never once found guilty of a hate crime while i certainly am not defending either one of them or their personalities having your integrity is part of being in the public eye would anyone have written about babe ruth being an alcoholic wife beater if he were a carpenter would anyone have cared that ty cobb was a racist if he had been a farmer would anyone care if bonds used steroids or hgh if he was a ups driver the answer would be no to all of these questions the only reason it eeven gets discussed is because they are or were very public figures i do agree with you however that it is time for people to move on whether or not they like bonds or not whether they think he juiced or not he now has hit more home runs then anyone in the history of the major leagues true hatred should be saved for things that really matter and not for something as insignificant and note i do love baseball as a game  Babe Ruth Barry Bonds Ty Cobb Lou Gehrig Hank Aaron Home run History of baseball in the United States Mark McGwire World Series Tris Speaker Ted Williams St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Sports timeline Babe Ruth's Called Shot Theory of conduct Major League Baseball Plame affair Shoeless Joe Jackson 2005 trial of Michael Jackson San Francisco Giants All-Star Baseball Rogers Hornsby Ben Johnson (athlete) October 4 in baseball EastEnders Wrigley Field Rickey Henderson September 20 in baseball Knots Landing Major League Baseball titles streaks Polygamy Reggie Jackson Rafael Palmeiro Batting average October 5 in baseball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) O.

how many baseball fans think that barry bonds homerun record is tainted i am torn both ways i think part of his homeruns is tainted due to the recent allegations made against him with the regards to the steriods use let's hear what you think what real baseball people need to understand is the mental part of the game clubs that face bonds study his every swing to see how to face him they use certain stats for certain days and even certain times if youre a real baseball person you know that stats are recorded for just about everything the point i'm getting to is it still takes a good player and even a better hitter to do what he does on top of that it takes an even stronger person to do all that with all the steroid stuff in the news did he take steroids it's a possibility i'm not saying he did or didn't what i enjoyed was watching the reaction of the fans when he broke the record that's what sports are about the excitement you feel that can't be felt any other way i find it amusing that everyone had a blind fold over their eyes when the whole mcguire sosa thing was going on if anybody knew mcguire when he started in oakland you would see how small he was then all the sudden he got big started hitting homers like crazy but not once did anyone think it's because of steroid use no one wanted to think about it because it was exciting to watch then comes jose canseco's book and the blind fold is taken off now everyone is judging the big man in the spotlight all in all i don't care if it's tainted or not i got that excitement watching it and looked past all the nonsense that surrounds it i feel for the people that let the nonsense get in the way of the moment  Jos__ Canseco Barry Bonds History of baseball in the United States St. Louis Cardinals Babe Ruth Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Sammy Sosa Major League Baseball Ty Cobb Andr__s Galarraga Shaggy dog story San Francisco Giants Troy Glaus Mark McGwire Jon Secada Hal Trosky World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Baseball Stars Gary Sheffield Volleyball Tris Speaker Ben Johnson (athlete) Los Angeles Dodgers New York Yankees Miguel Tejada Reggie Jackson Alex Rodriguez Baltimore Orioles Seattle Mariners Rafael Palmeiro Chicago Cubs Vin Scully Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Professional wrestling slang Texas hold 'em 1957 World Series Rickey Henderson Poker jargon Detroit Tigers Batting average New York Mets International League Willie Mays Pete Rose Torii Hunter I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Dave Kingman Major League Baseball television contracts Nolan Ryan Humphrey Bogart October 4 in baseball One Tree Hill (TV series) Sandy Koufax EastEnders Ron Gant ESPN25 Negro league baseball The McGuire Sisters Hulk Hogan Sydney Riot of 1879 1919 World Series Stolen base The Ashlee Simpson Show Slow Train Coming Major League Baseball All-Star Game Top 500 home run hitters of all time The Shining (film) Mois__s Alou 1988 World Series The Death Gate Cycle Homer Simpson Social rule Alex Ferguson Daredevil The Contender (television series) Knots Landing Babe Ruth's Called Shot Vince McMahon Milton H.

why do people answer questions when they have no idea what the answer is it seems like people always answer questions when they have no idea what the answer is just to get points i just saw a legitimate question where someone was asking how many steroid tests barry bonds failed anyone who follows baseball knows the answer is but people were responding with all sorts of answers they clearly didn't know but wanted the points it seems like it happens all the time there should be some sort of system in place where if enough people give a thumbs down they lose points i just wanted to vent my frustration and see how everybody else feels i agree but there are always times when people unfairly give you a thumbs down or two when you dont deserve it maybe thubms down give you points just like you get points for answering a question it is so annoying when people answer your question in an answer that is either obvious and not what you were looking for or is so wrong that any sane person would know that it is wrong it is so frustrating im with ya man  Theory of conduct Internet troll Expert system Barry Bonds Abortion debate Socrates God Emperor of Dune Meaning of life Breaker Morant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goodness and value theory The Joker's Wild The Newlywed Game Quizbowl Family Feud The Apprentice 2 Calvin and Hobbes The nature of God in Western theology Ethics Jeopardy!

should an asterisk be placed on any records made while baseball was segregated something like segregated stat whites only league induced record not officially made under full rules of fair competition and remove the asterisk for post stats when the league was integrated with the truly best players regardless of race i can just imagine what the record books would look like if blacks and latinos had been allowed to play back then i only ask this because everybody is saying bonds should have one for using steroids when he's never failed a drug test never yes it should actually have an asterisk and then also put the negro league record beside it  Major League Baseball Baseball Racial segregation Negro league baseball Barry Bonds National Football League Ted Radcliffe Home run Satchel Paige Softball Hank Aaron History of baseball in the United States Baseball color line American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Rugby league Rugby union Miguel Tejada Brown v.

why do some still deny bonds was a heavy steroid user this is the part of the debate that i don't get there are still some who believe bonds is totally innocent lets look at he facts federal prosecutors finding doping calendars at balco with bond's name on it balco's chemist stating that bond's used steroids the leaked testimony of several federal prosecutors bond's hat size growing sizes in his late s the san fransisco chronicle reporters book canseco's book what your eyes tell you wow he never failed a drug test so he is innocent i did a whole bunch of bad stuff as a kid just because i didnt get caught does not mean i didnt do anything wrong i do not think it is a coincidence that in the late 's when all this was going on that his physical appearance changed his home runs syrocketed and since the steroid issue broke they have gone down towards his normal numbers his personal trainer is in jail for refusal to hand over evidence against him everything with balco to say there is no hard evidence is technically true but to say that there is not overwhelming circumstantial evidence is crazy  Barry Bonds Jos__ Canseco Ben Johnson (athlete) Plame affair Doping (sport) Jason Giambi Major League Baseball Rafael Palmeiro Capital punishment Henry Lee Lucas Watergate scandal O.

what do you think about the new controversy of baseball umpires getting background checks i think they ought to have a check this big stink they are causing do they have something to hide when i got my job where i'm working now i had to have one done and so does just about everyone else i don't understand why umpires think they are exempt from everything especially after the recent ordeal with the basketball referee which by the way i think is disgusting i couldn't agree with you more like you i've been through background checks for jobs and i don't understand why it's perceived as a big deal that's especially true given the relative importance of their positions compared to many of us and the serious influence they can have on the outcome of a game  Baseball Umpire (cricket) Satchel Paige Umpire (baseball) Poker jargon Referee Sydney Riot of 1879 Babe Ruth Epistemology Intelligence quotient Major League Baseball Randomness Softball St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball television contracts One Tree Hill (TV series) Determinism Microeconomics The Catcher in the Rye Australian rules football Censorship in Australia Baseball Hall of Fame Bill Klem Chicago White Sox Milton H.

barry bonds in pete rose not now that barry bonds has broken the home run record it is being said that this solidifies his trip to cooperstown given that this record will always be overshadowed by the possibility of steroid use is it still fair for pete rose to not receive the invitation to cooperstown based on betting i say you either let them both in or keep them both out to allow bonds in based on hrs and not rose is a travesty separating professional from personal is the key for example dennis rodman was a helluva rebounder and his off the court antics shouldn't take away from his professional accomplishments after reading some of these wonderfully insightful comments i have to insert my opinion betting drug enhancement are both cheating it doesn't matter if you bet on baseball or you cheated on the field with body boosters while i see the difference in what rose did to what bonds has done cheating is cheating if dimaggio mantle nolan ryan or craig biggio cheated in any way betting drugs they should be noted as such we all know bonds took steroids how else can you double in size within years he sure didn't eat big macs everyday you can't hit like that without enhancements mcgwire couldn't do it sosa couldn't do it they cheated and now are ridiculed bonds has stayed silent and that silence to me doesn't excuse him from the obvious overwhelming guilt when he personally testifies i'll perhaps change my mind cheating on the field to me is more damaging than betting rose's ability was astonishing as bonds to exclude rose and include bonds is awful i agree somebody got those hits and that somebody was pete rose it's the hall of fame not the hall of morals  Home run Barry Bonds History of baseball in the United States Pete Rose Babe Ruth Sammy Sosa Ty Cobb Mark McGwire ESPN25 St. Louis Cardinals Craig Biggio Lou Gehrig Hank Aaron World Series Baseball Baseball Hall of Fame EastEnders Nolan Ryan New York Yankees Cincinnati Reds Mickey Mantle Jim Rice Houston Astros October 4 in baseball San Francisco Giants Ben Johnson (athlete) Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Willie Mays Whose Line Is It Anyway?

good or bad to be a baseball fan for the past days bonds breaks the home run record with the steroid allegations over him including the possiblity of being indicted glavine and his wins could be a loooooooooooooooooong time before someone joins the win clube a rod being the youngest to get to home runs and gettin plunked in toronto lol poor guy i have mixed feelings about these issues very hard to believe any of them dunno whats the truth dunno what the story behind the off field issues etc etc thoughts comments how do you think baseball is going along in general this year especially the past days lol iak ny i don't hate the yankees i just don't think they play team ball thats all i've been hard on them only on that part of the game i mean i don't like a rod but i don't hate him i think he's top players in the game right now im not a bandwagon fan in either sport but i do acknowledge talent when i see them i just don't know what stand to take on baseball for bonds dude took steroids but he wasn't the only one cheating is cheating no matter what the cirumstance is but i think its kinda unfair that he's been the poster child for all this crap but then again he should've been careful lol this thing goes round and round its much more complicated than basketball to be quite honest it's been a bad time to be a baseball fan i'll admit that the records are interesting to see however all of this has taken attention away from the team sport we've seen several individuals recognized but in the end their accomplishments don't mean a lot we watch baseball every year to see which team is the best not which player is the best if you want to watch an individual competition the best place to watch would probably be the olympics where plenty of individuals perform however baseball is a team sport i'm glad that these record chases are over now bonds and the giants can slip back into obscurity where they belong this season and the real sports can continue right now i'm watching the playoff race not a bunch of individuals earning records or milestones  Barry Bonds Major League Baseball Hank Aaron World Series San Francisco Giants Playoff New York Yankees Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States Satchel Paige Atlanta Braves Babe Ruth Home run Major League Baseball television contracts Pete Rose International League New York Mets New York Giants Sports timeline Playoff format Toronto Blue Jays Oakland Athletics Reggie Jackson Chicago Cubs Seattle Mariners Troy Glaus National Football League Boston Red Sox National Basketball Association Toronto Maple Leafs John Smoltz Rickey Henderson Carolina Panthers New York Knicks Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Norway national football team Mois__s Alou Pittsburgh Pirates Texas Rangers (baseball) Baseball Stars Ben Johnson (athlete) Baltimore Orioles Cincinnati Reds Sandy Koufax Detroit Tigers Minor league baseball Cleveland Indians Chicago White Sox 1957 World Series Alex Rodriguez San Diego Padres Yankee Stadium Pittsburgh Steelers Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Cincinnati Bengals Negro league baseball Philadelphia Phillies Darryl Strawberry New York Jets Tris Speaker Topps Willie Mays Wayne Gretzky Miami Dolphins Jim Thorpe Nolan Ryan October 27 in baseball Toronto Raptors Miguel Tejada Cleveland Browns Andre Agassi Gary Sheffield 1981 baseball strike Baseball statistics Al Michaels Olympic Games Derek Jeter Volleyball Boston Bruins Robin Ventura September 2005 in sports Hal Trosky Professional wrestling slang Mike Schmidt 2005 World Series

barry bonds fiasco i really don't get the whole outrage with barry bonds is people say that he cheated because of steroids there is no proof that he even was on steroids also what about all the other players out there that took steroids as well i don't see the outrage with there stats you can't have it one way and not the other if one wants to take away from barry's accomplishments than all of baseball is tainted because if he did take steroids he wasn't the only one there were pitchers and catchers and batters as well so baseball would be tainted not by barry alone also i think everyone would agree that there is no question that he is still using steroids with all this controversy and he is still hitting hr so whats with all the fuss with barry bonds i just don't get it be mad a mlb for allowing their players to use steroids cuz if barry used them he wasn't the only one also why aren't people mad about wrestling almost all of the wrestlers use steroids just look at that guy who killed his family and then himself bc of steroids and there are like other wrestlers who have died because of steroids if you are looking to place blame on steroid use its in the wwe people are singling out barry bonds for one reason and one reason only because he set the single season home run record if barry had never broken that record no one would care whether or not he took steroids or not and the resentment for him kept growing as he climbed up the ladder towards home runs i've heard that fans want barry's home runs taken away but what about all of the pitchers who have actually tested positive do we take their wins away and what about bonds's walk record he got that record during the time that he was on steroids do we take those away too does taking steroids also help you get walks where do you draw the line it's getting ridiculous who cares if barry took steroids what do steroids even do for you anyway they help you build muscle mass what does muscle mass have to do with hitting home runs you still have to have great eyesight to determine whether the pitch is a ball or strike then you have to have a perfect swing to connect the right part of the bat with the right part of the ball in order for it to go over the fence how does steroids help with any of that maybe it helps you hit the ball a few feet further but when most ballparks are feet shorter than they were years ago it wouldn't matter anyway people just need to get over it already and move on with their lives who cares if barry took steroids what people need to worry about is who is cheating now this season not years ago who the hell cares  Baseball statistics Major League Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Softball Ty Cobb Baseball Stars Pitcher Pete Rose World Series Chicago White Sox New York Yankees 2004 World Series Nolan Ryan New York Mets Baseball scorekeeping Mark McGwire International League Tris Speaker Los Angeles Dodgers Satchel Paige San Francisco Giants History of baseball in the United States Boston Red Sox Batting average Oakland Athletics Jos__ Canseco Gary Sheffield Rafael Palmeiro Professional wrestling slang Sandy Koufax 1957 World Series Ted Williams Sammy Sosa Stolen base 2004 American League Championship Series October 4 in baseball Cricket Mike Schmidt Andr__s Galarraga Houston Astros October 19 in baseball Fenway Park Strike zone Reggie Jackson Baltimore Orioles Ichiro Suzuki Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball television contracts Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cincinnati Reds Earned run average Professional wrestling match types 2005 World Series Wrigley Field Randy Johnson Washington Nationals Wes Ferrell Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim No-hitter 1981 World Series Vin Scully November 4 in baseball Seattle Mariners Alex Rodriguez Box score (baseball) Texas Rangers (baseball) 1919 World Series 1981 baseball strike Montr__al Expos SBC Park Troy Glaus Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) November 3 in baseball Japanese baseball Ben Johnson (athlete) Roger Clemens Professional wrestling aerial techniques October 27 in baseball June 8 in baseball October 22 in baseball Baseball bat Professional wrestling Catcher Greg Maddux

what is level difference from mlb baseball to cube domestic baseball sorry cuba in watching the world baseball classic i guess you could say that if japanese players could compete in mlb than the cubans can also i think that mlb probably has a more sophisticated system and more resources than cuba does however cuba has proven to have great talent also look at some of their national players pedro luis lazo resembles lee smith and pitches like him also many scouts say he could be a top knotch set up guy in mlb yadel marti he shut down a star studded domincan republic team albert pujols david ortiz alfonso soriano has really nast curve balls and breaking balls that other teams could not hit yulieski gourriel probably their best player and is regarded as one of the top prospects in the world he showed glimpses of brilliance if he were here in the us he would have been a first round pick overall according to most scouts so yes cuba has talent but thier league is slightly a knotch lower than mlb  Major League Baseball Baseball Albert Pujols World Series Boston Red Sox 2004 World Series Sammy Sosa Major League Baseball All-Star Game Minor league baseball Luis Tiant Baseball statistics Negro league baseball St. Louis Cardinals Pittsburgh Pirates Toronto Blue Jays International League Montr__al Expos New York Yankees Pedro Mart__nez Jos__ Canseco David Ortiz Houston Astros Baltimore Orioles 2004 American League Championship Series 2003 World Series San Francisco Giants Japanese baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Satchel Paige New York Mets Cuba at the 2004 Summer Olympics Washington Nationals World Baseball Classic Sports in Puerto Rico Barry Bonds Ichiro Suzuki Playoff Red Sox Nation Mois__s Alou History of baseball in the United States October 2004 in sports Ted Radcliffe Chicago Cubs 2005 World Series October 31 in baseball November 1 in baseball Dominican Republic Ben Sheets Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Major League Baseball television contracts Minnie Mi__oso Rugby union Felipe Alou Manny Ram__rez MLB Most Valuable Player Award July 2004 in sports Babe Ruth Chicago White Sox Cleveland Indians Baseball Stars Tampa Bay Devil Rays Designated hitter Luis Aparicio Diego Maradona Cincinnati Reds Julio Franco Home run Stolen base Andr__s Galarraga Troy Glaus MLB on FOX Golf November 3 in baseball Strike zone Derek Jeter Hank Aaron Sandy Koufax Salary cap Florida Marlins Pete Rose Rudy York Judo at the 2004 Summer Olympics Cuba at the 2000 Summer Olympics Draft (sports) Football (soccer) Tris Speaker October 22 in baseball Seattle Mariners October 21 in baseball Team Fortress Classic 2004-05 NHL lockout

who was the all time home run leader before babe ruth i was 'basking' in the 'glory' that is barry bonds and thought to myself we all know hank aaron owned this record before barry and alex rodriguez will probably own it soon after barry's reign is done and everyone especially including the racist whites in the s who threatened aaron's life over his record chase knows that george herman 'babe' ruth owned the record before hammerin' hank but whose record did the babe break surely this total couldn't have been more than a couple hundred or so putting whoever it was in the company of matt stairs and cliff floyd but i cannot stop thinking about this now who was the king of homeruns before babe ruth broke the record roger connor just like it was the other times this question has been asked since the all star break connor had home runs he played in the th century ce and you never heard of him before connor it was harry stovey with dan brouthers surpassed stovey for a couple of seasons but then stovey took it back before brouthers a fellow named charley jones jim o'rourke overtook jones for one season and before jones first held the crown it was a guy named lip pike with the massive total of he shared the record then at all of with two other guys levi meyerle and fred treacey that first season way back in pike was with the troy haymakers of the national association and played of the team's games which included a loss to the philadelphia athletics by a final of now that would have been some serious ballplaying entertainment for your nickel  Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Barry Bonds September 20 in baseball Major League Baseball titles streaks World Series San Francisco Giants Ty Cobb Alex Rodriguez Major League Baseball titles leaders Tris Speaker Lou Gehrig History of baseball in the United States Reggie Jackson Boston Red Sox Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936 Lip Pike Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 1957 World Series New York Giants Dallas Cowboys Indianapolis 500 Hank Greenberg Toronto Blue Jays Jimmie Foxx September 6 in baseball Atlanta Braves Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 St. Louis Cardinals Roger Maris Pro Football Hall of Fame October 4 in baseball Wrigley Field Cincinnati Reds Troy Glaus October 22 in baseball Top 500 home run hitters of all time Ontario general election, 1990 Mark McGwire Wayne Gretzky Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Sports timeline Los Angeles Kings November 2 in baseball October 5 in baseball Green Bay Packers October 16 in baseball Baseball June 2 in baseball Philadelphia 76ers October 7 in baseball Little Britain November 1 in baseball Yankee Stadium San Diego Padres 2004 World Series San Francisco 49ers 1981 baseball strike Buffalo Bills Babe Ruth's Called Shot Bj__rn Borg Los Angeles Dodgers Stage name Super Bowl XXVII United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim June 12 in baseball Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Chuck Cunningham syndrome Toronto Maple Leafs Red Sox Nation Kansas City Chiefs Detroit Tigers Knots Landing Super Bowl XIII Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay 61* Ted Williams Saturday Night Live Ken Griffey, Jr. October 10 in baseball Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns 1984 NBA Draft Manny Ram__rez Moe Berg Boston Bruins Baltimore Orioles

if frank thomas is the big hurt is bonds the big asterisk koala enable your e mail so we can discuss this issue if not for now i will say that the bonds haters wouldn't be so obnoxious if the bonds lovers would just acknowledge the fact that this record isn't that big of deal you have middle infeilders smacking homers now baseball was fading a decade ago so baseball compromised itself to bring much more offense into the game the nba and nfl have done the same thing idiots think that is because the players are so much better but the fact is that marketing runs professional sports and the fans are much stupider than they used to be they would rather see something fancy than see something fundamentally great old fans would be argueing about putting on the hit run or squeezing etc every fan was a manager on every pitch modern fans don't even know what that is they just sit back drooling for a home run the big syringe  Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants Ty Cobb Baseball Barry Bonds Chicago Cubs Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball television contracts Hank Aaron National Football League St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball Home run World Series 1957 World Series Cincinnati Bengals Baltimore Orioles Philadelphia Phillies New York Yankees History of baseball in the United States Detroit Tigers 1994 baseball strike Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Rams New York Giants Salary cap Wrigley Field Oakland Athletics EA Sports Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim International League Negro league baseball Kansas City Chiefs Toronto Blue Jays Tris Speaker Jeff Kent Pittsburgh Steelers Indiana Pacers Andr__s Galarraga Willie Mays Robin Ventura Alex Rodriguez Atlanta Braves Super Bowl I Hubert H.

barry bonds hit number your thoughts on this and who do you think will beat bonds' record my guess is alex rodriguez listen bonds has broken an amazing record it's amazing how the nay sayers crush bonds' record because the allegations of steroids people don't be ignorant the majority of mlb players as well as minor league baseball players used steroids for a long while and are still using look at the players today compared to players of the past they are all bigger and it's not the water that they drink get a clue bonds is and will be one of the greatest hitters in the history of the game it takes a lot more than muscle to hit a mph baseball take this into perspective should hammerin' hanks record be tainted because in his days they used harder balls than that of what babe ruth hit quit being ridiculous and celebrate the most celebrated record in baseball a rod will break the record in the next years at the most at his nd birthday he had or so more homeruns than that of barry at his nd barring a disaster the record is his and will probably stand for years as he could potentially hit homeruns also i highly doubt a rod is playing for the money if that was the case he would have retired the year after he made million dollars it's not about the money for these guys as they already have enough to live off of twice tt's about pride and glory  Barry Bonds Home run Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Baseball Major League Baseball New York Yankees World Series Ty Cobb St. Louis Cardinals Alex Rodriguez History of baseball in the United States Mark McGwire Lou Gehrig Boston Red Sox Reggie Jackson Troy Glaus Jos__ Canseco September 20 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays Pete Rose Andr__s Galarraga Baseball Stars Rickey Henderson Hank Greenberg Satchel Paige Sports timeline Seattle Mariners Yankee Stadium Baltimore Orioles Jimmie Foxx David Ortiz Nolan Ryan Minor league baseball Mois__s Alou Negro league baseball Ted Radcliffe Cincinnati Reds October 20 in baseball Hal Trosky Rafael Palmeiro Willie Mays November 1 in baseball Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball All-Star Game Wayne Gretzky Major League Baseball television contracts New York Mets Gary Sheffield Miguel Tejada June 12 in baseball Roger Maris George Sisler No-hitter Major League Baseball titles streaks Los Angeles Dodgers Houston Astros Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Hall of Fame Baseball statistics Atlanta Braves October 22 in baseball Pete Sampras September 6 in baseball Manny Ram__rez Texas Rangers (baseball) Jason Giambi Red Sox Nation Ted Williams June 8 in baseball Ernie Banks Detroit Tigers 2004 American League Championship Series Florida Marlins Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Joe DiMaggio Oakland Athletics October 4 in baseball San Diego Padres Randy Johnson Baseball bat Ichiro Suzuki Washington Nationals Derek Jeter Ken Griffey, Jr. Curse of the Bambino Shoeless Joe Jackson 2004 World Series Japanese baseball Designated hitter

in mlb what does a pitcher's change up mean please define it with examples a change up is a type of pitch the changeup is thrown with the same arm action as a fastball but at a lower velocity due to the pitcher holding the ball in a special grip there are several types of changeup which are generated by using different grips on the ball during the pitch the most common type is the straight change the ball is held with three fingers instead of the usual two and closer to the palm to kill some of the speed generated by the wrist and fingers this pitch generally breaks downward slightly though its motion does not differ greatly from a two seam fastball another common grip is the circle changeup the pitcher forms a circle with his index finger and thumb using these two fingers to grip the seams of the baseball by pronating the wrist upon release this pitch tends to break slightly in the same direction as a screwball more or less break will come about from the pitcher's arm slot the more three quarters or side arm angle the more break generally pedro mart nez has used this pitch throughout his career to great effect and many consider it to be his best pitch citation needed before shoulder injuries made him lose velocity martinez countered his mile per hour fastball with this devastating mile per hour screwball like changeup tom glavine's changeup grip is a circle change grip but because he does not pronate his wrist he doesn't have the screwball movement but rather more sink on the pitch than the straight change citation needed time cy young award winner johan santana has arguably the best circle change in baseball and many cite it as his most effective pitch boston red sox set up man eric gagn also has a highly effective changeup pitch which he throws at around miles per hour however the effectiveness of gagn 's change was greater as a member of the los angeles dodgers because his fastball reached velocities approaching m p h and his change as low as m p h  Sandy Koufax Baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Softball Starting pitcher Boston Red Sox Curveball Randy Johnson World Series No-hitter Knuckleball Volleyball Professional wrestling holds New York Mets St. Louis Cardinals Aerial (dance move) 2004 World Series Greg Maddux October 10 in baseball Atlanta Braves October 22 in baseball October 16 in baseball Gary Sheffield Babe Ruth Tris Speaker John Smoltz Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) San Francisco Giants Anatomical terms of location Types of bowlers in cricket David Cone Professional wrestling throws Eric Gagne Mouse (computing) Perfect game Johan Santana Wes Ferrell Nolan Ryan Dennis Eckersley Beer Pong Diving Double bass Ben Sheets Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Baseball statistics Satchel Paige October 4 in baseball Luis Tiant Swingout Weight training Cincinnati Reds Stolen base Montr__al Expos November 4 in baseball November 3 in baseball Smokey Joe Wood Pete Rose Mariano Rivera San Diego Padres 1919 World Series Chicago White Sox 2005 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Curt Schilling October 15 in baseball Al Leiter Tim Wakefield 1957 World Series Humerus Billy Wagner Mike Cuellar Major League Baseball television contracts Gesture 1981 World Series Chicago Cubs Carpal tunnel syndrome Salute Casey Fossum Coriolis effect Equine conformation Byung-Hyun Kim Vin Scully Violin Sammy Sosa Ty Cobb Keith Foulke

should mlb open two foreign pro baseball teams japanese latin america to play in major league not yet certainly logistically japan would be extremely difficult for two reasons one it is really far away it's a hour flight from dallas to tokyo i've done it and most people need at least one day to reset their bioclock that's asking a lot to play a three or four game series two japan has plenty of professional baseball already what would a mlb team really add in parts south the biggest issue is having a large enough local population and a strong enough economy  Major League Baseball Japanese baseball Minor league baseball Baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Playoff International League October 20 in baseball Negro league baseball Ichiro Suzuki Pete Rose Deion Sanders Las Vegas metropolitan area World Series 2004-05 NHL lockout Derek Jeter Salary cap World Baseball Classic MLB on FOX Dave Kingman Playoff format San Francisco Giants Dave Concepci__n Boston Red Sox Major professional sports league Pittsburgh Pirates Baseball statistics Interleague play Exhibition game 2004 American League Championship Series Major League Soccer Washington Nationals Andr__s Galarraga Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball television contracts Wild card Bernie Williams Dolphins Stadium Atlanta Braves New York Yankees Professional baseball Lou Gehrig Jack Buck All-Star Baseball Chicago Cubs RBI Baseball Houston Astros 2005 World Series Batting average Montr__al Expos Southern United States Luis Aparicio 1994 baseball strike Milwaukee Brewers Moe Berg Dallas Cowboys Japan national rugby union team Orix Blue Wave Sendai, Miyagi Houlihan's Stadium Hideo Nomo Detroit Tigers Ernie Banks Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Hubert H.

what's your opinion about barry bonds is it his record regular or not barry bonds is the new home run king i think its just easy for people to write off someones accomplishments by focusing blame on performance enhancers or in barry's case steroids unfortunately we now live in an era where every accomplishment will be subject to such scrutiny pa brought up a good point in mentioning how players from the 's were given amphetamines which are now illegal hank aaron used amphetamines for a season to get out of a slump dock ellis threw a no hitter while on lsd if barry bonds and baseball for that matter was so into steroids then why are there only active players in the top for home runs the next active player on the list is almost home runs behind bonds rafael palmeiro a confirmed steroid user who started one year after bonds has less home runs most anti bonds fans point out that when his alleged steroid use was over in his stats all went down what most people dont point out is that he was sidelined for of the season due to knee surgery and would have retired in ' had he not been chasing the home run record unfortunately for barry when you do anything good or bad now days you become the center of attention for all of pop culture when you factor that in to how much negativity comes out of the media allegations somehow become truth in any case i think barry rightfully deserves the crown he is a very trained hitter with a very intimidating plate presence when a rod breaks the record hopefully as an sf giant years from now he will undergo the exact same ridicule that bonds did it'll just be a different catalyst anytime a major record gets broken there will be a period of hate that turns into love only to cycle back to hate when a new contender approaches the record  Major League Baseball Hank Aaron Rafael Palmeiro Home run Babe Ruth St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Baseball Jos__ Canseco Toronto Blue Jays Sammy Sosa Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Miguel Tejada Baltimore Orioles Reggie Jackson Chicago White Sox Ty Cobb Troy Glaus World Series Lou Gehrig Batting average San Francisco Giants Nolan Ryan Mark McGwire Top 500 home run hitters of all time Ted Williams June 12 in baseball Tris Speaker Atlanta Braves Baseball scorekeeping Major League Baseball All-Star Game Ellis Burks Oakland Athletics Los Angeles Kings San Diego Padres Robin Ventura Sandy Koufax Willie Mays Cincinnati Bengals Los Angeles Dodgers Rickey Henderson 2004 World Series Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Giants Baseball statistics Alex Rodriguez Manny Ram__rez Detroit Tigers Gary Sheffield Chicago Bulls David Ortiz Rugby union Pittsburgh Pirates Volleyball Boston Red Sox International League Hulk Hogan 1981 baseball strike New York Mets Pete Rose October 4 in baseball October 20 in baseball Torii Hunter Florida Marlins Baseball Stars St. Louis Rams 2005 World Series Brady Anderson Cleveland Indians Roger Clemens Yao Ming Intentional base on balls Designated hitter Mike Schmidt November 1 in baseball Jennifer Lopez Hal Trosky Frank Thomas (AL baseball player) Randy Johnson Albert Pujols The Jim Rome Show Grunge music Jason Giambi Houston Astros Jeff Kent August 2005 in sports Jackie Robinson

is barry bonds' record illegitimate i think it's legit however i do believe that bonds did use performance enhancing drugs particularly hgh his shoe size is up sizes from a few years ago and he does admit that he was given 'creams' and 'supplements' from his trainer in the past although he thought they were efa oil or something of the likes why is bonds' soon to be record legit because steroids do not hit homeruns plain and simple yes people know about bonds giambi sosa and mcgwire but how many remember manny alexander gabe kapler or marvin benard the later three won't threaten any hr records although they all tested positive for steroids why not the answer again is simple it takes more than strength to hit hrs hand eye coordination a consistent swing conducive to hitting fly balls an awareness of the strikezone and the ability to generate bat speed via fluid mechanics are all more important than poking yourself in the posterior with a syringe full of dianabol bonds has spent years developing his swing to be more fly ball friendly it takes years of commitment to achieve that type of consistent swing bonds has hit more hrs over the past few seasons that the said three players mentioned above why hasn't anyone of the 'lesser' players that tested positive for 'roids been able to put together any type of formidable power numbers over the past few seasons bigger muscles don't always bigger hr numbers  Home run Barry Bonds Jos__ Canseco Jason Giambi History of baseball in the United States Baseball Andr__s Galarraga Professional wrestling slang Baseball Stars Batting (cricket) Sammy Sosa 2004 World Series Batting average Softball Bodybuilding Weight training Volleyball Oakland Athletics Hank Aaron Anabolic steroid Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox Alex Rodriguez Babe Ruth Bernie Williams Troy Glaus Cricket New York Yankees Baltimore Orioles Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Ted Williams Hal Trosky ESPN25 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mois__s Alou Golf Detroit Tigers Gabe Kapler Glossary of partner dance terms Baseball statistics Ty Cobb Steroid Laws of cricket Professional wrestling throws Doom enemies Doping (sport) Rickey Henderson Ichiro Suzuki Top 500 home run hitters of all time Types of bowlers in cricket MC Hammer Puberty The Isley Brothers Vladimir Guerrero Brian Close Aerial (dance move) Ravi Shastri 1957 World Series Billboard Hot 100 Batting order (baseball) Reggie Jackson October 4 in baseball World Series Jim Rice Batsman Equine conformation Tris Speaker Shawn Green The Living Daylights Signal transduction Satchel Paige Wrigley Field ELO rating system Tenshinhan Armored Core Rugby union positions Extreme Programming Cincinnati Reds Human sexual behavior October 2005 in sports Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Badminton Diego Maradona Bodyline Toronto Blue Jays Sandy Koufax Pete Rose

in mlb in what order is it easier to steal bases nd third home how does a player successfully steal home please give one example nd base is the easiest base to steal because the catcher has the throw across the diamond which is farther than throwing to first base or third base third base is the second easiest base to steal its a bit more difficult than stealing second because the catcher has a shorter distance to throw but home plate is the hardest to steal one can steal home plate on a passed ball so lets say the pitcher throws a fast ball but the catcher fails to grab it so it goes all the way to the backstop if there is a runner on third and this happens the runner sprints home but is very difficult to be called safe because once the pitcher sees that the ball has been missed the catcher he also sprints toward home plate and if the cather gets the ball in time from the backstop he can throw it to the pitcher to tag the runner out and because the distance from the backstop to homeplate is about feet the catcher can easily gun in the throw to the pitcher but a passed ball rarely happens when a runner is on third thus making it rare when the runner steals home also the catcher if he relays the ball in time he can throw to the pitcher who moved from the mound to cover home plate to tag out the runner  Softball Stolen base Baseball statistics Pitcher Interference (baseball) Baserunning Tag Perfect game First baseman Tris Speaker 1957 World Series Baseball positions 2004 American League Championship Series Catcher Left fielder Kickball Balk 2004 World Series World Series Ty Cobb Squeeze play (baseball) Knuckleball Baseball scorekeeping Volleyball Appeal play Barry Bonds Strike zone Sandy Koufax American football Box score (baseball) Derek Jeter Home run Baseball slang Fenway Park 1919 World Series Boston Red Sox Out (baseball) Origins of baseball Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Dodgers Knickerbocker Rules History of baseball in the United States Bunt 2003 World Series No-hitter Babe Ruth Equine conformation Satchel Paige Sprint (race) Intentional base on balls Dodgeball Roger Clemens Fast bowling Baseball Stars Doug Eddings Chicago White Sox Reggie Jackson Babe Ruth's Called Shot BASEketball Don Denkinger Pedro Mart__nez October 14 in baseball Second baseman Florida Marlins Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Four square October 16 in baseball 2005 World Series New York Yankees Aerial (dance move) I-70 Series Detroit Tigers Houston Astros Pete Rose Bo Diaz San Diego Padres Snooker October 10 in baseball Nolan Ryan Rounders Poker jargon October 19 in baseball Polo Grounds September 22 in baseball Athletics Middle distance track event October 8 in baseball Craig Biggio Cinergy Field 1981 World Series Unassisted triple play Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Major League Baseball television contracts October 20 in baseball Billiards Comparison of Canadian and American football

what is known about a rod and steroids i've been listening with disgust about barry bonds breaking the very hard earned record of henry aaron while cheating on steroids yes i understand that bonds has had clean tests for steroids but his back against the wall with a possible indictment for the use of them i have mentioned before that when someone is facing an indictment in the us distict court they are in big trouble yes we are all innocent until proven guilty but verdicts and pleas are extremely high when issued by the us courts here's my dilemma i want bonds to get the record and go away not only does he have the indictment problem he is also obnoxious to other players including his own team mates and has a hatred of the media and cares little for the fans i want to turn toward alex rodriguez and hope he can break bonds record so we can put bonds to bed i don't want to root for a cheater though what do you all know about a rod than being an extremely high paid baseball player well that i know of he has not taken steroids which is why im rooting for him as well its funny cuz i asked the same exact question and i stated almost the same thing as you i agree that hank fought through sweat and tears for those hr and i think its unfair for someone to cheat their way through the record when you play a certain game with someone are you happy when they cheat to win no imagine how hank aaron feels knowing the classy hank aaron i doubt hes mad hes waiting for another clean player to break the record again that being a rod youngest ever to hr we need you a rod left to go  Barry Bonds Hank Aaron 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Major League Baseball Alex Rodriguez EastEnders 1957 World Series Babe Ruth History of baseball in the United States Home run Prisoner's dilemma Social rule St. Louis Cardinals Lou Gehrig Cheating in poker Reggie Jackson Rafael Palmeiro 1919 World Series Ben Johnson (athlete) Jon Secada RuneScape cheats Nolan Ryan Plame affair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ty Cobb Pittsburgh Steelers Gary Sheffield Schapelle Corby Topps Cliff Richard Atlanta Braves Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Katelyn Faber 2004 World Series Cheating in Counter-Strike Knots Landing Professional wrestling slang Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Satchel Paige Vernon Schillinger Seattle Mariners Alex Ferguson Ken Griffey, Jr. Poker jargon Bj__rn Borg Humphrey Bogart Toronto Blue Jays Fathers' rights Karl Rove Oakland Athletics Miguel Tejada American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Mark McGwire History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction New York Giants October 22 in baseball W.I.T.C.H.

steve garvey and the hall of fame i know this has been asked before but do you think steve garvey is not in the hall of fame primarily because of his off the field exploits or because his career ended rather sudden in and he didn't hang on for stats first i am not a garvey fan but from to he was the best first baseman in the game the dominant player of his era six out of seasons with hits one mvp and four other top ten finishes all star games including a write in selection player on good teams four gold gloves the national league all time consecutive games played streak nlcs mvp etc to me garvey is a perfect example of my opinion that being dominant in an era should trump guys as opposed to good players who simply hang on with mediocre seasons to build career numbers obviously enough hof voters disagree on some level or they disagree that garvey was dominant what do you think about garvey and what do you think about dominance in an era vs career longevity garvey is one of those guys on the borderline his overall numbers are quite good but there's no single thing about him that really stands out he had his mvp year but he was never one of those guys who led the league in a major category he led in total hits twice and that's about it if he had maintained his nice guy image after retirement i think he would have gotten more votes but still have fallen short i think he falls into the same area as al oliver dave parker and a few other players from that era they were excellent players but fell short of being the legendary sorts the hall of fame should demand  Atlanta Braves Pete Rose Robin Ventura San Diego Padres Toronto Blue Jays Hank Aaron Steve Garvey St. Louis Cardinals Houston Astros Lou Gehrig Rickey Henderson Chicago White Sox New York Mets Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs International League Detroit Tigers Reggie Jackson World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Boston Red Sox Andr__s Galarraga 1981 World Series October 4 in baseball Ty Cobb Pittsburgh Pirates Seattle Mariners Nolan Ryan Cincinnati Bengals Babe Ruth Troy Glaus Oakland Athletics Tris Speaker Alex Rodriguez Sandy Koufax Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 NBA Finals Don Mattingly Kansas City Chiefs Willie Mays Barry Bonds Steve Nash New York Yankees Milwaukee Brewers National Football League Cleveland Indians Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Texas Rangers (baseball) Montr__al Expos Baseball Hall of Fame Vin Scully Florida Marlins New York Giants Hal Newhouser Michael Jordan 1981 baseball strike 2005 World Series Davey Lopes 2004 World Series Carolina Panthers Boston Bruins 2003 World Series Albert Pujols Billy Williams (baseball player) Minnesota Twins Randy Johnson Dave Concepci__n October 16 in baseball Chicago Bulls Baseball statistics Alan Trammell Joe Morgan San Francisco 49ers Tony Gwynn Cleveland Browns Yao Ming Tim McCarver November 1 in baseball November 3 in baseball Ken Boyer Bob Johnson (baseball) Major League Baseball All-Star Game Jim Palmer Eddie Murray Lou Boudreau Don Drysdale Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl XIV Larry Bird

what's the advantage to throwing side arm submarine if any just curious about why pitchers choose side arm or submarine delivery instead of the traditional is it harder for batter's to read the pitch or simply what is comfortable for the pitcher thanks really the only advantage is the batter sees the different arm angle good for the first at bat and that's it throwing side arm or submarine allows for the batter to see the ball longer and also lets the batter get more loft on the ball so basically you let off a lot of shots also there is no posible way for a pitcher to throw side arm and having the correct pitching mechanics which makes them lose velocity and increases their risk of getting hurt for anyone it is truly a comfort thing that can be easily broken out of  Baseball Pitcher Fast bowling Softball 1957 World Series Sandy Koufax Pitch (baseball) Baseball Stars Pedro Mart__nez Baseball statistics Satchel Paige Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Curveball Pitcher's mound Hit by pitch No-hitter Fielding (cricket) Tris Speaker Baseball bat Strike zone Bunt Switch hitter Baseball scorekeeping World Series Interference (baseball) Intentional base on balls Babe Ruth Beanball Cricket Baserunning Baseball positions Table tennis History of baseball in the United States Earned run average Ty Cobb Knuckleball Stolen base First baseman Chicago White Sox Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Car handling History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) English cricket team History of Test cricket (to 1883) Home run Golf club (equipment) Chicago Cubs Strikeout Randy Johnson Nolan Ryan Dead-ball era 2004 World Series Brian Close Batting (cricket) Gramophone record Box score (baseball) Ben Sheets Babe Ruth's Called Shot Balk Starting pitcher Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 St. Louis Cardinals Squash (sport) Volleyball Terminal ballistics Cy Young Billy Wagner Professional wrestling throws 2005 World Series Out (baseball) Yorker Squeeze play (baseball) Origins of baseball Reggie Jackson Marius Russo Beer Pong Diving Detroit Tigers Floppy disk Tenshinhan Professional wrestling holds 2004 American League Championship Series Ichiro Suzuki Knife Ted Radcliffe 1986 World Series Cricket pitch Table saw Smokey Joe Wood Negro league baseball Indian Oil Cup 2005 Internal ballistics Professional wrestling attacks No ball Greg Maddux A.J.

what is the cycle recently i was listening to a baseball announcer say that a certain player i forget his name achieved history by hitting for the cycle what does the cycle mean in baseball terms the cycle is not history niether is a hole in one in golf niether is a bowling a perfect game in bowling here is a cycle a batter hits a single and then the next time up at bat he hits a double then he is like really hot at the plate and bangs a triple his third time up now here is where your announcer gets overly enthusiastic to say it is history because when the hitter hits a homerun his th time at bat this is a great acheivement for sure he gets hits in one ball game i e hr b b b any order of hits done by the same hitter this is a cycle  Home run Batting average Hank Aaron Andr__s Galarraga Baseball Stars Box score (baseball) Babe Ruth Barry Bonds Designated hitter Softball Baseball scorekeeping Troy Glaus Ted Williams Toronto Blue Jays Perfect game St. Louis Cardinals World Series 2004 World Series Ty Cobb 1957 World Series No-hitter Manny Ram__rez Pete Rose Stolen base Alex Rodriguez Bert Campaneris First baseman Robin Ventura Chuck Klein 1919 World Series Jim Rice George Brett (baseball) Gary Sheffield Sandy Koufax David Ortiz Lou Gehrig BASEketball Boston Red Sox Vin Scully Ken Harrelson Dave Kingman Mark McGwire New York Mets Switch hitter Tony Oliva Wes Ferrell Ed Delahanty Mike Schmidt Intentional base on balls Felipe Alou Luke Appling Bunt Cincinnati Reds Shoeless Joe Jackson Chicago White Sox Daryle Ward Yankee Stadium Mois__s Alou Sports timeline Jeff Bagwell Pedro Mart__nez Hubert H.

do you think babe ruth has gotten a bad rap people say he wouldn't have set the home run record if the leagues had been integrated if the leagues had been integrated josh gibson wouldn't have hit his supposed home runs because he would have been facing stronger pitching and some people saying that nothing before should count what do we do ignore anything that ruth or gehrig or ty cobb or cy young did i think a lot of white fans who admire these old players have also shown genuine admiration for the black stars of the game like negro league players mays aaron and even pre steroid barry why do some people feel that black players can only get full recognition by taking recognition away from white players ruth's accomplishment was incredible he didn't start out as a hitter and he was chasing his own home run record for most of his career i think that's pretty amazing everybody's honoring hank aaron right now which is great but i don't think babe ruth should be denigrated get serious ruth hit more hrs than entire other teams the negro league thing is bs there were some talented players there that were every bit as good as guys in the mlb but mlb was also a very concentrated group so there were fewer teams and talent was more concentrated so if baseball had been integrated in ruth's day he'd hit just as many hrs as for records black and dark cuban players who were excluded from the majors on skin color only make up a fraction of the total talent in the s and s they came to have an abnormally high number of players for the same reason in ruth's time irish and italians made up an unsually high percentage of mlb players that is economic conditions made it such that if you were italian or irish crime and sports were really the only ways out of a life of hard labor for low wages as italians and irish integrated into the mainstream society their numbers dwindled in baseball blacks are seeing the same thing as they have advanced economically fewer people see sports crime and music as they only way to succeed the rise in payroll has made baseball a risk worth taking for many people who'd in earlier years would have just gone to college and never attempted to play pro ball until recently the pay scale was so low that even stars in baseball had to have winter jobs to make enough money to make a decent living the odds of even making the majors were slim and careers like today tend to be short so mostly it's been the very poor who have played baseball those that can afford college instead went to college today mega millions lure many middle class and even some people from wealthy families into taking their shot at fortune and fame cuba which produced many star and hall of fame players until the s has until very recently produced almost no mlb players today more and more cubans are defecting and castro's demise will probably open up a flood of cuban players again as for ruth's accomplishments as you pointed out he was a pitcher for many years he also cut his career short by a few years with his excessive lifestyle if he'd come up as a hitter and taken care of himself he'd hit hrs easily ruth hit a mushball and contrary to many claims pitchers in his day may not have had sliders but they were allowed to use the spit ball which nastier than a slider cut balls were the norm and the equiptment did not have the same level of quality nor was medical care anywhere close to what it is today back then you got a bacterial infection you toughed it out because there was no anti biotics training consisted of jumping jacks and push ups weight rooms didn't exist without steroids few modern players could have hit hrs a season with the kind of baseball that was being thrown and the kind of pitching that was faced a sense of machismo made bats very heavy ruth's bat weighed almost twice what most modern sluggers use as for ab per hr nobody even comes close to ruth to say records before don't count is nothing more than racism as blatent as the that which kept black and dark cubans out of baseball before then honoring aaron makes sense ironically aaron was not really a power hitter aaron led the league in hrs only times in his entire career ruth did it time by contrast mccovey and schmidt who were contemporaries of aaron and in same league by contrast led the league and times aaron was a complete hitter who stole bases hit for avg and even played good defense ruth also hit for high avg was one of the best rbi men to ever play the game as well as being one of the best pitchers of his day i don't recognize bond's or any other steroid user's records far as i'm concerned all awards given too camminitti bonds sosa palmiero giambi mcgwire cansecoo sheffield mcgriff and the other proven steroid users should be struck down and given to the next runner up thier career stats should be removed there is zero doubt that bonds not only used steroids that he would have never topped hrs or in a season without steroids he's admited to using them though he claims by accident he was nailed in the same investigation that busted giambi and sheffield he's long been rumored and his stats scream steroid use he did steroids and without steroids he had no chance at least with mcgwire you can say steroids probably hurt his hr total sure he'd hit fewer per season but mcgwire had a swing designed to maximize power mcgwire was a one dimensional player who did one thing hit hrs and he did it well if he weighed lbs that swing he developed would have been hrs a season easy bonds on the other hand was more of an aaron style player he had good power but not hr type power he didn't have aaron's durability so he'd never approached the hr mark without steroids he wouldn't be playing right now without steroids he was his way out of baseball when he started using the steroids they have prolonged his career by a good years however if he hadn't used steroids he'd gone into the hall of fame on the first ballot and been remembered in a much kinder light a rod who so far has not had any real evidence of steroid use is very likely to break any mark bonds sets and possibly even before bonds is elilgible for the hof there are three other players also capable of breaking that mark including griffy if he revives his career so bond's accomplishment unlike aaron's and ruth's isn't all that special even if he hadn't indulged in steroids it may not stand as much as years where ruth's and aaron's stood for decades they were light years ahead of anybody else in their time especially ruth who hit more than anybody else until mays and aaron so i agree people shouldn't knock ruth at all what he did was more amazing than what aaron did which was amazing enough what aaron did was no small feat it took him nearly twice as many abs as ruth but aaron's accomplishment was not just hrs it was being such a good well rounded hitter for so long much like rose's all time hits record is an amazing accomplishment he took more abs than cobb to set the record didn't hit anywhere near as well as cobb but rose was able to grit it out and be a very good hitter longer than almost anybody else so ruth is not nd place aaron doesn't deserve any they both set a record with great athletics and determination they both had amazing raw talent and achieved records in honest and competitive environments aaron set his record in a day when pitchers ruled the game aaron won two batting crowns for example ruth only won one ruth is still the greatest hr hitter aaron the greatest overall hitter

i don't understand something about a baseball stat if a batter hits a grounder to shortstop but the shortstop bobbles the ball the batter makes first is that considered a hit since he did make it to first example yesterday the cardinals had straight hits i believe braden looper hit a bunt pitcher had it but bobbled it looper makes it to first and its considered a hit according to the score card wouldn't that be an error or does it count as an error and a hit whenever there's an error whether it be a pop fly or grounder sounds confusing but i'm confused it becomes the judgement of the official scorekeeper as to whether it was fielded cleanly enough and easily enough to where the pitcher should have been able to make an out anywhere i didn't happen to see the play but the scorekeepers are generally correct however the play can always be reviewed later and changed to an error  Baseball Baseball statistics Baseball scorekeeping Softball Sandy Koufax 2004 World Series 1957 World Series 2005 World Series Bunt Satchel Paige Perfect game World Series Box score (baseball) October 4 in baseball Tris Speaker No-hitter 2004 American League Championship Series 1919 World Series 2003 World Series Shortstop Home run Baseball positions Braden Looper Lou Gehrig Pitcher Boston Red Sox Baseball Stars Detroit Tigers Hank Aaron October 22 in baseball Chicago Cubs Stolen base San Francisco Giants St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth October 13 in baseball Pete Rose October 17 in baseball Baserunning Mike Schmidt Batting average Bubble Bobble Interference (baseball) Ty Cobb Squeeze play (baseball) New York Yankees October 10 in baseball History of baseball in the United States October 7 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts 1987 National League Championship Series Mike Scioscia Out (baseball) Sabermetrics Origins of baseball First baseman Volleyball Curse of the Billy Goat Reggie Jackson Alex Rodriguez 1986 National League Championship Series October 14 in baseball Houston Astros Pedro Mart__nez October 19 in baseball Oakland Athletics October 28 in baseball Derek Jeter 1991 World Series Omar Vizquel Dead-ball era Toronto Blue Jays Cincinnati Reds Montr__al Expos Red Sox Nation Nolan Ryan Orlando Cabrera Switch hitter Jerry Coleman Catcher Bert Campaneris Kickball October 27 in baseball Wrigley Field October 25 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Infield fly Dave Concepci__n Negro league baseball 1986 World Series Kirk Gibson San Diego Padres Fenway Park Chico Carrasquel

why does espn have such an east coast bias when it comes to baseball i am tired of hearing about new york boston the fact of the matter and i'm sure you don't want to hear this is that the yankees and red sox make up of the marketing revenue in baseball alone i agree that it is an incredibly unhealthy balance but that's the way it is it's not east west it's what moves the dial and the yankees and red sox have the most stars and are what people want to hear about trust me i'm an angels fan and i'm bummed that my team gets undersold every year but those are the most popular teams and espn is a business out to please their consumers not an npo just look at yankees v red sox ratings against the ratings of any other game minus those that involve waiting for bonds to hit the big home run which to be consistent they covered ad nauseum on a national level it's no contest oh wait this is yahoo answers yeah man espn is like totally trying to push an agenda because abc's ceo has yankee underoos  Boston Red Sox New York Yankees Home run Major League Baseball television contracts Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox Reggie Jackson Tim McCarver Oakland Athletics Red Sox Nation Alex Rodriguez October 4 in baseball 2005 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds St. Louis Cardinals October 2004 in sports Houston Astros November 3 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Interleague play David Ortiz 1986 World Series Manny Ram__rez Curse of the Bambino MLB on FOX Baltimore Orioles Gary Sheffield Ty Cobb Tris Speaker Al Michaels New York Mets October 1 in baseball Dick Williams Pittsburgh Pirates Robin Ventura National Football League Atlanta Braves San Diego Padres Cleveland Indians October 22 in baseball October 19 in baseball October 5 in baseball October 9 in baseball American League October 26 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Rickey Henderson October 7 in baseball History of baseball in the United States Derek Jeter Major League Baseball Toronto Blue Jays ESPN25 October 25 in baseball Seattle Mariners Trot Nixon October 15 in baseball 1981 baseball strike No-hitter October 20 in baseball October 16 in baseball Edgar Renter__a Major League Baseball All-Star Game October 13 in baseball NFL on television October 3 in baseball 2005 American League Division Series Pedro Mart__nez October 27 in baseball Baseball Curt Schilling September 20 in baseball Minnesota Twins October 10 in baseball October 17 in baseball Moe Berg September 2005 in sports Tim Wakefield WFAN (AM) October 21 in baseball WEEI Salary cap John Olerud September 2004 in sports

who do you think had to over come the most odd in baseball history my three players personally would be jackie robinson st black player hank aaron when he was passing babe ruth record lots of others coudn't choose but maybe barry bonds passing hank and babe while accused of using steriods sadly many african american players had to overcome odds and sometimes still do i think jackie robinson is the obvious choice for reasons we already know he turned out to be a great player by the way and i think that adds to it also hank aaron death threats stuff like that the whole world was on his shoulders when he broke ruth's record and he did just fine i have all the respect in the world for aaron and i'm sad to see his record being in danger by a cheater  Hank Aaron Barry Bonds Home run Babe Ruth Baseball Atlanta Braves Reggie Jackson Hank Greenberg World Series Ty Cobb St. Louis Cardinals History of baseball in the United States Boston Red Sox September 20 in baseball New York Yankees Jackie Robinson Lou Gehrig Negro league baseball Major League Baseball titles streaks Cincinnati Reds Sports timeline Los Angeles Dodgers June 12 in baseball Baltimore Orioles October 7 in baseball October 20 in baseball October 5 in baseball September 6 in baseball Top 500 home run hitters of all time Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Stolen base October 16 in baseball 2004 World Series San Francisco Giants Polo Grounds Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth's Called Shot Major League Baseball Jimmie Foxx Major League Baseball All-Star Game Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Stars October 4 in baseball Mark McGwire Hank Stram Eddie Mathews David Ortiz American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Detroit Tigers Roger Maris Oakland Athletics Rogers Hornsby Tris Speaker Bowie Kuhn 1957 World Series Seattle Mariners Rickey Henderson November 2 in baseball Baseball (documentary) June 8 in baseball Nolan Ryan Major League Baseball titles leaders Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939 Roger Clemens Hank Thompson (baseball player) Toronto Blue Jays Cleveland Indians Wrigley Field Alex Rodriguez Manny Ram__rez Ted Radcliffe Chicago White Sox Bobby Charlton Mickey Mantle Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Priesthood (Mormonism) Leo Durocher Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Major League Baseball television contracts Jacky Ickx New York Mets Kansas City Chiefs Don Hoak Dixie Walker Perfect game Troy Glaus Batting order (baseball) Old Time Baseball October 3 in baseball Ted Williams Ken Griffey, Jr. Rafael Palmeiro Pee Wee Reese Sandy Koufax Minor league baseball Baseball color line October 8 in baseball

i just realized why soccer isn't popular in the u s what's your opinion on this soccer is very popular in poor rd world countries countries where they don't have the resources to buy baseball gloves bats and balls american football pads basketballs and hoops etc most americans can afford these they play what they can afford a pig's intestine they can kick around i'm being serious do you think resources have nothing to do with what sports get played in certain parts of the world it's one of the main reasons basketball is played in the inner cities must less expensive to put up two rims than to build a baseball field contact the most popular sport in japan is baseball do your research before trying to make a point artist what exactly would you classify brazil and uraguay as wealthy their per capita incomes are and respectively per capita for u s nice try though art it's just an expression calm down soccer is not popular in the u s because we prefer not to fall asleep during games rockytopron soccer is not popular in the u s before you cite the women's world cup as a sparkplug for the game tell me who won this year's wusa title nobody because the league folded two years ago because nobody was willing to drive to the stadium and pay bucks to see it you know why the ' u s women were popular because they appealed to the male libido yes they were great players but they were already mostly age and up with more yesterdays on the field than tomorrows once those players' skills deteriorated to the point that putting them out there meant sacrificing victory for eye candy the guys left the stadium and the women and young girls weren't enough of a combined revenue source to keep the wusa going it's got nothing to do with talent it's got everything to do with the fact that women alone can't keep a league going and men aren't going to watch athletic women they haven't seen in skimpy outfits over and over again and soccer outfits though showing off some fantastic legs are not skimpy is that fair no those americans male and female who are good soccer players deserve the chance to exhibit their talent in front of people willing to pay to see them there just aren't enough people willing to pay to see them in this country  Football (soccer) Baseball American football National Football League Basketball Babe Ruth Major League Baseball Field hockey Water polo World Series Football Oakland Athletics Golf Australian rules football Softball National pastime Chicago Cubs Sports in Puerto Rico Topps Playoff St. Louis Cardinals Volleyball Major League Baseball television contracts Rugby football Women's football (soccer) Pete Rose Satchel Paige Wrigley Field FIFA Series Sports timeline December 2004 in sports Continental Basketball Association American Football League Sport in the United Kingdom Sport in Ireland New York Yankees Pel__ New York Giants Mickey Mantle Norway national football team National Football League Lore Los Angeles Dodgers Boston Red Sox Lacrosse Ty Cobb Minor league baseball Ultimate (sport) Salary cap Canadian Soccer Association Rugby league Toronto Blue Jays 2005 World Series Brazil national football team New York Mets Indiana State University Canadian football Tris Speaker Yankee Stadium Texas Longhorn Athletics The Football League San Diego Padres Indoor football Alex Rodriguez Indoor soccer Cincinnati Bengals 2004 World Series FA Cup Atlantic Coast Conference Football (soccer) positions National Hockey League All-Star Game Robert F.

baseball rules i know pretty much everything about baseball the only thing i don't get is why do they say that its not good to make the first or last out at third base it's just one of those old accepted baseball sayings the point is that you shouldn't make the first or last out by being greedy trying to stretch a double to a triple or reach third on a single in reality you shouldn't make the first or third out by being greedy at any base but this is just the term that has stuck and it annoys me to no end when announcers repeat it  Baseball Pete Rose Ty Cobb Theory of conduct Softball 2004 World Series Baseball statistics Tris Speaker BASEketball Home run Playoff Hank Aaron Baseball scorekeeping Andr__s Galarraga Shaggy dog story Major League Baseball Manny Ram__rez 1957 World Series 2005 World Series 1919 World Series Chess strategy and tactics Singlish The nature of God in Western theology Origins of baseball Poker jargon World Series Jennifer Lopez St. Louis Cardinals Epistemology Luke Appling Stolen base Major League Baseball television contracts Negro league baseball Satchel Paige Baseball Stars Sheepshead Playoff format Sandy Koufax 2004 American League Championship Series Juan Samuel Scientific method Shoeless Joe Jackson Social rule Star Trek Customizable Card Game Milton H.

is it time for the red sox to be really worried about the yankees back and it's only the beginning of august i personally would not write off the yankees until they are out of both the al east title and the wildcard the reason the yanks have closed the distance boils down to a couple of factors all have to do with hitting david ortiz has had some knee problems that date back to late last year and will require surgery his production has suffered partially for this j d drew is not earning his money mill for years on a so called no batter who is batting like a fourth outfielder still not sure why they ranked him a must have he also hurt our chances of jermaine dye due to dye having to share the starting job with drew julio lugo for years at million he is pulling out of it but the slump hurt badly for so long wily mo pena has not emerged as the right handed power hitting people thought he could become he is also a liability in the field so they can't afford to play him at anything more than dh that and he strikes out a lot so they can't give him too many at bats manny's power numbers have been down but that could be due to the lack of production around him in the long run the red sox pitching will be great for years to come their bullpen has been one of the league's best thus far the short term the sox problem has been scoring runs they are leaving too many runners on base yes the yankees are all hitting the years old barrier with greater frequency but they can hit and produce runs in the now they aren't getting the same pitching the sox are but they aren't leaving runners on base this is even without sheffield the red sox fans that said that the yankees were done in may and june were crazy then no one should be writing of the yanks until oct i still think the sox will win the division but the yankees are still in striking distance and could very well take the wild card  Chicago White Sox 1957 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series World Series 2004 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Babe Ruth New York Yankees Baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Manny Ram__rez Home run 1919 World Series Satchel Paige Cleveland Indians Alex Rodriguez International League 2005 American League Division Series Robin Ventura Seattle Mariners St. Louis Cardinals Pedro Mart__nez Reggie Jackson Softball 2003 World Series Tris Speaker Florida Marlins Chicago Cubs October 4 in baseball October 12 in baseball Cincinnati Reds David Ortiz New York Mets Moe Berg October 22 in baseball October 10 in baseball San Francisco Giants 1986 World Series Baltimore Orioles Gary Sheffield Ty Cobb San Diego Padres Curse of the Bambino October 16 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Houston Astros Interference (baseball) Baseball statistics Oakland Athletics October 7 in baseball 2001 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Wade Boggs Texas Rangers (baseball) Roger Clemens Batting average Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Pete Rose October 2005 in sports October 5 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Fenway Park Yankee Stadium Sandy Koufax Lou Gehrig No-hitter Hank Aaron October 3 in baseball Bernie Williams Red Sox Nation October 13 in baseball New York Giants October 15 in baseball Baseball scorekeeping October 27 in baseball Dick Williams October 1 in baseball Cricket English cricket team Minnesota Twins Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) October 11 in baseball October 9 in baseball Fast bowling September 28 in baseball 1981 baseball strike Pittsburgh Pirates October 19 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Atlanta Braves

why are baseball teams allowed to trade cash for players i was just curious how this is possible what is to stop a team owner from pocketing millions of dollars personally in exchange for running a major pro sports team into the ground when a player is traded for cash are there rules for if that money has to be reinvested into the team or can it be used for non team purposes by the owner there are no rules about what can be done with the money within the team if the team isn't solely owned by one person and i don't think any are they would not be able to just take the money out of the team however that's business law not mlb rules the commissioner must approve any trade where the money exchanged is over a certain amount i don't recall what the number is but i think it's around m that rule is in effect so that owners won't do exactly what you suggest i e gut the teams for their own personal enrichment the most notable use of the rule was in when then commissioner bowie kuhn stopped a's owner charlie finley from selling several of his players joe rudi vida blue and rollie fingers  Oakland Athletics November 1 in baseball World Series Bowie Kuhn Boston Red Sox New York Yankees Salary cap Minor league baseball Dick Williams National Football League Washington Nationals Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants Detroit Tigers October 20 in baseball Los Angeles Clippers Baseball Toronto Blue Jays Poker jargon Satchel Paige Chicago White Sox American Football League St. Louis Rams Milwaukee Brewers Capital accumulation Montr__al Expos Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Dividend San Diego Padres Los Angeles Dodgers November 3 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts 1994 baseball strike Cleveland Indians Babe Ruth Rollie Fingers History of baseball in the United States The Amazing Race 1919 World Series Baseball Stars New York Mets George Steinbrenner Baltimore Orioles Baseball Hall of Fame MLB on NBC 2004-05 NHL lockout Rickey Henderson University of Notre Dame Texas Rangers (baseball) Softball Paintball Atlanta Braves Hank Aaron The Joker's Wild Houston Astros Dolphins Stadium Monopoly (game) Japanese baseball Kansas City Royals Florida Marlins New York Giants Warren Buffett Los Angeles Kings Reserve clause Tris Speaker October 26 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Negro league baseball Baseball statistics Ty Cobb New England Patriots Pittsburgh Pirates Ice hockey October 18 in baseball $ale of the Century Sammy Sosa Tax Football (soccer) Surplus value Buffalo Bills Insurance Slot machine October 22 in baseball Bud Selig Chicago Cubs Willie Mays Barry Bonds Oakland Raiders United States dollar Deion Sanders September 28 in baseball Grandfather clause Chelsea F.C.

will the cardinals sign chris duncan does anybody know the the cardinals might sign duncan or will he be leaving st louis it is debatable whether this is a good idea he is a good hitter and a great power hitter and is just ketting better however his glove is suspect he has gotten better but he still is a liability in the field the best comparison would be pat burrell that being said it is likely he will be resigned for several reasons first he is young and improving the cardinals struggle greatly from being too old and duncan can be a healthy fixture in lf for a long time to come second he is the son of the cardinals pitching coach dave duncan that does play a role in the willingness of the organization to resign him third he is a good character guy this cardinal squad suffers a bit in this area as well from the hancock tragedy to the recent spezio rehab duncan is a good guy and a very hard worker with a good head on his shoulders he is willing to improve his game and has done so over the last few years he is light years ahead of where he was when he came up and will likely only get better with ankiel's rising star the cards could have very productive corner outfielders for years to come  St. Louis Cardinals Baseball Houston Astros San Diego Padres Toronto Blue Jays World Series Detroit Tigers Baltimore Orioles Babe Ruth Andr__s Galarraga Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Reds 2004 World Series Tony La Russa Hank Aaron Cincinnati Bengals New York Yankees October 20 in baseball Cleveland Browns San Antonio Spurs History of baseball in the United States Sandy Koufax Pittsburgh Pirates Robin Ventura Edgar Renter__a Major League Baseball television contracts Orlando Magic Home run Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Oakland Athletics New York Knicks New York Mets Chicago White Sox Alex Rodriguez Pete Rose November 2 in baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dixie Walker Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

why don't pitchers just intentionally walk barry bonds yea but its not just all what the fans want i pay money to watch the pirates try to win but they are lucky if they win once every weeks at a certain point in the game they will ibb him because first base is open and he does not have a lot of protection in that lineup soemtimes the don't need the extra baserunner and the last time i checked bonds can't hit the ball all that well b c all he trys to do is hit homeruns and do it for himself and that is one of the prime reasons why the giants are so bad this season besides the fact they have not pitching they have the most pointless lineup in the league with durham roberts in your lineup in front of bonds is not going to work and i forgot to mention randy winn can't forget him so basically they dont do it all the time because they want to pitch to him and some liek the challenge or their manager wants to go after him and get an out to get out of the inning quicker its all about winning the game everyone except barry bonds team is worried about winning the game its like bonds and the rest of the guys dont even make an effort bonds just needs to hit the hr and then move on to arod for the next years  Barry Bonds Home run Grover Cleveland Alexander Baseball San Francisco Giants 1957 World Series Sandy Koufax Baseball statistics Babe Adams Ty Cobb Satchel Paige Pittsburgh Pirates October 4 in baseball Intentional base on balls Hank Aaron Toronto Blue Jays Oakland Athletics Troy Glaus Perfect game Alex Rodriguez Boston Red Sox No-hitter Cincinnati Reds Baseball Stars Joaqu__n And__jar Doyle Alexander 1986 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series International League Softball St. Louis Cardinals 2003 World Series Willie Mays Los Angeles Dodgers Sammy Sosa Johnny Allen Detroit Tigers New York Mets Major League Baseball television contracts 2004 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Tris Speaker Pitcher Atlanta Braves Johnny Antonelli October 27 in baseball 1919 World Series Houston Astros 2005 World Series Don Hoak October 15 in baseball Mois__s Alou Derek Jeter Pete Rose Chicago White Sox Stolen base San Diego Padres Nolan Ryan 2001 World Series October 12 in baseball Chicago Cubs Red Ames Randy Winn October 17 in baseball Ted Williams Greg Maddux Volleyball October 16 in baseball October 20 in baseball History of baseball in the United States October 19 in baseball Interference (baseball) Vin Scully September 20 in baseball November 3 in baseball Lou Gehrig Nick Altrock Batting average Ichiro Suzuki Wrigley Field Reggie Jackson Hit by pitch October 7 in baseball 1991 World Series Florida Marlins Felipe Alou New York Giants October 1 in baseball

how does the mlb wildcard work how many teams make it out of each division quite well actually bit of a surprise there considering it was a seligula initiative but even blind pigs find the occasional truffle each league has three divisions the wildcard berth per league is awarded to the second place team with the best record if necessary a tiebreaker game will be played nl the wildcard team is seeded regardless of record the division series will match up the wildcard against the seed best record unless they are from the same division in that case the wildcard will play the seed the wildcard team never has original homefield advantage in the division series or league championship series seedings do not matter in the world series as homefield is predetermined  Playoff Major League Baseball National Basketball Association NFL playoffs Toronto Blue Jays Playoff format Home team National Hockey League Chicago Cubs Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Bundesliga (football) National Football League The Football League 2005 World Series UEFA Champions League Single-elimination tournament Boston Red Sox Seattle Mariners Mois__s Alou Major League Soccer Houston Astros Sudden death World Series Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco Giants 2005 English cricket season Atlanta Braves Andrew Murray (tennis player) Canadian Football League Pittsburgh Steelers June 2004 in sports Stanley Cup Cris Carter Sammy Sosa Interleague play Buffalo Bills Chinese Basketball Association Houston Rockets Bowl Championship Series MLB on FOX 2002 World Series New York Yankees Cleveland Indians Chicago White Sox International League Pete Rose Milwaukee Brewers Primera Divisi__n Argentina St. Louis Cardinals Pittsburgh Pirates NBA Finals Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Mets Canadian Football League West Division Major League Baseball television contracts Indianapolis Colts Cleveland Browns Baltimore Orioles Rugby union Tournament 2002 NFL season FA Cup Detroit Tigers 2004 NFL season National Football League championships First-class cricket Cincinnati Reds Major League Baseball All-Star Game New England Patriots Kansas City Chiefs Minnesota Twins Miami Dolphins Washington Nationals NCAA Philippines Basketball Championship Philadelphia Eagles Match Game 2002-03 NHL season Blackburn Rovers F.C.

do you think pitchers in mlb like pedro martinez uses steroids for their weight and muscle gain there is no evidence that steroids enhance the performance of pitchers pitchers do not necessarily have to have power even a pitcher that relies mainly on the fast ball has to have other pitches to complement that pitch flexibility change of speed and other factors all contribute to a pitcher's success if you examine the records it is mostly position players that have tested positive or been have accused of steroid use it would not have much of an effect on pitchers  Pitcher Major League Baseball Barry Bonds Baseball Stolen base Softball Toronto Blue Jays Starting pitcher Designated hitter Weight training Batting average Boston Red Sox New York Mets 2004 American League Championship Series Baseball statistics Baseball Stars Knuckleball Greg Maddux Roger Clemens Puberty Win (baseball) Rafael Palmeiro 2004 World Series Tim Wakefield Fast bowling World Series Jos__ Canseco Seattle Mariners Montr__al Expos Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) MLB Most Valuable Player Award Mariano Rivera Perfect game Chicago White Sox History of baseball in the United States Tom Richardson St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Anabolic steroid Whitey Ford Ichiro Suzuki Clinical depression Hit by pitch Pete Rose Catcher Mark McGwire Pittsburgh Pirates Fielding (cricket) Pitch (baseball) 1981 World Series Randy Johnson Beanball Carpal tunnel syndrome Mike Schmidt Major League Baseball All-Star Game October 16 in baseball Tommy Lasorda No-hitter Complete game Strike zone Bud Selig Dieting 1983 World Series Red Sox Nation Growth hormone treatment Houston Astros Pitcher's mound 2005 World Series Luis Tiant Baseball scorekeeping Ben Johnson (athlete) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) November 4 in baseball Volleyball Satchel Paige Bodybuilding Signal transduction October 26 in baseball Timpani Terminal ballistics November 3 in baseball Glucocorticoid Trumpet Shane Warne Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry 1957 World Series Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Balk B-47 Stratojet Atlanta Braves Baserunning Andr__s Galarraga First baseman Mel Parnell Box score (baseball) Detroit Tigers

who else got a good laugh from the red sox mariners game i know i did when i saw it on the news the scene with the mascot sorry don't know the name crashing into coco crisp gave me a good laugh and i only say that because he wasn't hurt i got another good one when the coach started yelling at an official about it when did that happen was it before the game or between innings also what did the coach yell about did he think that the mariners were trying to sabotage the red sox well maybe it's one of those things that you'll look back on one day and laugh it reminds me of when randall simon hit the italian sausage on the head during the sausage race at a brewers game no one was hurt in that incident though simon was arrested and had to pay a small fine i think it was an honest mistake fortunately coco crisp wasn't hurt and the people involved were actually very genteel about the whole thing apparently coco was really cool about it and played it off with humor i think the funniest thing about this story is that red sox manager terry francona missed the entire incident because he was in the bathroom d'oh don't you wonder if he came running out of the restroom with his fly unzipped all worried this the mariners mascot tried to kill his center fielder and coach if the moose really did try to take out crisp you just send in big papi in a one on one between the moose and big papi i know which one i'd be betting on and it's not the one with the antlers and the fixed unblinking stare in the mariner's uniform  Boston Red Sox 1919 World Series Seattle Mariners 2004 World Series Tris Speaker Cleveland Indians Milwaukee Brewers Chicago White Sox Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Ty Cobb World Series Babe Ruth Piccolo Junior Saga November 1 in baseball Baseball Satchel Paige 2005 World Series Fenway Park Toronto Blue Jays 2004 American League Championship Series Red Sox Nation Home run Ted Williams Shoeless Joe Jackson St. Louis Cardinals Moe Berg Terry Francona Oakland Athletics October 4 in baseball Sandy Koufax Detroit Tigers EastEnders David Ortiz October 9 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 San Francisco 49ers Pete Rose October 15 in baseball 1986 World Series Randy Johnson Shaggy dog story Crystal Palace F.C.

do people confuse the ideas of a record and an award in talking about barry bonds' home run record a lot of people seem to think bonds is being giving something subjective that can be withheld or taken back like an mvp award or a silver slugger award rather than setting a record which is an objective statement of fact do you agree yes they do which explains all the people that ask does he deserve to hold the record some people just don't understand that nobody gives anyone a record records are just numbers nobody decided that joe dimaggio should be awarded the record for longest hitting streak nobody awarded pete rose the number one spot in lifetime hits and nobody will award bonds his th home run the fact is that very soon bonds will have hit more home runs than anyone else in major league history i happen to be one of those people who some might term a bonds hater but i have learned to accept this fact  Barry Bonds Pete Rose Home run Lou Gehrig Troy Glaus Hank Aaron New York Yankees Major League Baseball International League San Francisco Giants Alex Rodriguez October 20 in baseball Chicago White Sox Joe DiMaggio Ty Cobb October 4 in baseball Willie Mays Seattle Mariners October 22 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Dodgers Atlanta Braves Boston Red Sox NBA Finals June 8 in baseball September 6 in baseball Chicago Bulls 1957 World Series Don Mattingly Kansas City Chiefs Albert Pujols September 20 in baseball Bobby Abreu David Ortiz Torii Hunter Larry Walker Billboard Hot 100 History of baseball in the United States Manny Ram__rez Major League Baseball titles streaks Roger Clemens 2005 World Series November 3 in baseball Sports timeline Polyamory Ichiro Suzuki Pittsburgh Steelers October 19 in baseball Joe Kuhel Detroit Tigers October 17 in baseball Reality National Football League Lore 2004 American League Championship Series Roger Maris Sammy Sosa Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Houston Astros Bobby Bonds November 2 in baseball Mike Schmidt Babe Ruth Mickey Mantle Rickey Henderson Ellis Burks October 5 in baseball New York Giants October 16 in baseball Jim Rice Theory of conduct 2004 World Series November 4 in baseball Wayne Gretzky Shawn Green October 12 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cincinnati Reds Chipper Jones Pete Sampras October 3 in baseball San Francisco 49ers Satchel Paige Lou Boudreau Cincinnati Bengals Miguel Tejada Causality Super Bowl XXVII C__sar Tovar Royal Assent Mois__s Alou Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Canon (fiction) Brett Favre Super Bowl XXVI She Loves You Nolan Ryan

why don't left handed hitters bunt or slap the ball near the rd base side when a shift is placed on them i see shifts being put on bonds big papi and hafner i know that a lot of times they have success hitting the ball up the middle or pull the middle and try to middle the ball on the bat but during critical junctures of the games why won't these guys bunt near the rd base line or slap the shot near the rd base this could disrupt the defense and runners on base could move up the hitter could get on base and maybe an error might be commited are they not skilled enough and can't handle the bat to hit the ball the other way in the infield or what pitchers are pitching them away so why won't these guys do it i mean look at hafner his team could be running away with first place in the al central if theywon more close games if he could come thru and play smart like that when a shift is placed on him in critical close games he's having a bad year not hitting for power or average why can't he do this and contribute to his team why can't lefties like him and others do that lefties are taught trained to be pull hitters in most situations with runners on base the conventional wisdom is to put the ball in play to the right side of the field thus we have this emphasis for lefties unfortunately for most lefties it means that half of the field is not utilized offensively if properly executed on a semi regular basis this tactic would keep defenses honest and open up the right side again for a powerful lefty  1957 World Series Softball Volleyball Babe Ruth Ty Cobb Tris Speaker 1919 World Series Batting average 2004 World Series World Series 2005 World Series St. Louis Cardinals Fast bowling First baseman Boston Red Sox Home run Chicago White Sox Pete Rose Fielding (cricket) Toronto Blue Jays Glossary of American football Interference (baseball) Sandy Koufax Los Angeles Dodgers BASEketball Baseball Stars Baserunning Designated hitter Baseball positions Stolen base Hank Aaron New York Yankees Laws of cricket Andr__s Galarraga Cricket Table tennis Manny Ram__rez Ted Williams Out (baseball) 1986 National League Championship Series Shoeless Joe Jackson Satchel Paige 2004 American League Championship Series Pitcher Moe Berg Houston Astros San Francisco Giants Pittsburgh Pirates Seattle Mariners October 9 in baseball English cricket team Ichiro Suzuki No-hitter Pedro Mart__nez Bert Campaneris Rugby union positions Ravi Shastri American football Cincinnati Reds David Ortiz Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 San Diego Padres Atlanta Braves Alex Rodriguez 2003 World Series American football strategy Appeal play October 4 in baseball Marius Russo October 10 in baseball Perfect game Tag Paintball Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 October 20 in baseball Shortstop New York Giants Oakland Athletics Lefty Grove Barry Bonds Babe Ruth's Called Shot Rugby union Super Bowl XXI 1993 World Series October 1 in baseball

why aren't steroids good for the game anymore i remember when people were happy like back in then comes along and people get angry even though i could smell the fish in why didn't anybody else and i'm not saying roger maris did anything wrong because he didn't but people always say look at averages well maris never hit that many homers on average before he hit bonds has been pretty consistent in homerun production i don't understand why people use that as a case against bonds when he had one big jump in hrs just like maris sammy hit over three times mcgwire did it twice barry only once like maris i think barry did something but it doesn't matter to me because baseball purists know all records in baseball are tainted to a certain extent if you dig deep enough there is dirt on all of these records i think you are being a little over defensive of bonds however people didn't care that there were steroids being used in the 's because they didn't know if they knew i'm sure some type of anger would have come out  Home run Mark McGwire Barry Bonds St. Louis Cardinals Andr__s Galarraga Roger Maris History of baseball in the United States Jos__ Canseco New York Yankees ESPN25 Troy Glaus Satchel Paige Jason Giambi Babe Ruth Baseball Dave Kingman Major League Baseball Rafael Palmeiro EastEnders Major League Baseball television contracts Ted Williams Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind World Series Oakland Athletics Homer Simpson Wes Ferrell Pedro Mart__nez San Francisco Giants Rickey Henderson 1957 World Series Hank Aaron Jim Rice September 6 in baseball Dave Henderson Alex Rodriguez Kodocha Baseball statistics Cliff Richard Tris Speaker Hal Trosky Ty Cobb Willie Mays Gary Sheffield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Top 500 home run hitters of all time Baltimore Orioles Boston Red Sox October 22 in baseball Dave Concepci__n Batting average The Amber Spyglass October 4 in baseball Up the Down Steroid October 3 in baseball "Weird Al" Yankovic October 2005 in sports James Bond AFI 100 Years series Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist September 20 in baseball The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Piccolo Junior Saga Yogiisms Miguel Tejada Torii Hunter Brady Anderson Philosophical skepticism Rich Mullins Robin Ventura Stan Musial Bob Horner October 7 in baseball Wrigley Field Joe Adcock The Man with the Golden Gun Cincinnati Reds July 2004 in sports Bubble Bobble Baseball Stars Toronto Blue Jays Albert Pujols Pittsburgh Pirates Jeff Kent Jimmie Foxx Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Characters in the Smurfs Ron Gant Baseball scorekeeping Roger Clemens The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mois__s Alou Bart Simpson Baseball (object) Ben Johnson (athlete) 1919 World Series

when did it become legal to take a pitcher out in the middle of an at bat anyone remember what year rule h and h determines who is credited with the walk or strike out dependant upon the count at the time a pitcher is relieved prior to finishing the official plate appearance of a batter conversly b states that if a batter is removed with two strikes and the pinch hitter is struck out the first batter is credited with being struck out any other result is 'awarded' to the pinch hitter so a batter can be lifted in the same manner has always been that way although you rarely see it the official scoring of said scenario was adopted in but managers have always been able to lift a pitcher or batter in the middle of a count i've seen it once this season when jim leyland lifted andrew miller on a count last month  Baseball statistics Batting average 1957 World Series Sandy Koufax Designated hitter Perfect game Home run Hank Aaron Babe Ruth St. Louis Cardinals Strike zone Stolen base Softball Toronto Blue Jays Baseball scorekeeping Pedro Mart__nez Pitcher No-hitter 2004 World Series 2005 World Series Boston Red Sox Roger Clemens Bunt Firpo Marberry Detroit Tigers Randy Johnson Robin Ventura Chicago White Sox Intentional base on balls Box score (baseball) Baseball Stars Jeff Bagwell Switch hitter 1986 World Series Tris Speaker 1919 World Series Nolan Ryan Hit by pitch Pete Rose Chicago Cubs Seattle Mariners Oakland Athletics Lou Gehrig Greg Maddux Willie Mays Houston Astros Interference (baseball) San Diego Padres Ty Cobb Ted Williams New York Yankees Earned run average Volleyball Jimmie Foxx 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds Byung-Hyun Kim Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Texas Rangers (baseball) Barry Bonds Pittsburgh Pirates Dead-ball era November 3 in baseball International League November 4 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Knuckleball Alex Rodriguez October 19 in baseball Curveball Florida Marlins Batting order (baseball) 2003 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers 1977 American League Championship Series New York Mets September 28 in baseball Billy Wagner Ted Kluszewski Save (sport) Hideo Nomo Starting pitcher Carl Yastrzemski Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry October 4 in baseball Bob Friend Manny Ram__rez Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Kirk Gibson Reggie Jackson November 1 in baseball History of baseball in the United States Dave Kingman Hooks Dauss 1986 American League Championship Series

in your opinion in mlb how valuable are most switch hitters do they really make a big difference for their teams or are they over rated in general i honestly believe that having a switch hitter doesn't make much difference most of the time a switch hitter will be good from only one side of the plate anyway the only benefit that i can think of with having switch hitters on your team is that it forces the opposing team to swap out pitchers more often to create better matchups in a three game series you can really wear out an opposing bullpen by bringing up a lot of switch hitters in the later innings  Baseball statistics Designated hitter Baseball Batting average World Series Pete Rose 1957 World Series Switch hitter Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Roger Clemens Chicago White Sox Interleague play Hank Aaron Major League Baseball All-Star Game Edgar Renter__a Houston Astros 1919 World Series Baseball Stars 2004 World Series Babe Ruth Manny Ram__rez Tris Speaker Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa St. Louis Cardinals Byung-Hyun Kim 2005 National League Championship Series Ty Cobb Sandy Koufax Stolen base 1986 World Series New York Yankees Red Sox Nation Earned run average October 20 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Softball Box score (baseball) David Ortiz Pedro Mart__nez No-hitter Alex Rodriguez Oakland Athletics Andr__s Galarraga Satchel Paige Starting pitcher 2004 American League Championship Series October 21 in baseball Fenway Park 2005 World Series Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Home run Reggie Jackson 1977 American League Championship Series 2003 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Al Leiter Baseball scorekeeping Playoff Luis Tiant San Diego Padres Major League Baseball Minnesota Twins History of baseball in the United States Firpo Marberry Angel Stadium of Anaheim Texas Rangers (baseball) Major League Baseball television contracts Curveball Casey Stengel Randy Johnson 2002 World Series Rudy York Ted Williams Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Atlanta Braves November 1 in baseball New York Mets Florida Marlins Mariano Rivera 1981 World Series Edgar Martinez 1982 World Series Don Newcombe October 4 in baseball Dave Concepci__n Hal Trosky Japanese baseball Ozzie Smith Willie Mays Detroit Tigers 1987 World Series October 19 in baseball Robin Ventura Doug Mientkiewicz October 10 in baseball

who is the best middle infielder in the hall of fame the question is mainly centered on middle infielders in the baseball hall of fame so that would mean that they are for a start retired and have played at least five years in the majors what i'm looking for is not offensive production but defensive the firld is pretty wide but i can tell you who has my vote on this one ryne sandberg played for the chicago cubs from and played a stretch of straight games without making an error of any kind that includes fielding and throwing during that stretsh sandberg's glove got the nickname among some of my friends as the place base hits go to die does anyone agree with me on this one in my opinion you have a really good case on ryne he was solid for many years and i would have to agree with you b c the numbers he put up was for a mediocre team but also the great cal ripkin jr played most of his career at shortstop so unless you're talking about people who played their whole career in the middle i have to say cal b c he was a solid player and the iron man playing in consecitive games or whatever it was but it was still by far a record that will never be touched but that's my opinion cal ripkin jr ryne sandberg craig biggio played whole career w astros quitely putting up good numbers year in year out  Ryne Sandberg Baseball Chicago Cubs Softball 2005 World Series Boston Red Sox Lou Gehrig Pete Rose Chicago White Sox Seattle Mariners 2004 World Series San Francisco Giants Florida Marlins Cal Ripken, Jr. Pittsburgh Pirates Dallas Green October 4 in baseball New York Mets Robin Ventura Second baseman Cincinnati Bengals Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 St. Louis Cardinals Luis Aparicio October 27 in baseball Atlanta Braves Pittsburgh Steelers October 22 in baseball Detroit Tigers November 1 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays Nolan Ryan Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ernie Banks Jackie Robinson Sandy Koufax September 20 in baseball Hank Aaron Alex Rodriguez Tris Speaker Baseball scorekeeping June 11 in baseball Baseball statistics First baseman Los Angeles Dodgers 1919 World Series June 13 in baseball Kansas City Chiefs Bill Mazeroski Miguel Tejada Cap Anson Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Cincinnati Reds Carlton Fisk Miami Dolphins Joe Morgan Babe Ruth World Series Interference (baseball) Vin Scully Volleyball November 4 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Baltimore Orioles No-hitter Tony Kubek Carolina Panthers New York Yankees Nellie Fox Texas Rangers (baseball) Third baseman November 2 in baseball Luke Appling Babe Ruth's Called Shot Roberto Alomar Reggie Jackson Ty Cobb Troy Glaus November 3 in baseball Negro league baseball Leo Durocher Satchel Paige Edgar Renter__a Lou Boudreau Oakland Athletics Andr__s Galarraga October 12 in baseball October 7 in baseball October 1 in baseball Scott Podsednik

does anyone hate barry bonds like me this guy should be kick out of baseball the homerun list follws hank aaron babe ruth willie mays sammy sosa ken griffey jr frank robinson and so on i forgot screw sammy sosa cork back crude piece it would be harmon killebrew instead wow you really sound like you hate bonds i guess maybe it s one of those steroid tests administered by mlb that bonds failed what date was that again ummmm hold on i m thinking i m thinking oh wait i just remembered bonds has never tested positive for steroid use i guess the only thing you can base your hate on is your emotions your suspicions your broken crystal ball your utilization of the george w bush system of logical reasoning a lot of kool aid drinking here what makes you put hank on a pedestal above barry i love hank don t get me wrong but he has used amphetamines he s admitted to using greenies see his book i had a hammer bonds has used amphetamines too and like hank bonds has never failed a test for steroids administered by mlb so why all the barry bashing meg while you think bonds used steroids says it all for you it doesn t prove anything the only thing that separates bonds and aaron are a couple of decades and personalities could it simply be that you guys hate bonds because of what he isn t perhaps because he doesn t shuck and jive for the media maybe because he s had a horrible personality for much of his career he s definitely not the media magnet of say clemens wrapped up in the balco investigation or mcgwire in his heyday but clemens is okay suspicions are not enough for anyone to cast doubt on him but it s enough for barry could it be that barry bonds a black baseball player under suspicion of steroid use is just not as marketable to america as clemens a white pitcher whom everyone forgets is said to have used steroids could it possibly be you guys hate barry because american sports media told you to barry has never been kind to them or maybe you hate him because bud selig wants you to i mean mlb really has lost face for its encouragement of the drug culture of baseball over the last sixty years so what would you do if you were selig i would declare war on steroids but that s not enough you have to have a villain for a war i borrowed this notion from you guessed it the george w bush system of logical reasoning every great leader which selig fancies himself needs their arch nemesis their saddam hussein so for selig that s bonds bonds will be the fall guy the guy that mlb leaves out in the rain the guy that will take the criticism and judgment of the masses so mlb won t have to i mean aside from being emotionally charged after watching sports center and knocking back a bud light have any of you even contemplated why you hate bonds or would even be moved to use such a strong word as hate i m curious to know bonds is just one baseball player among many who live in the culture of american baseball the culture that mlb fashioned over the decades suspicions or not suspicions aside from having a horrible personality what s he done to you to deserve your hate where s the proof  Sammy Sosa Baseball World Series Boston Red Sox Bud Selig Babe Ruth Major League Baseball All-Star Game New York Yankees Major League Baseball television contracts Major League Baseball titles streaks Reggie Jackson Baltimore Orioles Negro league baseball St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs San Francisco Giants Rafael Palmeiro Ken Griffey, Jr. Ty Cobb October 4 in baseball Friends Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 MLB on FOX EastEnders September 6 in baseball Pete Rose Alex Rodriguez Detroit Tigers ESPN25 Atlanta Braves Satchel Paige Lou Gehrig Manny Ram__rez The Sporting News Player of the Year Award Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Toronto Blue Jays 2005 World Series Montr__al Expos Baseball Stars Oakland Athletics September 20 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers One Tree Hill (TV series) Wrigley Field Tris Speaker Milwaukee Brewers The Jim Rome Show Sin City New York Mets Hulk Hogan Roger Clemens Knots Landing Washington Nationals Batting order (baseball) July 2004 in sports Babe Ruth's Called Shot 1990s Hank Greenberg October 3 in baseball Theory of conduct Pedro Mart__nez Ben Johnson (athlete) San Diego Padres Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Roger Maris South Park Jackie Robinson Willie Mays Shaggy dog story Muhammad Ali Cincinnati Reds Plame affair Red Sox Nation Montreal Canadiens Pittsburgh Steelers Eric Cartman Andr__s Galarraga 1960s Gary Sheffield Vin Scully Nolan Ryan Seattle Mariners Troy Glaus 2003 Invasion of Iraq

the yankees hate 'em or love 'em and why i was just at the toronto blue jays vs the new york yankees game in toronto i was curious to see so many yankee fans but what even intrigued me more was the turnout of fans wearing red sox and mets uniforms now i came to this game to root against the yankees being a red sox fan but i did not expect so many other fans in toronto to come just to root against the yankees and not for the blue jays i know that toronto is fairly close to new york so i guess the yankee fan turnout is understandable but what were so many yankee haters doing in the stadium today my real question is what is the reason for you yankee extremists to hate on or root for the yankees there was no way that all of the yankee fans came from new york and certainly all the yankee haters did not come a long way either i love the yankees they are my favorite team it boggles my mind to think that people who are not fans on the opposing team would still travel to root against the yankees i don't like the red sox but there's no way that i would go to an orioles red sox game to root against the red sox why would i want to i can't quite figure out the thought processes of mets and red sox fans described in your question so they hate the yankees is it worth it to waste your time and money coming to root against them even though your team is not playing i can't answer your question about yankee haters traveling to root against the yankees because i don't know why people would be so angry and full of hate after all it's just a game i can say that most of the yankee fans do come from new york in my area alone there are many buses that offer transportation to toronto every time the yankees play when combined with yankee fans who drive to toronto there are thousands right there many come from canada too the yankees are like the dallas cowboys they have fans everywhere along with people who hate them i'm a yankee fan because i'm from northern new york and was raised in a family of yankee fans though for some unknown reason i have a cousin who roots for the mets and it is in my blood yankee fans are always accused of jumping on the bandwagon or for being fairweather fans but that is not the case  World Series New York Mets New York Yankees Reggie Jackson Interleague play October 4 in baseball Chicago White Sox Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics Red Sox Nation Babe Ruth Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2004 American League Championship Series St. Louis Cardinals Philadelphia Phillies Major League Baseball television contracts October 16 in baseball International League Cleveland Indians Cincinnati Reds Curse of the Bambino October 1 in baseball Houston Astros Detroit Tigers Alex Rodriguez Pedro Mart__nez No-hitter San Francisco Giants October 21 in baseball 2005 World Series September 2005 in sports Toronto Maple Leafs Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry American League Texas Rangers (baseball) Florida Marlins September 20 in baseball John Olerud October 13 in baseball New York Giants Baltimore Orioles Manny Ram__rez October 15 in baseball Chicago Cubs Who's your daddy?

what do u think about soriano's injury i am a huge soriano fan i've liked him since he first came up in he is a very exciting player and it's horrible for both him and the cubs he got off to a slow start but was really turning it on his loss is huge for the cubs considering they were one of the hottest teams in baseball they may find someone to fill in but they won't find anyone to replace his enthusiasm production and energy it hurt just to see him pull up running to third base that was nasty  2003 World Series Chicago White Sox Chicago Cubs Seattle Mariners Alex Rodriguez Boston Red Sox Sammy Sosa Texas Rangers (baseball) World Series Toronto Blue Jays Detroit Tigers Babe Ruth Baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball All-Star Game November 1 in baseball Cap Anson Wrigley Field Pittsburgh Pirates Andre Dawson July 2004 in sports Mois__s Alou St. Louis Cardinals Newcastle United F.C.

why does everyone assume that babe ruth and hank aaron were clean nobody tested them they could have been heavy into speed or something else that could have helped them the babe certainly does not seem above breaking the rules not sure about hank i just find it funny that everyone assumes that these guys were clean and bonds is dirty yet neither one can be proved just to clarify my question i am not trying to rationize or justify barry being dirty and by clean i do not mean clean from steroids i meant clean from anything that would be considered dirty today such as the speed i mentioned amphetimines have been around a long long time i was just curious if i am the only one that sometimes thinks hmmm how do we know those guys were totally clean not standing up for barry a rod is going to break the new record anyway within years so barry's record will be gone then anyway but will anyone claim that a rod is dirty because he slept with some dirty girls lol actually you're thinking is right on track in hank aaron's book he admitted to using greenies amphetamines at one point in his career to break out of a slump he doesnt insinuate that he used them for an extended length of time just long enough to break the slump these guys that are saying that steroids weren't around or weren't mainstream until the ' s give me a break steroids were around in the 's they were used by the russian weight lifting team just because they didnt sell them at the grocery store doesnt mean that hank aaron or others from that era didnt take advantage of them dont forget they were designed for athletes if olympians could get them then baseball players would definetely be able to get them just because the public didnt know doesnt mean that baseball players werent using them look at these designer steroids that are out now those werent mainstream until the grand jury testimony was leaked  Barry Bonds Home run Hank Aaron Babe Ruth History of baseball in the United States Major League Baseball Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Rafael Palmeiro Mark McGwire Jos__ Canseco Hank Greenberg Nolan Ryan World Series Lou Gehrig September 20 in baseball Rickey Henderson Ben Johnson (athlete) Ty Cobb Joe DiMaggio EastEnders Tris Speaker Baseball Stars Alex Rodriguez Jimmie Foxx Sammy Sosa Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Atlanta Braves Oakland Athletics Jason Giambi Toronto Blue Jays San Francisco Giants Minor league baseball Grunge music Sandy Koufax Major League Baseball titles streaks Gary Sheffield October 22 in baseball December 2004 in sports Top 500 home run hitters of all time Robin Ventura Designated hitter Bj__rn Borg W.

baseball fielding question if a catcher catches strike from a pitcher does the catcher get a putout yes the catcher certainly gets a putout it is the catchers responsibility to hold on to the third strike and if the catcher drops the ball and the batter reaches first then the strikeout is recorded for stats but no out is recorded because the catcher failed to make the putout to get the batter out if the catcher was to drop the third strike then the first baseman gets the putout because he catches the ball and puts the already struck out batter officially out  Baseball Baseball statistics Softball Baseball scorekeeping Strikeout Catcher Stolen base Pitcher Sandy Koufax First baseman Rich Gedman 2004 World Series Baseball positions 1957 World Series Interference (baseball) Baserunning Out (baseball) Babe Ruth Box score (baseball) Pedro Mart__nez Strike zone Randy Johnson Perfect game Origins of baseball Baseball Stars Knuckleball Roger Clemens 2004 American League Championship Series October 14 in baseball Ty Cobb World Series Baseball glove Pete Rose Satchel Paige Tim Wakefield Bunt September 22 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Squeeze play (baseball) Ted Kluszewski Hank Aaron November 3 in baseball Kickball St. Louis Cardinals 1919 World Series Robin Ventura Reggie Jackson Greg Maddux Steve Yeager Barry Bonds June 2 in baseball Appeal play Batting average 2003 World Series Ken Harrelson Second baseman Toronto Blue Jays June 14 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Balk Wes Ferrell Alexander Cartwright Moe Berg Baseball slang Carlton Fisk Boston Red Sox Knickerbocker Rules Babe Ruth's Called Shot Detroit Tigers New York Mets Home run No-hitter Craig Biggio October 12 in baseball Johnny Roseboro Infield fly Chicago Cubs October 4 in baseball Willie Mays Wilbert Robinson October 27 in baseball Bo Diaz November 2 in baseball San Diego Padres History of baseball in the United States Gabby Hartnett Curveball Tag 2005 World Series Dodgeball New York Yankees Bob Feller Oakland Athletics October 13 in baseball October 2 in baseball November 4 in baseball

did you know that more pitchers have been busted under mlb's steroid's substance abuse policy than hitters also it is the same with the minor league policy i really think that hitters get all the attention for no reason people seem to overlook and brush this fact under the rug i find it very comical well it's a fact and many sports outlets talk about this fact there are tests to prove this fact however there are few tests to prove some hitters that are under suspicion like i said it's laughable it's fine though that people want to continue to be ignorant i am aware that hitters juice but people want to be ignorant to facts the fact is that pitchers cheat at a higher rate than hitters and you only hear about the big name guys for the most part if you aren't a big follower of baseball you wouldn't know that the pitcher who gave up bonds' th hr failed a test in the minor leagues and was suspended under the minor league drug policy according to the link below of the major leaguers suspended for steroids from present have been pitchers in the minors more than half of those suspended have been pitchers of makes you wonder why nobody is questioning guys like roger clemens randy johnson david wells etc  Roger Clemens New York Yankees Barry Bonds Toronto Blue Jays Randy Johnson Boston Red Sox World Series Baseball Batting average History of baseball in the United States Chicago White Sox Minor league baseball Houston Astros Sammy Sosa No-hitter Babe Ruth Home run Bud Selig Designated hitter Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals Satchel Paige June 2004 in sports Mark McGwire Major League Baseball All-Star Game Pete Rose Negro league baseball Hank Aaron Sandy Koufax Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ben Johnson (athlete) Major League Baseball television contracts November 1 in baseball New York Mets Pitcher David Wells 1919 World Series October 20 in baseball Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers San Diego Padres Strikeout Jos__ Canseco Baltimore Orioles Strike zone Ty Cobb Starting pitcher International League Red Sox Nation Cincinnati Reds Lou Gehrig Salary cap Hideo Nomo American League Darryl Strawberry November 4 in baseball Mike Schmidt Baseball Stars Perfect game Pedro Mart__nez 2004 World Series Matt Lawton Mexican League Andr__s Galarraga Baseball statistics Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) September 20 in baseball Milwaukee Brewers Curt Schilling Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Reggie Jackson Bobby Abreu Jason Giambi 2003 World Series Volleyball November 3 in baseball Nolan Ryan Miguel Tejada Carlos Beltr__n July 2004 in sports October 27 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Alex Rodriguez 1986 World Series October 22 in baseball Plame affair Wes Ferrell Los Angeles Dodgers October 16 in baseball Switch hitter October 2005 in sports October 19 in baseball David Ortiz

do you truly believe that tom glavine may just well be the last pitcher to win games no absolutely not it'll be a while maybe at least years or so but i don't see why it won't happen again i mean glavine himself is a shining example of why it could people say five man rotations spelled the end of the game winner guess what glavine pitched his entire career in a man rotation occasionally he'd pitch games in a season but starts is not all that out of line for the league leaders these days people also say that pitchers not going longer in games reduces the number of decisions they get which if true is only marginal the percentage of decisions by starters on the average today is the same as it was in but again it doesn't affect glavine as much as he's never been a inning type guy he's cracked exactly three times in his career which top players in the league can do even these days bronson arroyo did last year and it was only a few years ago that roy halladay did and randy johnson did regularly glavine's never been one to go particularly deep into games either he averaged over innings a start exactly twice in his career i mean this is ridiculous people say he's the last game winner because no one else is on the immediate horizon but these things come in waves do you know how many players won games between and a span of years three will come again not in a good long while but it'll come again  Toronto Blue Jays Greg Maddux Tom Glavine John Smoltz World Series Roger Clemens Baseball statistics Randy Johnson Starting pitcher Pitcher Baseball International League Pedro Mart__nez Tris Speaker October 5 in baseball Sandy Koufax Nolan Ryan 300 win club 2004 American League Championship Series Atlanta Braves Batting average 2005 World Series Seattle Mariners Hank Aaron Boston Red Sox Satchel Paige Chicago White Sox Oakland Athletics No-hitter Complete game 2004 World Series Win (baseball) Detroit Tigers 1991 National League Championship Series October 10 in baseball October 16 in baseball 2003 World Series Houston Astros Andr__s Galarraga Ty Cobb Los Angeles Dodgers Jim Palmer October 22 in baseball 1903 World Series 1987 World Series Firpo Marberry Jamie Moyer Bronson Arroyo Cy Young Grover Cleveland Alexander San Diego Padres Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim St. Louis Cardinals Softball Ichiro Suzuki Mariano Rivera Art Nehf Alex Rodriguez New York Mets 1919 World Series Ted Williams Wilbur Wood Dennis Eckersley Major League Baseball All-Star Game Florida Marlins Reggie Jackson October 1 in baseball Milt Pappas Babe Ruth October 28 in baseball 2005 English cricket season Red Sox Nation Don Newcombe Sammy Sosa Robin Ventura 2001 World Series Luis Tiant October 4 in baseball Bob Friend New York Yankees Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Manny Ram__rez Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Pete Rose David Wells National Football League October 21 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Ravi Shastri Yao Ming Strikeout Willie Hern__ndez Marius Russo Claude Osteen

should dh's be held to a different standard among hof voters first i will admit my bias i can't stand the dh but i will be open minded in reviewing answers to my question should guys who are dh for most of their career e martinez baines f thomas ortiz have their offensive numbers be held to a higher standard when considered for the hof remember these guys do not play or contribute to half of the game also out of the five tools they are minus in two categories defense and arm and are usually poor in a third base running i am not saying a long time dh should not make the hall but i do think they must be held to a higher standard even at the expense of traditional benchmarks like hits and home runs and i am not talking about a mike piazza who finishes his career as a dh interested in your feedback most cogent answer gets points h charles your point is well taken about the defensive liabilities of some pre dh hall of famers and some other guys may have been able to prolong their career a k a mike piazza and add to the their offensive numbers certainly but not to a huge extent dhs contribute much less to the game and don't have to have all the requisite skills to play in the field that certainly removes a significant portion of the voting criteria since fielding is eliminated however there are several mitigating factors that lessen the negative impact of a career dh first the hall values offense more than defense particularly in the more recent era the barometers used to determine qualification are primarily offensive career homers batting average hits rbis etc while defense isn't discounted today it is much harder to quantify and therefore by its nature factored in to a lesser extent to appreciate d one has to spend a signifiant amount of time watching the player play second there are many hofplayers who did play in the field but had no business being there these guys would have been dhs had they been around but the position didn't exist guys like mccovey and killebrew were defensive liabilities much of their careers whose offense won the day dhs shouldn't be penalized any more than they were third there is a weaker argument that the dh is a specific postition and players should be judged soley by their merit at a particular position just as you would require less offensive production from a catcher than a right fielder for hall purposes you can require less defensive production from dhs after all we don't discount al pitchers because they never have to hit  Baseball Softball Baseball statistics Robin Ventura Hank Aaron 1957 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Batting average Willie Mays New York Yankees Seattle Mariners Chicago White Sox Boston Red Sox Ty Cobb David Ortiz Tris Speaker Barry Bonds Los Angeles Dodgers Home run Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Babe Ruth World Series New York Mets Andr__s Galarraga Sandy Koufax San Francisco Giants Fielding (cricket) Baseball Hall of Fame Taxation in the United States Carl Yastrzemski International League Paintball 2004 American League Championship Series Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 October 16 in baseball Nolan Ryan Volleyball Baseball Stars Baseball scorekeeping Oakland Athletics Insurance Gary Sheffield October 26 in baseball Cincinnati Bengals Microeconomics Ted Williams Extreme Programming New York Giants Batting (cricket) October 22 in baseball Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Designated hitter Poker jargon Pedro Mart__nez Blackjack Dave Kingman ELO rating system Cleveland Indians Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson Sammy Sosa Alex Rodriguez October 4 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Wealth Babe Ruth's Called Shot Batting order (baseball) Rickey Henderson American football Cricket Atlanta Braves Laws of cricket Derek Jeter Single Transferable Vote Mike Schmidt Florida Marlins Tommy Lasorda Frank Howard (baseball player) St. Louis Rams Billiards Troy Glaus Nuclear power English cricket team Sabermetrics Major League Baseball 1919 World Series National Football League

bad bat i bought the easton stealth it is inch ounce bat and i weigh and am about five foot four maybe i use this bat and it barely makes the ball go far at all it just makes it pop up shallow or ground out i know it isnt me because i used a different bat a demarini i think and it goes way far what is wrong with my bat and can i fix it its the blue regular stealth if that helps not composite i dont play softball and it is the bat popping it up because i tried a different bat and was ripping i cannot go to an old bat it's my first year with a big barrel and dont have it could be cracked how old is it bats have a life expectancy so they do wear out but if the bat is less then a year old i would try getting in touch with easton and telling them that there is something wrong and there is a good chance they will give you a new one but you don't know if you don't try if it is older then you will need to buy a new one  Softball Laws of cricket Fast bowling Baseball 1957 World Series Baseball Stars Baseball statistics Tris Speaker 2005 ICC Trophy Batting average RuneScape quests Batting (cricket) Poker jargon Table tennis Cricket Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Fielding (cricket) W.

all pitchers seem to leave the rubber well before they release the ball what is the rule on this and who monitors if they are even touching the rubber think they can get away with it i think none of the umpires can see if from where they are standing pitchers don't stand on the rubber they leave the foot of their push off leg pressed against it hence why it looks like they aren't on it they are only required to be in contact with it of course some might cheat a little but for the most part that wedge of rubber helps them push off so they use it if a pitcher were to overtly be off of it he'd be called on it interestingly in part of the th century pitchers were required to be in contact with the rubber with both feet honestly the th century stats should be considered the dinosaur days of baseball and the stats from there while they count should be separated from the th century come to think of it the st century stats should be kept separate from the th century there will always be the all time list  Baseball Softball Tennis Pitcher Baseball Stars Umpire (cricket) Balk Home run Interference (baseball) Baseball statistics Baseball field Barry Bonds Appeal play Perfect game Laws of cricket Pitcher's mound First baseman Out (baseball) Cricket Volleyball No ball Field hockey Stolen base St. Louis Cardinals Basketball Aerial (dance move) Major League Baseball Hank Aaron Leg before wicket Kickball Babe Ruth Hit by pitch 1957 World Series Table tennis No-hitter Umpire (baseball) Vin Scully Extra (cricket) Chicago White Sox Infield fly Nolan Ryan BASEketball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Four square Glossary of partner dance terms Tris Speaker 1981 World Series Angel Stadium of Anaheim Starting pitcher 1975 World Series Box score (baseball) Tag Contract bridge World Series Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Blitzball 2004 World Series American football Curling Lou Gehrig Fenway Park Ty Cobb Origins of baseball Swingout Rugby union 2005 World Series October 29 in baseball Canadian football Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Sandy Koufax Bunt Shoeless Joe Jackson San Francisco Giants Golf club (equipment) Snooker Wes Ferrell Boxing June 8 in baseball Water polo Earned run average Breaststroke Australian rules football 1986 World Series Mike Scioscia Baseball scorekeeping Satchel Paige Rolling-element bearing Chicago Cubs Reggie Jackson Wrigley Field Football (soccer) Yankee Stadium Negro league baseball Baseball slang Tackle (football) Snap (American football) Atlanta Braves Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005

how do the umps no if it is a stike i know the mask has something to do with it but im not sure the strike zone extends from the hollow of the knee bottom of the knee to the the upper limit of which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants usually the bottom of the letters the strike zone does not have an upper limit which includes the shoulders the strike zone shall be determined from the batter's stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball determining a strike much less a strike zone is a very hard job the toughest thing an umpire does in baseball for sure it's a lot of work to do so you have to have great spacial perceptions and abilities you need to create a virtual strike zone over home plate and determine if the ball hits any part of that zone if so it's a strike if not it's a ball unless the batter swings of course umpires also need to watch for check swings batters getting hit by pitches and a foul ball that hits the batter immediately the toughest strike to call is a pitch that may or may not have hit the outside corner at the knees since when working out of the slot an umpire's head will be around the inside corner or so and determining the strike zone's limits on the outside from here is a tough job to do the inside corner pitch is an easier call because of this as well but if the ball has movement curve slurve change cut fb slider knuckler etc it's even harder to judge working behind the plate requires a lot of concentration and while you're doing it your mind is racing heart is racing everything's happening at a million miles a minute  Strike zone Fast bowling Umpire (baseball) St. Louis Cardinals 1957 World Series Equine conformation Babe Ruth Interference (baseball) 2004 World Series Hit by pitch Baseball scorekeeping Batting (cricket) 2004 American League Championship Series Water polo Baseball Stars 1986 National League Championship Series Chicago White Sox 2005 World Series Golf Laws of cricket Tennis Sandy Koufax Barry Bonds First baseman Fielding (cricket) Umpire (cricket) Jerry Coleman Cricket Ice hockey Perfect game Home run Wrigley Field Ty Cobb Baseball slang Rounders Knuckleball Curveball Professional wrestling throws Catcher Satchel Paige Tris Speaker Strikeout Chair Snooker Leg before wicket Professional wrestling holds 1986 World Series Field hockey Glossary of American football Baseball field Boxing Dead-ball era Box score (baseball) Glossary of climbing terms 2003 World Series Pedro Mart__nez Stolen base Fenway Park Mixed martial arts Batting average Chicago Cubs Vin Scully No-hitter Out (baseball) 2001 World Series Alex Rodriguez Doug Eddings Polo Grounds San Francisco Giants Boston Red Sox Rugby union Baseball bat 1919 World Series Billiards Glossary of partner dance terms Swingout Intentional base on balls World Series Hank Aaron Don Denkinger Professional wrestling aerial techniques Lawn mower Stairway Australian rules football Major League Baseball

highschool baseball vs highschool softball i am a high school softball player going into my junior year and i've been playing varsity since my freshman year we are better than my school's baseball team who has their own fair amount of district champs and semi finalists only we have more and we have state championship titles our last one in ' we have the most appearances at the final four than any other school in the state of maryland so this proves that we are as good if not better than the baseball teams then why are we forced to wear rubber or plastic spikes on our cleats while the baseball players are allowed to wear metal in metal cleats you get soooooo much more traction when running and in rubber and you're playing the outfield and it's wet you slip so much easier that if you were in metal does anyone else think that this is total crap i just wanted to add i understand the whole face mask issue and have no problem with it because i have seen someone and have been nailed in the head with a pitch in which my face mask prevented it from breaking my nose softball pitching is thrown at an upward angle and we have riseballs which baseball doesn't and we're closer to the pitcher so i have no problem with face masks because baseball is simply more popular then softball the high school probably cares more about the baseball team than the softball team yes it is unfair but that's life i think you should write a letter to you're school or district to explain why you think the cleats are unfair  Baseball statistics International League Pitcher St. Louis Cardinals Detroit Tigers Oakland Athletics Major League Baseball Tris Speaker Dice Seattle Mariners Reggie Jackson Toronto Blue Jays San Francisco Giants World Series Babe Ruth 1957 World Series Chicago White Sox Laws of cricket Fielding (cricket) 2004 World Series Baseball cap Sandy Koufax Baseball bat Volleyball Playoff Baltimore Orioles Hank Aaron Fast bowling Starting pitcher Boston Red Sox Stolen base Golf Georgia Institute of Technology Cincinnati Bengals Houston Astros Montr__al Expos Cincinnati Reds Table tennis Professional wrestling match types Satchel Paige Curling Mike Piazza Violin Batting average Lacrosse 2005 World Series San Diego Padres 2004 College World Series National Football League No-hitter 1919 World Series Horseshoe Origins of baseball Kirk Gibson Rounders Ty Cobb 1981 baseball strike November 2 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series Atlanta Braves Arizona State University Hit by pitch Washington Nationals Baseball Stars Home run Major League Baseball All-Star Game Pittsburgh Pirates Ice hockey Jennie Finch New York Mets Pete Rose Knickerbocker Rules Welding October 14 in baseball October 16 in baseball Walter Johnson Gramophone record John Smoltz Dave Concepci__n University of Arizona Interference (baseball) American football Dick Williams Derek Jeter October 20 in baseball Paintball Harmonica Texas A&M University

how to play baseball how do i play baseball by myself its really hot here in kentucky right now so both of my parents wont play baseball with me and i need to practice everyday if i want to get good enough i play nd base i throw the ball up and swing and hit it but then i have to go chasing after it which is stupid and draining if you do that a lot so does anyone have any effective ideas on how to play baseball by yourself without buying anything cause i'm broke thanks cant drive no batting cages anywhere near me closest one is over an hour away you're a second baseman so this is a good and inexpensive drill for you take a tennis ball and throw it hard against a small flight of stairs one that has maybe or steps like you would find going up to a front door do this many times this drill will help your fielding out a lot because you need to have fast reflexes for this drill because the ball can bounce off the stairs in any direction whether it's a pop fly line drive or quick grounder  Fast bowling Baseball 2004 World Series Batting (cricket) Table tennis Volleyball Baseball statistics Babe Ruth Tris Speaker Baseball positions Sandy Koufax Andr__s Galarraga Home run Fielding (cricket) 2004 American League Championship Series Chicago White Sox Hank Aaron Laws of cricket St. Louis Cardinals 1957 World Series Vin Scully Bunt Baseball scorekeeping Reggie Jackson Ichiro Suzuki Aerial (dance move) Tennis Happy Tree Friends San Diego Padres Batting average Stolen base Detroit Tigers Baseball Stars Satchel Paige Worms weapons and tools Marching band Rounders Cricket Second baseman 1986 National League Championship Series Hit by pitch Matt Stairs No ball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Interference (baseball) No-hitter Pete Rose Tag Lou Gehrig Origins of baseball Baserunning Knuckleball Unassisted triple play World Series Baseball bat Trapping Brian Close Glossary of American football Rickey Henderson New York Yankees Jerry Coleman Mike Schmidt Fenway Park History of baseball in the United States Piccolo Junior Saga The Legend of Zelda series enemies Paintball Gary Sheffield Wrigley Field Four square Floppy disk Cincinnati Reds Ted Radcliffe Lance Berkman Box score (baseball) Barry Bonds Dodgeball Swing bowling Batsman October 8 in baseball Yorker Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) American football Professional wrestling throws October 4 in baseball 2005 World Series History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Tony Gwynn Super Bowl XXI Bowling strategy (cricket) San Francisco Giants Cricket ball New York Mets

how often does a pitcher in an mlb game have an at bat before he throws the first pitch this question only applies under national league rules and would only apply to a pitcher on the visitors team of course though it is conceivably possible for a home pitcher other than the starting pitcher to bat before he pitches i think what you're getting at is why doesn't the visiting team begin the game with a position player listed as the hitter in the lineup just in case they bat around you would have a better hitter up rather than the pitcher the thing is this batting around in the st inning may only happen once or twice a year it would not be worth burning a position player every game for the rare occurance that he might hit in the st  Baseball Baseball statistics Pitcher Designated hitter Major League Baseball All-Star Game Batting average 1919 World Series No-hitter World Series Sammy Sosa Softball Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox 1957 World Series Box score (baseball) 2005 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Stolen base Hank Aaron Home run Starting pitcher Tris Speaker New York Yankees New York Mets Barry Bonds Baseball Stars Major League Baseball Pete Rose Manny Ram__rez Andr__s Galarraga Roger Clemens Nolan Ryan Don Newcombe Randy Johnson October 16 in baseball Earned run average Babe Ruth Sandy Koufax San Diego Padres St. Louis Cardinals 2004 World Series Houston Astros 1981 World Series Reggie Jackson Sabermetrics October 4 in baseball Alex Rodriguez Pedro Mart__nez Atlanta Braves Detroit Tigers Ichiro Suzuki Luis Tiant Dave Concepci__n October 3 in baseball Lou Gehrig Early Wynn Batting order (baseball) November 4 in baseball International League Chicago White Sox Satchel Paige Washington Nationals Ty Cobb David Ortiz 1986 World Series Derek Jeter November 3 in baseball Seattle Mariners Robin Ventura Edgar Renter__a Chicago Cubs 1983 World Series Interference (baseball) 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds Bo Diaz Mariano Rivera Julio Franco October 22 in baseball Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Volleyball Cricket Negro league baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) MLB designated hitter statistics 1975 World Series October 21 in baseball 1903 World Series Ted Williams Switch hitter October 26 in baseball Bunt Los Angeles Dodgers

hitting styles linear or rotational linear style of hitting was the old way but rotational is the new the difference having to do with a number of things the main one in my opinion being that in linear hitting you have a little more weight on your front foot and when you finish your swing your back leg is straight almost a lunging effect in rotational you sit back on the ball all your weight on your back leg and when you swing your back leg is driving into the ball now my question is that which do you think is better since both obviously worth since linear hitting was the style for people like ty cobb babe ruth and other older baseball players but rotational is the style used by barry bonds a rod david ortiz etc rotational is better with the evolution of the game you slowly come to realize that hitters get bigger and stronger but pitchers get better early era pitchers rested predominantly on a fastball change up and on occasion a breaking ball unfortunatley they didn't have the best of stuff at the time their breaking pitches weren't refined and ended up hanging more often then not in turn you could get all you weight on you front leg because with a hung pitch its a good way to get to it before it breaks extremely late namely just before the catchers glove now with breaking pitches being an early learned tool the pitches are more devastating and more difficult to hit in turn you need to learn to hit back in your stance to deliver appropriate power keep the ball in your stance and drive with authority one of the better early rotational hitters was hank aaron and you can see the success he had  Ty Cobb Sandy Koufax World Series Home run Hank Aaron Pitcher Tris Speaker St. Louis Cardinals Toronto Blue Jays Batting average Nolan Ryan Barry Bonds 2004 World Series Boston Red Sox Softball 1957 World Series Stolen base Fast bowling Reggie Jackson Baseball statistics Volleyball October 22 in baseball Perfect game History of baseball in the United States New York Yankees 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds Pedro Mart__nez Boxing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 October 16 in baseball David Ortiz Randy Johnson Alex Rodriguez Greg Maddux Designated hitter Baseball Stars October 4 in baseball September 20 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Chicago White Sox Skateboarding trick Curveball Detroit Tigers Knuckleball San Francisco Giants New York Mets Manny Ram__rez Ichiro Suzuki 1919 World Series Hal Trosky San Diego Padres Chicago Cubs Wes Ferrell Batting (cricket) Baseball scorekeeping Swingout 2003 World Series Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Babe Ruth's Called Shot Starting pitcher Los Angeles Dodgers Cricket No-hitter June 12 in baseball Yankee Stadium Ted Radcliffe Al Leiter Sammy Sosa Aerial (dance move) Wrigley Field Gary Sheffield Jimmie Foxx First baseman Laws of cricket Bunt Professional wrestling attacks Batting order (baseball) David Cone October 20 in baseball English cricket team Ted Williams Dead-ball era Mark McGwire Equine conformation Catcher Ken Griffey, Jr. Seattle Mariners Negro league baseball Fielding (cricket) Origins of baseball

what is the proof of barry bonds cheating and using steriods i just started following barry bonds as he neared the new homerun record about a month ago and heard about all this speculation of him cheating and using steriods information on this barry is currently under investigation so the evidence that has been collected to this point is being kept secret it won't be made public until charges are filed or mlb decides to take action he did appear before a grand jury and admitted to taking two products that were steroids but claimed others lied to him by saying he was told they were something else his testimony was supposed to be secret too but someone leaked it to sf chronicle reporters the two links from ummfada will pretty much get you up to speed on the issue especially if you read several of the other sfgate articles too balco the company developing and selling the products was busted and put out of business five or six other major league ballplayers testified they got their steroids through barry barry got them from life long friend greg anderson who pleaded guilty to drug dealing charges greg is now rotting in prison refusing to testify ps the analogy of the guy traveling across country is fair at this point we can see something is not right and someone if not telling the truth  Barry Bonds Plame affair Plame affair timeline 2005 trial of Michael Jackson W.

how does one boycott barry by attending giants games i heard about a bunch of idiots wearing boycott barry t shirts at the giants v dodgers series in los angeles recently and though i'm into people protesting and all that good stuff if they want the whole thing is rightfully very contriversial that particular slogan only works if you're not going to the games it's also not just people buying the shirts and going to the games it was the head of the company so does he they not know what a boycott is am i missing something actually it is simply the choice of slogans that i have a problem with the fire millen people i actually am completely with that is an attempt to make some sort of a noticable statement it is hurt by the fact that they paid for the tickets but i completely get the train of thought my only issue is to wear a shirt that says boycott barry and do the exact opposite of it certainly express yourself but that is just nonsensical at least the fire millen guys didn't have boycott the lions signs and shirts they are actually supporting a team they care about and making a statement bonds totally emo actually all jokes aside he kind of is he's definately moody self centered and dark this is the first i have heard about it since i don't know the particulars i am only guessing one way this group could protest would be to show up at the game in their bb t shirts and then all leave at the same time like in the middle of the game the detroit lions had a similar group fire matt millen sadly for lions fans millen still has a job it might seem like a waste of time by the idiots because they already paid for their tickets still if there are enough of them it does send a message of sorts to bud and mlb because potentially it can be embarrassing the problem is that not enough idiots are willing to shell out the jack and then leave early btw barry bonds is soooo emo dude  San Francisco Giants Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Los Angeles Dodgers Pittsburgh Steelers Oakland Athletics Major League Baseball television contracts World Series Cleveland Browns New England Patriots American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Barry Bonds Los Angeles Clippers Babe Ruth Boston Red Sox Family Guy New York Giants Married... with Children Detroit Lions Los Angeles Kings Vin Scully Satchel Paige History of baseball in the United States Houston Astros Opie and Anthony New Orleans Saints Beavis and Butt-head Willie Mays Shit Rugby union positions New York Mets Detroit Tigers The Amazing Race Cincinnati Bengals Oakland Raiders Torquay United F.C.

why don't fans or baseball execs care more about badly defined strike zones the rulebooks clearly state the strike zone limits but many umpires neglect this in favor their own little zone i'm just wondering why this doesn't bother fans more and why anyone except sandy alderson seems to care in the mlb offices i can't imagine umpires arbitrarily calling balls fair or foul or runners safe or out so why an arbitrary strike zone i know you can argue that fair foul and safe out are more clearly defined but the strike zone too is quite clearly defined in the rules so why isn't this more of an issue the different strike zones that umpires have has bothered me for years it really irritates me to hear an umpire refer to it as my strike zone i don't always agree with joe morgan but i did when he said it's not your strike zone you need to have the same strike zone as defined in the rule book the rule book says that the strike zone comes to the top of the letters but it is rarely called however pitches that are sometimes several inches off the plate are called strikes remember eric gregg in the nlcs where livan hernandez was throwing strikes a foot outside what's worse today's umpires particularly the younger ones are very confrontational players or managers can't question them not to mention argue without the umpire getting in their face and being thrown out of the game young pitchers are squeezed and even veterans who depend on location struggle for the first couple of innings as they try to see what the home plate umpire will give them simply going by the strike zone as defined in the rule book would make it more fair for both the pitcher and hitter i think a consistent strike zone should be more of an issue umpires need to understand that the fans are not there to see them interfere or to have an effect on the game i know that umpires are only human and make mistakes but the strike zone should not be up for debate they should not have their own individual strike zones as for sandy alderson his going to san diego was a loss for mlb when he was in charge of the umpires he made sure that they were made aware of their mistakes they were sent footage of their calls so they could avoid the same mistakes in the future now that he is no longer working in the mlb front office it's been a huge loss as long as these arrogant confrontational umpires are allowed to keep using their strike zones these problems will persist  2005 World Series 1957 World Series Strike zone World Series St. Louis Cardinals Interference (baseball) Cricket Detroit Tigers 2004 American League Championship Series Pitcher Barry Bonds Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball Umpire (baseball) Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants Houston Astros Perfect game No-hitter Sandy Koufax Satchel Paige 1919 World Series Home run Major League Baseball television contracts Laws of cricket 1986 National League Championship Series 1986 World Series October 14 in baseball Reggie Jackson Don Denkinger New York Yankees Major League Baseball All-Star Game 2003 World Series Jerry Coleman Baseball Stars Wrigley Field Sammy Sosa Vin Scully Box score (baseball) Volleyball Cincinnati Reds San Diego Padres Pete Rose Nolan Ryan Tris Speaker Ty Cobb Batting average Roger Clemens Stolen base Basketball Oakland Athletics New York Mets October 20 in baseball October 19 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez October 12 in baseball History of baseball in the United States October 10 in baseball American football Hank Aaron Baseball scorekeeping Atlanta Braves Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) 2005 National League Championship Series Out (baseball) Fenway Park November 3 in baseball 2001 World Series MLB on NBC Appeal play Sydney Riot of 1879 Ted Williams First baseman October 16 in baseball October 4 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Dodgers Football (soccer) 1903 World Series Baserunning Knuckleball 1984 World Series June 8 in baseball Baseball slang October 15 in baseball Shoeless Joe Jackson Baseball field Bunt 1983 World Series

did a rod take steroids i think so i think he took them he gained so much more muscle and even though he had lost some weight he had some fat last year easy he burned some off and replaced some with muscle i mean when in texas they thought maybe also have u noticed that most people hate a rod that play the game with him also did you notice that every time he gets hit he freaks out an charges the mound another sign of steroids is mood swing oyu tell me what you think no i do not think that a rod took steroids you're not even backing your argument with reasonable evidence you can accuse every single player in the mlb for taking steroids but unless you can support that claim i won't listen to you a rod did burn some fat he only has a small percentage of body fat now due to the fact that he has been working out more as i heard of course that cannot be proven but it's a start most people that play with a rod don't hate a rod the toronto blue jays sure don't like him though he doesn't freak out every time he gets hit and charges at the mound he got hit one or two days ago but no confrontation between him and the pitcher occured the only reason he walked to josh towers on the mound is because he knew the reason towers had hit him and towers said something to him at first if you saw the replay that was closely following a rod's face a rod didn't just charge at the plate he was at first and towers yelled something at him so a rod confronted him there are a lot of people out there who accuse perfectly clean players of taking steroids just because they are good i don't mean to say that i think that a rod definitely didn't take steroids but there's not a great chance of it if that's all you have to back that claim up  Toronto Blue Jays Detroit Tigers Baseball Baseball statistics Babe Ruth Major League Baseball 1919 World Series St. Louis Cardinals Satchel Paige Tris Speaker Weight training Boston Red Sox Piccolo Junior Saga Pete Rose 1957 World Series Barry Bonds Major League Baseball television contracts 2005 World Series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of baseball in the United States San Francisco Giants Oakland Athletics Mark McGwire Pitcher Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) The Jim Rome Show Hank Aaron Equine conformation Doom enemies Los Angeles Dodgers Nolan Ryan Sin City Paul Is Dead Pedro Mart__nez Atkins Nutritional Approach Ty Cobb Chicago White Sox Florida Marlins Ben Johnson (athlete) Robin Ventura Matt Hardy Blackjack Androgen insensitivity syndrome October 20 in baseball New York Mets 2004 World Series Ron and Fez Time Out of Mind Troy Glaus Perfect game Jos__ Canseco Toronto Raptors Batting average 1993 World Series Softball M16 (rifle) Reggie Jackson Interference (baseball) Sammy Sosa Big Brother (USA TV series) Insulin October 5 in baseball Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Babe Ruth's Called Shot The Apprentice 2 Norway national football team 2004 American League Championship Series John Olerud Anabolic steroid Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Interleague play Ted Williams Avenue Q 2003 World Series Dieting Buffalo Bills Tower of Druaga Curt Schilling Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

so how come bonds was kinda in a slump for awhile he couldn't seem to hit the record breaking one for awhile then he's has or so since just luck or what players do go in slumps even the best ones he also had a ton of pressure on him which probably didn't help him he was probably trying to hit a homerun everytime up when a batter tries to hit a homerun instead of just letting it happen he will usually just end up making an out now all the pressure is off of him so he is probably more relaxed at the point  Home run Andr__s Galarraga Baseball Stars Toronto Blue Jays Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Troy Glaus Mois__s Alou Chicago White Sox Sammy Sosa Grover Cleveland Alexander Boston Red Sox San Francisco Giants Bobby Grich New York Yankees Jos__ Canseco Hal Trosky Willie Mays Joe DiMaggio Reggie Jackson Ken Harrelson Barry Bonds Kent Hrbek Joe Adcock Satchel Paige Florida Marlins 1957 World Series Don Drysdale Janet Jackson Babe Ruth Brian Close Softball Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) History of baseball in the United States St. Louis Cardinals Doyle Alexander Dave Henderson Tris Speaker Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Grandview, U.S.A.

why isn't roger maris in the hall of fame roger only played years in the league from but his season where he hit hr's to break the babe's record should've put him in on that achievement alone and come on people this was long before steroids even existed in sports he finished his short career with hits hr's rbi's and career my logic is if they let the scooter in phil rizzuto you have to let rog in i believe his number is retired by the yankees and he has a monument in centerfield http www baseball reference com m marisro shtml first off thomas that was probably the stupidest comment i have ever heard relating to roger's hair loss to possible steroid use are you an serious or just crazy watch the movie called it clearly showed how the stress of the home run chase made him lose hair which can happen buy a clue dude that was so idiotic chipmaker first off rose does deserve to be in the hall he's served years already and has come clean and if i want to start another thread regarding it i will this is a free country bigjohnb says rizzuto got in because he was a yankee so was roger maris for the love of christ he played his best years in ny i can't believe some of these comments roger has a monument in center field at yankee stadium read a book once in awhile read wikipedia com get a clue know your history and facts before posting the hall of fame is supposed to house the great players of baseball roger maris is one of them besides being a smart ballplayer and a time mvp he held the record in sport for longer than anyone else he has as many years as sandy koufax and jackie robinson so time in service isn't the issue the issue is that the writers are in love with large numbers they have lost the feel for the game that the hall requires alone all by itself is reason enough for his inclusion but his world series mvp at the end of his career for st louis should have sealed the deal it's a shame that greatness takes a back seat to longevity alone  Reggie Jackson World Series Boston Red Sox Lou Gehrig Phil Rizzuto Los Angeles Dodgers Toronto Blue Jays Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth Seattle Mariners Tris Speaker Sandy Koufax San Francisco Giants Baseball Hank Greenberg Ty Cobb Atlanta Braves Chicago Cubs Baltimore Orioles Major League Baseball Rickey Henderson Major League Baseball television contracts Detroit Tigers Pete Rose Home run Mickey Mantle Alex Rodriguez Nolan Ryan Milwaukee Brewers 1957 World Series Yankee Stadium Barry Bonds Kansas City Chiefs Cincinnati Reds History of baseball in the United States Troy Glaus Philadelphia Phillies Willie Mays October 26 in baseball Oakland Athletics San Diego Padres November 3 in baseball October 27 in baseball October 22 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Cleveland Indians Roger Clemens Texas Rangers (baseball) Don Mattingly Cincinnati Bengals Red Sox Nation NBA Finals Joe DiMaggio October 16 in baseball 2003 World Series Ted Williams Florida Marlins October 20 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Pittsburgh Steelers Manny Ram__rez October 21 in baseball October 5 in baseball October 4 in baseball 2005 World Series Vin Scully Casey Stengel International League No-hitter Negro league baseball Baseball statistics Ted Radcliffe 2001 World Series Rogers Hornsby Polo Grounds 2004 American League Championship Series September 20 in baseball Robin Ventura Jackie Robinson October 19 in baseball Miguel Tejada October 14 in baseball Branch Rickey Jim Rice Curse of the Bambino Sports timeline 2004 World Series David Ortiz Dixie Walker October 7 in baseball

hall of fame criteria i see a lot of posts on this site about current players' so called hof numbers are the voters going to be smart enough to to adjust the current numbers for induction obviously homers isn't what it used to be are half the current players going to get into the hof or is baseball going to go to a of how you did against your competition as a basis any ideas on how to fix this numbers mess i say they go back and look at what percentage got in back in the day if it is then only the top of today's players get in of course they have to have leeway for defense and clutch performances and stuff like that you don't want to leave an ozzie smith out because of lack of offensive numbers it's not just homers it's ba and rbi that are inflated in the modern game too whether or not a player gets into the hof is a subjective process while numbers are taken into consideration having certain numbers alone will not get you into the hof even in the last ballot mark mcgwire who has more than hrs was denied entry and by a lot of course this was due primarily to the fact that after his clam job in front of congress most people believe he did steroids entry into the hall is based on how great a player the writers think you are and although people think that the writers are biased there are enough of them voting to offset that bias besides i'd rather have borderline worthy people get left out than unworthy players get in which is why they revamped the veteran's committee  Baseball Hall of Fame Hank Aaron Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Jim Rice Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Chicago White Sox Barry Bonds Oakland Athletics Home run Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Detroit Tigers Mark McGwire Major League Baseball Robin Ventura 1957 World Series Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1947 Andr__s Galarraga Lou Gehrig Seattle Mariners November 3 in baseball Ty Cobb Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2004 Volleyball Boston Red Sox Carolina Panthers Carl Yastrzemski Dave Concepci__n Ozzie Smith Inflation Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1948 Jason Giambi Willie Mays Sammy Sosa Florida Marlins Gary Sheffield Tennis U.S. presidential election, 2000 Albert Pujols National Football League Philadelphia Phillies U.S. Electoral College Houston Astros Troy Glaus Rickey Henderson Pete Rose Jos__ Canseco Miami Dolphins Buffalo Bills Cincinnati Reds David Ortiz Major League Baseball All-Star Game San Diego Padres Mike Schmidt Dave Kingman Ed Delahanty Toronto Raptors Single Transferable Vote Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1949 Babe Ruth October 4 in baseball Joe Morgan New York Mets Bobby Abreu Chicago Cubs ELO rating system Los Angeles Dodgers Bowl Championship Series Unemployment November 1 in baseball Alex Rodriguez American football Tennessee State Constitution Election Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1942 Alan Trammell Ted Williams Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams 1919 World Series Citizens Bank Park Supply and demand George Brett (baseball) Ra (board game) Jack Buck World Series Hal Trosky 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939 Scott Podsednik 2005 World Series Lip Pike Softball

mlb schedule can some one tell me how do mlb teams play games over a month period how many times a week or month would they have to play to fulfill this schedule because games over months seems a little more complicated than an game month schedule in the nba or a game month schedule in the nfl i'm not so sure but i think the reason mlb teams have so many games is baseball is not as physically demanding ad football or basketball no offense to baseball players i think it works out to games over days baseball players work a very hard year as spring training begins in february and many players participate in winter leagues throughout the world as well as tournaments a baseball player will arrive at the ballpark between hours pregame and stay an hour after travel days sometimes bring players into town at odd hours combined with obligations such as signing after games public appearances and media sessions all star break provides most players their only relief hats off to those who participate they are the true fan favorites  Major League Baseball National Football League Playoff Baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game International League Major League Baseball television contracts National Basketball Association 2004-05 NHL lockout Toronto Blue Jays American Football League Minor league baseball Home team Playoff format Exhibition game Salary cap NBA Finals Baseball statistics Las Vegas metropolitan area Los Angeles Clippers Interleague play Negro league baseball Deion Sanders Japanese baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Hank Aaron Willie Mays Norway national football team Texas Rangers (baseball) Super Bowl XXXVI EA Sports Ichiro Suzuki Sudden death Lou Gehrig Babe Ruth Pittsburgh Pirates Milwaukee Brewers American football Andr__s Galarraga Satchel Paige Sports timeline Wrigley Field Jackie Robinson McAfee Coliseum Women's National Basketball Association Arizona State University Ty Cobb San Francisco Giants Chicago Cubs Michael Jordan Detroit Tigers Wild card New York Yankees MLB on FOX Ultimate (sport) New York Giants Jim Thorpe Basketball January 2005 in sports Georgia Institute of Technology World Baseball Classic Seattle Mariners Atlanta Braves Yao Ming Major professional sports league Continental Basketball Association National Hockey League All-Star Game Florida State University 2001 World Series Chicago White Sox 1994 baseball strike College basketball Canadian Football League Oakland Athletics MLB on NBC 1919 World Series Alex Rodriguez Cinergy Field University of Houston World Football League San Diego Padres History of baseball in the United States Mois__s Alou Reserve clause Barry Bonds Darryl Strawberry 2005 World Series Sandy Koufax

what is it that barry bonds did wrong recently um didnt he do something else no hmm okay lol ah steroids that makes more sense lol in what way was he rude to the media he grew up with a dim view of the media from listening to his father complain about it all the time as a result barry doesn't trust anyone in the media and his bias view has led not surprisingly to a life long disrespect for them and what they do barry doomed the relationship from the start another aspect is barry's real personality he's never been a team player even in college at asu his own teammates when asked by the manager tried to vote him off the squad in the pros he quickly earned a bad rep as a whiner self centered arrogant and generally surly just like his father what other guy is gonna want to hang around with him then he coveted the attention other ball players were getting and decided to use drugs to turn himself into a hr hitter so add in the steroids he becomes an even better hitter and boosts his power hits most hr in a season and career he tells the manager when he plays and when he doesn't this makes the situation worse inflating his ego and minimizing the contributions of his teammates his team isn't even trying to win ball games any more barry knows deep down he used steroids and doesn't feel good about himself he ignores everything negative and hears only the applause he doesn't deal with reality in a meaningful way when the pressure is on and he needs to reach deep down to grab hold of himself there's only the heart of a hater and a cheat that's why he chokes why he has always choked under pressure his post season numbers are terrible he batted about during the last month of the hr chase and now that the pressure is off he is hitting again he has never won a world series ring and his chances are not good because it takes a team and other star players are not willing to be on the same club with him i know you specifically asked what he did wrong recently and the honest answer is that every day with bonds is a bad day it is tragic since the guy had some god given talent and chose to go through life bitter and angry then made it worse by taking drugs you've probably heard a thousand times how our lives are shaped by the choices we make it's true here are bonds' numbers before during and after steroids ba hr bb sb per season ba hr bb sb now ba hr bb sb the reason barry gets walked so often is not that pitchers fear him it is because it makes sense to pitch around him since his teammates are not good enough to score him from first base  Babe Ruth Baseball Baseball statistics Ty Cobb Batting average 1957 World Series Sammy Sosa Reggie Jackson Hank Aaron World Series Tris Speaker Pete Rose Home run Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox Volleyball History of baseball in the United States Troy Glaus Satchel Paige 1919 World Series 2005 World Series Ted Williams Mark McGwire 2004 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates International League One Tree Hill (TV series) Lou Gehrig Rickey Henderson Softball Manny Ram__rez Ben Johnson (athlete) Baseball Stars Brian Close New York Yankees Gary Sheffield Hulk Hogan The Joker's Wild Pedro Mart__nez Laws of cricket Detroit Tigers October 4 in baseball Alex Ferguson Mike Schmidt History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Norway national football team San Francisco Giants Newcastle United F.C.

why does mlb allow their umpires to get and stay so damn fat do we really need another john mcsherry situation to happen for those of you who don't know who john mcsherry was he was a former mlb ump who was an ump for like years and around years ago he was working homeplate on opening day in cincinnati and like seconds into the game he basically fell right onto his face and died from a massive heart attack they said he was close to pounds how about that fat ass bruce froehming he has been an ump for like years and is retiring this year good riddance why aren't there weight standards that these guys have to adhere too in hockey the linesmen and refs are in shape granted they are skating the entire game burning off calories same with nhl refs running and nba refs running burning off calories but with baseball these guys are very stationary the whole game standing there etc i bet with all the star hotels they stay at on the road they eat lobster steak and drink beers every night whatever the reason it's not good for them to be fat like eric gregg who died last year of a stroke he was a black ump for like years and was huge come one guys put down the philly cheese steaks put down the hamburgers their has to be a way for them to become thinner fit is always better than fat mlb just really lets these guys pack the pounds on and i guess the umps union doesn't care about them it is very unhealthy especially in the dog days of summer like right now in a lot of the east coast states south and mid west like plus percent humidity and they wear black which attracts the sun and makes them even hotter and the homeplate guy must be even hotter with the mask and the equiptment i'm surprised that more of these fat umps aren't passing out on the field and having heart attacks strokes during the game like mcsherry mlb doesn't want that to happen again that was a very sad day for baseball stonewall jackson i'm just making an observation what is your deal don't you agree they are huge being fat is unhealthy duh good question maybe they let them stay fat because they want there to appear to be a presence behind the plate players may be more apt to mouth off if it was some puny runt making calls  Baseball Major League Baseball television contracts World Series Houston Astros Major League Baseball 1919 World Series Softball Pete Rose Umpire (baseball) Hot dog 2004-05 NHL lockout MLB on FOX Hamburger Poker jargon Theory of conduct Cincinnati Bengals ESPN25 Salary cap Jackass: The Movie Atkins Nutritional Approach NBA Finals Boston Red Sox Satchel Paige Combine (Half-Life 2) Sports timeline Reggie Jackson June 2004 in sports Playoff Kyle Broflovski St. Louis Cardinals Social rule Toronto Blue Jays Chicago Cubs Obesity Negro league baseball Teen Girl Squad Laws of cricket Oakland Athletics Barry Bonds International League November 2004 in sports Vin Scully National Football League August 2005 in sports Baseball Hall of Fame Milk Babe Ruth Baseball statistics MLB on NBC October 2005 in sports Hank Aaron Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an June 2005 in sports Los Angeles Dodgers Shaggy dog story June 8 in baseball National Hockey League All-Star Game Mercury Atlas 6 January 2005 in sports October 20 in baseball Ron and Fez The Jim Rome Show Al Michaels Equine conformation Cheesesteak Jerry Coleman Stanley Cup New York Knicks Arizona State University Time Out of Mind Cincinnati Reds Game show Michael Jordan Detroit Tigers New York Yankees Billboard Hot 100 Swingout Cuisine of Denmark Super Size Me Internal ballistics Draw poker Little Britain Los Angeles Kings History of baseball in the United States Los Angeles Clippers Babe Ruth's Called Shot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode)

what makes baseball interesting to you for me it is that each stadium is unique in that some favor pitching some the batters and some depend on witch way the wind is blowing i like that fact that there is no uniform field so that it shows true skill by adapting to diffrent palying enverment everything you mentioned and more the fact that the elements play such a large part in the game that the mental game is so important and even the fact that you can see the player's expressions since it is slow enough to make them out baseball is a metaphor for life a lot of waiting around with a few moments of furious action and when it's all said and done we just want to be safe at home  Baseball Softball St. Louis Cardinals Baseball statistics Pitcher Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox Batting average Detroit Tigers Reggie Jackson Minor league baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Seattle Mariners Lou Gehrig Final Fantasy magic New York Mets Wrigley Field Philadelphia Phillies 1919 World Series Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth Baseball scorekeeping Los Angeles Dodgers New York Yankees Interference (baseball) 1957 World Series Washington Nationals Cincinnati Reds Yankee Stadium Squeeze play (baseball) October 20 in baseball Cleveland Indians Houston Astros Bunt San Francisco Giants 2005 World Series Japanese baseball 1986 World Series Box score (baseball) Blackjack Ty Cobb Designated hitter Pedro Mart__nez 2004 American League Championship Series Manny Ram__rez Major League Baseball Baseball slang Montr__al Expos Chicago Cubs Atlanta Braves Jerry Coleman Home run 2004 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Minnesota Twins Satchel Paige Carlton Fisk Willie Mays Umpire (baseball) Baseball Stars Origins of baseball San Diego Padres Andr__s Galarraga Nolan Ryan Stolen base Batting (cricket) Hank Aaron Topps Strikeout Hubert H.

does the career home run record include postseason home runs i assume that it does i also assume that it does not include any exhibition or spring training games but here comes my real question can the single season home run record include postseason home runs i believe babe got his in regular season games marris got his in regular season games and that mcgwire and bonds got their records in the regular season also but suppose someone tied bonds at on the last day of the season and then continued on to the playoffs and world series to get several more would that player be considered the single season home run king or would he remain tied with bonds in the record books or would he get credit for first place but then get an asterisk beside his name indicating that some hrs came in the postseason i figured the single season record would not include post season but thought it was an interesting predicament given the possibility of someone hitting more than in postseason so i asked but some of you are disagreeing on career home runs does that include postseason i would think it does can anyone cite some evidence for their answer no postseason stats are counted separately i have only ever once seen maris credited with home runs in and that was specifically for his one hr in game of the world series and it was a bit jarring reading that i don't remember where it was long ago of course that never stops yankees fans from spouting that the team a true juggernaut went nice multiples of numbers when the season record was which is hard to imagine isn't good enough on its own merit honestly i have never before nor since encountered this sort of add the october games in sort of nonsense  Home run 1957 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Reggie Jackson New York Yankees 2005 World Series Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Dodgers St. Louis Cardinals Babe Ruth Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox Major League Baseball television contracts October 4 in baseball Hank Aaron Barry Bonds Rickey Henderson Derek Jeter Oakland Athletics 1981 World Series October 7 in baseball October 3 in baseball 1981 baseball strike David Ortiz Playoff format October 5 in baseball Pete Rose New York Knicks Baseball Roger Maris Atlanta Braves Troy Glaus Lou Gehrig International League Mark McGwire Alex Rodriguez Pittsburgh Steelers Wrigley Field National Basketball Association Chicago Cubs Cleveland Indians Robin Ventura Red Sox Nation 2001 World Series Curse of the Bambino Houston Astros Don Mattingly Boston Bruins Cincinnati Reds October 9 in baseball Miami Dolphins Cincinnati Bengals New York Giants Mariano Rivera Willie Mays 1987 World Series 2004 World Series Theory of conduct Florida Marlins Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry San Francisco Giants October 16 in baseball Jack Buck Cleveland Browns 1986 National League Championship Series Kansas City Chiefs October 18 in baseball Mario Lemieux Leo Durocher Pedro Mart__nez Tris Speaker Major League Baseball Dave Kingman No-hitter Alan Trammell Wayne Gretzky 1994 baseball strike Seattle Mariners Indiana Pacers Donovan McNabb MLB on NBC Houston Rockets Detroit Tigers 1975 World Series Tino Martinez Dick Williams Manny Ram__rez

baseball tryouts please answer i know im a girl and blah blah but im trying out for rec baseball and then varsity so tryouts aren't until early march but what should i do to prepar in the off season i live in kentucky so going outside in the off season winter is out of the question i play nd base thanks and what do you think ill have to do at tryouts so what should i do to get better at everything hitting ndbaseman etc what do we do at tryouts thanks peace here are some exercises that really helped me back in high school and college and sorry this will be kind of long fielding you will need to have someone to help you a racquetball and a blank wall you stand with your glove ready to take a ground ball your helper stands behind you and throws the racquetball at the wall and you field it as it comes back after the ricochet i chose a racquetball because they are bouncier and can be faster start off at a decent distance like feet away from the wall or where ever it starts to become challenging for you and repeat until it becomes easy then move up a foot once you can get to about or feet without missing any you will be an all star infielder batting you will need a pack of wiffle golf balls some high test fishing line and a broom stick tie one end of the string to a high place and the other to the golf ball what you want is to have the golf ball hanging at about your waste and then just hit it over and over with the broom stick this will increase your hand eye coordination better than anything else i have found i would recommend not hitting a regular baseball with a regular bat for like a week while you re doing this that way when you do it will be like hitting a beach ball with a x running to increase speed you will need a skateboard a blank wall and a backpack hold the skateboard long ways in both hands and stand feet from a wall lean forward until your body is at an angle and the skateboard wheels are on the wall then just do squats this builds the muscles that help you take off from a dead stop to increase difficulty as you adjust increase the angle and put on a back pack with books or weights as far as what to expect from tryouts all schools are different but ill share with you what my tryouts were like my tryouts were spaced over several days with each day devoted to a specific area like hitting running and fielding with hitting they first had us bat against a pitching machine then later on against a live person and had us run it out like it was live fielding they had us take every defensive position and hit to us over and over with only a second or two between they judged us on the amount of balls we fielded and the accuracy and speed of our throws to the target running they had us run from home to first first to second second to third and third to home in spurts and timed each they then made us round the bases at full speed and timed it they made us steal second from first on a live pitcher and catcher they also made us run the perimeter of the entire field so be prepared to do a lot of work during the tryouts  Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Volleyball Cricket Sandy Koufax Laws of cricket Pitcher 1957 World Series 2004 World Series Tris Speaker Andr__s Galarraga Babe Ruth Ty Cobb Fenway Park Fielding (cricket) First baseman Batting (cricket) Glossary of American football World Series Pete Rose Billiards Racquetball New York Giants 2005 English cricket season Internal ballistics Marching band Weight training Equine conformation Canadian football Golf Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Four square Baseball scorekeeping Wrigley Field Archery Squash (sport) Rugby union Aerial (dance move) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory International League 2004 American League Championship Series Swingout GunZ The Duel Baseball positions Barry Bonds 2005 World Series Poker jargon Breaststroke Interference (baseball) Stolen base The Joker's Wild Golf club (equipment) English cricket team Curling Batting average Gary Sheffield Reggie Jackson Polo Grounds Boxing New York Mets Hank Aaron National Football League Willie Mays Rugby union positions Textile manufacturing Dodgeball Baserunning Guilty Gear Professional wrestling throws Motorcycle Chicago White Sox October 4 in baseball Yankee Stadium Professional wrestling holds M16 (rifle) Jeopardy!

michael vick drafted by the rockies so i read on wikipedia that michael vick was drafted by the colorado rockies in the th round of the mlb draft despite not playing baseball since the th grade first of all is this true secondly why would the rockies do this just as a joke i know its the th round by why waste a draft pick for humor yes it is true and it very possibly was more of a publicity stunt then anything else with his athletic abilities vick very possibly could have been a good baseball player but i must strongly disagree with basketball boi for a couple of reasons first of all michael jordan retired from basketball for the first time before he ever set foot on a professional baseball field second jordan was not even a good aa ballplayer and was probably only given his roster spot because of his name and the owner of the bulls also happens to be the owner of the white sox as a thank you for what he had done in his basketball career third and finally baseball is not as easy as it looks hitting a baseball is probably the most difficult skill in any sport to learn it is not a talent that comes simply based on athletic ability baseball is more of a skill sport then simply a matter of being athletic yes athleticism may help speed a strong arm etc are great abilities to have as a baseball player but they are only part of the equation if baseball was so easy that players from other sports could pick it up and play it on the highest level you would see a lot more multi sport athletes out there  Minor league baseball Baseball Michael Jordan Major League Baseball Chicago Bulls Michael Vick Salary cap New York Yankees World Series San Diego Padres Deion Sanders Oakland Athletics Negro league baseball Larry Bird National Football League New York Knicks University of Miami New York Mets Andr__s Galarraga Cleveland Indians Draft (sports) Los Angeles Clippers Chicago White Sox Chicago Cubs Volleyball Ty Cobb New Jersey Nets Reggie Jackson International League Tris Speaker Boston Red Sox Philadelphia Phillies Orlando Magic LeBron James Pete Rose Equine conformation Batting average San Francisco Giants Albert Pujols Robin Ventura Jerry Krause Willie Mays Utah Jazz Lou Gehrig Babe Ruth Manny Ram__rez Tony Gwynn June 8 in baseball Baseball statistics National Basketball Association Alex Rodriguez October 20 in baseball Charles O.

if the orioles were to get one great lefty hitter in the off season who would fit them the best the orioles have been looking around for that one thing that they need to get back into the swing of things which they have been out of for the past years teixeira dunn ichiro anyone dunn is a good power hitter but he strikes out way too much jermaine dye i dont know if he's lefty or not but hes a great hitter nonetheless and has an expiring contract ichiro and teixeira are out of reach just signing new contracts there arent that many big bats out in the open market this season however here are a few players i think that could help the orioles club for the record im not an orioles fan im a diamondbacks fan bj upton from tampa bay he has great hitting power contact ability and is quick plus he may be a good compliment for nick markakis in the outfield hanley ramirez from florida again flashes the speed leather and power that the orioles need to help out tejada even though ramirez playes ss making the switch to b should be no problem where does brian roberts go you ask put him at b and use melvin mora as trade bait for ramirez miguel cabrera from florida big power hitter trade mora for cabrera and maybe throw in a couple minor league prospects for him too would be a nice compliment to tejada in the power department mike piazza fa pick him up off the waiver wire and use him as a dh instead of aubrey huff put huff as permanent b to not lose his bat and use millar as trade bait to also pickup a lf or a great hitting catcher which brings me to my next player brian mccann from atl jarrod saltalamacchia from tex great defensive catcher as well as a power hitter mccanns having a down year after showing promise last season but he should be up next year it'll be mccanns rd year in the league and he'll definitely bloom but saltalamacchia shows a lot of promise as a heralded prospect from atlanta now playing for the rangers he's a rookie this year but there is plenty of room for him to grow too all of these players i think would add a spark theyre all young except for piazza who adds experience as a veteran and show great potential for the future i think that the answer for the orioles isnt to find an immediate fix but plan for the future yes they have been down but theyre having a mediocre year this year and if they bring in any of these talented young players and sign them for a long term deal they will have a pretty good team for a few years  Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox World Series New York Yankees Babe Ruth Florida Marlins Boston Red Sox Manny Ram__rez Baseball November 1 in baseball New York Mets Sammy Sosa Detroit Tigers Alex Rodriguez Ichiro Suzuki Miguel Tejada Minor league baseball Reggie Jackson Pittsburgh Pirates International League Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States New York Giants Gary Sheffield Cleveland Indians Robin Ventura Randy Johnson 2004 World Series Cincinnati Reds Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Washington Nationals Melvin Mora 1957 World Series Baseball statistics Pete Rose Tris Speaker 2004 American League Championship Series October 4 in baseball Batting average St. Louis Cardinals Milwaukee Brewers Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Dodgers October 22 in baseball Barry Bonds November 3 in baseball Atlanta Braves 1919 World Series October 5 in baseball Hideo Nomo Volleyball Sandy Koufax Softball November 4 in baseball Hank Aaron Moe Berg Toronto Raptors October 2005 in sports National Football League Stolen base San Diego Padres Roberto Alomar Boston Bruins New England Patriots October 31 in baseball October 12 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers Detroit Red Wings Lefty Grove Mois__s Alou October 16 in baseball 2005 World Series October 14 in baseball Los Angeles Kings 1981 baseball strike Kansas City Royals Roger Clemens Carlos Beltr__n Dick Williams San Francisco Giants Dixie Walker Montr__al Expos Tampa Bay Buccaneers October 26 in baseball Scott Podsednik

is babe ruth the real home run king im curious compared to his total at bats if my figures are correct babe had abs where as hank had an amazing and bonds haz more than so technically then comparing there ab seems the only logical way to see who hit more in less time ruth had far more than anybody im i correct why do so many disregard this this is an answer of mine to a similar question aaron and bonds each had careers that lasted a similar amount of time to truly answer the question of home run king look at a more compelling set of stats aaron has a career total of homeruns in at bats that is an average of homeruns per at bat bonds at the time of this writing has homeruns in at bats for an average of hr ab ruth however had homeruns in at bats this averages to a whopping hr ab average so aaron and bonds have more career homeruns but it took them mor abs to reach their marks to put this in perspective look at it this way if the babe had as many abs as bonds he would have finished with homeruns and if he had as many abs as aaron he would have had homeruns so i do think it is safe to say that though bonds and aaron were great home run hitters the great bambino was and is still the home run king  Home run Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Barry Bonds Alex Rodriguez Baseball Baseball Stars Boston Red Sox Troy Glaus Ty Cobb Baseball statistics Batting average Andr__s Galarraga Gary Sheffield New York Yankees Curse of the Bambino Top 500 home run hitters of all time Jim Rice Atlanta Braves Reggie Jackson September 20 in baseball World Series Tris Speaker Lou Gehrig Mark McGwire Jimmie Foxx David Ortiz Rudy York 2004 World Series Hal Trosky Manny Ram__rez Rickey Henderson 1957 World Series Mickey Mantle Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Runs created Jos__ Canseco Babe Ruth's Called Shot Nolan Ryan Albert Pujols Rogers Hornsby St. Louis Cardinals Toronto Blue Jays October 22 in baseball Sadaharu Oh Todd Helton Shoeless Joe Jackson Batting order (baseball) Dave Henderson Cincinnati Reds Eddie Mathews Sammy Sosa History of baseball in the United States October 9 in baseball Yankee Stadium October 16 in baseball October 4 in baseball Herbert Sutcliffe September 6 in baseball Ralph Kiner Baltimore Orioles George Brett (baseball) Johnny Mize Perfect game Robin Ventura Major League Baseball titles streaks Ron Gant Mois__s Alou June 12 in baseball Baseball scorekeeping George Sisler Biblical inerrancy Red Sox Nation Willie Mays No-hitter Carl Yastrzemski W.

will it be easy to get in a high school baseball team in high school in oakland california like will tryouts be a breeze what u have to do serious answers only or ill report u getting on a baseball team depends on two things your skill level and the skill level of your competition i e the others trying out based on the tryouts at my high school i can say that they will not be a breeze my tryouts were spaced over several days with each day devoted to a specific area like hitting running and fielding with hitting they first had us bat against a pitching machine then later on against a live person and had us run it out like it was live fielding they had us take every defensive position and hit to us over and over with only a second or two between they judged us on the amount of balls we fielded and the accuracy and speed of our throws to the target running they had us run from home to first first to second second to third and third to home in spurts and timed each they then made us round the bases at full speed and timed it they made us steal second from first on a live pitcher and catcher they also made us run the perimeter of the entire field so be preparred to do a lot of work durring the tryouts also if youre a little rusty with your baseball skills i would recomend spending a few days every week untill tryouts getting back into baseball shape because if your school is anything like mine was competition will be fierce my best tip would be to try and relax and have fun if you stress yourself out at the try outs youll be a lot more stiff than normal and you wont perform as well i now its easier said than done but if you can manage it youll have a leg up on the competition  Baseball Softball Pitcher Baseball statistics Sandy Koufax Batting average Tris Speaker 1957 World Series Detroit Tigers Batting (cricket) Ty Cobb Cincinnati Reds Cricket Fast bowling Chicago White Sox Stolen base New York Mets Baserunning Reggie Jackson Volleyball Box score (baseball) 2004 World Series Baseball Stars San Diego Padres Baseball scorekeeping 1986 World Series Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Boston Red Sox 2005 World Series First baseman New York Yankees October 16 in baseball Babe Ruth Interference (baseball) Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants Minor league baseball October 22 in baseball Barry Bonds October 4 in baseball Pete Rose St. Louis Cardinals October 5 in baseball Gary Sheffield Sabermetrics International League Baseball positions October 14 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez Ted Williams Ichiro Suzuki 1919 World Series Out (baseball) Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth's Called Shot Tag Sammy Sosa Hank Aaron Strike zone Andr__s Galarraga Oakland Athletics Fielding (cricket) Dog agility October 8 in baseball October 27 in baseball Houston Astros Seattle Mariners Robin Ventura October 10 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays History of baseball in the United States October 20 in baseball Bill James Carlton Fisk Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Satchel Paige Laws of cricket Rudy York Paintball National Football League October 12 in baseball Moe Berg Willie Mays Texas Rangers (baseball) Vin Scully October 17 in baseball Marching band Mike Piazza Bunt Major League Baseball All-Star Game Origins of baseball Luke Appling Water polo Bullet Rogan Catcher

what is the history what started it of irrate mlb managers kicking dirt on umpire's shoes it's hysterically funny to see an irrate major league baseball manager going nose to nose with an umpire and then start kicking dirt on his shoes and pants i's enormously entertaining but i just wonder where that tradition started it's an odd thing to do to show your displeasure with a call hell i'd push it back to john mcgraw back when he played for the orioles in the s they only had two umps per game so players could get away with some fairly dirty tactics he carried that with him to his managerial days with the giants he may have picked it up from hanlon while in baltimore but to be honest years ago players and umpire were a lot less classy on the field then todays players fighting with fans umps spitting on umps remember how people were ready to crucify robbie alomar this all went on a lot more in the early days thankfully we have video replay and hold these men to higher standards at least while they are on camera so the worst we get nowadays is a dirt kicking tantrum  Baltimore Orioles San Francisco Giants Babe Ruth Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball Baseball Softball Major League Baseball television contracts World Series Roberto Alomar Sammy Sosa Cincinnati Bengals New York Mets John McGraw (baseball) Minor league baseball Oakland Athletics Boston Red Sox New York Yankees 1957 World Series Umpire (cricket) October 20 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cleveland Indians Australian rules football San Francisco 49ers Field hockey Carolina Panthers Reggie Jackson New York Giants History of baseball in the United States 1994 baseball strike Negro league baseball November 3 in baseball 2005 World Series St. Louis Cardinals International League Philadelphia Phillies Dolphins Stadium Troy Glaus Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers Frank Robinson Nolan Ryan Derek Jeter Seattle Mariners Sandy Koufax American football Pete Rose National Football League Lore Detroit Tigers Home run Interference (baseball) Ty Cobb MLB on NBC Mario No-hitter Casey Stengel Citizens Bank Park Montr__al Expos Laws of cricket Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Essendon Football Club Washington Nationals Skateboarding trick Super Bowl Tris Speaker Baltimore Ravens Luis Aparicio Tony La Russa Pants Rowland Monday Night Football Sydney Riot of 1879 Kevin Keegan Cleveland Browns Rugby union Marching band Andr__s Galarraga Tommy Connolly Cincinnati Reds October 2005 in sports

is baseball going down the tubes does mlb think that you have to score runs a game and have hr hitters to be good they already took away most of the strike zone and the fences are way short and lowered the mound etc now they suspend clemons days for retaliating on plunkings these guys are allowed to crowd the plate way too much these days anyway they should get plunked like the old days hell bob gibson wouldn't be allowed to play at all under these pro offense rules it's disgusting artistic that was one of the best and truest answers i've ever seen on this forum great job i agree with you that the game is more about offense now then it used to be i think that the reason that such an emphasis is put on scoring a ton of runs is that the for the casual fan that is more exciting baseball just like a casual fan of football can't appreciate a people that do not know the game can't appreciate a well played ballgame nowadays we live in an era when most people get there knowledge of the game from tv for a good number of these fans sportscenter and baseball tonight are where they learned the game and what makes the highlights home runs and diving catches you very seldom see a well executed sacrifice bunt or a lightning fast on these shows i think today's fans particularly the younger ones through no fault of their own just simply do not know the game as well as some of us who have a few more years behind us that's not to say that a person in their 's can't be just as knowledgeable about the game as someone in their 's but their appreciation of the game is different i think baseball would be better off helping to educate its' fans rather than dumbing down the sport  Baseball Babe Ruth Softball 1957 World Series World Series Baseball statistics Major League Baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Satchel Paige Batting average Toronto Blue Jays National Football League St. Louis Cardinals New York Giants Boston Red Sox Baseball scorekeeping 1986 National League Championship Series Pete Rose Chicago White Sox Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Dodgers Tris Speaker Ted Williams ESPN Houston Astros 2005 World Series Alex Rodriguez 2004 World Series Volleyball American football International League Robin Ventura Vin Scully Sandy Koufax Barry Bonds St. Louis Rams Fenway Park Willie Mays Dog agility Salary cap 2004 American League Championship Series 1986 World Series 1994 baseball strike Home run Strike zone Cincinnati Bengals Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson 2001 World Series 1993 World Series Cricket History of baseball in the United States San Francisco Giants 2003 World Series Negro league baseball Baseball Stars Nolan Ryan Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Japanese baseball Manny Ram__rez Major League Baseball All-Star Game Playoff Interference (baseball) Australian rules football Wrigley Field Yankee Stadium Stolen base Pittsburgh Steelers Andr__s Galarraga Kirk Gibson Cleveland Browns 1988 World Series Jack Buck Earned run average Designated hitter Pedro Mart__nez Box score (baseball) History of Test cricket (to 1883) Ted Radcliffe Babe Ruth's Called Shot Cleveland Indians MLB on FOX Randy Johnson American football strategy Atlanta Braves Rugby football ESPN25 Hank Aaron Charles O.

steroid use and gambling are the same in any sport especially baseball and let me tell you why if you don't agree tell me why with a well thought out answer the reason why i believe steroid use is analogous to gambling is because they inevitably are the same thing let me explain let's say you're a player or a manager and you call your bookie to place a wager on a mlb game let's say for instance you are betting on a red sox yankee game and you take the over for a dime meaning you are betting dollars on the game and you are taking the over in total runs scored las vegas sets the lines let's say the over under for this particular game is runs that means if the combined total is or more you win ok here is where the argument comes in that steroid use by ballplay players is just as bad as betting on a game especially the over because if some of the red sox players like manny ortiz etc and some of the yankees like giambi rodriguez etc are juicing on steroids they are more apt to hit more home runs and inevitably over inflate the total runs scored in the game and thus creating an over in the runs which allows the manager i e rose or whoever or even a player or fan to win that bet so in essence the steroid use creates a market for people to gamble on games especially taking the over because there will be more power more hits more home runs and in the end higher scoring games salty what are you talking about man you can bet on the over unders in baseball games duh find a bookie they take that action and yes las vegas does set the lines and go there sometime they have a place called the sports book it's legal there to bet on games i have bet many over unders there true the ballplayers are using steroids to help their numbers their stats which inevitably make them more cash especially in contract years yes roids do help you hit more hr's i e the entire juiced ball era from brady andersons luis gonzalez over sammy over mcgwire bonds don't you think all of this scoring helped out with the overs in many games that people bet on yes they did because more runs were scored because of it so players take steroids to help their personal stats but in the end those over inflated stats wind up making a lot of gamblers a lot of money especially if they take the overs do your research laying low vegas sets lines on all games every sport what are you talking about every day you can get a bet in on any sport vegas sets lines for everything you can go to a lot of websites and bet www youwager com is one of them click on view lines everyday and you'll see the over unders and the point spreads money lines whatever they get all this info from vegas that's where the center is that's why there will never be a sports team in any of the major sports in vegas mmmk  Boston Red Sox History of baseball in the United States Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth Baseball Major League Baseball Home run Jos__ Canseco Craps Pete Rose Barry Bonds World Series Mark McGwire 2004 American League Championship Series Detroit Tigers Sammy Sosa St. Louis Cardinals Tris Speaker International League Oakland Athletics Ty Cobb Blackjack Major League Baseball television contracts Poker jargon Satchel Paige Jason Giambi Alex Rodriguez Slot machine Manny Ram__rez Baseball statistics Los Angeles Dodgers Reggie Jackson Toronto Blue Jays Las Vegas metropolitan area Miguel Tejada Red Sox Nation October 4 in baseball Troy Glaus Spread betting David Ortiz ESPN25 Hank Aaron Chicago Cubs 2005 World Series New York Mets September 6 in baseball 1981 baseball strike Seattle Mariners Pedro Mart__nez Baltimore Orioles October 20 in baseball Roulette November 3 in baseball October 22 in baseball 1981 World Series October 12 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) History of Test cricket (to 1883) Curt Schilling October 26 in baseball Cricket Baccarat Bill James Gary Sheffield Cleveland Indians Las Vegas, Nevada Batting average MLB on FOX National Football League Betting (poker) Lou Gehrig October 27 in baseball Salary cap October 16 in baseball Match fixing Rickey Henderson Sabermetrics Atlanta Braves 1975 World Series Baseball Stars October 1 in baseball Super Bowl XXXVIII San Diego Padres Softball Cincinnati Reds Montr__al Expos Brady Anderson July 2004 in sports Jim Rice Derek Jeter

how many base hits can a team get credited with in an inning without scoring any runs and how would it happen very tough rules question first right answer with explanation gets the points ok folks has nothing to do with a man being thrown out at home that would not be a base hit it would be a fieilder's choice good try though a team can get as many as hits in an inning and still not score a run example each of the first batters get singles but are thrown out trying to stretch them into doubles the next batters all hit singles to load the bases the th batter hits a ball that hits one of the runners in fair territory that runner is ruled out but the batter is credited with a hit no run scores  Softball 1957 World Series Baseball statistics Stolen base 2004 American League Championship Series 2004 World Series Baseball scorekeeping Baserunning 2005 World Series Interference (baseball) Box score (baseball) Tris Speaker Perfect game 1986 American League Championship Series No-hitter 1919 World Series Out (baseball) Cricket Knickerbocker Rules 2003 World Series First baseman Batting average Pitcher Alexander Cartwright 2001 World Series BASEketball Origins of baseball Squeeze play (baseball) Babe Ruth 1991 World Series Baseball positions Chicago White Sox Laws of cricket Ken Harrelson Sandy Koufax 1986 World Series Detroit Tigers Rounders American football Lou Gehrig Don Hoak Run (cricket) Intentional base on balls Manny Ram__rez New York Yankees World Series St. Louis Cardinals Volleyball Appeal play Satchel Paige Batting order (baseball) October 16 in baseball Sabermetrics October 7 in baseball Tied Test Hit by pitch Bert Campaneris Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Shoeless Joe Jackson Walk-off home run West Indian cricket team Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Infield fly Ty Cobb October 20 in baseball Hank Aaron Pedro Mart__nez Brian Close October 10 in baseball Fielding (cricket) Andr__s Galarraga 1993 World Series English cricket team Pete Rose October 4 in baseball Boston Red Sox Dead-ball era History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) New York Giants 1987 National League Championship Series Don Denkinger Strike zone Lance Berkman October 12 in baseball October 14 in baseball 1977 American League Championship Series 1986 National League Championship Series Philadelphia Phillies Nolan Ryan Balk Hat-trick Tennis

chipper jones is definitely a lock for the hall of fame don't you agree in seasons so far and at age he has hit hr's hits doubles rbi's and ba plus he's a switch hitter and it always looks good playing your entire career for one team i don't care what people say to disagree with that the writers like that the only knock against him is he has played in the steroid era and thus that might stigmatize him did chipper juice who knows yes i am intrigued by hof questions and i think i can make some good arguments for players who aren't in who should be in i e rice gossage blyleven mattingly etc hey we finally agree i think besides the numbers it again comes down to the fact he was one of the best third baseman in the game for a long period of time and that he played on a consistent winner now let me clarify i think chipper should be a hofer assuming he has another solid year or two but don't know if he is quite a lock yet voters are hard on third baseman and it is too soon to know what type of power numbers players from this era will need for example i no longer think is a magic number and am not convinced jim thome will be a hofer the switch hitter thing is an interesting point and i agree with you that playing your entire career with one team can only help except jim rice i think chipper will be the b from this era to go matt williams didn't do enough and scott rolen of my cardinals great defensive player is already slowing down at age  Jim Rice Don Mattingly Chipper Jones St. Louis Cardinals Robin Ventura 1957 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Ty Cobb Pete Rose Hank Aaron Boston Red Sox Detroit Tigers November 4 in baseball Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson Batting average World Series Sandy Koufax November 3 in baseball Switch hitter Alex Rodriguez Houston Astros Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 San Diego Padres Chicago White Sox Tris Speaker Satchel Paige Baseball statistics Third baseman Nolan Ryan Lance Berkman September 20 in baseball 1919 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Troy Glaus International League October 4 in baseball David Ortiz Cincinnati Bengals Jim Thome October 21 in baseball Designated hitter Edgar Renter__a Roberto Alomar Edgar Martinez Volleyball Mike Schmidt History of baseball in the United States Craig Biggio 1981 baseball strike George Brett (baseball) Manny Ram__rez Al Oliver New York Yankees Seattle Mariners Barry Bonds 1981 World Series Frankie Frisch Major League Baseball Carl Yastrzemski Baseball scorekeeping Ron Gant Cincinnati Reds First baseman November 1 in baseball Jason Giambi Shoeless Joe Jackson Willie Mays October 20 in baseball San Francisco 49ers Ozzie Smith San Francisco Giants Sammy Sosa Pittsburgh Pirates Cap Anson Chicago Cubs Luke Appling Bob Johnson (baseball) Albert Pujols Hal Trosky Oakland Athletics Dave Kingman New York Mets Theory of conduct Los Angeles Dodgers National Football League Mike Piazza October 16 in baseball Rickey Henderson Tennis Rogers Hornsby Eddie Murray Baltimore Orioles

what does it mean in baseball when you go to a game and you see those signs around the ballpark on the field that say no pepper games pepper is a common pre game exercise in baseball where one player bunts brisk ground balls and line drives to a group of fielders who are standing close by the fielders try to make a play on the ball and throw it back as quickly as possible the batter then attempts to hit the return throw and so on some ballparks have banned pepper games because of the danger of balls landing in the stands and injuring spectators some of these stadiums may display a no pepper warning on the edges of the field near the stands pepper can be dangerous as players have gotten hurt before doing it  Baseball Softball Baseball statistics Home run 2004 World Series 1957 World Series Chicago White Sox Wrigley Field Bunt Fenway Park Cricket Tris Speaker Baseball scorekeeping St. Louis Cardinals 2001 World Series Left fielder Fielding (cricket) Laws of cricket Yankee Stadium Volleyball First baseman World Series Philadelphia Phillies Interference (baseball) American football San Francisco Giants Detroit Tigers Baserunning Batting (cricket) History of baseball in the United States Baseball positions 1919 World Series Oakland Athletics Babe Ruth Milwaukee Brewers 2004 American League Championship Series English cricket team Box score (baseball) Boston Red Sox Baseball Stars New York Giants Willie Mays Origins of baseball Frank Howard (baseball player) Chicago Cubs 2005 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Satchel Paige Pedro Mart__nez Major League Baseball Carolina Panthers Out (baseball) Cincinnati Reds Dodgeball Football (soccer) Canadian football Mois__s Alou Glossary of American football Reggie Jackson Baker Bowl Field hockey Cecil Fielder Pitcher Angel Stadium of Anaheim Paintball Lou Gehrig Beanball National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXV Gary Sheffield Kirk Gibson Dodger Stadium Rounders Boundary (cricket) Squeeze play (baseball) Texas Rangers (baseball) Los Angeles Dodgers Pittsburgh Pirates Ted Williams Super Bowl IX Dismissal (cricket) Washington Nationals Major League Baseball All-Star Game

could someone explain to me what the hell happened to the tigers it's basically the same thing that happened last year at a different time they are perhaps the streakiest team in the league meaning when they're hot they can't be beat but if they aren't healthy and on top of their game in every sense its like playing the pirates on a daily basis the good news for them is that they are streaky and at some point hopefully after my yankees play them they will get healthy and find their swagger and their game and reel off about straight wins or win out of games or something ridiculous like that also the indians are a very young team and don't have that big of a lead plus there is so much time left in the season there really is nothing to worry about except the health issues  World Series Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Reds St. Louis Cardinals October 4 in baseball Cleveland Indians Pittsburgh Pirates Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays New York Yankees Tris Speaker Luis Tiant 1957 World Series Reggie Jackson Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2005 World Series Oakland Athletics Pete Rose New York Jets Ty Cobb Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers International League Atlanta Braves October 5 in baseball Seattle Mariners Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Maple Leafs Florida Marlins New York Giants Chicago White Sox October 16 in baseball 2005 English cricket season Chinese Basketball Association Playoff Mario Lemieux Houston Astros Bowl Championship Series New York Mets Satchel Paige Pedro Mart__nez Bob Friend Cleveland Browns October 7 in baseball Richmond Football Club New York Americans Sandy Koufax Hal Trosky Hank Aaron October 13 in baseball Dick Williams Norway national football team San Francisco Giants Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXVII October 3 in baseball Chicago Blackhawks October 17 in baseball 2003 World Series September 20 in baseball Manny Ram__rez Milwaukee Brewers Canterbury Bulldogs San Diego Padres October 25 in baseball October 15 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Los Angeles Dodgers 1925-26 NHL season Rocky Colavito October 10 in baseball Hank Greenberg Chicago Cubs Theory of conduct NBA Finals Minnesota Twins Nolan Ryan Torquay United F.C.

how long do you think bonds will keep his record hank arron kept his for years personally i don't recognize any roider's records a rod who is probably clean of the taint of steroids barring injury will pass bonds in to years possibly as early as but unlikely unless a rod starts taking steroids a rod has one maybe hr seasons left in him griffy if he got healthy and got full seasons in could pass or be in striking distance of bond's mark pujos is on pace to shatter the mark but is at least a decade away a young b just came up who is hitting hrs at the same pace as pujus but likely to surpass pujos his name is ryan braun and in years he will if healthy almost certainly pass bond's mark pretty much anybody else playing today would either need to play into their mid to late s or to take the steroid route like bonds did to catch the current mark though aaron wasn't really a power hitter so a guy like bernie williams but one that can play until he's ish might just be the one who winds up setting the new mark much like aaron did by playing into his mid s the real power hitters of aaron's day were guys like mccovey and schmidt  Hank Aaron Home run Sandy Koufax 1957 World Series Nolan Ryan Alex Rodriguez Gary Sheffield Jim Rice Babe Ruth Robin Ventura World Series History of baseball in the United States San Francisco Giants Roger Clemens St. Louis Cardinals Cleveland Browns Rod Stewart Major League Baseball New York Mets Baseball Volleyball Randy Johnson Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Top 500 home run hitters of all time Pittsburgh Steelers Toronto Blue Jays Ken Griffey, Jr. Ravi Shastri Reggie Jackson Andr__s Galarraga Ty Cobb Leeds United F.C.

when did the all star game become a joke do people really care about it anymore who watches it i don't i did as a kid in the 's not anymore it's a joke especially since like or years ago when bud selig called the game to stop and ended in a tie in extra innings imagine how pissed off the bookies were on that one or the betters who got a push instead of a win i mean i guess there's some meaning behind it in that the winning league gets home field advantage in the world series but i feel that rule is beyond stupid it really doesn't showcase the best players it showcases the most popular players voted in by the fans and it is even more of a joke because a fan can vote for the same player times it's like american idol it's not a singing competition it's a popularity contest by the way do the players get paid for being in the all star game nobody cares except the players in it and the people dumb enough to bet on it my best guess as to when the all star game became a joke was around everyone's th birthday after that it is the teenage years and they know everything so surely they'd know it is a joke as far as how much the players get paid i am sure they don't get squat except for bonuses in individual contracts which of players this year had  Major League Baseball Pete Rose Major League Baseball television contracts Baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Bud Selig World Series American Idol Oakland Athletics 2005 World Series Softball Satchel Paige Montr__al Expos National Football League Football (soccer) Hank Aaron Playoff International League Betting (poker) You Don't Know Jack Scrabble (game show) Boston Red Sox Milwaukee Brewers Chicago White Sox Philadelphia Phillies 1919 World Series 1994 baseball strike Blackjack Vin Scully Yao Ming Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals Table tennis Survivor (TV series) Ice hockey Reggie Jackson Salary cap Derek Jeter FA Cup Game show Fame Academy American football New York Yankees Poker jargon Barry Bonds Winning Streak Hollywood Squares National Hockey League Playoff format Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Topps Extra innings Shaggy dog story October 16 in baseball Contract bridge Fay Vincent Monkey Island Slot machine Texas Rangers (baseball) Craps Toronto Blue Jays Mois__s Alou Jack Buck Washington Nationals Red Sox Nation Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry The Ashes American Football League Takeshi's Castle Cleveland Indians 1957 World Series Password (game) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

why do managers argue why do they come out and argue over a call the ump made but of the time the call stands why are umps so reluctant to change the call there's a lot of reasons managers argue with umpires they argue with the umpire to try and get the call changed this rarely works because umpires are judged evaluated by the commisioner's office and if they reverse calls it looks like they second guess themselves and looks poorly on their decision making managers argue to try and get into the umpire's head to perhaps get a call later in the game if a manager argues with the ump and the ump thinks he made a mistake then perhaps a questionable call later in the game he might give the arguing manager's team benefit of the doubt to try and even things out over the long run doesn't always happen but it's a possibility managers try to fire up their team by getting into an argument a struggling team sees their manager giving his all during the argument and they get fired up themselves to go to battle with their leader who may be ejected  Umpire (baseball) Umpire (cricket) Sydney Riot of 1879 Philosophical skepticism Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Judicial activism Theory of conduct History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Theodicy 1957 World Series The Apprentice 2 Baseball Laws of cricket Test cricket 1919 World Series Reggie Jackson Babe Ruth Don Denkinger Referee Leg before wicket Major League Baseball Tommy Connolly Ontological argument Extreme Programming Appeal Turing test Home run Chicago Cubs Official (American football) David Hume Tennis Workplace democracy Fathers' rights Deconstruction Resurrection of Jesus Sammy Sosa Microeconomics Melbourne Cricket Ground Australian rules football Goodness and value theory Free will Intelligent design Essendon Football Club Union for a Popular Movement Interference (baseball) Heckler & Koch MP5 Ad hominem New Orleans Saints Appeal play Stare decisis Cy Rigler Debate Ty Cobb Grandview, U.S.A.

why is everyone throwing pete rose into the steroid controversy i've seen a lot of people on this board say something like if bonds gets into the hof then pete rose should be allowed in as well i'm not sure if some of you actually realize what the difference is between what bonds is accused of doing and what rose admitted to doing what bonds is accused of doing at the most would land him a game suspension from baseball and that's if and only if he tests positive for steroids otherwise mlb has no grounds so suspend him and at this point there is no just reason to deny him a bid into the hall of fame rose certainly has the numbers to get in but what he did was so bad he didn't get a slap on the wrist and a game suspension he got banned for life not suspended banned gambling on the game is the worst thing you can do as a player coach owner umpire etc it's worse than taking steroids far worse so why is everyone lumping these two together it's two completely separate issues because people here know nothing about what they are talking about you won't hear that on an educated program you are right they are completely irrelevant but people just think they sound smart when they bring up pete rose  Major League Baseball Pete Rose History of baseball in the United States Bud Selig Barry Bonds Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth Ty Cobb San Francisco Giants Rafael Palmeiro Baseball Ben Johnson (athlete) Olympic Games 1919 World Series October 20 in baseball Satchel Paige World Series Sammy Sosa ESPN25 Mike Schmidt Baltimore Orioles The Jim Rome Show Lou Gehrig New York Yankees New York Mets November 3 in baseball Jim Rice August 2005 in sports New York Jets New England Patriots 1957 World Series Bobby Knight 2001 World Series Japanese baseball Bowl Championship Series Boston Red Sox Match fixing New York Knicks November 4 in baseball Jos__ Canseco Reggie Jackson Chicago Cubs Montreal Canadiens The Malice at The Palace Volleyball History of cricket October 29 in baseball Cincinnati Bengals Negro league baseball Arizona State University Los Angeles Clippers National Football League Bob Feller Detroit Tigers Major League Baseball television contracts Mark McGwire Baseball statistics Texas Rangers (baseball) San Francisco 49ers Cincinnati Reds Indiana Pacers November 1 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Carolina Panthers Major League Baseball All-Star Game Chicago Bulls Mahjong Tennis Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XXVII 1994 baseball strike June 2004 in sports Jim Thorpe The Football League December 2004 in sports John McEnroe Umpire (cricket) Stanley Cup October 22 in baseball Ted Williams Salary cap Softball Sydney Riot of 1879 Australian rules football American football Theory of conduct Essendon Football Club 2005 World Series October 5 in baseball One Tree Hill (TV series) Boston Bruins Philadelphia Eagles Washington Nationals Major League Baseball Players Association Backgammon 2004 World Series

minor league transactions in all the years following baseball i've come to realize my understanding of how minor transactions works is lacking so here goes i know optioning a player is when a guy on the man is sent down but i sometimes hear of a player who is out of options and thus can't be sent down or kept on the man how many options are there as far as callups are concerned i think players must be on the man to be called up to the majors correct what does the phrase designated for assignment and how is that different from being outrighted or optioned thanks in advance also how can a team purchase the contract of a player it already owns and pays after three years as a pro a player must be protected on a team's man roster or he is eligible for the rule draft more on that later once he's served those three years and assuming he is added to the man roster his club then has what are called options on him when a player is on the man roster but not on the man major league roster he is on optional assignment one common misconception about the rules is that a player may only be optioned out three times actually each player has three option years and he can be sent up and down as many times as the club chooses within those three seasons when you hear that a player is out of options that means he's been on the man roster during three different seasons beginning with his fourth as a pro and to be sent down again he'll have to clear waivers yes essentially designating for assignment allows a club to open up a roster spot while it figures out what it's going to do with a player there are certain situations in which a team needs a player's permission to either trade him or send him to the minors so rather than force the player to make a quick decision the team can simply designate him for assignment while he decides more commonly a player is designated for assignment so the club can open up his roster spot while they're waiting for him to clear waivers which can take four or five days occasionally a club will designate a player for assignment while they're trying to trade him  Minor league baseball National Football League Major League Baseball Salary cap Oakland Athletics International League Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Seattle Mariners Florida Marlins Playoff Baseball Major professional sports league Reserve clause 2004-05 NHL lockout National Basketball Association Sammy Sosa Chicago White Sox Negro league baseball Los Angeles Clippers Topps Cleveland Indians Contract Betting (poker) American football Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Dodgers New York Yankees New York Islanders American football strategy Toronto Raptors New England Patriots Continental Basketball Association Texas Rangers (baseball) Playoff format Major League Soccer Los Angeles Kings Pete Rose Lou Gehrig San Diego Padres San Francisco Giants Satchel Paige Volleyball Carolina Panthers Chicago Cubs Milwaukee Brewers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim NBA Draft American Football League Draft (sports) Mahjong 1994 baseball strike Poker jargon Cincinnati Reds Indoor football Utah Jazz New York Mets Andr__s Galarraga Kansas City Royals Portland Trail Blazers Option Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Albert Pujols Houston Astros New York Knicks Blackjack Ice hockey Sandy Koufax Atlanta Braves FIFA Series Softball Umpire (baseball) Baseball statistics St. Louis Cardinals Draw poker Manny Ram__rez Contract bridge Arizona Diamondbacks Joe Nuxhall Mexican League History of baseball in the United States Branch Rickey Futures contract New York Giants The Amazing Race Indiana Pacers Norway national football team Plame affair Glossary of American football Stud poker

do you think college baseball should switch to wooden bats isnt it a little dangerous my bad isnt it a little dangerous with aluminum bats is what i meant without question division i baseball should yes there is an expense to it but at the very least wooden composite bats should be used which last much longer than wood and perform closer to wood than aluminum mlb should be behind this as the signing bonuses of these guys gets higher and higher and the biggest unknown is whether or not they can hit with wooden bats as a former college baseball player myself i know plenty of guys personally who signed and got decent to good bonuses who where out of the game or only still in it because of the signing bonus they got but could not hit in the minors because they were not hitting with aluminum i am amazed that in the year i believe div colleges were to use composite or wood which was later changed before the season started but division i players which obviously have the best chance of getting drafted are still using metal bats granted i know some of these guys are playing in wooden bat leagues in the summer but at best they get seen for a few weeks and that is after the draft also if you look at the numbers from those leagues hitting stats are way below season numbers for all those guys  Major League Baseball Baseball Minor league baseball Baseball Stars Baseball statistics Batting average Pete Rose Tony Gwynn Andr__s Galarraga 1981 baseball strike Dave Kingman National Football League Toronto Blue Jays Rickey Henderson Lance Berkman Troy Glaus Brian Roberts 1981 World Series Sammy Sosa Alex Rodriguez Albert Pujols Barry Bonds Babe Ruth Edgar Renter__a Ichiro Suzuki Ernie Banks Steve Yeager Baseball bat Tris Speaker Satchel Paige Robin Ventura Seattle Mariners Scott Podsednik International League 2005 World Series Reggie Jackson Khalil Greene Don Mattingly Darryl Strawberry Lou Gehrig Willie Mays David Ortiz San Diego Padres New York Yankees Hank Aaron Salary cap Cleveland Indians Pittsburgh Pirates World Series Chicago Cubs Milwaukee Brewers Edgar Martinez Boston Red Sox Julio Franco Softball Wheel of Fortune Luis Gonzalez (baseball outfielder) New York Mets Cincinnati Reds Roger Clemens Baltimore Orioles Sandy Koufax Washington Nationals Mark McGwire Major League Baseball All-Star Game Luke Appling 1919 World Series Japanese baseball Playoff Home run Hank Greenberg Dave Concepci__n Ted Williams Los Angeles Dodgers Felipe Alou John Olerud 2004-05 NHL lockout Texas Rangers (baseball) Negro league baseball Kirby Puckett 2005 English cricket season Houston Astros Manny Ram__rez All-Star Baseball Jason Bay Randy Johnson Luis Aparicio Kansas City Royals Derek Jeter Kerry Wood (baseball player) Designated hitter Branch Rickey George Sisler Cricket Carlos Baerga

give me your take on barry bonds' record tainted not tainted there are a lot of people in the steroid era of baseball who take steroids or have taken some kind of hgh how many of those players can you name have hit now homeruns none so lets not figure in the fact that whether he took steroids or not he is a great athlete and nobody else could do the things he can now i am not a fan of bonds at all but you should at least respect the fact that the guy can play baseball he sees the ball well and has great mechanics and a very fast bat speed that allows him to hit home runs if he was taking steroid how do you explain the longevity of his career since steroids tears up your body in the long run hell steroids has been in sports forever and it's just now that people are trying to take action everybody used to turn the other cheek just saying well its only one person and he isn't doing any harm and now because records are being broken it is a huge ordeal i honestly dont care the guy can play baseball and they can put an asterisk at the end of the number if they want but no matter what he is the new home run king  Barry Bonds Home run Babe Ruth Jos__ Canseco Gary Sheffield Mark McGwire St. Louis Cardinals Softball Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays History of baseball in the United States Baseball Stars Rafael Palmeiro Mois__s Alou Ty Cobb Reggie Jackson Cincinnati Reds Jason Giambi Chicago White Sox Lou Gehrig Troy Glaus Rickey Henderson Willie Mays Hank Aaron Ted Williams Alex Rodriguez 1957 World Series Mike Schmidt Baseball statistics New York Yankees New York Mets Satchel Paige Pete Rose Ben Johnson (athlete) Derek Jeter Baseball scorekeeping Tris Speaker Miguel Tejada Batting (cricket) Table tennis Theory of conduct San Francisco Giants Sammy Sosa Human height Seattle Mariners English cricket team Jim Rice ESPN25 Cricket Vince McMahon Pittsburgh Pirates Ken Griffey, Jr. Mickey Mantle Nolan Ryan Laws of cricket November 3 in baseball Manny Ram__rez The Jim Rome Show Jimmie Foxx Indianapolis 500 Hal Trosky Baseball (object) Vin Scully 2004 World Series Oakland Athletics Lenny Dykstra Anabolic steroid Ken Harrelson 1919 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Dualism (philosophy of mind) SBC Park Roger Maris Ichiro Suzuki Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Fast bowling Sports timeline Ernie Banks Mike Greenwell American football Brian Close C__sar Tovar Torii Hunter October 22 in baseball Stolen base Baseball slang Professional wrestling slang Polyamory Detroit Tigers August 2005 in sports Bodybuilding

blown save question a save is only a save when there is a run lead or less if a relief pitcher comes into the th witha run lead give up singles and then a grand slam is it still a blown save no he gets a loss but since it wasn't a save situation when he first entered the game it's not a blown save and also there are other ways to get a save not just the situation you wrote someone else will post it though i'm surely not in the mood to do it since you didn't ask but if a pitcher comes in with the lead and pitches the last three innings without giving up the lead that's another situation  Baseball statistics Save (sport) 2005 World Series Baseball 1957 World Series October 4 in baseball 1919 World Series October 10 in baseball October 13 in baseball Closer (baseball) Pitcher Detroit Tigers 1986 National League Championship Series Pedro Mart__nez Houston Astros Firpo Marberry Mariano Rivera October 15 in baseball International League Toronto Blue Jays Sandy Koufax Roger Clemens Chicago White Sox St. Louis Cardinals Billy Wagner 2004 American League Championship Series October 17 in baseball October 20 in baseball 2003 World Series World Series Grover Cleveland Alexander Win (baseball) Earned run average 2004 World Series John Smoltz October 16 in baseball Vin Scully Starting pitcher Donnie Moore Nolan Ryan October 23 in baseball October 3 in baseball October 21 in baseball Randy Johnson Hank Aaron Satchel Paige 1987 National League Championship Series October 11 in baseball Robin Ventura October 7 in baseball Boston Red Sox October 22 in baseball Atlanta Braves Perfect game October 12 in baseball Dennis Eckersley 2001 World Series Willie Hern__ndez Reggie Jackson Home run 1993 World Series Milt Pappas Cleveland Indians Long Island Ducks October 14 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers No-hitter Tris Speaker 1903 World Series June 10 in baseball October 24 in baseball 1991 World Series October 19 in baseball 1986 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Wrigley Field 1986 American League Championship Series Jim Bagby Barry Bonds San Francisco Giants Chicago Cubs October 26 in baseball Hal Newhouser Eric Gagne September 20 in baseball Baseball scorekeeping Oakland Athletics Byung-Hyun Kim June 11 in baseball Jos__ Mesa Strikeout October 9 in baseball Manny Ram__rez Montr__al Expos Box score (baseball) Red Faber Baseball Stars Babe Ruth

jose reyes or derek jeter i have no idea both amazing shortstops but who would you rather have because both great but reyes is still younger personally i find this question to be a no brainer here's my comparison fielding jeter edges reyes out slightly in range but reyes has a much stronger and accurate arm it's a close tie here but give it a few more years and reyes will have the advantage over the older jeter hitting reyes is a premier lead off hitter i will say with full confidence that he is the best leadoff hitter in the game jeter is a good clutch hitter and can hit for a higher average again this is a close call and all depends on what type of team your building jeter is your contact man while reyes is your leadoff man base running no contest i shouldn't have to go into details about this but i will just because he is the most exciting player on the base paths yes i'm talking about jose reyes twice this season he has lured a pitcher into balking in a run while standing on third base he has steals which leads the mlb and his efforts are insurmountable by any other player his head is always in the game and has a natural knowledge of his surroundsing and whereabouts on the bases sorry jeter you may be a heads up base runner but reyes is the man you want on base intangibles derek jeter offers great team leadership if you need a club house player jeter definitely wins in that category as for reyes he supplies the energy his constant positive attitude in the club house is a great morale booster something every club needs in the intangibles these players are full of pros and little to no cons its a tie here overall i have to go with jose reyes i also forgot to mention his switch hitting capability he is truly a tool player who brings a whole new element to a baseball game he will be the top player in the nl for years to come and is on a path to become a future hall of famer  2004 American League Championship Series Alex Rodriguez Boston Red Sox 1919 World Series New York Yankees 1957 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Pete Rose Manny Ram__rez Toronto Blue Jays World Series 2004 World Series Batting average 2003 World Series San Diego Padres Barry Bonds Shortstop November 1 in baseball Houston Astros Softball Reggie Jackson Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball statistics Tris Speaker Major League Baseball All-Star Game St. Louis Cardinals Hank Aaron Home run Oakland Athletics Lou Gehrig Red Sox Nation Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants Baseball scorekeeping Detroit Tigers Cincinnati Reds Babe Ruth Sandy Koufax New York Giants Stolen base Satchel Paige Seattle Mariners Dave Concepci__n Andr__s Galarraga 2001 World Series Atlanta Braves Edgar Renter__a Nolan Ryan Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry International League Ozzie Smith Robin Ventura Bernie Williams Florida Marlins Volleyball 2005 World Series Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago Cubs Carlos Beltr__n October 4 in baseball New York Mets Ichiro Suzuki Luke Appling Jim Rice History of baseball in the United States Rickey Henderson Batting order (baseball) Baseball Stars Pittsburgh Steelers Designated hitter October 20 in baseball Ty Cobb Cleveland Indians Texas Rangers (baseball) David Ortiz No-hitter Willie Mays Negro league baseball Luis Aparicio Blackjack Troy Glaus Dave Kingman Professional wrestling throws Switch hitter Interference (baseball) Baltimore Orioles Jos__ Canseco Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Mike Schmidt September 20 in baseball Craig Biggio October 31 in baseball Montr__al Expos

will ryan braun keep up his hot hitting should i trade him away dude has to come back to earth sometime i already have atkins and upton as my backups so should i trade away braun or keep him i do kinda need pitching if i do choose to trade away braun what kind of solid second half starting pitcher can i get halladay bedard peavy c yorvit torrealba b prince fielder b b j upton b ryan braun mil b ss jimmy rollins of vladimir guerrero laa of of corey hart mil of of jermaine dye util garrett atkins col b bn barry bonds bn brian roberts bal b bn hunter pence hou of dl pitchers blanton lackey scott baker matt garza brian bannister takashi saito k rod joe nathan kazmir sheets dl short answer ryan braun will come back down to earth but he'll still outperform atkins and upton here's why i'm going to use some sabermetrics to support my argument and show statistically why braun is likely to come down a bit ryan braun's batting average on balls in play babip is this statistic is self explanatory it's batting average removing plays that are home runs or strikeouts since a batter has very little control over where a ball lands a very high batting average on balls in play means that a hitter is getting lucky and he may be getting some extra bloop hits that just miss a fielder's glove or something like that since braun's babip is almost we can assume that he's getting lucky as almost nobody can hit at that high of an average for the rest of the season braun's batting average will drop as a few more of those lucky hits find a fielder's glove braun's home run rate will slow down of the fly balls braun hits end up as home runs the league average rate is about braun is getting lucky with how many of his fly balls end up in the seats and he'll probably hit fewer home runs as his home runs fly ball percentage gets closer to a regular number braun has power but a rate is pretty close to juiced era bonds numbers if this didn't make sense go here and read up on babip http www firejoemorgan com glossary of terms html ryan braun is a great player but he's not quite as great as he looks now he's only played games in the majors and he's been lucky with the way the ball comes off his bat if you choose to get rid of braun you'd love to get peavy but don't undervalue someone like tim lincecum the rookie for the giants puts up a lot of strikeouts  1957 World Series World Series Softball Hank Aaron Babe Ruth 2004 World Series Baseball Stars Chicago White Sox Pedro Mart__nez Barry Bonds Ty Cobb Oakland Athletics 2005 World Series October 4 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Satchel Paige October 2005 in sports Tris Speaker New York Mets Home run Seattle Mariners Nolan Ryan Sabermetrics Baseball scorekeeping New York Yankees St. Louis Cardinals Ted Williams San Francisco Giants Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Lou Gehrig Box score (baseball) Ichiro Suzuki 1919 World Series Fielding (cricket) Sammy Sosa Greg Maddux New York Giants History of baseball in the United States Reggie Jackson 1981 baseball strike Chicago Cubs Willie Mays Pitcher No-hitter Houston Astros Pittsburgh Pirates Detroit Tigers Major League Baseball television contracts October 22 in baseball Strikeout Rickey Henderson October 16 in baseball Cleveland Browns Dead-ball era Gary Sheffield 2003 World Series Randy Johnson Cricket Boston Red Sox Roger Clemens Alex Rodriguez Interference (baseball) Washington Nationals November 1 in baseball Manny Ram__rez Laws of cricket Los Angeles Dodgers Earned run average Don Newcombe Left fielder November 4 in baseball 1987 National League Championship Series Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 2001 World Series Dave Kingman 1986 World Series Designated hitter Cincinnati Bengals October 5 in baseball San Diego Padres International League Don Hoak Shoeless Joe Jackson November 3 in baseball Jeff Bagwell Strike zone All-Star Futures Game

why do some of you think that steroids won't help you hit the ball basically if you are able to increase upper body muscle mass this will in turn make the bat lighter in your hands therefore you will be able to swing this bat quicker that is why they did it so anyone that says steroids has nothing to do with barry's achievement is sadly mistaken barry butt kisser comments please you guys are dumb yes he was a great hitter already and always had the eye hand coordination but the increased upper body strength will allow you to get to balls you might have missed before and allow you to play better on back to back games since steroids are syntihtic horse testosterone again yes he was a great player already we are talking about a competitive edge he gave himself yes steroids did not make him great alone he already was it is the edge the perfromance enhacing advadtage what is it about performance enhancign do uyou not understand theres a bit of a problem here in these answers most of you claiming steroids do not help you hit the ball cite hand eye coordination and anticipation skills which bonds already had its true however in the mlb everyone is required to use wooden bats and generally the weight range on those is between and ounces depending on whether you use a maple or an ash bat so let me explain say you are a relatively skinny guy and have to use a smaller say ounce bat to get around on the ball and still have the strength to change your trajectory mid swing you only have the momentum of a ounce bat probably not a heavy hitter so you go take some steroids now you have the strength to get around on the ball using a ounce bat it is your option as a hitter there to choose either the added power of the ounce bat or use your strength to more effectively move the bat mid swing to catch up slow down with the pitches using your old ounce bat bonds is huge he only uses a ounce bat do the math  Baseball Volleyball Barry Bonds Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Batting (cricket) Laws of cricket Baseball Stars Table tennis Babe Ruth Softball Weight training Cricket Baseball bat Gary Sheffield Baseball statistics History of baseball in the United States 1957 World Series Puberty Billiards Reggie Jackson Mark McGwire Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Snooker Tennis Tris Speaker Golf club (equipment) Sammy Sosa Double bass World Series Equine conformation Anabolic steroid St. Louis Cardinals Andr__s Galarraga Golf Batsman Hank Aaron Wood Rugby union Indian Oil Cup 2005 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ravi Shastri Badminton Fielding (cricket) Designated hitter Mass Squash (sport) Leg before wicket History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Rugby union positions Bodybuilding Mois__s Alou Home run Brian Close Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aerial (dance move) Boston Red Sox History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Ted Williams 2004 World Series Testosterone Blackjack Broomball New York Mets Blood (computer game) Kevin Millar Mike Schmidt Ichiro Suzuki Professional wrestling throws Dualism (philosophy of mind) Swimming Piccolo Junior Saga Pitcher 2005 English cricket season Swing bowling Doom enemies General relativity Ty Cobb Stolen base Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Rounders Shawn Green Major League Baseball 2005 World Series Troy Glaus Lou Gehrig

what exactly do you think got ryne sandberg into the hall of fame we all have heard of the exploits of ryne sandberg during his plus year career but what got him into the hof the main argument about it is that he never was on a world series winning team but there have been dozens od players that have gotten in without ever going to a ws was it his defensive accomplishments straight games without an error of any kind or his awards gold gloves at nd base and straight all star appearences or do you think that the writers had a heart and just let him in for no good reason or was it a combination of things that brought ryno into the hof several factors the ones you mentioned ofr sure his defense was outstanding he has an annual all star and a very good hitter what really got him in though are two factors first it is playing second base historically second basemen are weak offensively save a few exceptions morgan hornsby lopes etc there haven't been that many great power and average hitters at that position ryno was one while he was never a homer guy like davey johnson he did have very good pop and he annually hit secondly it was ryno's performance during the era he played ryno played in the s when offensive numbers were a shadow of where they are today ryno was the best at his position for the majority of his career there really aren't any secondbasemen from the s that can come close to putting up the numbers he did tim raines would have but he moved to of ryno like ripken was ahead of his time he altered the template of the middle infielder from small statured slick fielders with speed but no bat into larger five tool players that could genuinely slug while his numbers as a b may look more pedestrian compared to some of today's studs when ryno played he was one of a kind that factor is crucial for hof voters and why guys like biggio and santo will have trouble getting in best in the game when you played is one of the most siginficant factors voters weigh  Baseball Robin Ventura Chicago Cubs Baseball statistics Batting average Hank Aaron 1957 World Series Davey Lopes 2004 World Series Volleyball Pete Rose Seattle Mariners Baltimore Orioles Roberto Alomar Tris Speaker October 4 in baseball Boston Red Sox Babe Ruth Lou Gehrig Jim Rice Andr__s Galarraga 2005 World Series Cal Ripken, Jr. Softball Craig Biggio Toronto Blue Jays St. Louis Cardinals Dave Concepci__n Third baseman Joe Morgan Second baseman Baseball scorekeeping San Diego Padres Alex Rodriguez Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 San Francisco Giants Pittsburgh Pirates Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Home run New York Yankees Oakland Athletics International League Manny Ram__rez Satchel Paige October 16 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Alan Trammell Willie Mays Troy Glaus Ted Williams World Series New York Mets Cincinnati Reds November 1 in baseball Poker jargon 1919 World Series Ichiro Suzuki Bill Mazeroski Rogers Hornsby Fast bowling Jeff Bagwell Chicago White Sox Bobby Grich Barry Bonds Fielding (cricket) Jackie Robinson Vin Scully Los Angeles Dodgers Gary Sheffield October 31 in baseball Rickey Henderson Reggie Jackson Omar Vizquel Cincinnati Bengals David Ortiz Davey Johnson Interference (baseball) Box score (baseball) Miguel Tejada Steve Nash Jay Bell History of baseball in the United States Lance Berkman Baseball Stars Todd Helton Bob Johnson (baseball) Pittsburgh Steelers Sammy Sosa Mike Schmidt Sabermetrics National Football League

should matt murphy have to pay taxes on barry bonds' homerun ball for the record i think it is crap that he may have to pay taxes on a baseball for its resonable estimate of value the government already charges us tax on everything else isn't that baseball technically worth about a dollar until he sells it imagine this he pays taxes for its value then he sells it and is taxed again on the income just goes to show that its not just fans trying to get in on the action the government wants in on bonds' fame also what are your thoughts just to add something to those of you who think he should be taxed just for having the ball i believe if he sells tax the crap out of him its income and thats fair why tax an item that has no value until it is sold i work in mortgage its not like he can declare it on a loan application as an asset because value is subjective on something like that however he could declare it as income if he sells it and that can go on the application im just saying dont tax or force him to sell the man for being lucky enough to catch that one food for thought i read the article and makes no sense at all how can you put a tax figure on something that isn't sold always have there hand out for any possibility of a dime i heard yesterday that the ball may not even be worth what they were thinking bonds continues to hit home runs people are going to want his last home run ball the all time record ball plus if bonds is found to have done illegal steroids that will significantly drop the value like i said how can you put a figure on something that hasn't sold make no sense and how can that not be against the law he may never sell it why should he pay taxes on it  Taxation in the United States Baseball FairTax Barry Bonds Tax Home run Mortgage Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Softball Microeconomics Babe Ruth Baseball Stars Property tax Municipal bond Flat tax Gross domestic product Annuity Hyperinflation Insurance Major League Baseball Life insurance Tax protester American football Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Glossary of American football Tris Speaker Mutual fund Gold standard Illegal drug trade Boston Red Sox 401(k) Inheritance tax Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Gary Sheffield Craps SCO-Linux controversies Economy of Russia Capital gains tax Satchel Paige Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Citigroup Baseball (object) Government debt Money Security (finance) Baseball scorekeeping Predatory lending Warren Buffett Productive and unproductive labour Topps Jos__ Canseco Surplus value Tennessee State Constitution Baseball statistics Lou Gehrig Treasury security Poker jargon Blackjack Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Public good Mark McGwire Deflation (economics) Mortgage-backed security Personal finance Supply and demand Plame affair Troy Glaus Dale Murphy Income tax Mois__s Alou Income statement Monopoly (game) Government National Mortgage Association Gold as an investment I Want to Hold Your Hand Cincinnati Reds Hank Aaron Tax avoidance/evasion National Insurance Cricket Road pricing Government of Maryland Value added tax Income trust Supply-side economics Tax bracket Wal-Mart Willie Mays Keynesian economics Babe Ruth's Called Shot

who gets the most blame for the steroid fiasco that has overshadowed the great game of baseball this past decade who deserves the biggest slice of blame pie the players and trainers for doing it as long as they could get away with it major league baseball for being asleep or awake and blind at the controls until the poo hit the fan the fans and media for perpetuating the controversy what do you say i think the owners should get a lot of blame for turning their backs on the issue and filling their pockets with money which in turn leads to selig because he was the owner of the brewers so he had to have known about it i don't blame the trainers as much as i blame the player's association and union because they are the most powerful union in sports and could have taken preventative measures to stop all of this but didn't i think mlb has taken such a reactionary response that it's too late to do anything about the people who have already used they're trying to fix a past that has been tainted and not concentrating on the future stopping of drug use as a result the technology in labs like balco are always going to be one step ahead of testing because they're going to be working the next undetectable drug like the cream and the clear everything has snowballed and mlb has been slow in their approach to this epidemic the only solution which the player's union would never go for is to do blood testing the media covered it up also back the in the steroid heydays of the early to mid 's now they're reporting it like it's such a shock the wool was pulled over the eyes of the fans and now we're skeptical of any performance by a baseball player that is considered all star worthy because we don't know if it's been artificially enhanced or not  Barry Bonds History of baseball in the United States Bud Selig Major League Baseball All-Star Game Salary cap Baseball World Series Negro league baseball Jason Giambi 1994 baseball strike Chicago White Sox Montr__al Expos Major League Baseball television contracts Washington Nationals Detroit Tigers Minor league baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball Hall of Fame New York Yankees Cleveland Indians Baltimore Orioles San Francisco Giants New York Mets 2004-05 NHL lockout Los Angeles Clippers Andr__s Galarraga Milwaukee Brewers Babe Ruth Major League Baseball Players Association Houston Astros Atlanta Braves Toronto Blue Jays MLB on FOX St. Louis Cardinals Oakland Athletics Jos__ Canseco Cincinnati Reds Reggie Jackson Norway national football team National Football League Texas Rangers (baseball) Gary Sheffield Batting average The Jim Rome Show San Diego Padres Rafael Palmeiro International League Indianapolis 500 Olympic Games Psoriasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Limp Bizkit Topps Ty Cobb Chicago Cubs 1919 World Series First-person shooter Poker jargon Doping (sport) Satchel Paige Japanese baseball MLB on NBC Mark McGwire Peter Gabriel Sandy Koufax New anti-Semitism Tris Speaker Wayne Gretzky Sports betting Tour de France Newcastle United F.C.

does height really matter in baseball im years boy who dreams playing ball in the big league im currently ' '' and lbs and i think my final height would be around ' '' so i asked my self that how can i pitch against batters like ' '' im a pitcher btw i throw middle s right now but im sure i can throw at least high s in pro league i think most of the mlb scouters are looking for huge guys especially huge pitchers do you think i can make majorleauge with this height it really depends on who's looking you'll find some div college coaches that will tell you that they only look for pitchers who are over foot you'll find other scouts that will look more at control and speed i think the most important thing is to not get discouraged by looking too far ahead what i mean is just keep looking at the next level of ball that you need to get to in order to make your dream happen if your i'll assume that you are playing high school ball i'll take a guess and say that your playing at the junior varsity level the main focus you should have now is how effective your going to be at the varsity level if your at varsity you need to be looking to see how you can match up at one of the college levels and so on talk to your coach he can point you in the direction that you need to go if you get to the next level then you start to think of making a career of it just stay focused at what you need to do the problem at looking too far ahead is you might get easily discouraged if you go through a bout of bad starts and such i really hope your dream comes true hook me up with tickets when you make your first pro start  Baseball Pitcher Softball Baseball statistics Sandy Koufax Tris Speaker Minor league baseball Major League Baseball Satchel Paige World Series American football Pedro Mart__nez Fast bowling Volleyball Chicago Cubs National Football League Randy Johnson Stolen base Negro league baseball Nolan Ryan Earned run average Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Mike Piazza Strike zone 2004 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Houston Astros Starting pitcher Batting average Japanese baseball No-hitter Basketball 2005 World Series Perfect game Roger Clemens Reggie Jackson Knuckleball Designated hitter New York Yankees Home run Jerry Coleman Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States Babe Ruth Hit by pitch Ben Sheets Bunt Field hockey Willie Mays Barry Bonds Ted Radcliffe Atlanta Braves Roger Federer Hank Aaron 2004 College World Series Umpire (baseball) Luis Tiant Cy Young Derek Jeter Fenway Park Mike Scioscia Jim Thorpe Florida Marlins Chicago White Sox Cincinnati Reds Super Bowl XXVII New York Giants Yao Ming Canadian football Squash (sport) Origins of baseball Pitcher's mound October 20 in baseball Rugby union Hideo Nomo 1919 World Series Tim Wakefield St. Louis Cardinals Jim Palmer Jerry Lucas One Tree Hill (TV series) Bryan Robson Greg Maddux Montr__al Expos Peter Shilton Texas Longhorn Athletics First baseman FC Rostov Eric Gagne Detroit Tigers San Francisco 49ers Major League Baseball All-Star Game

can you imagine if the guy who caught the home run threw it back in disgust imagine when bonds hit that hr and it was in some open location and this fan caught it relatively easy then he throws it back angrily i thought about this and i would think that fan would become an instant national hero he would get book deals talk show appearences making him more money than as if he was to keep the ball whats your thoughts on this if you did actually throw away the barry bonds' home run ball you'd probably be the most stupid person in the history of america which is pretty bad considering who america's most famous screwups are sure why should i hold the most valued piece of sports memorabilia in years why shouldn't i auction off the ball and make up to million dollars mcgwire's th in ' went for mil honestly if you did do that you wouldn't be a instant national hero it's not like every single person in america hates bonds did you see the footage of the guy who caught the ball did you see the scramble and you're telling me that there are people in there who's main purpose is to throw the ball back into the field sure you seriously think that the people around the guy who threw it back would be thrilled they'd be horrified that someone had the nerve to throw away the home run ball if they didn't want it why should the spoil it for the other people who want it he wouldn't become a national icon he'd become known as a complete moron and an a sure he'd go on talk shows but to talk about why he did it not that he is a great person who stood up for steriods he'd be the next jeffery maier if he wanted to be a national icon he should keep the ball auction it off and give the money to the investigation or to charity  Barry Bonds Baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Home run Theory of conduct 1957 World Series Babe Ruth Shaggy dog story St. Louis Cardinals Hey Jude Satchel Paige History of baseball in the United States Mark McGwire World Series Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Eric Cartman Softball Chicago White Sox 1986 National League Championship Series Cricket Ty Cobb Derek Jeter National Football League Lore Autograph New York Yankees San Francisco Giants Hank Aaron Avenue Q Tris Speaker Garfield 2004 World Series Tag Married... with Children Andre Agassi American football Teen Girl Squad Interference (baseball) Reggie Jackson Lucille Ball Rickey Henderson ESPN25 Vin Scully New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVI Dodgeball Poker jargon Canadian football Glossary of American football Volleyball The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Marilyn Monroe Babe Ruth's Called Shot Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XIX Sammy Sosa Fast bowling The Ashlee Simpson Show Game show Cody Travers Super Bowl XIV Goldfinger Todd McFarlane Stewie Griffin Wyatt Earp Unreleased Madonna songs Baseball statistics The Shining (film) Philadelphia Phillies Intentional base on balls 2004 American League Championship Series October 4 in baseball Garth Brooks 1919 World Series Aerial (dance move) Red Sox Nation Friends $ale of the Century Big Brother (USA TV series) Nine Inch Nails Knots Landing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Los Angeles Dodgers Indianapolis 500 Laws of cricket Humphrey Bogart Stolen base Wrigley Field Blood on the Tracks John Lennon Punisher Super Bowl XXI Kodocha Bond Pedro Mart__nez

breaking records in baseball i'm not a baseball nut but i do enjoy going to the games with my husband i was watching a documentary about cal ripken jr and the record he now holds and it just seems to me that baseball don't want any of their records broken as they prefer the pastime players holding on to them i understand the recent years as steriods plays a large role but cal ripken jr didn't do steriods and is a good guy so why try to screw up his record breaking attempt not to mention roger maris who seemed to be a good guy as well like i said i don't know that much about baseball but it just seems to me that baseball don't approve of their records being broken i always thought records were meant to be broken please enlighten me as i would like to understand why record breaking seems to be a bad thing in baseball ripken in my opinion was pretty selfish i think sometimes him trotting out when he should have taken a day off to rest his injured body he played i think he hurt his team sometimes that's pretty selfish although i admire the record i would call anybody who broke it to be selfish as well in baseball they play games that's almost every day play cal was injured many times he played and at the time i thought it was cool but as i got older and understood how you could hinder your team it lost it's luster and to answer your question i agree records are made to be broken some people do not like the fact that people are using enhancements to break them i agree however every era has had this issue the name just wasn't steroids it was amphetamines and gambling tainting the game  Baseball Lou Gehrig Major League Baseball Cal Ripken, Jr. History of baseball in the United States Troy Glaus Satchel Paige Miguel Tejada ESPN25 Babe Ruth Baltimore Orioles St. Louis Cardinals Tris Speaker Pete Rose Detroit Tigers Poker jargon Goodness and value theory New York Knicks Toronto Blue Jays Roger Maris Evil September 20 in baseball Nolan Ryan Olympic Games Los Angeles Dodgers Nine Inch Nails 1981 baseball strike Ty Cobb International League Sandy Koufax San Francisco Giants Hank Aaron Jim Rice Bud Selig Home run New York Mets Sydney Riot of 1879 Transactional analysis September 6 in baseball Brian Close Plame affair Jos__ Canseco Batting average Minor league baseball The Fairly OddParents 1919 World Series Altruism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chicago White Sox The Ashlee Simpson Show 1957 World Series Kasparov versus The World New York Yankees Baseball statistics Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Indians Yogiisms Laws of cricket Origins of baseball National Football League Oakland Athletics Stolen base Pittsburgh Steelers Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Bodybuilding Rickey Henderson Norway national football team October 22 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Cricket Boston Red Sox Reggie Jackson Carl Yastrzemski 2004 World Series Major League Baseball All-Star Game 1994 baseball strike 2004-05 NHL lockout Tour de France Ultimate (sport) Dave Kingman Boston Bruins EastEnders Barry Bonds Playoff Negro league baseball Softball Don Drysdale Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball television contracts Professional wrestling slang Billy Ripken Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 World Series Pawtucket Red Sox Casey Stengel Consensus decision-making

looking for solid evidence i know roll your eyes i live in philadelpha and am not a giants or barry bonds fan but i was wondering if there was any solid evidence that barry bonds used steroids if there is none what is the anecdotal evidence i'm not really looking for opinions or speculations i just heard he was never positively tested and i'm wondering what the actual evidence is so i can make my own decision and think for myself i know just humor me ok the fact that he said he took something and didn't know it was steroids is a very thin excuse even if he didn't know they were steroids he still had them in his system and thus had an unfair advantage not looking good for bb first of all he admitted using what he said he though was linseed oil he and his trainer have connections to balco as for anecdotal evidence you can look at the change in his physique and the increased surliness in his attitude after most telling is the fact that his power numbers rose dramatically at this same time at an age when it is basically unheard of for such figures to do so he had been a good power hitter before but he became an incredible one at an age when most players start to see their numbers drop not rise this was also the time when mark mcgwire and sammy sosa were getting huge amounts of attention due to their breaking roger maris' single season record sources said bonds wanted to get what he saw as his fair share of that attention he wasn't getting it based simply on being one of the game's best players as evidenced by his three mvp awards so he seems to have decided to add something to his game  Barry Bonds Home run Sammy Sosa Mark McGwire History of baseball in the United States St. Louis Cardinals Jos__ Canseco Baseball Jason Giambi World Series Roger Maris Hank Aaron Babe Ruth Troy Glaus Rafael Palmeiro New York Yankees Major League Baseball All-Star Game Chicago White Sox Roswell UFO incident San Francisco Giants Rickey Henderson Larry Walker 1957 World Series Gary Sheffield Shawn Green Miguel Tejada Batting average National Football League Ted Williams Torii Hunter Chicago Bulls Oakland Athletics ESPN25 October 22 in baseball Willie Mays Lou Gehrig Pete Rose Plame affair Craps Inflation Solar cell Robin Ventura Reggie Jackson Wayne Gretzky ELO rating system One Tree Hill (TV series) The Contender (television series) James Bond Jimmie Foxx Carolina Panthers NBA Finals Blood on the Tracks Satchel Paige Alex Rodriguez Sandy Koufax Heinkel He 100 RISC Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Married... with Children Nolan Ryan Sub-Zero Andr__s Galarraga Brady Anderson Mach kernel Amiga Power 2004 World Series Todd McFarlane Atlanta Braves Controversies in autism Ichiro Suzuki Toronto Blue Jays Glass Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Salary cap Manny Ram__rez Cleveland Browns Mike Schmidt Vince McMahon Pittsburgh Steelers Seattle Mariners G-Man (Half-Life) Bud Selig Jeff Kent Ted Radcliffe Randy Johnson Time Out of Mind W.I.T.C.H.

isn't the ball going to drop value as barry keeps hitting home runs you raise an interesting question the value of won't necessarily drop that much until a rod gets to that level it's still the record breaker so it has value because of that none of bond's future hr's will be worth as much unless he somehow gets to there's really no established track record in terms of the value of record breaking home run balls aaron's th was hit into the braves bullpen his teammate tom house caught the ball and got it to aaron immediately it would have been interesting to see what a ball like that would have been worth if a fan caught it in but it just didn't work out that way baseball memorabilia wasn't the business back then that it is today although baseball collectibles have always been the most valuable of any of the major sports if bonds falls short of then his final hr ball if caught by a fan would have some value to collectors as well but every hr hit between and his final hr won't be worth nearly as much  Barry Bonds Baseball Babe Ruth 1957 World Series Atlanta Braves Home run Reggie Jackson Sandy Koufax Toronto Blue Jays 2004 World Series Pete Rose Boston Red Sox Cincinnati Reds Major League Baseball Indianapolis 500 Satchel Paige World Series San Francisco Giants Baseball (object) History of baseball in the United States Baseball Stars Chicago White Sox Willie Mays Ty Cobb Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Tris Speaker 2005 World Series New York Yankees New York Giants Baseball statistics Troy Glaus Polo Grounds St. Louis Cardinals Wrigley Field International League Gary Sheffield September 20 in baseball American football Ken Griffey, Jr. ESPN25 Glossary of American football Mois__s Alou Mark McGwire Chicago Cubs Alex Rodriguez Rickey Henderson San Diego Padres Ted Williams Manny Ram__rez Vin Scully Baseball Hall of Fame Major League Baseball All-Star Game Canadian football Torii Hunter Don Hoak October 4 in baseball Softball Poker jargon Super Bowl XIV Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Jerry Coleman Cleveland Indians Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Perfect game Philadelphia Phillies Super Bowl XIII Sammy Sosa October 3 in baseball September 2005 in sports Tim McCarver Phil Rizzuto October 22 in baseball Houston Astros Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) 1991 World Series October 7 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers National Football League Lore Baseball scorekeeping Robin Ventura Major League Baseball television contracts Interference (baseball) Nolan Ryan October 10 in baseball Indian Oil Cup 2005 Pedro Mart__nez October 17 in baseball Derek Jeter Wayne Gretzky Volleyball 2004 American League Championship Series Seattle Mariners Lou Gehrig Sabermetrics Fenway Park Pittsburgh Steelers Stolen base Eddie Mathews

would there have been a mlb steroid investigation had bonds never broken mcgwires record steroid use by major leaguers had been suspected since the early 's and nothing was said until bonds broke mcgwires record mcgwire had been a for a long time suspected of steroid use why did no one make a big deal about it when he broke the record i am not hating on barry bonds i personally feel that mlb and the media are using him as a whipping boy no racial pun intended i also believe that if mcgwire was standing in his shoes america would have gone with it and the whole steroid controversy would have never arose mark mcgwire was caught with a dietary supplement that was sitting there plain as day in front of the media yet he was never attacked like barry bonds is now he was way bigger than bonds what about the other names likes pudge rodriguez sammy no speaka da english sosa gary sheffield and even roger clemens and how stupid was mr viagra rafael palmiero he wolud have definitely have been elected to the hall of fame  Mark McGwire Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa History of baseball in the United States Home run Rafael Palmeiro Jos__ Canseco St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Major League Baseball Baseball Roger Maris Pedro Mart__nez ESPN25 October 22 in baseball Jason Giambi November 1 in baseball July 2004 in sports November 3 in baseball Major League Baseball titles streaks Wrigley Field Major League Baseball television contracts Roger Clemens Up the Down Steroid The Sporting News Player of the Year Award Todd McFarlane October 7 in baseball Houston Astros Texas Rangers (baseball) Oakland Athletics Willie Mays September 20 in baseball Chris Berman MLB on FOX Hulk Hogan San Francisco Giants Shawn Green September 6 in baseball Milt Pappas Boston Red Sox Chicago Cubs Bud Selig Red Sox Nation October 3 in baseball Steroid Alex Rodriguez Los Angeles Dodgers Toronto Blue Jays The Living Daylights Lou Gehrig World Series October 20 in baseball Minor league baseball Miguel Tejada Iv__n Rodr__guez Hank Aaron June 12 in baseball Albert Pujols June 11 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Troy Glaus Professional wrestling throws David Wells Seattle Mariners Goldfinger Jack Buck Androstenedione MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award Cleveland Browns Jos__ Luis Rodr__guez Zapatero Roger Federer Brady Anderson October 4 in baseball Bee Gees Gary Sheffield Major League Baseball titles leaders Rick Reilly Irish people Pete Rose Cincinnati Reds August 2005 in sports October 2005 in sports Ren and Stimpy 50 Cent The Jim Rome Show Satchel Paige Dominican Republic James Bond Nolan Ryan 2000s October 31 in baseball Tour de France Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Major League Baseball Players Association Columbine High School massacre 1990s Ben Johnson (athlete) Randy Johnson

how many homeruns would mark mcgwire have hit if he was on steriods bonds' numbers obviously jumped up quite a bit when he started taking while mcgwire always stayed the same so if mcgwire actually took some steroids could you imagine the hundreds of homeruns he would have hit i think he could have hit in a season if mcgwire cheated like bonds i agree that mcgwire would have hit a lot more bonds went from averaging hrs a season to like while mark hit a whole bunch his rookie year i bet mark would have probably hit at least if he took anything that cheater did  Home run Mark McGwire Jos__ Canseco Sammy Sosa St. Louis Cardinals Andr__s Galarraga Grover Cleveland Alexander Baseball Stars History of baseball in the United States Oakland Athletics Albert Pujols Troy Glaus Up the Down Steroid ESPN25 Alex Rodriguez Jimmie Foxx October 4 in baseball Jim Rice New York Yankees Toronto Blue Jays September 6 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Shawn Green International League MLB on FOX Los Angeles Dodgers Vladimir Guerrero Bob Horner Satchel Paige Doyle Alexander 1957 World Series October 3 in baseball Busch Stadium Rickey Henderson Bobby Grich November 3 in baseball Brady Anderson Joe Adcock October 7 in baseball Dave Henderson October 22 in baseball Pete Rose Felipe Alou Seattle Mariners Cheating in Counter-Strike Roger Maris Bobby Crosby Boston Red Sox Kent Hrbek Hal Trosky Cheating Hank Aaron Tony Oliva Baltimore Orioles Brother's Little Helper Major League Baseball Eddie Murphy Cinergy Field Houston Astros Florida Marlins Cheating in poker Minor league baseball 1988 World Series Bobby Hillin, Jr. Ayrton Senna San Francisco Giants Pittsburgh Steelers Babe Ruth Batting average Major League Baseball television contracts Rocky Colavito Rudy York Wally Berger Tino Martinez Gary Sheffield Dave Kingman Nomar Garciaparra October 1 in baseball Baseball statistics The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award Roulette Milt Pappas Billy Williams (baseball player) Rafael Palmeiro The Amazing Race October 2005 in sports Khalil Greene Poker jargon Craps Ed Delahanty Maverick (film) Flamingo Road Anabolic steroid Roberto Alomar Bond World Series Professional wrestling slang

how many home runs do you think bonds will finish with when he retires he will play one more year maybe at a cheap rate as dh with a title contender because a he has never won the world series and b he is now only about hits from which he will not get this year but would in one more so i'm guessing about more this year and in another year so right around that seems to be the consensus answer  San Francisco Giants St. Louis Cardinals Philadelphia Phillies Chicago Cubs 2005 World Series Chicago White Sox Shawn Michaels Willie Mays Family Feud Kirby Puckett New York Yankees Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Atlanta Braves 2004 World Series Seattle Mariners Pete Sampras Reggie Jackson Pittsburgh Pirates Scrabble (game show) Mark Calaway World Series Houston Astros Detroit Tigers Oakland Athletics Cincinnati Reds Troy Glaus Andre Agassi Ken Jennings Playoff Hank Aaron October 20 in baseball Baltimore Orioles Pyramid (game show) Home run International League Nolan Ryan Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Blue Jays CPU cache NBA Finals 1957 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Minnesota Twins Pete Rose Tampa Bay Devil Rays October 3 in baseball October 22 in baseball Sparky Anderson Boston Red Sox Steffi Graf Babe Ruth Maia Chiburdanidze Chain Reaction (game show) Tic-Tac-Dough Barry Bonds Card Sharks Cleveland Indians Jesse Orosco Rickey Henderson David Bautista 2004 American League Championship Series Dick Williams Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry October 4 in baseball Ravi Shastri Major League Baseball Mastermind (television) Indiana Pacers Ted Williams Jim Rice Password (game) Wheel of Fortune $ale of the Century New York Mets West Indian cricket team The Joker's Wild English cricket team Paul Levesque Carlton Fisk Cap Anson Willie Pep World Chess Championship Alan Trammell Robin Ventura Chinese Basketball Association Harvey Kuenn Tony Stewart Albert Pujols New York Knicks Professional wrestling slang John Forsythe 1993 World Series October 7 in baseball Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Ty Cobb 2005 English cricket season Everton F.C.

cardinals central champs cardinals are games back again brewers are cold and soriano is out can the cardinals make a miraculous comeback and become central division champs the cardinals are the defending champs and in my mind still have a shot until someone knocks them off the top the brewers are crashing hard and the cubs really aren't that good of a team either and when soriano went down that was the end of their great run yankees are only back at the moment and most people still think they have a shot games is nothing when you still have months to play  St. Louis Cardinals Milwaukee Brewers World Series Detroit Tigers 1957 World Series Cincinnati Bengals 2001 World Series 2003 World Series New York Giants October 10 in baseball November 1 in baseball Hank Aaron October 4 in baseball Dick Williams New York Yankees October 17 in baseball Pittsburgh Steelers Texas Rangers (baseball) Cleveland Browns September 2005 in sports Boston Red Sox October 15 in baseball October 12 in baseball October 31 in baseball Interleague play 2005 World Series Lou Gehrig October 3 in baseball Chicago Cubs Alex Rodriguez Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2004 American League Championship Series International League July 2004 in sports Home run 1987 World Series Tim McCarver 2004 World Series San Francisco Giants October 2005 in sports October 5 in baseball October 2004 in sports San Diego Padres Minnesota Vikings October 16 in baseball Curse of the Billy Goat Baltimore Orioles National League Red Sox Nation Oakland Athletics Wrigley Field New York Mets Babe Ruth NBA Finals October 20 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays 1934 World Series 1982 World Series Mark Bellhorn December 2004 in sports Grover Cleveland Alexander Seattle Mariners Terry Francona October 23 in baseball Reggie Jackson Gary Sheffield November 2 in baseball October 9 in baseball Chicago White Sox October 11 in baseball Joaqu__n And__jar October 21 in baseball Sandy Koufax Ty Cobb October 14 in baseball National Football League Lore Baseball Carolina Panthers Harvey Kuenn ESPN25 Babe Ruth's Called Shot Philadelphia Phillies Andr__s Galarraga October 13 in baseball November 3 in baseball August 2005 in sports Los Angeles Dodgers Billy Martin John Smoltz Scott Podsednik October 19 in baseball Jim Abbott Florida Marlins Satchel Paige Ozzie Smith Richie Sexson Pacific Coast League NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Arizona Cardinals Mois__s Alou

i play baseball and i keep getting jammed on inside pitches need help with htis problem trust me standing further away from the plate will only b worse the pitcher s will c this nibble away at the outside corner making u either take an outside strike swing miss more and or foul more balls off keep ur stance the way it is unless there's sumthing else wrong w it talk a coach just shorten ur swing but st what u need do is this go the plate of these times just stand there in ur normal stance take the st pitches no matter what key dont act like u arent gonna swing fake a swing or make the pitcher think u may swing cuz if a pitcher no's that a batter's taking straight pitches that pitcher will throw straight down the middle after this occurs if u havent struck out which u probabaly wont have quickly go through in ur head think abt the pitches where they were thrown if u do strike out wait til next at bat follow the next advice where were the locations were they all inside outside did the pitcher mix it up once u've decided where the pitches were think abt the count if its then just look for a fastball swing if u want its totally up u if its take the pitch if it looks like it will b out of the strike zone worst case scenario the pitch will break strike if it looks good swing away if can just tell that it will b a ball take all the way if its ur in a bit of trouble but not as much as the pitcher thinks u think a good pitcher will not throw a pitch near the zone on a count if he she no's u cant hit inside she'll he'll most undoubtedly throw a fastball inside if he she doesnt no where u can or cant hit she'll he'll probably still throw a fastball inside or a slider on the outside part of the plate depends her orhis pitches if he or she throws a slider or not take the pitch evn if u strike out ur more prepared next time as u no what that pitcher's strike out pitch is if u take straight called strikes ur coach manager will probably b angry tell her or him what u were doing tell him or her its a new approach ur taking but after that called rd go back sit down in the dugout visualize the at bat in ur mind again think abt the pitches thrown from there u can bcome more accustom ur new stragedy the best way hit inside pitches is just shorten ur swing dont try do much w the pitch stay on it but hey i had trouble hitting those insiders but ive gotten better w this approach a pitcher will c that u just wont give in the inside stuff she or he will have go more outside eventually  Softball Strike zone Sandy Koufax St. Louis Cardinals Satchel Paige Baseball statistics Babe Ruth Tris Speaker Batting average Fast bowling 2005 World Series Hit by pitch Bunt Volleyball 2004 World Series Reggie Jackson Interference (baseball) Pitch (baseball) Chicago White Sox Perfect game 1986 National League Championship Series Curveball Nolan Ryan Baseball Stars Batting (cricket) Pedro Mart__nez Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Dodgers First baseman Hal Trosky Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Baseball scorekeeping Stolen base Jerry Coleman New York Mets Swingout New York Yankees Andr__s Galarraga 2004 American League Championship Series No-hitter Knuckleball Cincinnati Reds Baseball slang Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Starting pitcher Greg Maddux Fielding (cricket) Vin Scully Intentional base on balls Aerial (dance move) Snooker History of baseball in the United States Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Atomic Kitten San Francisco Giants 1903 World Series International League Smokey Joe Wood Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Cricket San Diego Padres Switch hitter Randy Johnson Florida Marlins Kirk Gibson October 16 in baseball Hank Aaron Billy Wagner New York Giants Baserunning 2003 World Series Stan Musial Ben Sheets Frank Howard (baseball player) Professional wrestling attacks Philadelphia Phillies Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Carlos Zambrano Squeeze play (baseball) A.J.

will the rockies make the playoffs i hope they do i think it would be really exciting to see a totally new team in the playoffs i think its really neat that they've found a way to overcome the altitude problem and also win some road game it looks like they've become committed to winning hopefully they'll play a bigger role in aquiring free agents and become even better next season i think teams like this show that baseball works the way it is i actually think they will they've been streaky but they started in the cellar and have made their way up over the last two months they've got two solid starters in francis and cook and they've got some nice hitters in hawpe and atkins holliday is the star of the team a guy who will be a bona fide superstar in the coming years todd helton has lost his power but he still hits in the clutch and for a solid average for the first time in recent memory they're not an embarrassment on the road so i think they will either take the nl west or the wild card  Toronto Blue Jays Seattle Mariners New York Giants Oakland Athletics Boston Red Sox Detroit Tigers Pittsburgh Steelers Playoff Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Orlando Magic National Football League New York Islanders Houston Astros 1957 World Series NBA Finals Chicago White Sox Todd Helton 2005 World Series International League San Francisco Giants New England Patriots Los Angeles Kings Buffalo Bills San Diego Padres New York Jets New York Knicks Boston Bruins Mario Lemieux Indiana Pacers Milwaukee Brewers Playoff format October 20 in baseball Atlanta Braves New York Rangers Edmonton Oilers Toronto Raptors Robin Ventura Minnesota Timberwolves Pete Rose Red Sox Nation Major League Baseball Carolina Panthers Chicago Cubs Arizona Diamondbacks Andr__s Galarraga New York Mets Texas Rangers (baseball) Baseball statistics Baltimore Orioles Chicago Bulls Mois__s Alou Batting average Kansas City Royals Miami Dolphins Baseball Stars Sammy Sosa Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cleveland Indians Alex Rodriguez Houston Rockets Yao Ming Baseball Montr__al Expos Super Bowl XXXIV Philadelphia 76ers Satchel Paige New Jersey Nets Miguel Tejada Chicago Blackhawks Steve Nash Super Bowl XXVII National Hockey League All-Star Game Detroit Red Wings 1981 baseball strike Kansas City Chiefs Michael Jordan Fernando Valenzuela Jim Rice Wild card Carlos Beltr__n Wayne Gretzky Colorado Rockies Pittsburgh Penguins Qu__bec Nordiques NFL playoffs 2004 NBA Finals Los Angeles Dodgers Nolan Ryan Jason Giambi Japanese baseball

question to yankee fans jays fans and others do you think after last night the blue jays will get better as a team and perform better offensively the yankees are pumped but im jsut asking what about josh towers will burnett help following the jays has been quite the rollercoaster with a game win streak as the highlight they have such a hard time putting a good run together and it seems their spirit can be broken easily that said last night's beatdown was encouraging especially frank thomas' hitting as he's pledged to make good for his crappy first half over the rest of the season the playoffs certainly aren't impossible esp if glaus can get out of his slump they need to get the mark a bit farther in the rearview before the wild card is a serious topic towers has been solid i hope that burnett doesn't screw things up because the rotation has been great he's pretty hit or miss but can probably handle the pressure better come september over someone like litsch or towers if there's any pressure to be felt the yankees look to be headed to the postseason but i think they're rotation is going to hit a slump soon those old aces have just been around too long however it won't matter if they're scoring runs a game so we'll see  Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Cleveland Browns Florida Marlins New York Giants St. Louis Cardinals Chicago White Sox New York Yankees 2003 World Series International League Cleveland Indians Atlanta Braves Detroit Tigers 2001 World Series Seattle Mariners 2005 World Series Miami Dolphins Cincinnati Reds Troy Glaus Chicago Cubs Alex Rodriguez October 4 in baseball Ty Cobb Houston Astros Pete Rose Los Angeles Dodgers Mario Lemieux Pittsburgh Steelers September 2005 in sports Milwaukee Brewers Babe Ruth Reggie Jackson 2004 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts Robin Ventura Baltimore Ravens New York Mets Toronto Raptors National Football League October 2004 in sports Indianapolis Colts San Diego Padres 1981 baseball strike Red Sox Nation National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Carolina Panthers Baltimore Orioles Playoff Utah Jazz 2004 American League Championship Series New York Knicks Lou Gehrig Indiana Pacers Volleyball Satchel Paige Montr__al Expos New York Jets Minnesota Twins 1987 World Series October 16 in baseball Poker jargon October 1 in baseball Los Angeles Kings San Francisco Giants Pedro Mart__nez NBA Finals Hank Aaron October 12 in baseball Super Bowl XXV Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry 1993 World Series 1994 baseball strike Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) October 3 in baseball Baseball Super Bowl XXXIV Cincinnati Bengals St. Louis Blues (hockey) Professional wrestling slang Curse of the Bambino Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Derek Jeter Diving Montreal Canadiens October 10 in baseball October 21 in baseball Willie Mays Super Bowl XXII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXVII Oakland Athletics

what do you think of bud selig's reaction to barry bonds' record home run bud apparently made a telephone call to barry after the game but again he was not in attendance so let me ask should bud have attended and should he have more readily embraced this historic moment everyone clearly can tell that bud thinks barry cheated by his lukewarm reaction to the tying home run but still i agree that bud is a pretty bad commissioner but no one will ever be worse than the nhl's gary bettman i am in no way a public defender for bonds quite the opposite actually but this record meant a lot to him and it would not have been classless for him to play on and attempt to break it we are not saying bud had to act a certain way but we are saying that he needed to take one stand or the other instead he tried to please everyone by being emotionless and congratulating barry with congrats on the record even though i think you cheated again i don't like bonds either and i do think he did steroids but still have some respect for this accomplishment i like how bud selig could not go without mentioning the scandal while he congratulated barry it was smooth it was like congratulations you are the new home run king even though there are questions surrounding you acccomplishments also i praise hank for not being there and i believe the only reason he congratulated barry was to be the better man  Barry Bonds Major League Baseball Bud Selig National Hockey League Home run 2004-05 NHL lockout World Series History of baseball in the United States 2005 World Series Pete Rose Hank Aaron Married... with Children Baseball Montr__al Expos Ben Johnson (athlete) Moonraker 1994 baseball strike Commissioner Babe Ruth Stanley Cup Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) 1957 World Series The Joker's Wild Theory of conduct Plame affair One Tree Hill (TV series) Gary Bettman Brian Close Babe Ruth's Called Shot St. Louis Cardinals Cliff Richard Major League Baseball television contracts Bud Adams Fay Vincent ESPN25 Poker jargon Pittsburgh Steelers September 2004 in sports Reggie Jackson MLB on FOX 2004 World Series Los Angeles Clippers Ice hockey Los Angeles Kings Oasis (band) 1987 World Series Contract bridge Nolan Ryan Boston Bruins Dream Job (Season 2) 1919 World Series Royal Assent Rock, Paper, Scissors Chicago White Sox Bud Collyer EastEnders Knots Landing San Francisco Giants Cheating in poker Rafael Palmeiro Palace of Westminster Volleyball September 20 in baseball Minnesota Vikings New York Giants Mario Lemieux Jean Chr__tien 1986 World Series Don Drysdale Barry Goldwater Baseball (object) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Unreleased Madonna songs Kareem Said Billboard Hot 100 Washington Nationals Sydney Riot of 1879 Kansas City Chiefs Playoff New York Yankees October 7 in baseball Gary Sheffield John Kerr Craps Anti-communism Inspector Gadget Sammy Sosa Weapon X 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Darwin from Orchids to Variation Microeconomics Linus Pauling Goldfinger October 22 in baseball Norway national football team Ultimate (sport) 1992-93 NHL season Modernism James Bond

do the cardinals have a shot at the post season my opinion is yes they're games back in a weak division they still play a bunch of games against the cubs and brewers their pitching staff is kinda sorta gaining momentum the brewers are realing and the cubs are cursed i'd give them a shot right now what do you all think right now it's pretty hard to say i will say that you can never count them out the brewers are young and seem to be struggling as of late you also have to look at milwaukee's road record also injuries to ben sheets and tony graffanino don't help either as far as the cubs go i don't think they'll be seeing the postseason this year they've also been falling apart as of late they were just swept by the houston astros also alfonso soriano is on the dl for at least the next month so the cards have a better chance than some might think the good thing is that st louis has six more games against milwaukee well that could potentially be a bad thing considering that the games are in milwaukee  Chicago Cubs World Series 2005 World Series Detroit Tigers National League October 4 in baseball 2003 World Series Chicago White Sox Atlanta Braves October 12 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays Florida Marlins October 15 in baseball San Diego Padres October 3 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts New York Knicks Hank Aaron October 9 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Satchel Paige October 2004 in sports October 5 in baseball October 10 in baseball 2005 National League Championship Series Oakland Athletics Scott Podsednik Pittsburgh Steelers Baltimore Orioles Tony La Russa Harvey Kuenn Cleveland Browns New York Yankees Seattle Mariners Babe Ruth November 3 in baseball October 1 in baseball Interleague play Roger Clemens New York Giants October 31 in baseball Cincinnati Bengals Texas Rangers (baseball) New Jersey Nets Los Angeles Clippers John Smoltz San Francisco Giants 1982 World Series Joaqu__n And__jar November 1 in baseball Wrigley Field October 13 in baseball Indiana Pacers Wild card October 2005 in sports NBA Finals 2004 World Series Philadelphia 76ers Davey Lopes Randy Johnson Nolan Ryan Terry Francona Houston Rockets September 2005 in sports MLB on NBC Pittsburgh Pirates Ben Sheets Perfect game Red Sox Nation Alex Rodriguez Don Sutton Albert Pujols History of baseball in the United States October 21 in baseball 2004 National League Championship Series October 11 in baseball Milwaukee Admirals Mark Bellhorn October 17 in baseball October 27 in baseball MLB on FOX Babe Ruth's Called Shot Mario Lemieux September 22 in baseball Ty Cobb Grover Cleveland Alexander September 20 in baseball New York Mets

how can i change a fast pitch softball swing to a slow pitch swing i played fast pitch softball through high school but now am now playing co ed slow pitch having a hell of a time not swinging too soon and i'm making contact too close to the grip any pointers starting stance starting bat position where should my weight be over my feet should i use as big of a bat as i can manage or small with slow pitch you want to wait and explode always swing at the very last possible moment good pitches will be good hits don't take a bad pitch in slow pitch they pretty much have to give you a cookie always be able to lift your front foot off the ground that is about on the badck and on the front stay to the back of the box i teach to hold the bat straight up and down so the knob is pointing to the dirt and the endplug is pointing strait to the sky this allows you to use an endloaded bat without feeling that weight you want to use an endloaded bat and as heavy as you can feel good with and as you get stronger move up a half an oz in weight the reason the ball goes far and hard is because the bat does not slow down much after contact if you have a bat speed of mph before contact and mph after contact you will hit poorly if you have a speed of mph before and after you will be over the fence swing hard and don't slow down at contact contact is the most important factor in hitting consistently well practice i mean really practice every bp day to watch the ball and bat touch the cneter of the ball and the centerline of the barrel the whole barell of the bat is sweetspot now with the composites but the farther out to the end you hit the more physics comes into play and you will get better power i always teach that if you cannot make perfect contact on a hit then why would you ever put a full swing on a ball i take a bucket of balls and have the batter just tap them back towards the field anywhere with no power or muscle into it just the bat and the ball like a bunt but with a little swing to it and no dampering this allows you to get the feedback of a perfect contact hit the ball will go much further when it is hit in the center and it hits the centerline of the bat barrel stance is not important you dont want to be moving and you dont want to move the bat around you stay still and explode at the last moment hit for perfect contact and don t slow down at contact swing hard through it with a big follow through i prefer having batters let go of the back hand right after contact so not to teach the brain to slow down becasue it will hurt by letting go this message never gets sent becasue it doesnt hurt try this until you understand it it will work i have taught it to many many people with great success boys and girls a few bp sessions and you will understand where to stand and how to wait and explode after about three tijmes of tapping balls tossed to you from a bucket and letting the bat tap them to the field you willstart to have perfect contact good luck  Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Laws of cricket Cricket Equine conformation Swingout Batting (cricket) Sandy Koufax 1957 World Series Baseball Stars Baseball statistics Bunt Fielding (cricket) Car handling Professional wrestling throws Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pitcher Batting average Satchel Paige Tris Speaker Professional wrestling holds Table tennis Babe Ruth Ty Cobb English cricket team Sydney Riot of 1879 Baseball bat Internal ballistics Glossary of American football Tag History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Skateboarding trick Badminton Lindy Basic Yorker St. Louis Cardinals 2005 World Series Brian Close Indian Oil Cup 2005 Helicopter Poker jargon Tennis Electrophysiology Golf club (equipment) Ravi Shastri Tenshinhan Golf Circle (dance move) Pedro Mart__nez Ayrton Senna Four square Protoss 1986 World Series Terminal ballistics Babe Ruth's Called Shot Side pass (dance move) Parade (military) Wing Chun Rugby union Football (soccer) Rounders History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Field hockey First baseman Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Snooker Dog agility Rugby union positions Andr__s Galarraga Strike zone International League Baseball scorekeeping Squash (sport) Wind turbine Suplex Batsman 2004 World Series Mixed martial arts Wrigley Field Contredanse Types of bowlers in cricket Tai Chi Chuan Horse gait RuneScape quests Glossary of climbing terms Blood (computer game) Glossary of nautical terms The Shining (film) Out (baseball)

in mlb do both leagues use designated hitters what is the difference between a pinch hitter and a designated hitter first of all i must tell you the history of designated hitters originally both leagues had the pitchers bat but in the 's most games were low scoring and a lot of american league teams were in small markets to keep fans in small markets coming to games the american league teams and the commisoner of baseball decided to try to make games higher scoring without changing the game too much they found that pitchers had low batting averages and that having another player hit would lead to more scoring so only american league teams use a designated hitter except in interleague play it depends on who the home team is a pinch hitter has to replace a player while a designated hitter plays the whole game and when he replaces him he has to play the field you can also have pinch runners who take someones place on base instead of hitting for them there can be more than one pinch hitter but not more than one designated hitter  Baseball Designated hitter Batting average Baseball statistics Lou Gehrig Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball All-Star Game Major League Baseball Tris Speaker World Series Manny Ram__rez No-hitter 1919 World Series Barry Bonds New York Mets International League John Olerud St. Louis Cardinals 2004 American League Championship Series Box score (baseball) Pete Rose Interleague play Japanese baseball 2004 World Series MLB designated hitter statistics 1986 World Series Babe Ruth Robin Ventura Chicago White Sox Shoeless Joe Jackson Sammy Sosa 2005 World Series Bert Campaneris David Ortiz Reggie Jackson Willie Mays Volleyball Alex Rodriguez Ichiro Suzuki Hank Aaron Baseball scorekeeping Dave Kingman Detroit Tigers Jim Rice San Diego Padres New York Yankees Andr__s Galarraga Milwaukee Brewers Mike Scioscia Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Negro league baseball Edgar Martinez Jeff Bagwell Pittsburgh Pirates Mark McGwire Casey Stengel Pitcher Oakland Athletics Batting order (baseball) Edgar Renter__a Ted Kluszewski Sabermetrics Melvin Mora Troy Glaus Montr__al Expos Mike Schmidt Seattle Mariners Carlos Beltr__n Rickey Henderson Derek Jeter Texas Rangers (baseball) First baseman Jimmie Foxx Bobby Abreu Satchel Paige Torii Hunter Rocky Colavito San Francisco Giants Fenway Park October 4 in baseball Cap Anson Cincinnati Reds Scott Podsednik Bunt Playoff Shawn Wooten Perfect game Sandy Koufax

compare and contrast barry bonds vs roger clemens everyone including myself is hating on barry bonds for roids this is justified in my opinion because steroids tarnish the hallowed records and statistics of baseball records now people presume that bonds use steroids for two main reasons he got better as he entered his forties and the size of his head now is about times that of it his rookie year and even in but isn't the same true for clemens futhermore each could still be using hgh in the offseason as baseball does not test for the substance as of now do you think clemens used steroids and if so how does that affect your view of him as compared to bonds who many hate because he is the poster boy for roids i think clemens is a roid boy too but he hasn't testified to it in front of a grand jury yet clemens has always had a large head so maybe he's been using for a long time henry aaron is still my hr king  Barry Bonds Hank Aaron Major League Baseball Rafael Palmeiro Jos__ Canseco Home run History of baseball in the United States Seattle Mariners New York Yankees Growth hormone treatment October 22 in baseball Houston Astros Boston Red Sox Human height Nolan Ryan Miguel Tejada St. Louis Cardinals Mark Twain Professional wrestling slang Major League Baseball Players Association Baseball Babe Ruth Up the Down Steroid June 2004 in sports Mark McGwire Plame affair Puberty Pittsburgh Steelers Red Sox Nation Jason Giambi Albert Pujols October 2005 in sports Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Miami Dolphins Minor league baseball Troy Glaus December 2004 in sports Oakland Athletics Ben Johnson (athlete) Greg Maddux San Francisco Giants Phimosis Freedom of speech Jim Rice Randy Johnson Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) Clemens Maria Hofbauer The Sporting News Player of the Year Award Bud Selig Polyamory Baseball Stars ESPN25 Tour de France Sexual orientation Bodybuilding Summer Olympic Games John Barry (composer) San Antonio Spurs July 2004 in sports Epistemology David Hume American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Chicago Cubs 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Toronto Raptors Chicago White Sox Doomsday argument September 2005 in sports 2005 World Series Allergy The Invisibles Steroid New York Rangers Theory of conduct Topps Cleveland Indians Sammy Sosa Indiana Pacers Pedro Mart__nez November 2004 in sports Growth hormone deficiency Baltimore Orioles Ted Williams Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miguel Cabrera Lou Gehrig Yao Ming Economic inequality Insulin Detroit Red Wings October 27 in baseball Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Rickey Henderson Atlanta Braves August 2005 in sports FoxTrot Steroid hormone receptor

in mlb isn't 'fielder's choice' really just half of what could be a double play sorry i took this from wikipedia its very very long in baseball a fielder's choice abbreviated fc is most often the act of a fielder upon fielding a batted ball choosing to try to put out one runner while in so doing allowing the batter runner to advance to first base a batter who reaches base safely as the result of a fielder's choice is not credited with a hit he is effectively charged with an out and an at bat just as if he had been put out himself example with a runner on first base the batter hits a ground ball to the shortstop instead of throwing the batter runner out at first base the shortstop chooses to throw to the second baseman who is covering second base forcing out the runner coming from first meanwhile the batter runner reaches first base safely this play is a fielder's choice if the defensive team fails to put out the runner being played upon the play may be scored either as a fielder's choice with or without any errors or as a base hit a fielder's choice will also be recorded for the batter when he beats out an attempted double play assuming there are no fielding errors see example below example with a fast runner on second base the batter hits a ground ball to the shortstop instead of throwing the batter runner out at first base the shortstop chooses to throw to third base in an attempt to throw out the runner advancing from second base the third baseman tries to tag out the runner but is unable to do so because of the speed of the runner in this case both runners are safe and nobody is put out this play is a fielder's choice but no errors are charged because there was no misplay of the ball if anything the shortstop made a mental mistake such misjudgements are not charged as errors by choosing to throw to third base instead of first base example with a slow runner on second base the batter hits a ground ball to the shortstop instead of throwing the batter runner out at first base the shortstop chooses to throw to third base in an attempt to throw out the runner advancing from second base however the third baseman drops the ball thrown by the shortstop and does not recover in time to tag out the runner again both runners are safe and nobody is put out this play is a fielder's choice but an error is charged to the third baseman as the runner would have been easily put out had the ball not been dropped example with a runner on first base the batter hits a ground ball back up the middle the shortstop dives for the ball and saves it from going into center field realizing he has no time to throw out the batter runner at first base the shortstop tosses the ball to the second baseman covering second base in an attempt to force out the runner coming from first however the throw is not in time and both runners are safe in this case this play will be scored as a base hit because even had the shortstop thrown the ball to first base the batter runner still would have been safe example with a runner on first base the batter hits a ground ball to the shortstop the shortstop throws to second base to put out the lead runner the second baseman then turns and attempts to complete a double play by throwing to first base the batter beats the throw and is safe at first base this play would not be recorded as a base hit for the batter but as a fielder's choice to retire the runner at second a fielder's choice is also recorded when a fielder attempts an out on a runner and another runner advances due to such an attempt this type of fielder's choice is unrelated to the batter reaching first base it happens with other runners or with the batter runner after he reaches first base for example if a batter sends a base hit to the outfield and the fielder throws to home plate in an attempt to put out a runner trying to score the batter may decide to advance to second base since he can see that there will not be a play there the batter is only credited with a single and is said to have taken second on a fielder's choice or on the throw additionally a runner who steals a base may not be credited with a stolen base statistically if the defensive team is indifferent to his advance this usually occurs in the late innings of a game with a wide scoring margin where allowing one extra base would not have any impact on the outcome for this play the common usage is to say that the runner advanced on a fielder's choice although in this particular case it was the choice not to attempt a play at all and may be called fielder's indifference or defensive indifference  Cricket Pitcher Detroit Tigers Appeal play English cricket team Box score (baseball) Fast bowling World Series Lou Gehrig Seattle Mariners Fielding (cricket)

in mlb does a runner on base have to tag up if a grounder is hit or only if it's a fly ball better yet when does a runner not have to tag the bag before running a runner who is touching a base which he is entitled to occupy may not be tagged out runners may attempt to advance from base to base on any fair ball that touches the ground when a ball is hit in the air i e a fly ball and caught by the defending team runners must return and touch the base they occupy called tagging up after the ball is legally caught once they do this they may attempt to advance at their own risk on a ball that touches the ground in fair territory if there is a force runners are required to run baserunners may attempt to advance at any time while the ball is alive even before or while the pitcher is throwing a pitch the catcher or pitcher in lieu of delivering the pitch often tries to prevent this by throwing the ball to one of the infielders in order to tag the runner this pick off attempt is usually unsuccessful in tagging out the runner but is effective in keeping the runner closer to the base if the runner is tagged out while diving back to the base it is called a pickoff if the runner attempts to advance to the next base but is tagged out before reaching it safely he is caught stealing a successful attempt by the runner is called a stolen base if a pitch gets away from the catcher runners may also try to advance this may be a wild pitch if the pitcher is held responsible for the ball getting away or a passed ball if the catcher is deemed to be at fault sometimes the defending team will ignore a runner who is trying to steal a base in this case a runner is not credited with a steal and the base is attributed to defensive indifference  1957 World Series Out (baseball) Pitcher First baseman Tag 2004 World Series Baseball scorekeeping Baseball positions Tris Speaker Appeal play Bunt Glossary of American football Cricket American football 2004 American League Championship Series Fast bowling 2005 World Series Volleyball Laws of cricket Perfect game No-hitter Water polo 2003 World Series Left fielder Catcher Box score (baseball) Strike zone Fielding (cricket) 1919 World Series Balk Canadian football Chicago White Sox Dodgeball Origins of baseball Unassisted triple play Ty Cobb Wide receiver Comparison of Canadian and American football Rugby union Babe Ruth Boston Red Sox Knuckleball World Series October 14 in baseball Kickball Rugby league Knickerbocker Rules Satchel Paige Derek Jeter English cricket team October 4 in baseball Ultimate (sport) Home run Squeeze play (baseball) Reggie Jackson Strikeout Football (soccer) San Francisco Giants Doug Eddings Rounders Baseball Stars Willie Mays The Inning October 17 in baseball Punt (football) October 8 in baseball Barry Bonds New York Giants 2001 World Series Football New York Yankees October 16 in baseball October 10 in baseball Australian rules football Florida Marlins Rugby union positions Pedro Mart__nez Alexander Cartwright BASEketball Nolan Ryan Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Super Bowl X

there was a question on espn com today and i totally disagreed with what most people chose quest was what is the hardest record to break it was barry bonds hr record joe dimaggio game consecutive hits carl ripken consecutive games played pete rose career hits said it's carl ripken's record but i beg to differ infact i think that's the easiest record all one has to do is be in the lineup even when you're hurt one thing i hated about this record i thought barry bonds' record is still the hardest to break i mean bb himself did it with steroids people say a rod will break it but i still have doubts about that to me it's either the hr record or joe dimaggio's hitting streak whatcha think please don't add your own records i am talking about these alone please if we keep seeing sick amounts of homers like we have recently i would think someone catching bonds is quite possible the biggest question for me would be if players like arod decide to retire early since they already have more than enough money to last them and to avoid beating up their bodies further not everyone sticks around through their s i think dimaggio's record is the toughest to break when you factor in the skill and luck needed to hit in straight games same with rose's career hits ty cobb is my favorite old school player to read about and i gotta respect rose's hitting skill when he broke a record of the great ty cobb all cal ripken did was show up though it was a hell of a lot of times in a row lol and it will be extremely difficult to beat but at the end of the day it's just showing up for your job he got the perfect attendance award  Lou Gehrig World Series Babe Ruth Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States Troy Glaus New York Yankees Baseball Home run Cal Ripken, Jr. Joe DiMaggio Alex Rodriguez Hank Aaron ESPN25 October 22 in baseball Game show September 20 in baseball 1957 World Series Satchel Paige Pete Sampras Miguel Tejada Tris Speaker September 6 in baseball Sports timeline June 12 in baseball October 4 in baseball Detroit Tigers Roger Federer Bj__rn Borg International League $ale of the Century Andre Agassi Willie Mays Jim Rice The Joker's Wild New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals The Adventures of Pete & Pete October 5 in baseball 2004 World Series Ted Williams Andr__s Galarraga The Isley Brothers Volleyball Poker jargon November 1 in baseball October 20 in baseball Final Fantasy XI Norway national football team Wayne Gretzky San Francisco Giants Major League Baseball titles streaks Sandy Koufax Baltimore Orioles Mickey Mantle Fast bowling Rickey Henderson Ken Jennings Stolen base June 8 in baseball Wheel of Fortune Snooker Major League Baseball television contracts Indianapolis 500 Batting average Cincinnati Reds November 3 in baseball Chicago White Sox Billboard Hot 100 St. Louis Cardinals Rafael Palmeiro The Sporting News Player of the Year Award NBA Finals Hip hop rivalries Joe Morgan Boston Red Sox Pump It Up Toronto Raptors New England Patriots 24 Hours of Le Mans Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles San Francisco 49ers Jennifer Lopez Super Bowl XXVII Marilyn Monroe Cleveland Browns Nolan Ryan St. Louis Rams English cricket team Brett Favre George Sisler

would a relegation system create more interest in baseball soccer generally has a first division and second division every season the worst two teams are dropped from the first division and the best two are called up from the second division wouldn't this create a greater talent pool and more interest in baseball if the worst team in the nl and al were relegated to the minors every year and the best minor league teams became ml teams it would create a greater minor league fan base greater talent pool and force teams to remain competitive shouldn't mlb consider this i know the owners would hate it but it would be good for the game actually what you are suggesting might hurt the talent pool the way teams are set up the best players in each franchise are in the majors and the ones who are not as good or still need experience stay in the minors excluding specific circumstances in which the player must clear waivers to go to the minors this system ensures that a franchise's major leagures are among the best available if a player does well he's promoted if a player struggles he's demoted in your system an entire team is demoted that's not fair let's say that a bad team has a couple of good players on it don't those couple of players deserve to stay in the majors leave the league the way it is and players move based on their performance regardless of whether or not the rest of the team is playing well besides if teams were moved up and down it would always be the same teams year in and year out the royals and devil rays for instance have small budgets whereas the yankees and red sox can afford much better teams as a result the same teams the ones in need of the most assistance would be penalized most severely  Minor league baseball Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox New York Yankees Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Mets Oakland Athletics Cleveland Indians International League Baltimore Orioles San Francisco Giants Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Salary cap Chicago White Sox Major League Baseball All-Star Game Baseball World Series Montr__al Expos Houston Astros Minnesota Twins Toronto Blue Jays Playoff Seattle Mariners San Diego Padres National Hockey League Sammy Sosa Tampa Bay Devil Rays Detroit Tigers Lou Gehrig Atlanta Braves Washington Nationals Milwaukee Brewers West Bromwich Albion F.C.

what stand should i take with barry bonds and the home run record i asked a question earlier similar to this wasn't convinced with the answers here i go again dude just accomplished something phenomenal he broke the all time home run record i'm a huge sports fan as you can see from the top contributor badge in baketball and i used to own one in baseball lol but here's the thing i'm only i know nothing about what went on years ago who and wat do i believe barry used steroids and acknowledged that but does he still use it did he knowingly cheat you and i don't know so how can we say he cheated after all he wasn't the only one who did it right but here's the thing i think cheating is cheating and those who dishonor the game in any way should be punished but how do i know what barry did back then was wrong or not if steroids weren't even tested back then or weren't considered a way to cheat or gain an unfair advantage well people say performance enhancement what about lazer eye surgery doesn't that improve people's eyes and isn't that performance enhacement why can't they just wear glasses im totally lost and confused with this thing i have mixed feelings about it and i don't know where to take a stand on this issue usually im do my research and im pretty firm in what my opinions are im no bandwagoner but im a true passionate sports fan especially baseball and basketball and it sucks to watch all this crap going on not knowing what is right what is wrong and who to believe and who not to believe christian rollindo what about the referee betting scandal in basketball that sport ain't clean either but then again all major american sports have come under a lot of fire this year ref in nba bonds in mlb and vick and dogfighting in nfl phashant my friend i read this question earlier and i too am very mixed myself so i am going to talk a little about everything here we go barry used steroids please don't argue this do you want to know how i know give me one reason why his trainer is in jail refusing to testify if he doesn't have something to hide about barry using them why would his trainer allow himself to sit in jail and rot for months if he didn't have something to hide is he just bored and wanted to hang out with some of his friends in jail obviously not see there is no reason he would choose to be in jail rather then testifying and keeping his freedom he is there because he is hiding something remember everyone he admitted used the arthritis cream and flax seed oil which obviously was the cream and the clear he just said his trainer lied to him about what they really were yet why would the same trainer lie to him about that and allow himself to be held in contempt by protecting barry and refusing to testify on the matter because he knows something personally i don't barry he skips autographs sessions and shows little respect for the fans this is not only from my experience at giants games but from many people around him including his teammates sports journalists books and newspapers articles and fellow baseball players but that is just my opinion my biggest problem is with baseball the game i loved as a child i grew up watching and reading anything about it i've been to a number of games including in the world series game of the dodgers athletics series when kirk gibson hit that home run of dennis eckersley and in watching ichiro suzuki break and set a new mlb record for most hits in a season i have been to dodger games mariner games giants games angels games padres games a's games rockies games and diamondback games i still love baseball but my deep passion for it is gone watching barry bonds mark mcguire sammy sosa gary sheffield jason giambi rafeal palmeiro all weasel and squirm their way through the court proceedings made me sick not one of them was man enough to admit they took them mark cried sammy faked a lack of understanding of the english language and communication funny he has no problem understanding the english language during interviews hmmmm and the rest of them lied you could see it on their faces those guilty looks it just made me sick and i lost respect for all of them so to me hank is still the home run champ and i will continue to respect the rest of baseball's record for now finally i have to comment of a few things said above just because some people cheat doesn't excuse a person from being responsible not to cheat themseleves and no one is saying bonds wasn't a great player in the early and mid 's but people are suspicious when his numbers started going up in when most players career would have been on the decline because of his age and the fact that is head and body magically ballooned in size that is it i am tired of typing p s players don't wear glasses because of safety concerns no one wants broken glass in their eye many still wear contacts even though some have gotten eye surgery since contacts do pop out and get dirt in them and no i don't believe lasic surgery counts as performance enhancement actually that's kind of funny  Hank Aaron San Francisco Giants New York Yankees Major League Baseball television contracts Reggie Jackson

why did barry bonds shun hr contests he wears body armor for protection against pitchers throwing at him what if his body armor is really a hr hitting assistive device if he wore the armor in hr derbies people would figure it out because he needs no protection against batting proactice lobs he never dared sue people who said they had evidence that he was cheating on steroids his body is likely juiced the ball is juiced too the balls all said cushioned core before mlb needed more homers due to flagging attendance notice the ball does not have that cushioned core message any more so if his balls are juiced and his body too why do we expect him to stop there could he also have a juiced body brace too here is my problem with bonds i personally think he took steroids that is not the problem i have if players want to use that junk more power to them however if it is blantanly obvious that a player took it as i believe bonds did then just come out and admit it his feat is great but keep in mind several facts he isn't professional baseball's all time home run king he is only major league baseball's home run king there is a player in japan how has i believe home runs babe ruth hit home runs all while living a less than healthy lifestyle he drank and ate the most unhealthy food i can imagine hank aaron while not the most gifted athlete was consistent for his entire career bonds has never been a media darling he continuously chides the media and blames them for painting a bad picture bonds and his accomplishment will forever be tarnished by the cloud of suspicion that hangs over him for the steroids i think he will be the first to introduce the asterik era in sports hopefully it will be a reminder to kids playing the game and other sports that in order for history to remember them well they will do it on their own  Baseball Major League Baseball Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Home run World Series History of baseball in the United States Ty Cobb Mark McGwire Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Baseball statistics Boston Red Sox September 20 in baseball Softball Jos__ Canseco Batting average Rafael Palmeiro Chicago White Sox San Francisco Giants Tris Speaker 1957 World Series Willie Mays Manny Ram__rez Ted Williams Mickey Mantle Stolen base September 6 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals October 22 in baseball American football Atlanta Braves Baseball (object) Rickey Henderson Andr__s Galarraga Chicago Cubs New York Mets Pete Rose October 20 in baseball Oakland Athletics Gary Sheffield Volleyball Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball All-Star Game Nolan Ryan October 16 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Alex Rodriguez Ken Griffey, Jr. Negro league baseball Albert Pujols No-hitter Satchel Paige Vin Scully Jimmie Foxx Troy Glaus October 4 in baseball 1919 World Series David Ortiz Fenway Park Sammy Sosa Sports timeline October 27 in baseball Washington Nationals Detroit Tigers Mike Schmidt June 12 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez Shoeless Joe Jackson Curse of the Bambino Sandy Koufax Hank Greenberg Dave Kingman Minor league baseball Derek Jeter Snooker Jason Giambi Roger Clemens Japanese baseball San Diego Padres Old Time Baseball Toronto Blue Jays October 21 in baseball Perfect game International League Jim Rice Paintball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Australian rules football 1981 World Series
