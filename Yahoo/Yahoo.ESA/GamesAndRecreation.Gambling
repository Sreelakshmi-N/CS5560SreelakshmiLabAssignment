black jack question does card counting really still work now a days isn't their like decks in play in most casinos it's not illegal but can't you still get booted from a casino if they indentifiy your betting stratagy as card counting anybody who thinks counting multiple decks is less effective is wrong plain and simple if i suspect someone of counting cards it doesn't matter if it's decks or the same principles apply there are very very few people that can accurately do it with any number of decks though anybody can get a plus minus count on any number of decks with a little practice and easily calculate the count per deck based on it ie if you're running an deck shoe and there are decks left and your running count is you've got a count of per deck simple adjust your bet accordingly what most people don't realize is that the majority of the edge a player can get is play adjustments a good example is that you hit with a against a dealer's now if you've got that count you're going to stay now just that alteration effects such a thing and think about how many possible combinations of plays there are yes you can be removed from casinos but usually what will happen is that the casino will simply tell you that you're welcome to play any game they provide but no more blackjack or they will say that you're welcome to continue playing but you may not adjust your bets or number of hands during a shoe thus negating any advantage you may have  Craps Poker jargon Draw poker Cheating in poker Baccarat Betting (poker) Stud poker Gambling Pai gow poker Cribbage Slot machine Community card poker Skat Card game Poker Card counting Texas hold 'em Extreme Programming Egyptian Ratscrew Shuffle Mao (game) Suit (cards) Canasta Playing card Hearts (game) Doomtown Dice Five-card draw Card Sharks Seven-card stud UNO (game) Sheepshead Monty Hall problem Online poker Principle of indifference Dominoes Omaha hold 'em Yu-Gi-Oh!

what do you do in this nl texas holdem shorthanded game its handed you are bb deep and opponent has you covered oppenent is fairly tight but switches it up alot and is a thinking player you are fairly aggressive and have c bet of the time but you show down the goods you raise it to with a and get a call from middle position the blinds fold the pot is the flop comes you bet and he raises to what do you do if you call what do you do on the turn bet or less the pot as a blocker bet check planning to fold bet more than the pot would any of this change if you had k instead o so sorry sabes the flop has two clubs and you have ad h this is a really tough spot it's tough to imagine that he would call a raise with a in his hand or just call your raise pre flop with j j or a bigger pair than that but you also mention that he is tight so one would believe that he thinks he has the best hand there is a key piece of info missing here though is the flop rainbow it makes a difference since he could be raising with a flush draw i don't think i would fold here it's just too unlikely that he just calls a raise with a pair jacks or better or calls a raise with a in his hand i would have to put him on maybe or or maybe he has a also or possibly k q or j suited or a flush draw if possible and the only hands to really worry about are or a suited and there isn't even much chance of him calling the raise with the second hand that said i think re raising is the best play since we are bb deep if we were shorter i think calling would be the better play because it would commit less money but with such deep stacks you have the chance to re raise and still be able to fold if he comes back over the top re raising should pick us up the pot right here most times and will give us a chance to gain the info we need to possibly fold if necessary calling isn't a really bad option but it kinda puts you to a guess on the turn especially if a high card comes off on the turn folding isn't really bad either but i think there are too many hands we beat and if we had k i think i would probably fold or just call since i could safely put my opponent on a as a more logical possibility this is one of those tough spots in hold'em where all three of the options are ok but you don't really like any of them  Betting (poker) Omaha hold 'em Stud poker Cheating in poker Draw (poker) Poker Seven-card stud Sheepshead Bluff (poker) Blackjack Poker strategy Five-card draw Poker tournament Professional wrestling slang Glossary of American football American football strategy Five-card stud Volleyball Pai gow poker New York Giants Card Sharks Let's Make a Deal Cribbage Hand (poker) Bad beat Mao (game) Kasparov versus The World President (game) Norway national football team Baccarat Craps Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Ruy Lopez $ale of the Century Chess terminology Harmonica Contract bridge Table tennis Game show Dominoes ELO rating system Backgammon Winning Streak Maverick (film) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tic-Tac-Dough Paintball Buffalo Bills Chess strategy and tactics Slot machine Hearts (game) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers American football Wheel of Fortune Big Two Gambling San Francisco 49ers Pete Rose Spades Equine conformation Badminton Eight ball The Joker's Wild T.

question about texas holdem strategy okay i was reading a wikipedia article on poker strategy http en wikipedia org wiki poker strategy and it says that there are other more advanced strategies however i have tried to do some research and i have never found anything that was even more advanced on the net so basically do you guys know any good links or have good info on some advanced strategy ummm queens i think i figured that out quite a while ago that is basic basic basic advice maybe read the article and try to give me something that i dont know this advice in the article is almost completely taken from the theory of poker by david sklansky who is referenced a couple of times as you probably noticed the only more advanced strategy i can think of right now that can help you is the idea of psychological manipulation knowing your opponent and everything about him can really help you when you are playing against people you've never played against in online play that would be his statistical information and to some degree the chat box but in live play the idea gets more complex since you can see and talk to your opponents i'll some live play examples say you are starting a live tournament and seated with a group of people you don't know there is one empty seat to be filled and a man wearing numerous gold chains with an open button down shirt and smoking a cigarette takes the final seat and you notice immediately that he won't stop moving his leg and that he stacks his chips very sloppily what can you assume about this player is he going to be a tight conservative player or will he gamble it up you can safely guess that this guy is going to be pretty loose and aggressive most likely in contrast a very well dressed guy is sitting in another seat very calm and collected and spending a lot of time making his chips very neat and tidy well you can probably guess that this guy doesn't spend too much time actually playing pots if he's got so much time on his hands to stack chips nicely and that he's pretty conservative with his money you ask the man sitting next to you how he entered the tournament and he says he got in through a satellite you can guess that this guy is just here for the ride living the dream and just hoping to scratch into the money you can also guess that he won't be putting a lot of money in the pot without a big hand you ask the man on the other side of you how he entered and he says he bought in directly you then ask what he does for a living and he tells you that he is a bookmaker right away you should know that this guy has the money and will be willing to gamble now these things don't tell you all that much about them until you see them play but they give you at least a small idea since you've never watched them play i don't know how much live poker you play but when you do and you play people you don't know you should make sure to notice these things  Poker Texas hold 'em Betting (poker) Draw poker Craps Poker tournament Cheating in poker Gambling Mahjong Doomtown Online poker Blackjack Star Trek Customizable Card Game Backgammon Tournament Norway national football team World Series of Poker Theory of conduct Prisoner's dilemma Slot machine Baroque chess $ale of the Century Game theory Bluff (poker) EastEnders Contract bridge Wheel of Fortune Maverick (film) Milton H.

what is the best limit to play at nl you get a lot of loose players which i know will i still find some loose players playing but not as many as the reason i ask is that i just played at a casino in detroit everyone at the table was loose didn't raise strong hands like aa or kk even aq i ended up only loosing bucks from my initial investment although i was up a hundred which i should have walked away since i really wasn't getting any cards the entire day i basically won with a little luck with bad cards and maximized my profit when my cards hit because i was called right to the last card no matter wait i play occasionally at this casino and more often then not i will double my money money is not an issue and i feel that i can move up another level obviously since is the lowest limit spread in casinos the worst players are at people often like to say that you should work up a bankroll and start at because the level of play is distinctly different from and therefore you can bluff and get away with more while that is true it is wrong because the game where everyone calls no matter what is more profitable even if you can't bluff  Poker jargon Betting (poker) Craps Blackjack Poker Stud poker Omaha hold 'em Draw poker Texas hold 'em Gambling Backgammon Slot machine Community card poker Baccarat Roulette Sheepshead Cheating in poker National Football League Bluff (poker) Poker tournament Online poker Game show Press Your Luck Contract bridge Video poker Bingo President (game) World Series Winning Streak Yu-Gi-Oh!

casino blackjack is there a statistical reason for winning at a deck shoe and losing at an deck shoe my husband is a black jack dealer in the th largest casino in the world but he finds that when he is required to use decks instead of hardly anyone wins why is this why the difference it's driving him nuts not knowing from looking at the other answers you the hubby aren't the only ones who know nothing about this subject here's the correct answer please ignore all others to keep your i q level from dropping for each deck added to a shoe the house garners a slight advantage about for several reasons first there's an increased probability of larger chunks of low value cards occurring together in the deck making book assumptions of a value card coming out of the shoe next and a value card being in the hole less accurate adding decks also makes it increasingly difficult for players to determine the true count of the cards the count and the true count are different if you have decks in the shoe and the count is after two decks have been dealt the true count is only divided by the number of decks remaining in the shoe decks if the same occurred on an deck shoe the true count would only be so even if you have a player with the remarkable ability to accurately run the count on a shoe and here's the biggest reason for all of this the more decks you have the more count stable the shoe is and the harder it is for the players to have a positive enough true count on the shoe to realize any advantage whether they're keeping track of the count or not of course the deeper into the shoe you go the less this is realized and the more accurate the count would become but the counting player would have to accurately count several decks of cards down over a long time without messing up to determine if he might be at an advantage for the last couple of hands of the shoe not an easy task doesn't matter much though the stability of the count regardless of if someone is counting is the reason deck shoes are tougher to beat than deck shoes which are tougher to beat than double deck games more decks less drastic count swings and with an even count the house is always at an advantage because the dealer goes last  Poker jargon Craps Draw poker Cheating in poker Baccarat Contract bridge Monty Hall problem Skat Betting (poker) Pai gow poker Texas hold 'em Stud poker Card game Canasta Volleyball ELO rating system Suit (cards) Card counting Sheepshead Cribbage Redundant array of independent disks Gambling Online poker Playing card Randomness Dominoes Spades Egyptian Ratscrew Dice Baseball Hearts (game) Fischer Random Chess Card Sharks Piquet Poker Five-card draw Mao (game) Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Prisoner's dilemma Shuffle Ra (board game) Doomsday argument Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Omaha hold 'em Floppy disk Violin Determinism Star Trek Customizable Card Game Tarot (game) Fast bowling Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Gin rummy Badminton Microeconomics Golf Yu-Gi-Oh!

question about poker i'm brand new to this when does it become too late to fold in a game like texas hold'em is it after the first round of betting is over please forgive my ignorance i'm trying to learn well essentially there are two kinds of games when it comes to poker not two kinds of poker but two kinds of games cash ring games and tournaments they differ greatly a cash game is a game you can sit at as long as you have money and every hand you win wins you money you can sit in one hand go all in win and double up and then say sayonara and you've walked away with a profit or go all in and lose everything you have in just one hand in those games the ante never goes up so there's no pressure to hurry up and get a big chip stack as long as you have more than what you started with you win in a cash game it's never too late to fold in a tournament you could arguably say there is a time when it's too late in a tournament the purpose is to work your way up the ladder and place well to do this you need a big chip stack to see you through the increasing antes what happens often is one player makes a bad move or gets unlucky and his chip stack shrinks like a kmart t shirt after about washes if the blinds are up to not real money chip money and he has only it's going to cost him or his stack just to call i've been in many situations where i've had marginally good hands with only blinds are and i was forced to a decision use of my stack on a shakey hand or try my luck in the next round if i tried my luck and it didn't work out i'd be wiped out with the small blind that's the rest of my chip stack so usually i would go for it so if i have like queen ten offsuit and i call and the flop comes a t well i have a decent hand and if i fold i'm going to be out with the next hand so in that case i feel it's too late to fold i'd go all in  Poker tournament Poker Draw poker Craps Cheating in poker Blackjack Tournament Stud poker Slot machine Community card poker World Series of Poker Mahjong Baccarat Omaha hold 'em Sandbagging (poker) Bluff (poker) Game show $ale of the Century Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Roulette Poker strategy Maverick (film) Sheepshead Video poker Gambling Press Your Luck Guilty Gear Doyle Brunson Ra (board game) Magic: The Gathering Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Doomtown Wheel of Fortune Backgammon Bad beat Jeopardy!

about poker pros online poker pros have losing streaks because there is a lot of luck in poker they might have losing days weeks maybe months with online players playing many more hands per hour per table and usually multiple tables at a time their losing streaks should be much shorter than live poker pros so how long does a live poker pro who knows he is a favorite typically need to play to have better than a decent chance of being up rather than being down poker pros do better face to face  Online poker Betting (poker) Poker Poker jargon Slot machine Magic: The Gathering Video poker Draw poker Blackjack World Poker Tour Poker tournament Community card poker Tournament Stud poker Phil Hellmuth Hand (poker) Pai gow poker Roger Federer Dave Ulliott Cheating in poker Caribbean stud poker Bj__rn Borg Late Night Poker Tilt (poker) Sheepshead Norway national football team Gambling World Series of Poker New York Giants Seven-card stud Game show President (game) Craps Stu Ungar Ra (board game) Mahjong Go ranks and ratings Dominoes National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Pinball Poker strategy Maverick (film) Johnny Chan (poker player) World Championship Wrestling Card game New England Patriots Draw (poker) San Francisco 49ers Dice Winning Streak European Poker Tour Ken Jennings Cleveland Browns High card by suit (poker) Buffalo Bills Gus Hansen Omaha hold 'em Leon White Kurt Angle The Joker's Wild The Contender (television series) Orders of magnitude (numbers) Phil Gordon Oh Hell Playing card Rodney Anoai Bill Goldberg Pete Sampras Super Bowl XXVII David Williams (card player) Daniel Negreanu Indianapolis Colts American football Doomtown Super Bowl XXV Josh Arieh Alternate reality game World Series of Poker, 2005 Bluff (poker) Mike Matusow John McEnroe Foxwoods Resort Casino Five-card stud Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Jimmy White T.

i need to learn poker in a day im going to houston for a few days and my cousins are like poker finatics and ive always wanted to play them for money and stuff but i dont know squat about it so i need help what are the rules what are the combinations of cards like flush and stuff like that okay its going to be tough because poker takes years to master im assuming you guys are goiing to be playing texas holdem which is the most popular and common of all the poker games out there lets start with combinations from lowest to highest the lowest is called high card lets say you have a in texas holdem you start off with two cards that only you have the community cards there are cards that everyone gets to see and use are j in poker its all about best five card hand so your hand would be j ace the next combo is a pair thats say you have a again board is a j this time you have a j a a the next combo is two pair lets say you hold a this time you would have two pair if the community cards from the last example were the same you would also have two pair if you had j aj etc ace jack would be the highest two pair and would beat a or ace is always highest and two is always lowest in any combo the next combo is trips thats say you hold the flop first three community cards are you would have trips because you have three 's yea its coomon sense the next combo is the straight it is cards in consecutive order the next hand is called the flush it is of the same suit lets say you hold ac c community cards are c c d s c you would have a flush because you have a all clubs the next combo is the fullhouse it is of a kind and a pair lets say you hold the community cards are k you have sixes and two fives which fullhouse the next combo is four of a kind it means you have four of something the next rank is straight flush it is a straight with a flush lets say you have d d the community cards are d d djcks that would be a straight flush last is royal flush same thing as straight flush except it has to be akqj of all the same suit if you dont understand something go to this source http en wikipedia org wiki poker hands okay now lets discuss the basics of texas holdem you are dealt two cards in the begining this round is called preflop there are two forced bets that are happening preflop and they are called the small and big blind if you are not in the blinds you either fold call or raise if you fold you dont lose any money but your hand is discarded if you call you put in the amount the big blind cost if you raise then you put more money in the pot and anyone that wants to continue to the next round will have to call your raise or reraise your raise when you first start out you want to play big cards from aj ak aa kk qq jj kq once you get the feel of the game play lesser cards like j kj q and so forth however you never ever play cards like a as i mentioned poker is the best card hand lets say you have a and the community cards are a q you have top pair right well its not a good sitation at all as you might think lets say some bets on the flop they could easily have a all the way to ak and their card hand would be better than yours so only play hands even when you think you are better that both have at least the value of ten so dont play j just play j dont play a play a when you get really bett er you may but for now play tight remember these rules only apply when you are playing nine players including you play more hands the less people there are a becomes a very good hand against two oppenenets anyways this is all preflop stuff the next round is the flop the flop is the first of community cards you try to make a hand with these cards if you dont have anything just fold if someone bets if no one bets you can just check not betting but will get you to the next round remember if you check and someone bets you have to call that bet the next round is the turn only one card comes out if you didnt have anything on the flop you should't be here except if you have a draw there are two common draws the flush and teh straight if there are two cards on the flop with the same suit as yours you have aflush draw you still need one more card to complete taht flush a good straight draw is like when you hold the flop is a you can hit a or a to get your straight so its worht it pursuing this straight this straight is called an open ended straight a straight draw not to pursue is if you held and the flop comes out j first you are drawing to the end of the straight and if teh ten does come out someone could easily have qk another reason is you can only hit a ten while the orevuous example you had cards to hit of course you dont always pursue flushes and opened ended straights either you have to ge ta good price for your draw no matter what it is anways as i said one card comes on the turn if some one bets to you and you dont have at least top pair with a kicker higher than you should probaly fold also its always better to be the one betting not calling on the river the last card comes if you have a decent hand you want to value bet you put your oppenent on a hand if you beat the hand you put him on then bet a certain amount where you think he woill call if you cant beat any hands just check if you dont know the pot is good if you get reraised just fold here are more links if you dont understand or need more

what are sweetheart teasers i know it has something to do with sports bets with a regular teaser you have to pick teams and you get a certain number of points off the point spread but you have to win all games ex you bet to win the patriots may be a point favorite but if you tease them up points you will be getting points and they become an underdog you pick other teams you get the points for each one but you have to win all games with a sweetheart teaser you have to pick games but you get a whopping points toward your spread and it usually pays so in the above example the patriots would now be a point underdog getting points instead of a point favorite points is a lot in football but picking games correct is still difficult  Spread betting Sports betting Gambling Super Bowl XXXVI New England Patriots Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXXIX Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl XXXI St. Louis Rams National Football League New York Giants Wayne Gretzky Cleveland Browns National Football League Lore New York Jets Blackjack Indianapolis Colts Buffalo Bills January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XVII Donovan McNabb Cincinnati Bengals Norway national football team Pittsburgh Steelers Hoosiers Jacksonville Jaguars Carolina Panthers New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Los Angeles Clippers Craps Betting (poker) Gaelic football Super Bowl XIV Pete Rose Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXV San Diego Chargers Wheel of Fortune Chicago Bulls 2004 NBA Finals American Football League Super Bowl XX 1919 World Series Bowl Championship Series New York Knicks ELO rating system Tom Brady Boston Bruins Super Bowl XXI Dodgeball New York Yankees Rugby union Super Bowl XXXIII Sport Club Corinthians Paulista Montreal Canadiens Match fixing New York Mets Washington State University 2002-03 NHL season Ultimate (sport) ESPN25 Terrell Owens Monday Night Football Mario Lemieux Super Bowl AFL-NFL Merger Randy Moss Super Bowl XXIX Miami Dolphins The Football League Game show Poker jargon Super Bowl XI Playoff Hubert H.

can anyone expain betting football games to me i am moving to vegas and was going to start betting nfl games there is this guy who is professional he checks out and he is going to give me the picks anyhow what is a unit in betting and if i bet one unit could i make more from that one bet any info on bettinbg will be much aprreciated dont worry iam only betting bucks at a time the content below was taken from my site http gamblingreviewssite com you will also find guides to wagering on other sports as well as free daily sports picks betting stats odds lines and free tips wagering menus for american football includes but is not limited to the following wagers pointspread and total for the entire game pointspread and total for each individual half pointspread and total for each individual quarter moneyline for each game proposition wagers point buying for betting purposes unless otherwise stipulated games are official after minutes of play teams must play for there to be action all wagers included all leagues included pointspread over under wagers sportsbooks offer pointspread and over under betting on american football on a pointspread wager the team wagered must win by the pointspread on an over under wager the total points of the contest by both teams overtime included must fall over or under the side selected example the posted line is san francisco at st louis and the over under total is the odds are to win unless otherwise indicated for the player who wagers on san francisco they must win by more than points for this to be a winning wager for the player who wagers on st louis they must either win the game or lose by less than points for this to be a winning wager if the outcome falls on the number either way the bet is declared a push and the original stake is refunded for the player who wagers on the total points of this contest by both teams to be over the combined final score of both teams must exceed for the player who wagers on the total points of this contest by both teams to be under the combined final score of both teams must be less than if the outcome falls on the number the bet is declared a push and the original stake is refunded pointspread and over under lines will be offered on all nfl afl and ncaa contests all wagers on the side total will include all overtime scoring halftime wagers sportsbooks offer halftime wagering on american football halftime wagering is simply a wager only on the score of the first or second half of a contest the line offered will be a pointspread a moneyline or a combination of the two but the wager applies only to the score of the halftime period specified first half lines will be offered on all nfl and ncaa contests and will be released mid week allowing ample time to get action on these events second half lines will be offered on all nfl and the majority of ncaa contests and will be offered within minutes of the end of the first half of the contest wagers may be parlayed to other contests but a first half wager may not be parlayed to any other wager from the same game no teaser plays or buying of points is allowed on halftime wagers overtime periods are included as part of the second half the full half first or second must be played for action quarter wagers wagering on quarters is simply a wager only on the score of the first second third or fourth quarter of a contest these lines will be offered on marquee events such as monday night football sunday night games and bowl games the line offered will be a pointspread a moneyline or a combination of the two but the wager applies only to the score of the quarter specified quarter lines will be released the day of the game allowing ample time to get action on these events all quarter lines will come down at kickoff wagers may be parlayed to other contests but a quarter wager may not be parlayed to any other wager from the same game overtime scoring is not included in fourth quarter wagers moneyline wagers moneyline wagering is simply wagering on the contest based on a given price rather than a pointspread the team wagered on just has to win the game example a player could choose one of two wagers on the following matchup san francisco at st louis if san francisco wins then the player laid to win if st louis wins then the player who bet wins moneylines will be offered on most nfl and ncaa contests and will normally be available on the morning of the game moneyline wagers may be parlayed to other contests but a moneyline wager may not be parlayed to any other wager from the same game point buying this is a method of allowing the bettor to improve the pointspread of a football contest by actually buying points for the team he she wants to wager side or total bettors can buy points in point increments up to points depending on the contest each point costs the bettor an additional vigorish example the denver broncos are playing the kansas city chiefs and the line on the game is the broncos with a total of if a wager is placed on the broncos with a point buy the player has a wager on the broncos points and must put up to win instead of the usual to win if the player for example requests a full point buy to move the pointspread down to he she would have to put up to win buying the pointspread down points to would cost to win and the full point buy down to would cost the bettor to win conversely the bettor may also buy points on the chiefs side and get the line at plus or points all the way up to plus points with the same increase in vigorish bettors may also buy points for football totals in this particular game bettors could buy an over wager with a maximum line move down to or an under wager with a maximum line move up to point buying to a maximum of points will be offered on all nfl and ncaa contests first points will be charged an additional vigorish and and will be charged an additional vigorish bettors will be charged an additional vigorish to buy on and or off of the number in the nfl point buying will not be offered on halftime quarter or moneyline wagers proposition wagers sportsbooks offers a wide variety of proposition wagers props wagers include offers such as completions by peyton manning over under  September 2005 in sports Monday Night Football Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXIV Football

can any gamblers answer this looks at the typical problem of the 'gamblers lament' a gambler plays a game with a cost of where the chances of winning are percent the return or loss is if the gambler wins and then loses he ends up with if he loses first sending him down to and then wins he also ends up with so he wins as often as he loses but he's still on the fast track to the poorhouse how do you account for this alejandro you're on the right track but thats not right alba sure your scenario makes sense but the scenario here involves a return or loss its not double or nothing thats something you've added for your convenience there is a very good answer by the way nice tries guys and some of you were close win lose and lose win will happen only half the time chance of lose lose end result win win end result add up the losses amount when you win then win each is equally likely overall expectancy however like the last responder mentioned you're very close to and betting your entire stack each time random walk says you're going to hit most likely when this method start with a bankroll of units and bet unit each time and you wont move that much in the long run any problems with my answer how do you account for what you are only setting up a scenario the way you want it to happen so if you lose first drop to and then win you are at you are just as likely for this to to win in a row or lose in a row the only thing different here is that you are betting differently every time  Gambling Poker jargon Gambler's fallacy Sports betting Craps Slot machine Betting (poker) Roulette Monty Hall problem Martingale 1919 World Series Backgammon Wheel of Fortune $ale of the Century Chess terminology 2005 World Series World Series ELO rating system Dice Ra (board game) Microeconomics English cricket team Card Sharks 1957 World Series Random walk Draw poker Theory of conduct GunBound Press Your Luck West Indian cricket team Prisoner's dilemma Badminton Natural Selection (computer game) Ken Jennings Risk management Radar Spread betting Winning Streak Computer chess Pinball Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Civilization III 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Super Bowl XXXVI Probability Dynamic random access memory New York Giants History of Test cricket (to 1883) Volleyball Table tennis Laws of cricket FA Cup Transformation problem Chicago Cubs Drag racing Bayesian inference Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Tic-Tac-Dough Objective-C Ethernet Deflation (economics) Counter-Strike Stud poker Tic-tac-toe Halting problem Norway national football team Strategic management Online gambling Kasparov versus The World Scenario planning Inverse gambler's fallacy Shogi Detroit Tigers Family Feud Game show Bowl Championship Series Shen Gong Wu Baccarat Pete Rose Community card poker Theodicy Chess strategy and tactics The Price Is Right 2005 English cricket season Insurance Ruy Lopez Redundant array of independent disks Transmission Control Protocol Solar cell Remix Brian Close

river rats are killing me in poker ok so i lost about the other night with buy ins now im not one to really believe in luck steaks since the cards lack the muscular strength to reposition themselves in someones favor but every single time i was all in this stupid fucking idiot dumbass would call with the worst hands ive ever seen anyone play im talking suited offsuit offsuit everytime i went all in i had him dominated yet every single time he got extremely lucky and beat me there was one time where i moved all in with pocket aces and hit an ace on the flop the only out he had with his offsuit which he called for pre flop in a blind game was for him to hit a and a queen to make his straight for the flop was a j so automatically i think im going to take it with trip aces yet once again he fucking drew out and hit running q now he is honestly the worst player i've ever seen but how can i beat someone who has the worst hand everytime and still wins by the river i've seen the same number hit times in a row on a roulette table that's a in it's not that surprising that someone can hit a lucky streak pushing in with junk anyway you're still going to beat that guy in the long run i understand your frustration but take solace in the fact that in the long run that guy's going to blow his whole bankroll times over and eventually he'll have to learn to play or quit the short term answer is easy move to a different table you're obviously playing online and there's probably other tables with those same limits you could sit at otherwise just keep playing smart and wait for his luck to run out it may seem like you're going to lose everything you have but keep in mind if you were going to play 'professional' poker at that table you'd need a total bankroll of somewhere in the range of to even out the highs and lows you could also move to a limit or pl table where you can't bust out your whole stack so quickly  Texas hold 'em Blackjack Draw poker Omaha hold 'em Betting (poker) Poker Stud poker Community card poker Pai gow poker Craps Cheating in poker Game show Sheepshead Egyptian Ratscrew Draw (poker) Roulette World Series President (game) Backgammon Hand (poker) Chicago White Sox Snooker Billiards Doomtown Big Two Hearts (game) Four square Online poker Bad beat Skat Poker tournament New York Giants Tournament Poker strategy Andre Agassi Wayne Gretzky Dominoes Finesse Mike Matusow The Contender (television series) Pete Sampras 24 Hours of Le Mans Magic: The Gathering Spades Ace-to-five low Card game Team Fortress Classic Press Your Luck Detroit Tigers Slot machine Shuffle Caribbean stud poker New England Patriots Mahjong 2005 English cricket season Eight ball Table tennis Canasta San Francisco Giants Pinball Euchre Maverick (film) Monty Hall problem Video poker Playing card Ken Jennings Harmonica Norway national football team ELO rating system Doyle Brunson St. Louis Cardinals Oh Hell Zerg Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Blue Jays Extreme Championship Wrestling Limit Break High card by suit (poker) World Poker Tour Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Orders of magnitude (numbers) Tilt (poker) Paul Morphy Seven-card stud San Francisco 49ers Tenshinhan Atlanta Braves New York Mets

can you call a bet in a nl holdem cash game wiht a small pp lets say you have in mp you raise it to twelve times the bb he reraises you to thirty six on the button he has a huge bet range do you call or fold effective stacks are bb would it change if effective stacks were bb would it change if he was on the bb sabes actaully if he has a wider range of reraising preflop i dont see how you can call lets say flop comes out a theres a huge chance he doesnt actually have the ace and you wont stand to win a lot of money on the other hand if he has a smaller range and the flop comes out a you can put him on the ace and bet accordingly why would someone with a large range be not scared of an ace and if you dont lead out and bet you dont know whether he hit or is just c betting are you just going to check call all the way to the river o yea another point how does your oppenent holding jj get you to be paid off okay you say checkraise which most times will be a bluff this cost alot of money and many times he will actually have something lets say he has at least a j with at least a higher kicker than yours which is going to happen of the time are you going to check raise with all these overcards that he may have hit if you're right you win a decent pot but if your check raise gets called you're going to lose alot of money because check raise bluffs to be effective have to be at least the size of the orignal bet and are usally it's not generally called a bet in a no limit game that's more of a limit term you raise to three times the big blind which is a fairly standard raise in most games another player re raises you three times your raise to so now you have to put in more to see a flop the problem is what can you beat he clearly likes his hand or is completely bluffing but even against a bluff there is a pretty good chance he has two over cards to your hand he could have j or q or something equally unimpressive but even with such a mediocre hand you win just of the time so the problem with calling here is that against most over cards and it is unlikely that he doesn't have over cards to you are in a coin flip if he has a pair of sixes or better you are a substantial dog against you are only going to flop a set one in times if you miss the flop a face card comes on the flop and he bets into you what then a stubborn call do you really want to call off the rest of your stack in the hopes he is being overly aggressive with ak and doesn't hit as nice as a pocket pair looks especially after a run of bad cards a low pocket pair like this is rarely any good against this kind of action unless you have a powerful read on this player you probably want to release your hand and move on to the next it certainly doesn't seem like you are in a favorable spot here  Omaha hold 'em Blackjack Bluff (poker) Poker Slot machine Stud poker Cheating in poker Community card poker Craps Pai gow poker Sandbagging (poker) Sheepshead Cribbage Draw (poker) Baccarat Gambling President (game) Hand (poker) Egyptian Ratscrew Monty Hall problem Dice Paintball Bad beat Ra (board game) Game show Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Skat Sports betting Seven-card stud Maverick (film) Let's Make a Deal Aerial (dance move) Video poker Piquet $ale of the Century Dominoes Online poker Credit card Norway national football team Hearts (game) Five-card stud Wheel of Fortune English cricket team Caribbean stud poker Volleyball GunZ The Duel Pai Gow Pittsburgh Steelers Card Sharks Contract bridge Winning Streak Equine conformation Star Trek Customizable Card Game Collision detection Coin flipping Extreme Programming Magic: The Gathering Playing card Roulette The Amazing Race Monopoly (game) Three card monte CPU design 1919 World Series Mahjong GunBound Octopus card Gramophone record Microeconomics National Football League Floppy disk Yu-Gi-Oh!

to be a good poker player what do you have to know things like odds and probabilities and things what else thanks you need to know alot of things to be a good poker player but thats talk numbers first the most important mathmatical thing in texas holdem is pot odds you have to use pot odds when you hold a draw like a flush or straight draw a draw is when you need one more card to complete the combo anyways have you ever had a flush draw but someone went allin you know you need one more card for that flush so is it worth it to call to try to complete your flush the first step is to look at your draws and ask yourselves what your hands odds are to find your hand oddsyou should first find out how many outs you have outs are the number of cards out there that are not used yet that will complete your draw lets say you have a flush draw and you hold ksjs the flop comes out s s d you need one more spade for that flush to be complete you have of them and the board has two of them that is that are already used there are spades in the deck and as i said are already in use that leaves spades that can complete your draw so you have outs okay next we need to find out what the chances of completing are draw is here is an easy rule to remember multiply your outs by and then subtract one to find your hand odds by the river okay so with our flush draw with aouts we multiply that by and then subtract that is or you can multiply your outs by and then subtract by one for any and every draw on the flop once you get to the turn you only have one more chance now you can only multiply your outs by but you can add one so now you have a or chance by the river to complete your draw lets say the turn brings out c you would now use this rule remember these rules arent completely accurate and maybe will be off a little anyways your hand odds on the flop would be and on the turn so what do you do with hand odds you are suppose to compare your hand odds to your pot odds if the pot odds are less than the hand odds it a good call if its more than its a bad call well now we have to know how to find your pot odds lets go back to the previous example where you hold ksjs thats say preflop you raise it times the bb which is with your hand on the button so you raise it to six and get callers both on the blinds the pot is now the flop comes s s d the small blind bets the big blind folds so what do you do with your flush draw well lets look at your pot odds the pot is and it costs you to call pot odds is the ratio to call to the pot so your pot odds would be or close to it would be okay to call because your pot odds would be while your hand odds would be the turn comes c the pot is now and he bets now you have to call to win or close to again however your hand odds are this time your hand odds is less than pot odds so you should fold well thats about it for pot odds if you dont understand anything check out this link http en wikipedia org wiki pot odds also heres a good probability link not useful but you never know http en wikipedia org wiki poker probability texas hold 'em when you first start you want to play a tight game play only quality hands play only aa kk qq jj ak aq thats all once you get the idea start playing a couple worse hands like aj kj and suited connectors here is a good guide to what to play depending on your position http www pokerjesusonline com starting hand chart htm once you start using the guide for one month stop using it and do your own thing remember its just a guide and you want to adept to your oppenents also your oppenent can read you like a book if you keep using this guide know when to fold when you are beat like letting go of pocket aces on a coordinated board learn how much you should bet to manipulate pot odds know how to capitilize on position i was just reading some above posts and one person gave really solid advice until i read the earlier the position the better wrong the later the better you get alot more info let me give you an example thats say you hold kj utg first person to act preflop its a game and you raise it to normal raise preflop you get raised to by someone on the button what do you do well you arent ahead of anything that reraises and maybe even money with pocket s and lower you are down big time against any ace with a jack kicker and higher and you are still down versus any ace you are down big time against any pocketpair higher than pocket 's and against any king kq kk but you decide that since you have a king you want to call the flop comes out k you bet into a pot of he calls now you decide that since he just called he is weak you bet the into he reraises you allin now you lost half your stack on a hand that can hardly beat anything good you are forced to fold now you should have folded preflop and stopped betting after the flop is done however if you had position you probaly would have saved at least dollars on the turn calling on the button with kj isnt a bad move and calling the flop when the king came out wasnt bad maybe a raise to get information would be better however when he bet you should probaly fold because as i said kj isnt too great a hand anways position gives you a whole bunch more of information the worse the hand the better position you need know how to play suited connectors know how to bluff and semibluff know when to slowplay and when to just bet of the time you need to be agressive and bet know your oppenents and their tells betting and facial once you get the feel of the game start varying your play like raising with suited connectors or trash hands like thats all i can think of this article will expend on most if not all these points http en wikipedia org wiki poker strategy if you cant find somne points i mentioned in this link just google it build a library and stock it with this once you get the above some is limit some is nl anything skalansky writes really depends barry greenstiens book ace on the river limit

what would you do if you won the lottery right now at million dollars what charities would you give to and how much what would you do with the rest of your money would you invest best list wins i'd go collect the money then i would sit down with a good accountant and figure out how best to invest it keep in mind that after tax and deductions if you take the lump sum you are probably going to end up with m or so i'd want to make sure before i start giving money away that my money was safe and i had all the things i want in life i want to make sure that my financial future was secure after about a year once the initial shock of that kind of money had began to wear off i'd see about either donating or founding a charity organization there are all kinds of horror stories of lottery winners ending up broke in jail dead or otherwise unhappy the trick to avoiding this kind of situation is not to simply go crazy and start blowing your money giving it to charity giving it to friends and family you have to be sensible and slow to act it's a bit like cars if you drive a ford focus base model and then someone buys you a porsche turbo you don't want to start getting crazy with it you really want to be ultra careful and teach yourself what it can do before you start to experiment for most people who are not born rich this is an almost incomprehensible amount of money so you have to take things slow and really plan what you are going to do or before you know it you will one day wake up in a pool of your own vomit and wonder how you managed to blow your lottery win and ruin your life  Microeconomics Inflation Lottery Flat tax Capital accumulation United Kingdom corporation tax Mutual fund Life insurance Annuity National Kidney Foundation Singapore Insurance Advance fee fraud Tax Social Security (United States) 24 Hours of Le Mans Confidence trick Gross domestic product Hybrid vehicle Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 1957 World Series Charles Ponzi Poker jargon Knots Landing Deflation (economics) Florida Lottery Donald Trump Gambling The Apprentice 2 Ocean's Twelve FairTax Warren Buffett MMORPG The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Bretton Woods system Live 8 Meat Loaf Wheel of Fortune Personal finance Progressive tax Supply-side economics Keynesian economics Green Day Hyperinflation Drag racing Government debt Indianapolis 500 Ponzi scheme Public policy Trust (Law) USA Jon Secada Hedge fund Mortgage Bank Automobile Money Economy of Russia Jeopardy!

what makes a winner what makes a winner winner is a personality type an attitude a state of mind it's also an image that other people read and respond to a winner will always get a date make money and yes beat the casino to be a winner you have to think and act like one here's a quick guide how to transform into a real hardcore winner how many times have you seen this scene in a casino you're sitting in the corner of your blackjack table having an even game and the beauty in the opposite table won't give you the time of day up till now everyone around you are pretty much the same and then in he comes throwing his jacket in a swift smooth motion sitting in the center of the hottest table with a glass of fine scotch the hostess served him on the house and then he starts winning and then the beauty you've been mooning over starts making eyes at him he's not a better player than you he's not better looking he's not richer and he's not smarter but he got the winner's aura and that makes a world of difference the good news is that everyone can transform into a winner the not so great news is that to be a winner you have to work hard if you're ready to make that transformation here is valuable advice you should take to heart mental work think like a winner i know that sounds trivial but this is the foundation of anything to follow our consciousness and perspective determines who we are how other see us and consequently how we live from the day we are born we are embedded with rock hard behavior patterns that don't always work for our benefit parents teachers and others teach us to be good but that usually means disciplined quiet and passive we are reared to obey people that aren't that smarter than us yes i'm talking about your boss and keep our feelings and instincts to ourselves the bottom line is we are told to accept reality according to norms and act by them well the first thing about being a winner is to defy what was presented to us as obvious and objective and the place society seems to allocate for you no more taking orders for granted from now on you determine your goals and wills i'm not saying beat up your boss but even when you are doing what you have to when you don't want to do it your own way think james bond he always accomplishes the mission m lays down on him but he stays wild while doing it how to start the change simply picture yourselves as winners take a scenario with a winner who you consider an ideal type and plant yourself in the picture imagine yourselves in all kind of scenes and then create scripts of the 'winnerish' way to handle them how it works well our thoughts these intangible abstract shadows can change matter both our thoughts and the matter we are made of are created of the same tiny units called quantum there's a great movie about it called what the bleep do we know i recommend minutes of winner thinking every morning as soon as you wake up and an extra at night you can take another one focusing on casino wins for advanced training look up nlp talk like a winner when you're talking about yourself think big and focus on a positive message when a winner tells a story or describes a situations he always positions himself as the center of the plot i saw winners who worked in the mail room that could carry a story about themselves that would made senior executives feel small think of it this way if your life were a movie would you settle for a supportive role when you should be the lead keep your speech interesting do not be monotonous in tone or content because that's just boring be a little dramatic when you talk about yourself but never push it or you'll lose your credibility act like a winner this is the other end of the previous tip when it comes to losing no explanations no apologies and above all no temper tantrums a sore loser is an ugly sight don't try to explain why you lost the game don't get all apologetic about the money you lost you can figure all that out privately in public be as gracious as a prince you can always compensate for this in your next win by sharing your wisdom in those stories we talked about before  Poker jargon Milton H.

what wouldbe the minimum hand you would call or raise on in texas holdem pretend the cards are not paired or of the same suit what would be the minimum hand you would call or raise on also what would be the minimum pair you would call on such as a pair of s thanks a lot okay this really depends whether this is preflop flop turn or river i assume preflop because postflop its pretty self explanatory even though you said not to talk about paired cards pocket pairs ima still talk about them because they make up a huge range of your starting hands when you first start okay minumum hand time it really depends on whether you are a beginner or have been playing for like months and are just curious of what other people think if you are a beginner its quite simple just play aa kk qq jj ak aq raise with them in any position if the pot is already opened somone in front of you already bet re raise times their bet if you get reraised or pushed allin after you reraised fold jj aq and ak call the allin with all other hands with the pocket pairs two of the same cards like jj you want to flop an overpair or hit a set trips if you dont just check fold with ak or aq you want top pair after the flop otherwise just check fold eventually you will want to continuation bet but for now just play it straightforwardly okay do this for at least like weeks until you get the feel of the game then start loosening up play more hands now position becomes much much more important preflop and postflop let me give you an example you are playing in a bb stack and you are covered by your oppenent you have kj utg first to act preflop you raise it to x the bb is a normal raise preflop now you get reraised by someone in middle position to do you call you are beaten by almost all hands that would reraise in the first place like kq kk aj aq ak and aa lets say you call you are also first to act on the flop the blinds are the last to act preflop but first to act on all other betting rounds but they folded this time the flop comes out k q you have top pair with a crappy kicker the pot is and you bet he reraised you to you are forced to fold because you can hardly beat anything that would have reraised preflop and reraised on the flop you should have folded preflop btw however if you were on the button to last person to act preflop and last to act on all other betting rounds you could have more information and if faced with a raise preflop could just fold or call if facing a loose player you could also open the pot if no one else has and theres a way smaller chance that any one else is going to call you or raise you even if you are called you have more information after preflop anways heres a reallly goood chart for you to use in a limit or no limit texas holdem game it says limit but dont worry about it http www pokerjesusonline com starting hand chart htm the only thing i disagree with with the starting hand requirements is of suited connectors and pocket pairs suited connectors down to you should call if they have a stack as big as yours or bigger and if you have at least bb only call times the bb at most in middle position and late position with small pocket pairs from same amount of bb but you can call up to times the bb in any position its really informative but after you used it for months dont keep using it its only a guide and they can read you like a book if they are observant and notice you do what that so and so website or book says anways remember play really tight first and loosen up gradually until you are not comfortable anymore gl with poker  Community card poker Stud poker Seven-card stud Blackjack Poker Five-card stud Poker tournament Cheating in poker Hand (poker) Craps Sandbagging (poker) Bluff (poker) Poker strategy Draw (poker) Contract bridge Strap-on dildo President (game) Sheepshead Wheel of Fortune Slot machine Pai gow poker Mahjong Aerial (dance move) Online poker Pai Gow Snooker Clarinet American football strategy Harmonica Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Contender (television series) Card game Video poker New York Giants Gambling Star Trek Customizable Card Game Baseball National Football League Caribbean stud poker Violin Volleyball Floppy disk Winning Streak Let's Make a Deal Mattress Timpani Textile manufacturing Cheating in Counter-Strike Fischer Random Chess Badminton Social rule Skat Chess strategy and tactics Canasta Japanese tea ceremony Norway national football team Spades T.

what do you think of rebuy tournaments i've noticed there are a number of low buy in rebuys tournaments available what do you think of rebuys is it worth it to enter if i don't have enough to make a rebuy i've managed to survive a few low limit rebuys without rebuying but it's tough three is a lot of maniacal play during the rebuy period you have to play extremely tight and avoid connectors and suits in favor of solid hands drawing hands that usually can pay off well in big pots with a lot of players will quickly fall by the wayside since so many players are just taking shots if you have a few bucks i'd recommend at least taking the usually offered add on or the bonus chips they offer at the start of the tournament it's good to frontload your stack to be able to keep up with the frequent large bets best thing about not taking rebuys is the huge payback you can get if you hit the top or if you don't tilt easily and can handle watching some insane hands take huge pots i'd say go for it they payoff can be too big to ignore for such a low outlay  Betting (poker) Craps Draw poker Blackjack Poker tournament Snooker Stud poker Texas hold 'em Omaha hold 'em Slot machine Poker $ale of the Century Paintball Contract bridge Team Fortress Classic ELO rating system Video poker Volleyball Cheating in Counter-Strike Fischer Random Chess Norway national football team Billiards Extreme Programming M16 (rifle) Star Trek Customizable Card Game Tournament Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Dominoes Cheating in poker Hearts (game) Card Sharks Winning Streak Sheepshead Football (soccer) Tennis Draw (poker) Guilty Gear Grand Theft Auto (game) Diving Andre Agassi Satchel Paige Baccarat Community card poker Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Blood (computer game) Piccolo Junior Saga Counter-Strike Ravi Shastri GunBound Pinball The Championships, Wimbledon Wheel of Fortune Major League Baseball television contracts Unreal Mahjong PGA European Tour Canasta Car handling Five-card draw CPU design Ra (board game) RuneScape weapons Hand (poker) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Unreal Tournament 2004 Universal Serial Bus MMORPG UNO (game) Knife Magic: The Gathering Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Atari 8-bit family K' Double bass Leeds United F.C.

two different kinds of freerolls i play on both poker stars and pacific poker it's interesting how different the freeroll systems are on poker stars you start with in chips blinds and minute levels on pacific you start with in chips blinds but levels go up every minutes freeroll or not how would you adjust your play according to these parameters you've gotta take more shots with the shorter time periods even though it's against better poker play rules you've got to get your chips in when you've got a hand and just hold your breath and go for it it's the only way to get any kind of position or stack for later in the tournament you've gotta build a big stack quickly or you won't be able to keep up with the fast climbing blinds later low stack short period freerolls are a crapshoot and you've got to play them that way  Poker jargon Poker tournament Poker Texas hold 'em World Series of Poker Betting (poker) Draw poker Online poker Craps Hand (poker) Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Cheating in poker Orders of magnitude (numbers) Stud poker Community card poker Doyle Brunson Late Night Poker Slot machine Tie (draw) Pai gow poker World Poker Tour Volleyball Big Two Card game Maverick (film) T.

what's your favorite game to play at a casino for example blackjack craps slots poker roulette other craps the next time you are in the casino stop and listen when you approach the table games from the craps pit you will probably hear whooping and hollering as you see high fives and other animated gestures coming from the players craps is by far the most exciting game in the casino and the players are not afraid to let their emotions show the game is fast moving and at times very loud it is for this reason that craps is probably the most intimidating game to new players if you feel this way you are not alone many players would like to learn how to play craps but the thought of approaching a craps table scares them it was a few years into my casino visits before i decided to find out what this game was all about and learn how to play craps i knew that a pass line bet in craps with its low house edge of percent made it one of the best bets in the casino this gave me the incentive to take the plunge and learn how to play craps it was a decision that i have never regretted i love playing craps and over the years i have introduced many friends to this exciting game craps is not as confusing as it looks it actually is an easy game to learn an understanding of the basics of the game and how to make a passline bet will get you started on your way you don t have to be concerned with any other of the craps bets when you begin to play craps there are about different bets that can be made on a craps layout but most of them like the proposition and hardway bets have terrible odds that you should avoid to get started playing craps all you need to understand is the basic passline bet passline bet a simple passline bet works like this you place your bet on the passline before a new shooter begins his roll this is known as the come out roll if the shooter rolls a or you win if the shooter rolls a or you lose if the shooter rolls any other number that number becomes the point number the shooter must roll that number again before a seven is rolled if that happens you win even money for your passline bet if a seven is rolled before the point number is rolled again you lose example a new shooter rolls the dice for the first time and they land on a and a the total is six which becomes the point the dealers places a marker that looks like a hockey puck on the number on the craps layout the shooter must now roll a six before he rolls a if he rolls the six the passline bet wins and the shooter rolls again this is a new comeout roll and the same procedure applies as the first time the shooter rolled the dice if the shooter rolls a seven before the six the pass line bet loses and the dice are passed to the next shooter odds bet once the point is established the bettor can make an additional bet behind the passline bet this is known as the odds bet it is the only bet in the casino that does not have a house edge as it is paid off with true odds most casinos offer double odds which means you can make a bet twice the size of your pass line bet if you passline bet is you are allowed to make an odds bet of the odds bet is paid as following if the point is or it pays to if the point is or it pays to if the point is or it pays to a passline bet is the simplest bet you can make on at the craps table and it will get you on your way to playing this exciting game an easy way to learn how to play craps is to take advantage of the free lessons offered by many of the casinos the instruction will give you the basics and also show you some of the table etiquette that will make you feels more comfortable approaching the table  Baccarat Dice Draw poker Foxwoods Resort Casino Slot machine Sports betting Backgammon Online casino Video poker Pai gow poker Poker Online poker Cheating in poker Contract bridge Texas hold 'em Spread betting Dominoes Community card poker Poker tournament Caribbean stud poker Sydney Riot of 1879 Fischer Random Chess History of Test cricket (to 1883) Counter-Strike Hearts (game) Online gambling Mahjong Winning Streak Game show Monopoly (game) Monty Hall problem Seven-card stud Advanced Squad Leader Ice hockey Montreal Casino Rain Man Card counting Volleyball Ra (board game) Golf Pai Gow High Rollers Omaha hold 'em Sandbagging (poker) Card game Five-card draw Table tennis Probability Billiards Prisoner's dilemma Stu Ungar Tournament Scenes from a Memory The Football League Pinball Casino token RISC Neopets Three card monte Hardware random number generator Mao (game) English cricket team Memoir '44 1919 World Series Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

texas hold'em tournament ruling so i was in a heads up hand and the river card gave me a straight and the winning hand without the river card i would have lost the other guy caught a of a kind on the river there was talk around the table you know normal stuff he got a straight it beats a of a kind then i rake in the chips while i am raking a good minute goes by and someone says that the river didn't have a burn card the guy that says this is holding the stack of muck is the host and his father is the one i am in the hand against so they then proceed without any research to burn the card that helped me to burn the river card and put out another river what is the proper way to handle this in las vegas if it has been prov en that a card had not been burned by the surveillance dept then the card that was the river would become the burn and another card will be dealt as the river  Poker jargon Texas hold 'em Draw poker Blackjack Card game Community card poker Pai gow poker Poker tournament Professional wrestling match types Poker Cheating in poker Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game President (game) Hand (poker) Mahjong Big Two Draw (poker) Contract bridge Omaha hold 'em Aerial (dance move) Wheel of Fortune Skat World Series of Poker Stud poker Craps Card Sharks Egyptian Ratscrew Cleveland Browns Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

question about being the big stack i've been having this problem lately my bankroll take a major hit so i've been playing mainly freerolls i have no trouble dodging maniacs and then catching them off guard when i have premium hands and doubling up and then using my prescence to intimidate the weaker players and thus building a huge stack in the early and middle stages of a tournament however these tournaments i enter have anywhere between and people and only or so actually get anything when it comes to crunch time the last few hundred people or so i falter and i see my stack slowly start to dwindle away i'm not a table bully i just play my game adjusting only to put pressure on the smaller stacks but i don't loosen up much until antes come in then i may limp in with marginal hands and i don't feel it's my duty to take out smaller stakes so i don't take a lot of risks and yet i've gone out on the bubble pretty consistently any tips i have played in thousands of tournaments anywhere from casinos to online to freerolls online to free bar poker leagues to friendly house games i have made final table or have won at least of the time you have to turn into more of that table bully that you say you are not and get more aggressive with your betting and preflop play you would be surprised how many people are like you and just try to limp into a pot to see a flop even in the late stages of tournaments if you are going to enter into any pots this late in the game you need to be raising and times the big blind make it a rule in mid to late position mix up the position and dont always raise you will get callers here or there so sit out some rounds to at least win back your blinds or antes in that round my favorite raises come right before the dealer dealer small and big blinds i seem to pick up more pots and feel more comfortable raising here you dont need to have a premium hand but try to be either suited with a king or ace or have connecters preferably suited at least your main goal is to steal the blinds and antes without going to showdown you must bet well if you get a caller and see the flop if the board doesnt look like one that someone with a premium hand hit you need to follow up your preflop bet with a pot sized bet even if you didnt hit the flop and if out of position to them and they bet first get some guts and reraise them but not putting your tournament life at stake times out of ten they will fold the other times they will call or reraise and you dont bet after or get out here unless you have a good amount of outs the other times that you take down those pots without a showdown will pay for the oops hands that you get caught on and then some the people that tighten up and dont raise preflop are the ones that go out on the bubble or just make the final table with some luck the people that are aggressive and raise like i said earlier are the ones that win or come very close to it  Craps Community card poker Stud poker Cheating in poker Blackjack Omaha hold 'em Baccarat Seven-card stud Online poker Gambling Contract bridge Snooker Sandbagging (poker) Five-card draw Sheepshead Draw (poker) Backgammon Volleyball Bluff (poker) Pai gow poker Game show Caribbean stud poker World Series of Poker Poker strategy Baseball $ale of the Century Norway national football team World Series Pittsburgh Steelers Slot machine Winning Streak Sports betting Softball Tournament American football strategy President (game) Skat Wheel of Fortune Roulette Magic: The Gathering New York Giants Dominoes Hand (poker) Euchre Hearts (game) Peter Shilton Ra (board game) Cello Ravi Shastri Violin Pete Rose Spades Video poker Bryan Robson Computer and video games Table tennis Tag Textile manufacturing Tilt (poker) NBA Finals Tenshinhan Chess terminology Yao Ming 2005 English cricket season Hollywood Squares Detroit Tigers Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Stu Ungar Cribbage Tennis Social rule Pete Sampras Guilty Gear Pinball Bad beat 500 (card game) ELO rating system High card by suit (poker) FA Cup Playing card

anybody know of any games or bets that you can't lose i like bar bets or games that can't be lost if you know the secret of course thanks sure real estate specifically buy in neighborhoods being bought up by gay men seriously most have an obsession with detail and a few gays can often increase property values for an entire neighborhood in very short order regarding bar games here you go this is my favorite and the chicks love it claim that you're an accomplished meta physicist you're able to sense others' auroras through certain media copper in particular set up nine pennies on the bar in a x square grid select an attractive girl even better if she's hanging out with other female friends to touch one of the pennies while you're away outside in the bathroom or wherever you'll be able to sense her aurora through the copper of whichever penny she touches step away let her touch a penny then come back to the bar hold your hand an inch or so above the pennies eyes closed and slowly move your hand over the grid open your eyes and touch the same penny she selected this works every time and so long as you don't give away your secret you'll probably get her number every time the secret your friend who remains at the bar and witnesses which penny she touches positions his cocktail on his square coaster or cocktail napkin in the same location as the penny in the grid for example if she touches the upper left penny your friend places his drink on the upper left portion of his cocktail napkin a quick unseen glance at his drink tells you which penny she touched you can even go a step farther with this if she touches more than one penny which she'll inevitably do on about the third try your friend's drink will be in the location of the first penny she selected after noting where his drink is however he picks it up takes a sip and places it in the position corresponding to the second penny she touched not only will you blow her away by telling her she obviously touched more than one penny but you'll be able to say which pennies and in which order she touched get even fancier by telling her to try again by touching the penny with a non conductive object like a pencil you'll still sense her aurora if she touches all of the pennies your friend might simply pick up his glass and cocktail napkin in the same hand take a sip but not set the glass down you can come up with a whole list of contingencies to include multiple girls touching a penny no one touching any at all or perhaps a signal to let you know your friend didn't see for certain which if any penny she touched quit while you're ahead though eventually someone will figure out your friend is in on the gig even they won't know how exactly and remember don't tell your secret  Friends Craps Fischer Random Chess Sudoku Sin City Avenue Q Tag Swingout Cellular automaton Knots Landing Blackjack Social rule Chess terminology Menstrual cup Glossary of partner dance terms Gambling Professional wrestling match types EastEnders Tai shogi Rugby union Dominoes Columbine High School massacre Softball Mao (game) Married... with Children Slot machine Dead Like Me Theory of conduct Dai dai shogi National Football League My Name Is Earl Shaggy dog story Volleyball Tenjiku shogi Human sexual behavior Jon Secada Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Death Note Draw poker Surreal number Good Times The Shining (film) YuYu Hakusho Baseball Baroque chess Pinball Gay slang The Critic Syberia Chu shogi Action potential Blood on the Tracks The Wotch Kodocha Denis Law Monopoly (game) Complex number British coinage Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Daredevil Glass Water polo Skateboarding trick Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of American football Colony in Space Cannon shogi St. Elmo's Fire (film) RuneScape quests Combat Mission (computer game series) Phoebe Halliwell Laws of cricket Dai shogi Good Morning, Vietnam Moe Szyslak Confidence trick The Lovely Bones Penny Arcade (comic) Textile manufacturing Mouse (computing) Hall & Oates Sex and the City Ron and Fez Computer and video games Manifold Burial Touch football (rugby league) Big Brother (USA TV series) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
