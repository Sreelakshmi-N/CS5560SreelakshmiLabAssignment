how will juve do back in serie a well we are back to were we belong i'm not supporting juventus actually quit the opposite but i'll be objective this time first i'm glad that juve spend one year in serie b and i hope they learned something from this experience let's be honest in and they won the title but everyone knows how they didn't keep it but still an cheating it's just so ugly in especially in sport think about all those matches they won in minute and how many times the extra time was over when they scored now it's hard to say what they are going to do for now i think that the title is out if the question and i say that because the team just doesn't seam to be good enough they lost a few good players the defense especially is a mystery to me anyway i see them on champions league spot or maybe but no way they can win the title in a few years they can be back in top they surely have the financial support and the history to do that but one question still remain can they do it honestly that's the big challenge for juve to prove all of use that it is indeed a big team  Norway national football team Troms__ I.L.
