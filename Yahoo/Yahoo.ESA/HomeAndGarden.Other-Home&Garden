which one costs less central air or window units i live in a small apartment right now the central is not working should i ask them to fix it or get window units central air is less expensive than a window unit air conditioners are all the same basically what is expensive is how often the air in your apartment goes above a certain temperature that you set your thermostat at when you set your central air to the temp you want and leave it alone it will only come on when when the temp gets higher than what you want otherwise it stays off a window unit for the most part is turned on and does not have a thermostat to set therefore it will continue to blast cold air until you get up and turn it off it could be snowing outside and it would be on if you wanted it to so the cost is turning the unit on and off several times each time you turn it on there is a power drain and your bill shoots up so but leaving your central air on all the time it actually cost less than flipping the switch on a window unit and making it work hard to make you cool after coming home to a hot apartment the same is true with florescent lights it is cheaper to leave them on then to turn them off and on all day long the other thing is that you cannot force cold air by that i mean you cannot force cold air from one room to another around a corner that in itself is a problem with a window air conditioner if you put it in your living room the bedroom could be hot whereas a central air unit is blowing through the air duct system of your apartment and cold air is being distributed into each room individually  Thermostat Solar power Temperature Air conditioning Thermal power station Autonomous building Pebble bed reactor Furnace Climate of the United Kingdom Transformer Rail tracks Electrical wiring Stirling engine Apollo 13 Bicycle brake systems Wind power Carburetor Car handling Engine cooling GunZ The Duel Dodge Neon Hot air balloon Fossil fuel power plant Professional wrestling throws Lighting Fire fighting Sento Digital circuit Turbojet Thermoregulation Wind turbine Digital photography Heat Jet engine Bi-metal Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sauna Apartment Severe weather terminology (United States) Items in the Metroid series Solar cell Central processing unit Fuel injection Aquarium Weather lore Diesel engine Window MOSFET Vacuum Personal rapid transit Steel Axial compressor System/36 Control system E85 Mutual fund Windows 2000 Betting (poker) Modem Spacecraft propulsion Bong Common cold Deep lake water cooling Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Kitchen Mitsubishi 3000GT Syphon Filter Carbon dioxide Wrigley Field Canadian and American health care systems compared Space shuttle main engine Wilton House Windows XP Floppy disk Transistor CPU design Negative feedback Renewable energy Motor oil Ocean thermal energy conversion Energy development Turbocharger Hydrogen economy Ice P-38 Lightning History of Microsoft Windows Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Passive solar The Day After Tomorrow Mouse (computing) Mercury Atlas 6 Year of the Spider Scramjet Sin City IBM PC compatible Thread (computer science) Advance Wars: Dual Strike

anyone please answer on building a new home we are completely stuck with friends and bias answers does this make sense ok we want to build this modular before u say anything these are not average ones we have done research even went to the plant walkthrough models neway they offer a sq ft ranch w full basment where all we need to do is sheetrock its done a full walk up attic blown out so its like another floor a venetian spa bathroom that is ' ' georgeous a kitchen that is ' ' absolutely beautiful w all appliances included even microwave laundry washer dryer everything even the damn curtains come w the house however they want for this yet im seeing sq ft houses sale not new but for less than this not as nice of things but definitely way more space are we naive in thinking that its still worth it pay more smaller get what we want or since its a modular it should not be that much money i know most people are bias when it comes to this but look for ureself on pleasant valley modular what do you think advice please sq ft houses include the basment in the sq footage because its finished so no its not impossible because i can give you realty sites with new contructions that have them at the first thing to consider is the location that is the most important thing in real estate buy in the best location you can afford the next thing would be to compare homes in your area that have the same amenities as the modular home and are comparable in size you may find that you are not getting such a great deal you can opt to buy a larger home in a great location and invest the money in putting the amenities into it i e the venetian spa you also need to consider financing many traditional lenders shy away from manufactured homes so you may find yourself taking out a personal property loan rather than a real property loan i don't think you will have many options in this type of loan so you may pay more for it talk to your mortgage broker manufactured homes can tend to decrease in value if they are not immaculately maintained the shortage of traditional financing for used manufactured homes often reduces demand for resale of course this can vary greatly according to your local real estate market talk to your realtor the final thing to consider is how soon do you want to sell the home it might take you longer to sell due to people shying away from modular homes and the lack of mortgage options when my husband and i were looking for a home we saw a beautiful modular home i didn't even know is was modular the realtor immediately said to us that she needed to disclose that it was modular the way she said it made my husband and i think there was a bad stigma attached to those type of homes we opted for a more traditional home finally i would consider the motives of your friends and if you find they are only looking out for your best interest then i would listen to them good luck in your search for the perfect home  Real estate broker Mobile home Donald Trump Insurance Capitalism Stock Microeconomics Student loan Citigroup Predatory lending Life insurance Deflation (economics) Security (finance) Japanese toilet Bond Mutual fund Real estate FairTax Finance Debt Illegal drug trade Government National Mortgage Association Great Depression Capital accumulation IBM PC compatible Title insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Taxation in the United States Social rule Supply and demand Kitchen Privatization Islamic banking Monopoly (game) Gross domestic product Financial markets Warren Buffett History of the United States (1918-1945) Free trade Real estate bubble Property tax Law of value Economy of Russia Tesco Bank Ford Motor Company Tax Chatsworth House Wayne Corporation Bretton Woods system Gold standard MMORPG Federal National Mortgage Association Harlem Economics Interest Concurrent estate Annual percentage rate Derivative (finance) Money Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Monetary policy CPU cache Microcredit Mergers and acquisitions Economy of the United States Property (ownership right) Temasek Holdings Berkshire Hathaway Anarchism and capitalism Personal finance Option Mathematics Construction Wells Fargo Economy of India Annuity Divorce Betting (poker) EastEnders Infantilism Mortgage-backed security Real estate economics Solar power Business Unemployment Basement Savings and loan association 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Intellectual property Poker jargon Theory of conduct RISC

if i spray weed killer all over my garden you see it's covered in weeds and undergrowth i've tried pulling them up but the stinging nettles have long roots that have networked all over the garden below the surface the only way i can figure it can be sorted would be with weed killer however if i spray will it affect the soil and if i wish to lay grass seed will that be affected by the chemicals what about the frogs etc will it kill them and if at a later date i wish to grow veg etc will the soil be safe to grow stuff in you could use a systemic weedkiller it works by killing the roots of the weeds trouble is it takes a couple of weeks to work but it leaves the soil good for replanting  Weed control Herbicide Weed Hemp Biodynamic agriculture Biological pest control Comfrey Agriculture Illegal drug trade Irrigation Tillage Fruit tree propagation Stinging nettle Flax Mulch Garden Strawberry Ragweed Deforestation Masanobu Fukuoka Pansy Organic farming Compost Kudzu Carnivorous plant Nettle Organic gardening Alfalfa Hay fever Hydroponics Creeping Charlie Anchor Sugar beet Cannabis (drug) Green Revolution Bamboo Gypsy moth Wetland Rapeseed Plough Cannabis cultivation Root Glyphosate Rice Agricultural machinery Tobacco Sewage treatment Honey fungus Leaf Genetically modified food Soil pH Minor Harry Potter Beasts Earthworm Dune Turnip (brassica rapa) Mosquito Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Septic tank Flowering plant No-dig gardening Roundup Apple Hamster Blood (computer game) Lawn Drooping Brome Coast Douglas-fir Vermicompost Sin City Mandrake (plant) Ragwort Bonsai Yarrow Harrow Garlic DDT Pollinator decline Soil Green manure Nepeta Wildfire Plant Ginkgo Malaria Pesticide Cortaderia selloana Houseplant Cuscuta Oat Breastfeeding Zuiderzee Works Maize Organic food Fennel Rumex Absinth Wormwood Broom (shrub) Organic horticulture Iris (plant)

is it safe to prune back my nectarine tree it is only three years old and it's the second year it's had fruit last year it only got a few nectarines this year it is overloaded and the branches are drooping also it's been months and only a few of the fruit closest to the trunk are starting to mature i think if i trimmed the excess that the tree wouldn't be so overwhelmed and would be able to make better fewer fruit but it's only my theory i really don't know i've been told that if we trim it back while it's got fruit that it will kill the tree i find this hard to believe but i don't want to do it and kill my tree because i don't know what i'm talking about help pruning should consist of removing the laterals that have fruited and thinning out the new laterals that have grown also cutting back the top growth keeps the tree from growing too tall it sounds as if you need to thin your tree take off all small and diseased fruit do the pruning after the tree has finished fruiting if it is only maturing near trunk then sounds like your tree needs either more watering or some sort of fertiliser check with your garden center good luck  Pruning fruit trees Peach Fruit tree propagation Pruning Olive Bonsai Apricot Wood Equine conformation Banksia Bamboo Apple Gypsy moth Wisteria Gooseberry Moss Coffea arabica Durian Plant Coffea Apical dominance Christmas tree Giant Sequoia Black pepper Auxin Coconut Tree Hamster Ginkgo Grafting Acorn Date Palm Rainforest Tooth European Beech Vanilla Sequoia Kakapo The Time Machine Coffee Dutch elm disease Plum Mushroom hunting Flowering plant Seed Refrigerator car Elephant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Woodworking Pachypodium Comfrey Gardening White Spruce Morphology of Pachypodium Capercaillie Pine 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Honey fungus Citrus Collision detection Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Deforestation Rambutan Knife Reservoir Dogs Thuja plicata Root Minor characters in Morrowind Garden Strawberry Poker jargon Elm Fecal incontinence Pesticide Shark Logging Onion Prostate cancer Tobacco Campfire 2003 North America blackout In vitro fertilisation Luther Burbank Orchard Black Spruce Foodborne illness Fruit Banana Pubic hair Sphenoid bone Normal distribution Loganberry Pachypodium baronii Ethylene Pitaten Drainage

potential home buyers would you rather see white painted kitchen cupboards or poorly refinished and stained here's the deal we plan on selling our house within the next year and our kitchen cupboards are i think a mess they are old s style oak with fake oak laminate panels on the inside we knew something needed to be done so they are completely torn apart and sanded however there appears to be damage steam to the bottom of several upper cupboards and around the dishwasher that i can't sand out i propose that it would be best to slap down some white enamel paint but my husband feels that a potential buyer would prefer wood cupboards even if they are looking rather worse for wear what do you think our countertops are a light grey stone and other comparable homes in our neighborhood go for around the mark i would leave them like they are then the buyer can do what they want with them but if you paint them white the buyer will have a harder time a buyer might want to stain what is already there or they may take them out and get new cabinets that they like everyone has a different taste just try it like they are and see what the people looking at the house say if that is a major thing that you notice everyone talking about maybe it would be better to go ahead and paint them i personally would just leave them like they are because wood cabinets look better than painted ones even if they have a couple trouble spots have a good day  Kitchen Door Plastic Wood carving Arcade cabinet McMansion Aliens of London Equine conformation Wood Chatsworth House Mattress Supply and demand Drill bit Woodworking Upholstery Microeconomics Dishwasher Paint EastEnders Ford Cortina Oak Black Orchid (Doctor Who) Pitaten Salad Fingers Kitchener, Ontario Daredevil Harlem American Broadcasting Company Hartford, Connecticut Home repair Bristol Grammar School Ford Motor Company Tire Harrow School RuneScape quests Beatmania IIDX First Battle of the Atlantic Internet fraud Black Staining (biology) Donald Rumsfeld One Tree Hill (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Imperial (automobile) 1957 World Series Illegal drug trade Alhambra Kitsch Dinghy Knife Dishwashing TARDIS Jumpstart 3rd Grade Boston College Seismic retrofit Cello Social rule Tooth Insider trading Sculpture The Adventures of Pete & Pete In-N-Out Burger Australian legislative election, 2004 Glass Transformer Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim StarCraft: Uprising Trapped in the Closet Blenheim Palace Grace Cossington Smith Friends Oakland Athletics Timber framing Real estate broker Diamond Toronto Blue Jays Laser engraving Mess dress Frankfurt kitchen Buckingham Palace In The Groove (game) Something Awful Tudorbethan architecture The Empty Child Wilton House Cabrini-Green Ship Mushroom hunting Los Angeles Clippers House Table saw Bulk vending Wrigley Field Infantilism Boat building Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diamond cut Brett Whiteley

does anybody have any tips on how to get rid of bed bugs call a professional it can be expensive but bedbugs are very hard to get rid of and a professional will know best what to do if you're going to try to do it yourself the first step is to launder everything that can be laundered then go through the room with a vacuum going over every nook and cranny that means lifting up the mattress moving furniture going along the baseboard with the vacuum's hose attachment and moving and vacuuming everywhere you can think of remember that bedbugs can travel up to feet in one night to feet and can fit into a space the width of a credit card so they could be living anywhere in the room not just the mattress some pesticides are effective some aren't bedbugs sometimes are immune to certain pesticides so you may need to try a couple before you find one that works and remember that you'll probably need to do this a couple of times depending on how bad your infestation is because as their eggs hatch you'll have more bedbugs to deal with  Bedbug Mattress Vacuum Vacuum cleaner Strap-on dildo Animal Crossing Stairway Vacuum tube Gypsy moth Glossary of firefighting equipment Casualty lifting Bed (furniture) Upholstery Malaria Equine conformation Illegal drug trade Biological pest control Xenomorph Rail terminology Zerg Swingout Speed of light Pok__mon Abilities Luminiferous aether Tick Surveillance Scuba set Siphon Central processing unit Hard disk Mosquito Red imported fire ant Glossary of partner dance terms Crab louse Basement Berth Space elevator Vacuum mattress Bong Plastic Carpet RuneScape quests Emergency preparedness Diode Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Faster-than-light Car handling Stretcher Sudden infant death syndrome Social rule Allston, Boston, Massachusetts Kitchen Volleyball Maxwell's equations Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts CPU design The Doctor Dances Malware Beetle Roomba Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Ambulance Fan (implement) Combine (Half-Life 2) Shark Glossary of firefighting terms Trust (Law) non-USA Aliens versus Predator (computer game) Photon Ice hotel Vladimir Mayakovsky StarCraft: Uprising Human adaptation to space Massage Swimming House dust mite Textile manufacturing The Empty Child Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Chicago Cubs Mercury 4 The Long Game Lumber Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Pok__mon types Physics and Star Trek Organic food Subwoofer DDT (professional wrestling) Dinghy Glossary of nautical terms Glossary of ballet terms Marching band P-61 Black Widow Software bug Deadly Rooms of Death

gross inground pool help we have a small inground pool it has been uncovered since last summer i guess we cleaned out a tremendous amount of leaves and slime we have poured algecide in it repeatedly we cannot drain it b c it is or years old the installer said it would ruin the liner to drain it problem is even with the algecide we could never see the bottom of the pool to tell if we had gotten all the gunk we finally shut off the pump b c we felt like we were pouring money down the drain any ideas hi rachael have you had your filter checked it might need to be cleaned or replaced our pool guy told us that a pool doesn't really need anything but a good filter to keep it clean not even chlorine we of course still use chlorine because our filter's not that good but it was an interesting point to make or maybe your pump isn't pumping water through the filter as efficiently as it needs to in order to keep up with the algal growth we had an algal bloom last summer that was nasty i remember throwing tons of algaecide at it with seemingly no effects eventually we broke down and rehired the pool maintenance man we'd let go of just to save some a few months before and he had the pool looking good in a couple of weeks he started with getting the filter back in tip top condition and kept at it with algaecide and high chlorine levels good luck  Motor oil Sewage treatment Eutrophication Heinkel He 100 E85 Diving Ozone depletion Thermal power station Water purification Algal bloom Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ozone hole Dry cleaning Dialysis Air conditioning Fountain Lake Lake Burley Griffin Piccolo Junior Saga Bong Drainage Chlorine Wind turbine Siphon Sea ice Autonomous building Water supply Loudspeaker Houseplant Poker jargon Home repair Hydrogen economy Coffee Swimming Dundas Square Flat tax Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Textile manufacturing Ozone layer Solar power Full Metal Panic?

should i trust weedman i am a weedman customer who uses the natural treatment for weeds i have a relatively good lawn and live on a small crescent about homes with a ravine behind it i don't have any trees around my home at all the weedman guy called and told me that because of the june bugs in the air there are eggs on my lawn that will turn into grubs in the next week unless i treat it he made it sound like was calling all the customers on my street we are the only ones and they were all going to get theirs treated they never left me a note as they usually do although the guy on the phone said they did i told them to send back their technician to show me the eggs before i pay them their he said that if he did he'd need a microscope to see them i don't know how weedman works but it sure sounds like they are looking to reach a quota of some sort by scaring their customers into treatments anyone have advice on what to do could they really be telling the truth they seem to have an answer for everything and are hard to trust anyone know exactly how grubs germinate i am out all the time in the evenings and have seen no june bugs at all i live in canada he said they couldn't use a microscope but if we waited and didn't take the treatment we'd have a big surprise they could treat it later but then i'd have to resod my whole lawn which costs lots of money if you do have grubs you will know in a couple months the grass will start turning yellow or brown in spots you can still treat for them after the yellow spots appear so i would wait and see what happens to the lawn most people don't know they have them until they see spots and call someone to come and check it out  Ocean's Twelve The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Social rule Chatsworth House Stomach cancer Poker jargon GSM services The Amazing Race Lawn Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Surveillance Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Mad Money Piccolo Junior Saga Ben Johnson (athlete) The Apprentice 2 She Loves You Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks Health insurance Year of the Spider Eric Bischoff Good Times Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Prostate cancer Hall & Oates GunBound The Pet Sounds Sessions The Empty Child Plame affair Biological pest control Wal-Mart E-mail spam Live 8 Treehouse of Horror V Tick The Beatles discography Full Metal Panic?

older houses with strange shower heads in the basement recently i have encountered some older homes with strange features in the basements usually cinder block types i have come across random showers in the corners all that is there is a pipe with a shower head coming out of it and a small drain on the cement floor what are or were these showers used for i'm not quite sure on the age of the houses i would say most likely pre 's and yes there is room for a person to stand underneath i had also seen a tv show where they identified a similar shower as a butcher shower where a butcher would cut up meat in the basement and wash the blood off when he finished working the show was about paranormal activity and the people who lived in the home felt that horrible things had happened in the basement so i'm a bit freaked out by these showers i saw the same show you did and that was the first thing that came to mind but it is still just a shower and not necessarily used after butchering animals i would imagine that they were used to wash off after any chore that was dirty like farming ranching cleaning stalls as well as butchering dinner no reason to be freaked out it's just a shower  Kitchen Sento Japanese toilet Milton H.

refuse collection is there a way to get rid of polystyrene i've bought a few items over the last couple of weeks that as usual come packaged in polystyrene beads boards and those potato chip things there is only a collection once per fortnight days and only one bin trash can to you ppl in the usa so the only way to get around it is either to drive miles to the recycling center or dump as we called it in the old days or fly tip i'm not keen on the first option because it's a mile round trip every time and i'm not going to leave it on the side of the road either is there some way to melt it i don't mean burn it but surely there's some way to compact it down but before you say trash compactor the cheapest i've seen is nearly for something i would only need to use no more than once a month i understand you are not in the united states i know that polystyrene in the us is not manufactured with chlorofluorocarbons but i'm not sure about your location shredding burning or melting polystyrene that contains chlorofluorocarbons can release harmful toxins into your air a conservative answer can you store the packing materials until your rubbish pickup thank you for not considering leaving on the roadside some companies are beginning to use cornstarch packing materials these will melt when they come into contact with water good for them  Polystyrene Recycling Plastic Dustbin Garbage truck Haloalkane Printed circuit board Gramophone record Floppy disk Waste Casting Dumpster diving Soldering Animal Crossing Boy Scouts of America Donovan PlayStation 2 STS-62 Teller-Ulam design Thermal power station Pebble bed reactor Air pollution Incineration German grammar Nuclear weapon design Solar power United Parcel Service USB flash drive Vermicompost Pickup truck Betting (poker) Backpacking (wilderness) United States Postal Service Bong Toyota Prius Potato chips Nuclear meltdown Dairy Cigarette Solar cell 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Ammunition Sewage treatment Powder metallurgy Plutonium Surface-mount technology Road Poker jargon Radio controlled airplane Wheel of Fortune DVD The Amazing Race Model aircraft Items in the Metroid series Nintendo Steel ZX Spectrum Glass Sega Saturn MAME Opportunity rover William A.

how to fix a slippery front patio our front patio leading to the front door is very slippery when wet and being rainy season here in florida it always seems to be wet i can't afford to rip it up right now is there anything i can paint on the surface that will prevent it from being so slippery or other low cost meathod making the patio safer i am going to guess that its a concrete patio the easiest and cheapest way is to go to your local home builders store and ask for cement floor paint you can get it with sand in it or you can spread some on while painting make sure you use floor paint other paints will not hold up to the traffic you could also try to etch the surface of the concrete with an acid this will make it a little rougher and less slippery if you etch the surface there is a good chance you will kill all plant life next to your patio because of the rinse water run off good luck  Concrete Japanese tea ceremony Slippery slope Opportunity rover Terrazzo Rapid transit Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Dishwasher Stucco Reinforced concrete Printed circuit board Rear wheel drive Xanadu House Portland cement Carnivorous plant Printmaking Seismic retrofit Plastic Fountain Soap Solar power Pavement (material) Naval mine Vacuum cleaner Illegal drug trade Irrigation Masonry Table saw Casting Diving suit Paint Brush Sugar beet Basement Bicycle lighting Anchor Lechaina Kitchen Sailing Wood carving Desert Drawing Dairy Water purification Carbon dioxide Sento Dundas Square Home improvement Tag Hydrogen economy Geodesic dome Bladderwort Wayne Corporation Knife Titanium West Side Highway Capernaum K__ppen climate classification Sewage treatment St. James railway station, Sydney Glass Christmas tree Etching Car handling Floppy disk Photoengraving Shotcrete Semiconductor fabrication Hamster Sport utility vehicle Straw-bale construction Textile manufacturing Paintball Sandpaper School bus Bicycle Anti-lock braking system Plaster Battery (electricity) Fluoride therapy Photolithography Model aircraft Water (molecule) Fire fighting Bamboo Bus models used in New York City Transit Soil Diving Heinkel He 100 Quang Ninh Province Florida Keys Tile Tire Autonomous building Temporal bone Rathfarnham Whitewater

remedies for keeping flies away any remedies for keeping flies away i often like to keep the door non sliding to my balcony open the only thing is there is no screen so i hung up a lace curtain that looks pretty and keeps a lot out of the apt but when the wind blows the flies can get in and then i cannot get them out are there any remedies that you know of to keep them away i heard that in portugal they keep plastic bags filled with water up by windows and doorways to keep them at bay and it supposedly works anyone have experience with that i am open to most anything last year i lived in the same complex and only had cluster flies they like to cluster and hang out on windows they were easy to take care of i just vacuumed them up with my handheld vacuum and released them outside the water is a good idea flies are attracted to moisture this is sad but true you know when on tv you see articles on starving people and they show video you see flies all over the people's faces mouths and eyes the flies are attracted to the mouth and eyes because it is the last place with moisture the only problem with putting the bag of water out is that you should refresh it daily or you will be creating a mosquito labor and delivery room in that bag you can also hang a few sprigs of fresh mint at the door or put a large mint plant there that is what we always kept on the picnic table when i was a kid to keep them away  Bong Vacuum cleaner Vacuum G-Man (Half-Life) Columbine High School massacre Professional wrestling match types Plastic The Phantom Manor Time Out of Mind Carnivorous plant Door Textile manufacturing Nepeta Carburetor Little Britain Bubble Bobble Houseplant Explosive material Skateboarding trick Mosquito Angling Salad Fingers Tea Sento STS-59 Buckingham Palace Mid-levels Comanche Vacuum tube The Star Wars Holiday Special Cathode ray tube Death Valley National Park USS Wasp (CV-7) Wood carving Tobacco Mattress Hash table Kitchen Coffee Conspiracy (TNG episode) Hay In-N-Out Burger Upholstery Floppy disk The Amber Spyglass About a Boy Stereoscopy Characters in the Smurfs The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Shoe Fire fighting The Parting of the Ways Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paragliding Dairy The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Sims 2 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Flax Cessna T-37 Blood (computer game) Mercury Atlas 6 Real Love (song) Water (molecule) Desert Las Vegas metropolitan area Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Tofu Dial M for Murder Energy development Teletubbies StarCraft: Uprising Grace Cossington Smith Suicide methods Luminiferous aether Hydroponics Fossil fuel power plant Ecco the Dolphin Max Payne Weather lore Home repair Smoke-screen Social rule Apollo Command/Service Module The Brady Bunch Cannabis cultivation YuYu Hakusho B-47 Stratojet Xanadu House Domestic rabbit Alcoholics Anonymous Jute Sonic the Hedgehog Passenger car Silent Night, Deadly Night Colonization of the Moon Bagpipes Customs and etiquette of Japan Glossary of firefighting equipment

what would be a good price to charge for raking a lawn becasue i was thinking of raking lawns for some money this fall they are standard size neighborhood lawns what to charge for front only back only or front and back i would bring my own garbage bags and rake for the leaves also what would be a good price for gardening this would be like watering flowers weeding gardens etc you should figure out how long you think it will take you to do the area and then multiply it by what you want to make i would say around an hour since it will probably be cash then add in the cost of any materials you need like the leaf bags you need those in most towns not just garbage bags and that will give you the price after the first one or two you will get a feel for how long it will take and be able to adjust your price accordingly for gardening i would figure out a price per square foot of gardens that the person has so you roughly measure all their gardens and figure out the area and then charge by that so if it was a vegetable garden feet long by feet deep that's square feet you could maybe charge something like cents a square foot or for weeding and go up or down from there depending on how many weeds there are the bottom line is that the market will set your prices for you that means if they are too high you won't have any business if they are too low you'll have too much business to handle and you'll be able to raise the prices to get to a manageable level the best way to learn is to do a few jobs and then see how it goes if people start spreading the word and you get lots of work raise your hourly rate a little if no one's hiring you drop it down good luck  Poker jargon Inflation Microeconomics Wal-Mart Gross domestic product Illegal drug trade Labor theory of value Keynesian economics Mattress Labour economics Lawn Bond Deflation (economics) Chopper (motorcycle) Tax PE ratio Brewery Glossary of wildland fire terms Tennis Free trade Sears Holdings Corporation Chair View camera Euro Monopoly (game) Economy of Russia Anchor Monetary policy Ra (board game) Japanese tea ceremony Microsoft Solar cell Unemployment Mutual fund Warren Buffett Oscilloscope Minimum wage Tesco United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Bong FairTax Urban sprawl Petroleum Economics Value added tax Comfrey United States dollar Australian War Memorial E85 Gold standard Professional wrestling attacks Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Capital controversy Economic inequality Natural monopoly Wall Street Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Explosive material Monopoly Drill bit Hot air balloon Dog agility Contredanse Price discrimination Cost accounting Stairway Equine conformation $ale of the Century Rebreather The Apprentice 2 Tariff Gravity Just In Time Productive and unproductive labour IPod Car handling Surplus value Soil pH Ryanair New Deal Irrigation Gasoline Corporate finance Vegetation Caddy Hydroponics Organic food Mount Pinatubo London Congestion Charge Indian Railways

what kind of spider is this i live in western canada and on our back deck today we found a big spider it was similar to the ones we referred to as crab spiders that we had every year but this one was brown with light brown spots and it left brown splotches spider poop under it's web i looked it up and couldn't kind much and discovered that crab spiders actually don't spin webs so what kind was this it was brown with splotches of light brown on it and it had a huge sac on it's back connected to its body it spun a big web and was up near the roof on our house close to the door so someone is going to kill it so it doesn't get in our house or something any ideas if the web has a kind of zigzag stitch then it is a common brown orb weaver which is harmless and beneficial for the garden orb weavers are garden spiders and have no interest in moving into your home so there is no reason to kill it they are not poisonous and their bite is not that bad besides they'd rather run like hell then be anywhere near a human just get a stick and remove the web and it will likely relocate to a more secluded location does this look like your guy http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages fp dorb bweavers ei dutf js d ni d fr dyfp t b d w h imgurl static flickr com f f e f d m jpg rurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fjohncarney f f size kb name e f d jpg p orb weavers type jpeg no tt oid ee a cf b ef fusr johncarney tit taste of things to come hurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fjohncarney f ei utf src p  Spider Combine (Half-Life 2) London JPEG St Andrew's Cross spider Flickr Brown recluse spider HyperText Transfer Protocol Textile manufacturing Shen Gong Wu Uniform Resource Locator Hobo spider Common Unix Printing System Widow spider Blood (computer game) Snooker Tarantula Doom enemies Cross site scripting Butterfly Website Search engine optimization Web traffic Representational State Transfer Professional wrestling throws HTTP cookie World Wide Web Unreal Naruto jutsu Time travel Web crawler Digital photography Minor Harry Potter Beasts Spider-Man PlayStation Portable Piccolo Junior Saga Web server Computer virus Theory of conduct Web browser RuneScape quests HTML element Recluse spider Toilet humour Araneomorphae Fishing Mario series enemies Incarnations of Immortality The Legend of Zelda series enemies Textile manufacturing terminology Resident Evil (video game) World Series Bridge Bon Jovi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Google Maps Australian venomous funnel-web spider Bob and George Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Venom (comics) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Creatures in Bionicle Static (superhero) Meat Loaf Pitaten Wiki EastEnders Aerial (dance move) Spot the Dog Humphrey Bogart Baltimore Orioles Eye Linyphiidae Software agent Skateboarding trick Sega Dreamcast Common house spider StarCraft Episode VI The Haunted Mansion (film) GunBound Professional wrestling holds Mushroom hunting Web page Freenet Futurama (TV series - season 4) HyperCard Futurama Kyle Broflovski Mid-levels Ecco the Dolphin Patent Color

how do african violets need to be watered they do not like water on their leaves i have always been told to have a saucer under their pot the pot has to have holes in it and water in the saucer the dirt and roots will soak it up from there as far as fertilizer they say to water weakly weekly which means a weak solution of fertilizer and there are specific african violet mixtures every week instead of a big dose of fertilizer every month or so if the fertilizer mix is too strong and it is used too often you will have fertilizer burn and the violet will turn brown and whither if you are fertilizing and that happens the rhyme goes like this the solution to the pollution is dilution flush water through the pot or times the amount that you would normally water with and discard that water when watering like this water from the top of the pot just trying to water under the leaves on to the soil if the fertilizer burn seems really bad you could discard the old potting soil and very very gently rinse the roots dunk roots in a bowl of water briefly and re pot in new dirt this will most likely shock your violet and it may continue to look sickly a while longer but may save it in the long run  Houseplant Coffee Poker jargon Tobacco Hippeastrum Draw poker Textile manufacturing Comfrey Ammonia Sewage treatment Bonsai Soil Teapot Irrigation Sugar beet Sulfuric acid Weed control Betting (poker) Soil pH Garden Strawberry Fujian tea ceremony Bread Carnivorous plant Japanese tea ceremony Phosphorus Bong Haggis Fertilizer Jute Snooker Staining (biology) Cannabis cultivation Gram staining Basil Fire fighting Nuclear fallout Dishwashing Phosphate Illegal drug trade Pysanka Gypsy moth Concentration Sodium hypochlorite Community card poker Seabird Poker Laundry detergent Acorn Tofu Lawn Body piercing Halitosis Ultraviolet Alcohol fuel Venus Flytrap Hangi Potassium Texas hold 'em Waste management Pottery Opportunity rover Carburetor Deluge (mythology) Seismic retrofit Melting pot Idli Rebreather PH The Incredibles Town gas Omaha hold 'em Cuisine of Brazil Fire extinguisher Brewery Hydrogen peroxide Yerba mate Ocean thermal energy conversion Uranium Fast bowling Tillandsia The Weakest Link Biodynamic agriculture Cannabis (drug) Environmental concerns with electricity generation Nile Marathon (sport) White phosphorus incendiary Cheating in poker Carbon dioxide Menstrual cup Pansy Derbyshire lead mining history Cyanide Five-card draw Essential oil Earthworm Ethanol

why do some countries have volt outlets and others i am an american and i live in morocco where we have volt outlets in america we have besides volts what is the practical difference is it better to supply homes with one over the other okay i have heard of a step down converter i use one here for some things i brought from america it is obviously out in the open and i manually plug it in to the outlet where in the house in america are these transformers or converters is it in the house or in the appliance in the house i grew up in we had only one outlet that was and it was illegal to have the appliances plugged into the same outlet as a lamp can you explain more thanks in the usa there are two lines that feed the meter and enters the fuse box both these lines are energized if a volt meter is used you would be able to measure the voltage potential to ground of volts if you measured the voltage potential from one line and the other line you would read a difference of v large appliances require the volts like dryers welders and some air conditioners earth ground is part of the circuit from the generating station and your home the current travels from the electric company to the lights and then through a line connected to a rod that goes into the ground in the house there are many configurations that an electric grid can be wired and not everyone uses the same standard you are at the mercy of your local electric company regardless which country you are in  Alternating current Three-phase electric power Transformer Residual-current device Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Ground and neutral Circuit breaker Volt Electric power transmission Electricity distribution Mains electricity BS 1363 High-voltage direct current High-voltage hazards Electric motor RS-232 Oscilloscope Electricity meter Circuit design X10 (industry standard) Lineman (occupation) Capacitor Electrical wiring National Electrical Code (US) Vacuum tube Diode Spark plug Transistor Battery (electricity) Solar power George Westinghouse Loudspeaker War of Currents Operational amplifier Potentiometer Impedance matching Electricity Distribution board Thermal power station Thermostat Lightning Tesla coil Antenna (radio) Electrical network Decibel Resistor Earthing system Electric power Electrical generator Membrane potential Single-phase electric power Overhead powerline Power line communication Welding power supply Digital circuit Spark gap Gas metal arc welding Electrical resistance Electrical wiring (UK) Universal Serial Bus Relay Carburetor Ring circuit Fluorescent lamp Inductor Lighting Fan (implement) Appliance classes Current (electricity) Enigma machine RLC circuit Maxwell's equations Seismometer Rapid transit Power cord Lightning rod Uninterruptible power supply Power (physics) Gauge theory Linear particle accelerator Jack plug Action potential Ampere Magnet

do spiders pee my parents keep saying this since i was young that household pests like spiders' pee can cause the lips eyes or whatever sensitive body parts to 'rot' how true is that great question here is an article all about it source is sited below here is their question and response question do spiders urinate why i get this question so often i don't know answer spiders have structures designed to get rid of nitrogenous waste these are called malpighian tubules and function in a manner similar to our own kidneys spiders don't produce urine like we do but produce uric acid which doesn't dissolve in water and is a near solid spiders have this alternate form of waste because they can't afford to lose as much water as we do these malpighian tubules drain into an pouch attached to the digestive tract called a stercoral pocket so the uric acid waste from the kidneys is combined and eliminated together with solid waste from the digestive tract in this sense spiders don't deposit separate feces and urine but rather a combined waste product that exits from the same opening anus oh look leah we have the same source you forgot to site your source though  Uric acid Insect Renal physiology Urine Sewage treatment Osmoregulation Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Nephron Nutrition Toilet humour Gastrointestinal tract Urinary system Urea Ammonia Biochemistry Cat Animal Nitrogen Urinary incontinence Vitamin C Glycogen storage disease type I Toilet Snake Prostate cancer Protein Water Carnivorous plant Biodiesel Gout Kidney stone Acute renal failure Herpes simplex virus Japanese toilet Hamster Insulin Dialysis Feces Vermicompost Bacteria Reptile Penis Carbon dioxide Tumor lysis syndrome Poison Scorpion Animal communication Hydrochloric acid Tissue engineering Eutrophication Chlorine Cirrhosis Guinea pig Diabetes insipidus Anus Sulfuric acid Dehydration Wilson's disease Nuclear power Urinary tract infection House Mouse Serine protease Cancer Jellyfish Androgen Alkane Urination Cell (biology) Waste Autonomic nervous system Tooth Phosphorus Chlorophyta Natural gas Future energy development Technetium Plastic Stomach Casting Crohn's disease Dairy Pneumonia Liver Alcohol fuel Blood (computer game) Bladderwort Epithelium Acid rain Antibody Defecation Meiosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

if a house is painted white will this make it colder if the white paint reflects the sunlight does this also mean it will reflect the cold if one house were painted black and another white would the black one be more energy efficient i fully understand that insullation is the most important way of making a house energy efficient also realise white will keep it cool in summer just interested to know what the implications are no matter how small hadn't considered the radiant effect of this thoughts in summer it would reflect heat making it cooler inside you wouldn't need to use an air conditioning system all the time this is why most houses are white in mediterranean countries in winter it would lose less heat black bodies radiate more heat than white bodies and so you wouldn't have to have the heating on all the time white paint also has a higher albedo factor i e the amount of sun light that it reflects back into space this is how the ice caps contribute to maintaining the temperature of the earth painting a house white is just one of the many things you can do to make it more energy efficient  Solar power Albedo Temperature Climate change Autonomous building Sun Solar variation Sunlight Heat Ozone depletion Air conditioning Renewable energy Water Ozone hole Urban heat island Cloud Planetary habitability Spacecraft propulsion Furnace Ice Water vapor Ice age Greenhouse effect Passive solar Thermoregulation Energy development Future energy development Terraforming Lighting Sea ice Vacuum Black body HVAC Stirling engine Spark plug Energy Global climate model Climate of the United Kingdom Stellar evolution Jet engine Color Black hole Peltier-Seebeck effect Deep lake water cooling Solar cell Transformer Global warming Thermodynamics Carbon dioxide Glass Phase (matter) Radiant energy Welding Laser Solar radiation Nuclear weapon design Nuclear power Global dimming Internal combustion engine Little Ice Age Colonization of the Moon Exergy Motor oil Swimming Insulation Warm-blooded Temperature inversion Entropy Big Bang Ionosphere Turbocharger Brewery Season Explosive material Hydrogen economy Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes Planetary nebula COBE Hyperthermia Atmospheric reentry Lake Timeline of the Universe Ocean thermal energy conversion Hydropower Lightning Space manufacturing Fire Thermal energy Weather lore Pebble bed reactor Mercury (planet) Radioisotope thermoelectric generator

vacuum before dusting or dusting before vacuuming what should i do first why if you have a vacuum that throws off dust as some here suggest then you should get rid of it and buy one that doesn't i have always heard that you dust before vacuuming since what you dust off of your furniture lands on the floor if you vacuum before you dust you will still have a dusty floor you should clean from top to bottom that would make floors the last thing to clean seems logical to me  Vacuum cleaner Upholstery Vacuum Carpet Roomba Dust Brewery Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Dust devil Physics and Star Trek Mattress The Chemical Brothers Kirby Corporation Polyurethane Advertising Little Britain Cleanliness Francis Bacon (painter) Table saw Exploration of Mars Cosmic dust House dust mite Mars Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Professional wrestling throws Blood Simple Animal Crossing Coffee Professional wrestling aerial techniques Enceladus (moon) Atomism The Amber Spyglass The Hoover Company Piccolo Junior Saga Big Apple (dance) User Friendly Professional wrestling slang Kitchen Berkshire Hathaway Bong Colonization of the Moon Cathode ray tube Falsifiability Drill bit Phoebe Halliwell Luminiferous aether Elevator Transistor Kerr metric Strap-on dildo Logic Dust Bowl Professional wrestling attacks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lighting Deep Impact (space mission) Opportunity rover The Parting of the Ways Soul Dyson (appliances) Pyramids of Mars Jam (TV series) Exact solutions in general relativity Aluminium Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Remediation Volleyball Carbon fiber Toilet Eastern Illinois University Diving Fluid solution Luigi's Mansion Thermal power station Carburetor The Subtle Knife Cleanroom Genericized trademark Potential energy Salad Fingers James Dyson Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Hobbit Stairway Dark energy Queen (band) Conker's Bad Fur Day Null dust solution Magnetic monopole The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Furnace Plastic Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Squidward Tentacles Diode T.

has anybody used liquid lawn aeration about months ago i laid a new sod yard i tilled the entire yard about inches deep to loosen the soil to give the new sod roots a good start well the yard isn't doing so good even after continued watering i called in a lawn care company and they have treated the lawn with fertilizers and premergers for the weeds growing between the sod they recommend lawn aeration and overseeding this fall which is what i plan to do i have found a few companies that offer a liquid aeration that is supposed to be better that traditional methods such as spike or core aeration has anyone had any experience with this type of aeration aerify and lazyman liquid soil aerator are two of the companies any help would be greatly appreciated years ago we used to like to spend time in our yard and do things ourselves so to us hiring companies would have been out of the question if you like your yard why not spend some time out there buy yourself a garden hose and one of those attachment bottles and get out there and water your lawn once a week with joy dishwashing liquid and water that will give the bugs diarrhea and but a hand sower probably cost you but lasts forever and put some good seed in it and spread it throughout your lawn just before a good rain and then once a month put some miracle gro or scotts product green plant food into your sprayer mixing it with the water from your hose and spray that on your lawn it will grow green and grow like crazy then you need to cut it but not too close to the root maybe you loosened the yard by tilling before you planted but it doesn't sound like you added any compost or vitamins to the soil or lime before you replanted maybe you should have your soil tested to see what it's lacking and then feed it what it's lacking i missed from your paragraph if you said you seeded or if you placed squares of grass or plugs and i didn't see what type of grass you planted there are all types of grass you could have planted fine grass but not drought resistant so be sure you get the scoop on what you need from a plant nursery you will want the kind of grass even if it is a little tougher looking that will be drought resistant since the weather seems to be getting warmer  Weed control Houseplant Agriculture Irrigation Earthworm Comfrey Hydroponics Sugar beet Herbicide Sewage treatment Fire fighting Vermicompost Organic farming Opportunity rover Glossary of wildland fire terms Weed Textile manufacturing Soil pH Maize Autonomous building Cannabis cultivation Lawn mower Norman Borlaug Hamster Tobacco Jute Potato Garden Strawberry Alfalfa Sod The Championships, Wimbledon Tillage Composting toilet Coffee Wine Fish farming Gypsy moth Leaf Gardening Nuclear power Peanut Chernobyl accident Root Alcohol fuel Organic food Breastfeeding Moss Sears Holdings Corporation Biodynamic agriculture Zuiderzee Works Waste management Mattress Bonsai Christmas tree Rigging Renewable energy Organic gardening Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prostate cancer Famine Carnivorous plant Pachypodium Plough Green Revolution Agricultural machinery Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Desertification Illegal drug trade Drainage Percy Schmeiser Rice Fire extinguisher Pok__mon Abilities Soil Brewery Orchidaceae Concrete Ant Fecal incontinence Vitamin C Dishwasher Flowering plant Barley

i seem to have a spider problem what can i use to get rid of them i would not of put this here if i was did not want to get rid of them on the whole i am an animal lover but don't like spiders crawling on me when i am trying to sleep so unless you have a respond son how to kill them don't send and reply thank you i personally think spiders are very helpful the keep all the other bugs away i live in northern california close to the sacramento river and spiders are at an abundance spraying for spiders will not work because they just walk across the area that you sprayed i tried spraying a water bleach mixture but this only effects the current spiders and not future spiders from coming in so personally i just deal with it and accept them like i said they keep all the other bugs away so they do serve somewhat of a purpose  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Robert A.

moving a gas cooker hi there i am looking to move a gas cooker to a different location in a kitchen but leaving the connection where it is if that makes sense can you get extension pipes thanks if you're only shifting it a short distance like a foot or two on the same wall you can get a longer flexible gas line replace the existing with a longer line don't try to daisy chain them more than that and you'll need to plumb it with additional black pipe it's not hard installing gas line but if you don't make absolutely gas tite joints there's a good chance you'll blow up your house and kill your family so be very certain of your diy abilities before you attempt this also be aware that many municipalities require that all gas line work be done by a licensed plumber if you do attempt to extend the black pipe yourself don't use white teflon tape on the fittings there is a special teflon tape made for gas fittings it's yellow but i strictly use joint compound it's a thick past that comes in a tube kind of looks like toothpaste after completing the extension test the fittings by brushing a soap water mixture a good squeeze of dish soap in a glass of water to all the joints if there's a leak bubbles will form watch for a full minute slow leaks may take a minute to form a bubble basically the process is pull the stove from the wall turn off the supply valve and remove the flex hose determine the routing for the new pipe and the length of each piece your hardware store will cut the pipe to length and thread it have the new pipe fittings joint compound and two large pipe wrenches on hand turn off the gas at the main remove the shut off valve for the stove install the new pipe and fittings being sure to apply joint compound or gas line teflon tape to threads at each fitting reinstall the shutoff valve at the end of the new line and making shure it's off turn the gas main back on apply soap solution to each joint and watch for bubbles if you have any leaks you can try tightening the fitting but most likely you'll need to turn the gas off remove the fitting apply more joint compound  Glossary of firefighting equipment Tire Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Bong Spark plug Diving regulator Plastic Drill bit Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Trombone Screw Siphon Carburetor Carbon dioxide Irrigation Rebreather Rail terminology Electrical wiring Wrench Flush toilet Soldering Soap bubble Dialysis Brewery Casting Scuba set Portable stove Domestic water system Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar power Genericized trademark Vacuum tube Printed circuit board Knife Cookware and bakeware Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology Professional wrestling holds Diving suit Decompression sickness Diving cylinder Apollo 13 Town gas Naval mine Novelty (locomotive) Explosive material Hand grenade Bubble Bobble Brazing Computer Haloalkane Furnace Two-stroke cycle Gasoline Pipe organ Mouse (computing) Stove Urinary incontinence Oxyacetylene Bicycle frame Tai Chi Chuan Glass William Murdoch Pottery Fire hydrant Breathing gas Uilleann pipes Basement Circuit breaker High-voltage direct current Fluorescent lamp Energy development Combine (Half-Life 2) Stage lighting Glossary of firefighting terms Bread Japanese tea ceremony Universal Serial Bus Space Shuttle external tank Wood fuel Glossary of climbing terms Tap (valve) M60 machine gun Archery Rigging ALGOL 68

is it better to leave my home air conditioner on all day at a constant temperature or to vary the temperature i had a new thermostat installed and it allows me to set several different time blocks during the day to specific temperatures as an example i can have the house at degrees from am to am and then at degrees from am to pm and then back at from pm to pm and so on my fiance thinks that it is more energy effecient to leave the house at a constant temperature all day so the the air conditioner does not have to work as hard to cool down the house between temperature changes i think it is a waste to cool the house all day long when we are not at home and that recooling the house once in the evening takes less energy than maintaining the same temperature all day any thoughts on who is right there are lots of websites that say the same thing use the thermostat like it is made to save energy all day when noone is home here is what con ed has to say about it http www coned com customercentral energysavingtips asp don't cool rooms that aren't occupied open windows on breezy days instead of turning the air conditioner on make sure your air conditioner is the proper size for the area you are cooling check your air conditioner filter at least once a month and keep it clean turn off your air conditioner when no one is home set the automatic timer to turn on your air conditioner minutes before you arrive home ceiling fans can make your air conditioner's job easier while saving you money a two degree adjustment to your thermostat setting higher in summer lower in winter can lower cooling heating bills by four percent and prevent pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year if installing a new central air conditioner or heat pump you should know that recent field studies suggest that approximately percent of installed cooling equipment may have incorrect amount of refrigerant an incorrect refrigerant level can lower efficiency by five to percent and can cause the equipment to fail prematurely  Thermostat Air conditioning HVAC Carburetor Brewery Refrigerator Welding Wind power Jet engine Renewable energy Autonomous building Sun Explosive material Ozone depletion Solar variation Energy development Carbon dioxide Ozone hole Turbocharger Apollo 13 Gas metal arc welding Motor oil Hydrogen economy Dialysis Thermal power station E85 Thermoregulation Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Spacecraft propulsion Solar cell Daylight saving time Carbon dioxide sink Transformer Ocean thermal energy conversion Vacuum Coal Ice Biodiesel Three Mile Island Deep lake water cooling Water (molecule) Nuclear power Lighting Superconductivity Earth's atmosphere Urban heat island Furnace Nuclear reactor Overclocking Internal combustion engine Diesel engine Gas compressor Paragliding Wind turbine Environmental concerns with electricity generation Hydropower Haloalkane Climate change Global climate model Homeostasis Gas tungsten arc welding Ozone layer Global warming Stirling engine Climate of the United Kingdom Tire Phase (matter) Water Phase change heat pump Kyoto Protocol First aid Hydraulic machinery Supercharger Severe weather terminology (United States) Swamp cooler Dry cleaning Diode Kitchen Space shuttle main engine Turbojet Gasoline Nuclear power phase-out Electrical wiring Greenhouse effect Ironing Dishwasher Aquarium Water purification Rebreather

windmill pool took my money and refuses to complete my pool how can i get them to pay court judgement i contracted w windmill pool back in may of a year and months later they still haven't complete my pool i've fully paid windmill but i'm getting notices from subcontractors that they didn't get pay by windmill what a nightmare a shady general contractor can be tough to collect against they structure the company as a shell possesing no assets so there's no real property to seize lein you can get a lein against their bank accounts but then they just open a new account or even a new corporation it's possible for an attorney to go after the personal assets of the corporate principals but this will easily run several thousand dollars in legal fees still your first step is to talk to an attorney but be prepared for bad news depending on the size of the judgement and how slippery windmill pools is it just may not be worth pursuing unfortunately that's not the end of your headaches by paying the general contractor in full before completion of work you're double y screwed if windmill pools didn't pay their subcontractors the subs can file a workman's lein against your home and hold you liable for the work they did even though you've already paid the windmill pools again talk to an attorney there are specific time limits on when a workmans lein must be filed your best bet here is that the subs missed a key filing deadline otherwise you'll be paying for the work twice the big lesson to take away from this never pay any contractor in full in advance and only work with licensed and insured bonded contractors a legitimate contractor will carry a bond or insurance which protects you from both unpaid subs and any injuries that occur on the jobsite otherwise you're also on the hook for any work injuries insist on seeing a copy of their bond insurance and call to verify that it's current and valid also always use a payment schedule with payments tied to construction mile stones e g excavation framing and rough plumbing plaster and deck equipment and final plumbing final building inspection sign off typically these correlate to points in the building inspection process and you only pay when the building inspector has signed off on that stage of construction  Insurance Mortgage Life insurance Construction Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Poker jargon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bond United States Postal Service Taxation in the United States Corporation Money Estoppel Copyright Trademark Tax Credit card Enron Corporation Lawyer SCO-Linux controversies Annuity ITV Microeconomics Wal-Mart 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bank fraud Mechanics lien Plame affair Schabir Shaik Trial Warren Buffett Contract Bank Trade union Bank of China (Hong Kong) Attorney at Law Divorce Finance Security (finance) Probation officer Spyware Government debt Patent Workers' compensation Gold standard Copyleft Institutional fund management Surety bond Octopus card Bechtel Corporation Temasek Holdings Hedge fund Crew Exploration Vehicle Auto insurance Child support Notary public Same-sex marriage in the United States Capitalism Tennessee State Constitution Betting (poker) Software patent debate FairTax Wind turbine Blackjack Nuclear proliferation Appeal Economy of Russia Variable universal life insurance Medical prescription Unemployment Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Gambling Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Halliburton 2003 California recall Commodity markets E-mail spam OpenDocument Internet fraud Tort reform Trust (Law) non-USA Real estate broker Citigroup Health insurance Mergers and acquisitions George W.

self home building permits needed plumbing electricity i want to build a home on my own land not a full sized normal home but something about the size of an apartment the question comes down to if i'm allowed to wire my own house and or if it's as efficient and legal to buy a natural gas generator and use extension cords behind the walls what are the costs involved in and most realistic ways to get water and electricity into a house how much would the cost of doing such things measure up against the price of building materials ie wood and cement for the foundation btw when i say extension cords i mean hooked to a minor say watt generator not a public ie grid power supply i wouldn't dare deal with anything that high voltage i'd compare placing extension cords in the walls for electricity to running garden hoses for water there are proper materials for the job use them or don't waste your time do the job right and you will be better off if you want to operate the house from a portable generator wire it up exactly as if you were connected to the grid install an electrical panel and run proper wiring to outlets lighting appliances etc it will be easy to plug the generator into the panel to power the house if at some time you plan to connect to the grid the house will already be wired and ready to go  Solar power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Solar cell Transformer Electrical generator Electrical wiring Renewable energy Incandescent light bulb Welding Spark plug Autonomous building Alternating current Three-phase electric power Hydrogen economy Solar panel High-voltage direct current Electric power transmission Battery (electricity) Fuse (electrical) Ground and neutral Hybrid vehicle Electric motor Electricity meter TGV Nuclear power Energy development Laptop Thermal power station Kitchen BS 1363 Wind power Future energy development Oscilloscope Circuit breaker Transistor Electrical wiring (UK) Vacuum cleaner Manitoba Hydro Universal Serial Bus Loudspeaker Split phase Battery electric vehicle Radio controlled airplane Residual-current device Electric power Fan (implement) Seismic retrofit Rail transport modelling Mains electricity Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Overhead lines Bicycle lighting Thermostat Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Grid energy storage Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Solar power satellite Internal combustion engine 2003 North America blackout Spacecraft propulsion Power cord Glossary of firefighting terms Power line communication X10 (industry standard) Extension Cord Toyota Prius Fuel cell War of Currents Rapid transit George Westinghouse E85 Electricity distribution Lighting Plastic Gas turbine Natural gas Fluorescent lamp Nuclear reactor Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Alternative fuel Sewage treatment Power station Arc welding Lawn mower Circuit design Jack plug Hydraulic machinery Enron Corporation Audiophile Thermocouple

why are co op boards so strict probably because of the method of owning an apartment in a co op unlike owning a house or a condominium when you buy a co op you aren't buying an apartment per se but buying shares in the building which is owned cooperatively by all the residents you're really part of a corporation the board operates in the same way as the board of directors of any corporation with the powers to make rules regulations as well as direct the daily operations of the business in a co op building this means they have the power to screen prospective buyers of apartments primarily to assure that they have the financial ability to pay over the term of their agreement but also to make sure that the prospective buyers will fit in with the general ambiance and standards of that particular building this can mean to put it crudely keeping out the riff raff which in many co ops in nyc means rock musicians entertainment personalities other kinds of people who the board feels would be unstable residents and sometimes also means excluding people simply based on the prejudices of the other residents of the building the board is also empowered to regulate the lives of the residents to whatever degree is stated in the by laws of the building this can mean rules about pets items that can or cannot be left in common hallways signs or decorations that are visible on the outside of the building etc they also determine rules on sub letting apartments and even how long someone can visit boards are elected by the share owners so how strict they are in any given situation will vary given the current residents of any given building if you're thinking of trying a co op apartment you should have your realtor obtain a copy of the building by laws and restrictive covenants before you start the process of trying to buy  Housing cooperative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Real estate broker Capitalism Dividend Contract Intellectual property United Kingdom corporation tax Stock Life insurance Corporate governance Copyright law of the United Kingdom Apartment building Security (finance) Public domain Wal-Mart Forum moderator Condominium Republic Microeconomics Donald Trump Cooperative Futures contract Patent Concurrent estate Property (ownership right) Political subdivisions of New York State Option Apartment Rupert Murdoch Monopoly (game) Congress of the United States Insurance Irish Houses of Parliament Government of Maryland Theory of conduct Illegal drug trade Article One of the United States Constitution ITV Commodity markets Non-aggression principle Treaty Stock market Supply and demand Tax Mutual fund Capital accumulation Royal Assent Pretty Good Privacy Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Consensus decision-making Trademark Coercion Appeal Leasing Public policy SCO-Linux controversies Gross domestic product Lawyer Citigroup First-sale doctrine Digital rights management Campaign finance reform Restrictive covenant Democracy Separation of church and state Conrail Dormant Commerce Clause Unreformed House of Commons Political divisions of the United States Copyleft Poker jargon Polyamory Media in Hong Kong Mikhail Khodorkovsky Microsoft Gun politics Wealth Israeli settlement Amway Apprenticeship Accountancy Government of France United States House of Representatives Education in Australia Divorce Price discrimination Speaker of the British House of Commons Politics of the United States CBS Marriage Mobile home Salary cap Mixed economy Election

remove scratches from a soft leather chair we have a lovely quality soft leather armchair in the office yesterday our kittens were behaving like terrorists and went on a run around using the chair as a climbing frame my husband has gone bananas there are many small scratches to the surface of the leather no tears but just like needles have been scratched over the surface in places and very fine surface rips that although aren't too deep they show and my husband is really sad it is a very special chair of his and i wondered if anyone has any knowledge of how to remove the scratches fine sandpaper and wax maybe there is a great new product on the market called easy colour which has been developed for precisely this problem you can buy it from ltt in a colour to suit your suite it is a wipe on product which will fill in the scratches and replace the colour it is very easy to use car colours and pigments as in other repair kits may be the wrong type of product depending on what type of leather you have http www lttsolutions net leather repair consultants to the furniture and cleaning industries  Leather Upholstery Gramophone record Strap-on dildo Pottery Casting Woodworking Welding Japanese tea ceremony Radio controlled airplane Textile manufacturing terminology Tire Knife Drill bit Drawing Chair Lionel Corporation Cross-country skiing Gilding Shoe Clothing De Lorean DMC-12 Radio controlled car Cat Turquoise Airsoft Warez RuneScape quests Scale model Tattoo Thermal power station Bulk vending Color Tooth Brewery Hydrochloric acid Disc brake Printmaking Hard disk Diamond Arcade cabinet Floppy disk Volleyball Billiards Violin Bong Movie projector Wood carving Energy development Nintendo Entertainment System Pastel Illegal drug trade Glacier Motorcycle Motor oil Cotton Tofu O scale Menstrual cup Diseases of the honeybee Fishing Dairy Oscilloscope Jute Top-bar hive Doctor (Doctor Who) Hamster Intravenous therapy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Agriculture Graffiti Inkjet printer Glass Beretta 92F/FS Amateur telescope making M4 Sherman Car washing techniques Land Rover (Series/Defender) Equine conformation Compact disc Material properties of diamond Carburetor Trademark View camera Berkshire Hathaway Aluminium Common Unix Printing System Diamond simulant Timpani Frogman Manicure Naval mine Seismic retrofit Internet protocol suite Shaggy dog story Tanning

how can i get rid of weeds called cats ears from my lawn i was curious on what exactly cats ears on a lawn were i had never heard of that name before first search and i found this cats ear for a weed this has an enormous variety of names used to describe itself false dandelion flatweed hairy cat's ear hairy wild lettuce etc are just some of them whatever you decide to call it it still remains a weed this is so common that most gardeners would have found it in their lawn at some stage cat's ears large flat leaves lie flat on the ground smothering everything that it covers it acts as a natural soil solariser but unfortunately kills your lawn instead of the weeds there are two ways to address this type of weed obviously the first method is to eradicate them either manually or by using a spot glyphosate on the centre of the weed the second method is to actually keep them in your lawn but continually mow them the reason for this is that cat's ear has an amazingly long taproot that can bring many nutrients to the surface and actually help your lawn grow healthier however this second method is a gamble if you don't mow them well enough they can continue to grow and eventually take over i would recommend allowing them to grow for a few regular mowing periods and then treat them  Weed control Weed Dandelion Lawn Comfrey Agriculture Lettuce Catsear Hydroponics Lawn mower Leaf Kudzu Irrigation Organic farming Roundup Anchor Maize Gypsy moth Ragweed Herbicide Organic gardening Guinea pig Sewage treatment Biological pest control Organic food Genetically modified food Tennis Tobacco Carnivorous plant Gooseberry Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sugar beet Offer and acceptance Burial Masanobu Fukuoka Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Burdock Tick Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Ragwort Poker jargon Gardening Creeping Charlie Gray Wolf Biodynamic agriculture Cat Wetland Nepeta Green roof Glyphosate Domestic rabbit Fish farming Vegetation Horseshoe Skateboarding trick Hemp Deforestation Cheetah Dog Chatsworth House Mulch Hay Compost Carpal tunnel syndrome Alaga__sia Clover Pansy Rice Moss Stereoscopy Tetrapod Turnip (brassica rapa) New Zealand English Infantilism Sonchus Bonsai Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Combine harvester Rail tracks Cancer Livestock Cannabis cultivation Root Monster Rancher monsters Stinging nettle Soil pH Green Revolution Filigree Plough Chlorophyta Tomato Dairy Feral cat Digitaria Illegal drug trade Xeriscaping Rainforest

i live in the d c area i want solar panels where do i go for quotes and installation i agree with the advise given that you really need to search the internet a little before putting out that kind of cash find out what you need and know what you are looking for before you start talking to dealers some dealers are great and will give you a good deal and a dealer will be able to install it quicker because they have done it before but don't fall for the story that only a solar electric dealer can install your system for the install you need someone who can find the rafters in your roof to mount the solar panels to someone to hang the power panel on the wall and then you need an electrician to wire it all up not a rocket science a building permit for the install an electrician for the state you live in and fill out the paper work from the electric co be sure to file for all fed state and any local incentives you can get check this link for rebates http www dsireusa org check out this page to understand how to size a system http www oynot com solar info html remember you can buy your system from one palce and have someone else to install it or do it your self  Solar power HyperText Transfer Protocol Solar cell Electrician Solar panel Mozilla Firefox Uniform Resource Locator Domain Name System Electrical wiring World Wide Web Poker jargon Common Unix Printing System Roof Autonomous building Representational State Transfer Mozilla Application Suite Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Internet fraud Wget Internet PHP Solar power satellite STS-61 Three-phase electric power Betting (poker) Web crawler BS 1363 Spyware HTML Proxy server Web server Wind turbine Electric boat Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fan (implement) Burglar alarm FairTax BitTorrent Solar variation Whois Plagiarism Apollo 15 Plame affair timeline Fuse (electrical) Macromedia Flash Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities OpenBSD Light-frame construction Gravity Spacecraft propulsion Ford Motor Company CPAN CPU cache Elevator Web browser Cruising (maritime) Planet Wiki Electrical engineering Computer virus Internet Explorer Satellite HTML element TGV Colonization of the Moon Split phase Website XHTML Google Desktop Electricity meter Craps Hubble Space Telescope Software patent debate Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Electrical wiring (UK) Comparison of web browsers Windows 2000 Kitchen Distribution board HTTP cookie Dan Dare Electric power transmission William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin WebDAV History of the Internet Illegal drug trade Mahjong MSN Messenger Solar sail Freenet Interactive fiction Roof and tunnel hacking Slashdot subculture Fuel cell Dodge Charger Transmission Control Protocol Lighting

i live in florida i was wondering how do those nasty palmetto bugs get in houses by the way my house is clean pipes most commonly they come in at a crack where they dug the pipes in or a crack in a closet the pipes that run under your house straight up into your bathroom under the sink are not sealed that tightly think round pipe square hole often if you have a sunroom or screened in porch the seal around the door isn't as good as the outside doors since it doesn't need to meet the same waterproofing standards they can walk into the garage from the outside and then once in the garage there are often cracks where the concrete slabs don't match up especially if the garage was added on later of course they can also come up from inside the pipe itself into the tub or kitchen sink they find ways but most of the time it is into a bathroom or kitchen filthy little things aren't they i live at the beach and i know what you mean can't keep your house clean enough to not have them but every area has something i used to live in the mountains and we had ladybugs and for a month or so you'd have hundreds of ladybugs in your house and nothing you could do about it i poor clorox down the drain and i like to think that does something to discourage them and a cheap method at that but i'm not sure it really works or just makes me feel better about it  Kitchen Poker jargon The Brady Bunch Seismic retrofit Dundas Square Shaggy dog story Hogwarts Floor Directory McMansion Jackass: The Movie Knife Drill bit Dairy Domestic water system Plumbing fixture The Shining (film) Japanese toilet Saw II Social rule The Inside Washroom Basement The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wood carving Ladybug (arcade game) Screw Conspiracy (TNG episode) Dishwasher Bong Dormitory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Young Ones (TV series) Textile manufacturing Debugging Humphrey Bogart Toilet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drug test Sailing Columbine High School massacre Passive solar Prisons in the United States Bus models used in New York City Transit Ultima Online Jumpstart 3rd Grade Concrete Dymaxion house Fecal incontinence Naval mine Light-emitting diode Diamond Scarlet's Walk Combine (Half-Life 2) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Floppy disk Blood Simple Masonry Equine conformation Brewery Cosmo Kramer Brazing Trapped in the Closet Jam (TV series) King Khalid International Airport Computer security Plastic Dishwashing Russian joke Hebburn The Fairly OddParents Shotgun house RuneScape quests TARDIS Futurama (TV series - season 4) Syphon Filter Wind turbine Internal ballistics Mach kernel Avenue Q The Hobbit Air-raid shelter Toilet paper Diseases of the honeybee Casting Friends Solar cell Flush toilet The Suffering (game) Naruto jutsu The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Eifel Aqueduct Rathfarnham Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Autonomous building Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) EastEnders Anchor Diving Volleyball Abbey About Schmidt

does anyone know about the dangers of those large green electric boxes that sit in the middle of the grass we have alot of children in our neighborhood who seem to think that it's o k to play on the electric box in our yard i am not concerned that they are in the yard but i wonder about the dangers of electricution on these boxes can anyone tell me some stories or give me some information that might scare them away telling them is one thing listening is obviously another thanks i cannot give you any good scare stories but i agree the kids have to learn to play responsibly that includes staying off of these boxes usually you see those boxes where there are underground power lines so the wires and equipment are out of reach the cabinets should always be locked and therefore accessible only to authorized personnel while these boxes are electrically safe it would be a good idea to tell your kids not to climb on the box there are still ways the kids could get hurt playing on or around the enclosure often there is a label which identifies the box by location or number and includes a telephone number for the power company responsible for the box check the label and give the power company a call they would be able to answer your questions and concerns and possibly even send someone out to make sure it is safe and secure if you see a person from the power company looking it over go out with the kids and talk with the power employee they can give the kids enough information as to why they should not be playing around the equipment someone knowledgeable like that will make a bigger impression on the kids  Telephone tapping Call for help Classified information Plame affair Surveillance Loudspeaker Episodes of Lost (Season 1) High-voltage hazards Rail terminology Password Tag Universal Serial Bus Poker jargon Airport Electrical wiring The Empty Child Jumpstart 3rd Grade Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marching band Black Mesa Research Facility Public-key cryptography The Parting of the Ways Glossary of firefighting terms Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ocean's Twelve Pop punk Silent Night, Deadly Night Electricity meter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Phreaking Avenue Q Hearing impairment Railway signal Bluetooth GSM services 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Modal logic Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act 21 July 2005 London bombings Consensus decision-making Survivor (novel) Baseball The Human Stain War of the Worlds (2005 film) Paragliding Electricity Mountaineering Burglar alarm Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Telephone Hamster Donald Rumsfeld Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Time Machine Malcolm in the Middle Logic The Inside Bass guitar Home Box Office Able Danger Changeroom Children of Dune Rich Mullins Computer security United States Postal Service Contract bridge Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Government of France Epistemology Disaster ITU-T Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache Voice over IP Static (superhero) Private branch exchange Star Trek Customizable Card Game The Ark in Space U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Socrates Avalanche Nuclear proliferation TELUS Glen Jacobs Shen Gong Wu Objective-C Plame affair timeline Bank fraud Ownership 2003 North America blackout RFID The Amber Spyglass Glossary of American football Expert system Telephone exchange Floppy disk Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

i woke up to about flies in my front window how could this be i have no food out or anything like that could there be something dead outside can they get in through the air conditioner well this is an educational opportunity to remind ourselves of things we had forgotten in grade lol they may have come from your neighbors and if you live in a farm or where there is uncovered garbage containers outside etc this occurence can be explained by this article one female fly can give birth to flies in days read on the house fly life cycle these are the four distinct stages in an average house fly's life egg depending on the size of a female house fly she can lay up to eggs in a three to four day period eggs are white in color and are usually less than half and inch in size larvae larvae are commonly referred to as maggots maggots emerge from the eggs within eight to hours of being laid larvae begin eating whatever they can find in the area they were laid they prefer warm moist environments to grow in pupa after about four to days a maggot will move to higher drier ground to move into the pupa stage of its life this process take about three to six days and is where the maggot encases inself in a reddish brown skin where the final stages of development take place adult once the adult house fly hatches from the pupal stage it has an approximate life span of to days females are able to start producing eggs after two days of life and will continue to lay eggs for about a month female house flys are usually larger than the males the house fly a day in the life you will find house flies pretty much everywhere there are humans or animals flies love things like garbage manure and anything else that left out in a warm environment like the chicken you left thawing on your counter all day house flies don't feed off of human flesh they get their nutrients from spitting saliva on their food which liquifies it so they can suck it up with their sponge like mouths the house fly did u know house flies can travel up to six miles in hours but they usually prefer to stay close by their breeding ground the easiest way to keep flies out of your home is to keep things clean don't leave food lying around make sure you take out the garbage on a regular basis and wipe up messes right away fly investations are often found on farms because it is hard to keep them from breeding in the readily available manure house flies like to perch on things like wire or string and no they cannot get through air conditioning unit filters  Housefly Gypsy moth Anopheles Mosquito Insect Flea Chicken Tick Ant Butterfly Livestock Earthworm Factory farming Diseases of the honeybee Beetle Spider Biological pest control Blow-fly Vermicompost Egg (biology) Myiasis The Ark in Space Breastfeeding Coconut crab Kakapo Tooth Spruce Budworm Hamster Peanut Organic farming Tsetse fly Rocky Mountain spotted fever Honeybee Queen bee Bedbug Platypus Bird Krill Vegetarianism American lobster Fly Puberty Fancy rat Nile crocodile Salmon Veganism Taboo food and drink Carnivorous plant Kodocha Grasshopper House Mouse Wood Honeybee life cycle Domestic rabbit The Amber Spyglass Energy development Agriculture Animal Hemp Pregnancy Compost Unreal Cat Gooseberry Ostrich Cannabis cultivation Bagworm moth Cockroach Aphid Discus (fish) Menstrual cup Textile manufacturing Ladybird Climate of the United Kingdom Organic food Xenomorph Dairy Snake Bird migration Phorid fly Minor Harry Potter Beasts Antarctic krill Leatherback Sea Turtle Head louse Tuatara Elephant American Alligator Digenea Botfly

i live in central arkansas the other day i got zapped by black wasp out of the blue people are telling me it was a mud dauber but i saw of them circling a paper nest what zapped me left itchy welt with brown mark that faded overnight and left a dimple hole mud daubers can and do sting but not without complete provocation i've even laid my hand on them twice that i recall and never been stung they sting as an absolute last resort however a paper wasp gives very little warning all you have to do is breath on one the wrong way and they will nail you they are very protective of their nests and guard them viciously i had a nest growing in an empty bird house on my fence i also had tomatoes on that fence all i did was pick a tomato and vibrated the fence a little and the little bugger nailed me on the finger didn't really hurt that bad but i was lucky because they tend to attack as a group sounds like you were lucky too the paper wasp is the most aggressive and that is probably what gotcha i normally don't suggest killing wasps because most are beneficial but paper wasps are dangerous so i suggest that you get rid of the nest if you can you can purchase some raid wasp and hornet killer with a foot reach for safety for comparison mud dauber the only wasp with a thread waist they come in many colors including pure black some blue and brown harmless http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages f adv prop dimage fr dyfp t va dmud bdauber sz dall w h imgurl www thebestlinks com fimages fa fad fmuddauber jpg rurl http a f fwww thebestlinks com fmud dauber html size kb name muddauber jpg p mud dauber type jpeg no tt oid f a e f e a ei iso paper wasp http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages fp dpaper bwasp ei dutf fr dyfp t x dwrt js d ni d w h imgurl static flickr com f f c dfc m jpg rurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fchi liu f f size kb name c dfc jpg p paper wasp type jpeg no tt oid bfa c b d fusr chi liu tit yellow paper wasp hurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fchi liu f ei utf src p good luck  Hornet Wasp Butterfly JPEG USS Wasp (CV-18) Ant Flickr HTML element Spider Africanized bee Web browser Paper wasp Blue Tit Red imported fire ant USS Washington (BB-56) Tarantula USS Wasp (CV-7) Biological pest control Dog Sub-Zero Yellowjacket Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Professional wrestling holds Paul Is Dead Uniform Resource Locator Digital photography Milton H.

can i feed birds uk i want to get a bird feeder for my uk garden but i'm concerned that the weather will be turning colder soon and at the back of my mind it feels like i shouldn't feed birds near winter for some reason can i feed birds safely or am i going to make them starve in winter once you start feeding it should be on a regular basis then the birds will associate your garden with a food supply this becomes very important during the winter months and they will keep returning to you by attracting them to your garden at this time of the year you are doing yourself a favour they will eat some of the bits you put out then turn their attention to the bugs which will be destroying your plants so you build up a symbiotic relationship they need a higher calorific diet in the winter nuts suet seeds fat peckers make sure they have fresh water summer and winter keep ice clear in the cold weather a bird bath is ideal because they can spruce up their feathers as well  Bird migration Seabird Hamster Bird feeder Vegetarianism Acorn Cereal Domesticated turkey Water (molecule) Carnivorous plant Breastfeeding Nutrition Ice cream Biological pest control Vitamin C Bird Bread Peanut Tlingit Water Squirrel Egg (food) Organic food Christmas tree Omega-3 fatty acid Mosquito Hunting Kakapo Winter Hummingbird Sento Albatross Life in the Freezer Gypsy moth Veganism Organic farming Agriculture Ostrich Climate of the United Kingdom Livestock Bird bath Dieting Operation Barbarossa Genetically modified food Atlanta metropolitan area Anorexia nervosa Canary Hedgehog Robert Falcon Scott RuneScape quests El Ni__o Watermelon Symbiosis Alfalfa Chili con carne Ice Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Emu Species K__ppen climate classification Falconry Dairy Birdfeeding Foie gras Diesel engine Ozone depletion Fish farming Domestication Sorghum Renewable energy Guinea pig Airport Venus Flytrap Severe weather terminology (United States) Maize Pok__mon Abilities Antarctic krill Little Ice Age YuYu Hakusho Customs and etiquette of Japan Mealy Parrot Obesity Ozone hole Pine Billboard (advertising) Orca Thermal power station Skiing Brown Bear Gardening Battle of the Bulge Famine Agusan del Sur Milk Garfield

i have this sewing machine it's really old to my knowledge it still works but i havent tried to use it as it is greek to me to a collector or avid sewer would it be worth anything i'm going to put it in a yard sale how much should i ask for it stop before you put it in a yard sale do your research look on the sewing machine and find out the name of the maker it is usually on the long horizontal portion of the machine look also for an identifying number for instance right now i'm looking at a green machine from the 's up on the long horizontal portion it says bernina favorit and on the pillar of the machine that's the part that acts just like a support pillar on a building it says so i know it is a bernina i'd do a google on bernina i'd turn up numerous listings for bernina maybe a few for checking those listings i'd learn a bit about how desirable it is to a collector then i might go to ebay and look for the same but specify completed auctions in the search don't think you can get an ebay price at a yard sale because those ebay sales are mostly salesmanship with lots of pictures and increasingly professional text but you can avoid selling a machine for and finding out later after you find out the price do your best to maximize the appeal of your machine by cleaning it at least clean the outside the safest way i've found to do this without harming the decals decals are the decorations you find on the machine in some circumstances is by using baby oil on a soft cloth put the baby oil on the cloth rub the machine lightly then move to a dry portion of the cloth and rub again this will clean and give it a nice shine and smell then consider photographing it and selling it on your local craig's list again don't expect ebay prices just present it as best you can with photos and some of the information you learned in your google search you were taking notes right specify that the seller has to pick it up that way you can avoid the hazards that await the person who packs a sewing machine for shipment and doesn't know what they're doing they'll arrive money will cross palms and the machine and whatever came with it will go off to the new owner  Google Upholstery Textile manufacturing Bulk vending Amazon.com Autograph Microeconomics Surveillance Live 8 Illegal drug trade Philatelic investment Mattress Clothing Windows XP Auction Tattoo Network effect Characters in the Smurfs Supply and demand Sewing machine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Contract Slide rule Coffee Coin collecting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swimming ROM image Comanche Toyota Prius Shaggy dog story Chrono Trigger Oil-for-Food Programme Tax Thermal power station Expert system Sewing New York City Subway Lionel Corporation Monopoly Donald Trump Electronic commerce Web crawler Bookbinding Arbitrage Violin USS Tunny (SS-282) Drill bit Mozilla Firefox Dodge Charger The Star Wars Holiday Special Online auction business model Tofu Technical analysis Gmail Social rule Short selling Jute Hemp IBM PC compatible Airport IPod Insurance Gramophone record Atari 8-bit family Password Web traffic Copyleft CPU design Book collecting Photography United States dollar Monopoly (game) Friends Pet skunk US and Canadian license plates Economics O.

what causes large black circles on my tomatoes in my garden the spots are like the tom's laid on the ground but i noticed today that it is even on the above branches it is only located on the bottom of the tomatoes the problem is called blossom end rot ber and is caused by a lack of calcium within the fruit when calcium reaches low levels in the tomato the fruit simply dies back at the bottom leaving the characteristic black or brown spot calcium is present in most soils in adequate amounts the problem is that the plant cannot absorb enough calcium through its roots because of dry soil conditions that's because calcium is taken up by the roots along with water if for some reason water uptake is restricted calcium uptake will stop what can you do about it have your soil tested to make sure you have enough calcium in the soil if you don't add either limestone if the soil's acidity level or ph is below or gypsum if calcium levels are adequate the most important control measure is to maintain optimum soil moisture whenever tomato plants are allowed to experience the slightest bit of water stress you are causing ber to maintain good soil moisture try using a mulch of straw leaves or even grass clippings to prevent evaporation tomatoes need about one inch of water per week as a minimum if you do not get this through rainfall you will need to apply the water as a rough estimate each tomato plant needs approximately gallons of water each week if you use a mulch this amount may be cut in half when watering don't lightly sprinkle the ground apply the water so it enters the ground and moves through the soil to a depth of inches shallow watering only encourages shallow rooting which leaves tomato plants more prone to wilting  Soil pH Desert Physiological plant disorders Sugar beet Gypsy moth Hydroponics Insulin Irrigation Carbon dioxide Comfrey Sorghum Coffee Houseplant Rain Fertilizer Drainage Weed control Hamster Wildfire Mattress Seismic retrofit Tofu Portland cement Equine conformation Brewery Pachypodium habitats Hemp Garden Strawberry Tomato Ecology Pachypodium Deforestation Soil salination Bonsai Chernobyl accident Wood Eutrophication Desertification Leaf Compost Alcohol fuel Textile manufacturing Calcium Lawn mower Tobacco Effects of global warming Lake Water E85 Organic gardening Japanese tea ceremony Dairy Soil Rainforest Peach Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit Wetland Ecohydrology Sewage treatment Water purification Breastfeeding Vitamin C Organic food Jute Anchor Auxin Flowering plant Glossary of wildland fire terms Lawn Amazon River Earthworm Tooth Herbicide Edible salt Apple Water (molecule) Anorexia nervosa Honey fungus Acorn Global warming and agriculture Veganism Protein Xeriscaping Nuclear power Concrete Rice Carbon dioxide sink Bog Hydrochloric acid Weed

planting a tree a few questions i know the basics about planting a tree but i do have a few questions the tree is a red maple in a gallon pot and it's about feet tall how long can i keep it in the pot before i plant it do i need to do any pruning how far from a driveway should i plant it so that it will get maximum water for the roots but not damage the cement driveway any other hints or suggestions are welcomed i'm in zone thank you the tree can remain in the pot for a good while if it was approximately feet when you purchased it otherwise if it has grown considerably since you've had it you should consider transplanting it you're supposed to prune bushes after transplanting but not trees i would plant the tree a significant distance from the driveway since the roots will one day become very large and may just push up the driveway however it there is very little other foliage or trees in the area the tree shouldn't have to compete for water soil and nutrients having said that i would plant the tree at least feet from the cement at this time of the year i would wait until autumn before i ransplant the reason is because sap in trees will eventually draw down into the root system in the fall this will result in less root shock for the tree after transplanting the tree you should water it regularly perhaps even watering the tree twice per day for the first week then daily for another two weeks this will allow the tiny root hairs to establish themselves and create a strong watering sytem for years to come it would also be beneficial to the tree if you were to buy some of those miracle grow spikes and hammer one into the ground just outside the perimeter of the root system of the tree you can estimate this by figuring the height of the tree aprx feet then figure about a foot ring around the base of the tree this is what the root system should initially aspire to reach then it will root out in several directions good luck as your tree grows to produce a beautiful yard speciman  Bamboo Bonsai Fruit tree propagation Pruning fruit trees Cannabis cultivation Garden Strawberry Hydroponics Hurricane Rita Tree Weed control Sequoia 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Root Wood Coffee Eucalyptus Auxin Geothermal areas of Yellowstone European Beech 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Vegetation Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Flowering plant Liriodendron Olive Coast Douglas-fir Pachypodium Carbon dioxide sink Desert Opportunity rover Soil pH Old growth forest Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Grafting Campfire Venus Flytrap Glossary of wildland fire terms Plant Portland cement GunBound Hippeastrum Logging Apple Peanut Tamarix Maple Poker jargon Apical dominance Carnivorous plant Acorn RuneScape skills Irrigation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Deforestation Yosemite National Park Aerial root Tobacco Soil life Toxicodendron Dundas Square Professional wrestling throws Chernobyl accident Computer chess Coconut Solar system Normal distribution Atlanta metropolitan area Florida Keys Black pepper Hydrangea Rainforest Apricot Tag Tsunami Professional wrestling holds Hemp Tide Christmas tree Fire fighting Domain Name System Peach Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Caliche Dog agility Teapot Seismic retrofit Hurricane Frances Orchidaceae Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wisteria Prospect Park (Brooklyn) Pine Pinophyta

does anyone know a way of getting rid of ants in your home with ou killing them my daughter really doesn't want to kill the ant in our bathroom is there anyway of getting rid of them without killing them if you can figure out where they are coming from just place cinnamon sticks there they don't like it and they stay away but it doesn't hurt them i have also heard that bay leaves work but i have never had any luck with that another trick they won't cross a chalk line so again if you know where they are coming in you could block them with that if you don't know where they are coming from you could also try sprinkling baby powder on the countertop they won't walk through it you could probably just put cinnamon sticks on the counter too but they may just move to a different part of the house good luck  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Chess strategy and tactics Pitaten The Inside Luck EastEnders Bubble Bobble Characters of Lost Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan Muslim ibn Aqeel Aerial (dance move) True Crime: Streets of LA Ant Phoebe Halliwell Animal Crossing Oh My Goddess!

how do i keep mold from forming on my strawberry jam when i can it of all the jams and jellies that my wife and i can strawberry jam seems to give us the worst problem there should never be any mold present when properly canned sounds like you need to re evaluate your processing get a blue book for canning and follow it exactly this is more of a science than an art for sure my guesses are starting with a product the fruit that is already over ripe if anything use slightly under ripe fruit discard anything that is soft and mushy leaving too much head space in jars distance between product and seal lid jars not actually sealing properly when sealed properly you should actually be able to hear them sort of ping during the night as they seal themselves my grand mother actually used to know the exact counts in her head of what she'd canned that day and as one would ping late into the night she'd be heard saying softly  Food preservation Sauerkraut Canning Garden Strawberry Jelly Cheese Fruit Cannabis cultivation Wang Mang Antique fruit jar IP (complexity) Casting Tea Tin can Strawberry Cuisine of Brazil Jazz Waste management Tofu Food Pearl Jam Strawberry Fields Forever Jamiroquai Plastic Fanta Beastie Boys Gatorade USS Tunny (SS-282) Phonograph cylinder Bong Hamster Genericized trademark Grand Ole Opry Peanut butter Loganberry Four sons of Horus Radar USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Table tennis Dr Pepper Porgy and Bess The J.M.

what is the best thing to keep spiders out of your house spiders are the filthiest creatures on earth they do not clean themselves so spraying a residual pesticide will not have any effect on them since they will not ingest it what i recommend you do is treat the outside of your home windows doors foundation eves and spigots with any basic exterior pesticide this will keep any other insects out of your home spiders are hunters so if they are in your home they are hunting something then make sure you change any outdoor lighting to the yellow bug lights again trying to keep other insects aka food source away all you would then have to do is keep taking down their webs spiders are also lazy if you keep removing their webs they will go somewhere else where they are left alone good luck  Biological pest control Spider Pesticide Insect Diseases of the honeybee DDT Gypsy moth Organic farming Bedbug Pollinator decline Oddworld Green Revolution Mosquito Items in the Metroid series Shen Gong Wu Metroid Prime Knife Hamster Jet Force Gemini Organic food Cockroach Gaucho (insecticide) Nuclear fallout SimAnt Dioxin Characters of Naruto Camp Lazlo Foodborne illness Poison Python programming language Star Wars: Galaxies Essential oil Vinegar Hedgehog Chagas disease Creatures in Bionicle Ultraviolet Carnivorous plant Web crawler Pysanka Venom (comics) Malaria Pollination management Red-back spider Shotgun St Andrew's Cross spider Pesticide poisoning The End of the World (Doctor Who) First aid Genetic engineering Caffeine Vegetarianism Insecticide Hunter __ Hunter Naruto jutsu In-N-Out Burger Agricultural wastewater treatment Mortar (weapon) Neopets Ultimate Spider-Man Debugging Star Wars: Battlefront Kosher foods Tarantula Black widow spider Food Rachel Carson Textile manufacturing Dairy Pesticide toxicity to bees Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Air pollution Fauna of Australia Apple Light pollution Netscape Communications Corporation Computer virus Grasshopper Pesticide misuse Software bug Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Unreal Dungeon Keeper Arthropod Japanese tea ceremony Blood (computer game) Tokusatsu Gas metal arc welding Customs and etiquette of Japan Adam and Eve Cannabis (drug) Xanadu House Cat Nutrition Tarantula hawk Color Sewage treatment

bumblebee nest we didn't know we had one in our yard until my husband dumped some dirt in a low spot suddenly we have a bunch of angry bumbles circling around the dirt mound and they don't look happy that's just an assumption since i can't see if they are smiling or frowning we would never have deliberately harmed or blocked their home but how can i tell that to a bee is there anything we can do now or will they dig it out themselves and can we ever use that part of our yard again bumbles make small nests compared to other types of bees i've had them in a hollow next to the driveway in the ground under a shrub and in the middle of the garden where a tree had been removed and a hollow left from the roots being taken out a typical backyard colony might have around fifty individuals without the working bumbles to feed her the queen is most likely dead already just leave it alone the workers who came to the nest's defense with no where to go now will likely die off as well it's sad because bumbles are in short supply in a lot of places but you didn't know they had a nest there so don't feel too bad they only use the next one season in most area of the us with no queens to hatch from that nest this year you may not have to deal with any next year  Bumblebee Bee Ant Beehive (beekeeping) Poker jargon Zerg Honeybee Termite Pollinator decline Kakapo Carpenter bee Volleyball Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Red imported fire ant Viva La Bam Rigging Hornet EastEnders Dodge Charger Platypus Honeybee life cycle Gypsy moth McMansion Satchel Paige Super Bowl XVII The Death Gate Cycle K' Diseases of the honeybee Seabird New York Giants Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station Theory of conduct Invasion of the Waikato Easement Burial Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling slang Casting Numbat Africanized bee Microeconomics Paper wasp Bamboo Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory The Brady Bunch Queen bee Old growth forest Dead Like Me Chicken Knife Terran (StarCraft) Marilyn Monroe Camp (style) Quicksort Glossary of American football Japanese tea ceremony GunBound The Dukes of Hazzard Air-raid shelter SimAnt Worker bee Wood Pollination management Swarming (honeybee) Textile manufacturing Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago White Sox Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rachel Corrie Orchidaceae Pitaten Apple Grafting Capercaillie Field hockey Brood (honeybee) Armored Core Tick Conker's Bad Fur Day The Smoking Room Biological pest control Spotted Nutcracker National Football League Lore Megachilidae Time Out of Mind Ultimate (sport) The Amber Spyglass Super Bowl IX Carburetor Common Wasp Pollination Tobacco One Tree Hill (TV series) Atlanta Braves Bee learning and communication RuneScape quests Christiansborg Palace Compiler optimization

how do i get rid of pesky house flies one of the most effective home remedies to get rid of flies involves hanging clear plastic bags of water near outdoor entryways this might sound like a ridiculous way to get rid of flies but people who live on farms and those who operate fruit stands use this home remedy to get rid of flies on a regular basis and swear by it while visiting arisona i saw these things hanging all over the place and asked about it sure enough it's to keep the flies out there is more than one theory behind this home remedy and the first theory hinges on the natural instincts and the poor eyesight of flies clear bags of water are said to cast images that to a fly resemble spider webs and flies steer clear of anything that resembles a web the other theory claims the reflection of the water disorients flies and this illusion is said to be an effective way to get rid of flies and greatly control their numbers whatever the reason this home remedy is said to really work simply fill gallon size bags of water about halfway full and hang the bags outdoor areas where flies are a problem suspend the bags near entryways garage doors and anywhere else files seem to graze according to this home remedy you ll notice a great reduction in the fly population almost immediately  Spider G-Man (Half-Life) Mercury Atlas 6 Determinism Dairy Contract Hydroponics Suicide methods Milk Stoicism Kitchen Coffee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Light pollution Homunculus Dialysis American individualist anarchism Bong Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Skateboarding trick Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Microeconomics Horseshoe Bad Wolf Plastic Phaedo Bush v.

how can you tell how long you have had mice we recently found droppings in a cabinet they much be recent we are in there about once a week so we would notice any droppings we think it just started but why nothing has changed except out above ground pool burst flooding our backyard anyway there is a pretty decent amount of droppings in the cabinet kind of looks like someone spilled some chocolate sprinkles for ice cream http www ipm ucdavis edu pmg pestnotes pn html management because house mice are so small they can gain entry into homes and other buildings much more easily than rats as a result house mouse infestations are probably to times more common than rat infestations effective control involves sanitation exclusion and population reduction sanitation and exclusion are preventive measures when a mouse infestation already exists some form of population reduction such as trapping or baiting is almost always necessary a key to successful long term mouse control is the limitation of shelter and of food sources wherever possible trapping works well when mice are not numerous or it can be used as a follow up measure after a baiting program when considering a baiting program decide if the presence of dead mice will cause an odor or sanitation problem if so trapping may be the best approach removal of mice should be followed by taking steps to exclude them so that the problem does not recur several types of rodenticides are used in baits the anticoagulant rodenticides are most commonly available and can be used in and around buildings table because all rodenticides are toxic to humans pets and wildlife take special precautions to prevent the poisoning of nontarget animals sanitation because mice can survive in very small areas with limited amounts of food and shelter their control can be very challenging especially in and around older structures most buildings in which food is stored handled or used will support house mice if the mice are not excluded no matter how good the sanitation while good sanitation will seldom completely control mice poor sanitation is sure to attract them and will permit them to thrive in greater numbers pay particular attention to eliminating places where mice can find shelter if they have few places to hide rest or build nests and rear their young they cannot survive in large numbers exclusion exclusion is the most successful and permanent form of house mouse control build them out by eliminating all gaps and openings larger than inch through which mice will enter a structure steel wool makes a good temporary plug seal cracks in building foundations and around openings for water pipes vents and utility cables with metal or concrete doors windows and screens should fit tightly it may be necessary to cover the edges of doors and windows with metal to prevent gnawing plastic screening rubber or vinyl insulating foam wood and other gnawable materials are unsuitable for plugging holes used by mice traps trapping is an effective method for controlling small numbers of house mice although time consuming it is the preferred method in homes garages and other structures where only a few mice are present trapping has several advantages it does not rely on potentially hazardous rodenticides it permits the user to view his or her success and it allows for disposal of trapped mice thereby eliminating dead mouse odors that may occur when poisoning is done within buildings simple inexpensive wood based snap traps are effective and can be purchased in most hardware and grocery stores traps can be baited with a variety of foods peanut butter is the most popular because it is easy to use and very attractive to mice set the triggers lightly so the traps will spring easily multiple capture live traps for mice such as the victor tin cat and the ketch all also are available from hardware stores and pest control suppliers they can catch several mice at a time without being reset so labor requirements are reduced set traps behind objects in dark corners and in places where there is evidence of mouse activity place them close to walls so mice will pass directly over the trigger traps can be set on ledges on top of pallets of stored materials or in any other locations where mice are active use enough traps to make the trapping period short and decisive mice seldom venture far from their shelter and food supply so space traps no more than about feet apart in areas where mice are active an alternative to traps are glue boards which catch and hold mice that are attempting to cross them in much the same way flypaper catches flies they are available at many places where other rodent control products are sold place glue boards along walls where mice travel do not use them where children pets or desirable wildlife can contact them nontarget animals that become caught on the glue board can be removed in most cases by using vegetable oil as a solvent to loosen the glue glue boards lose their effectiveness in dusty areas unless covered extreme temperatures also may affect the tackiness of glue boards one problem with live catch traps and glue boards is that you need to dispose of the live mice cervical dislocation is an acceptable method of euthanasia for mice caught on glue boards this means taking a sturdy rod or stick and delivering a sharp blow to the base of the skull drowning is not considered humane although it is sometimes suggested by trap manufacturers releasing live caught mice back to the outdoors frequently promotes increased mouse problems baits baits to control rodents are formulated with an attractant generally food and a rodenticide toxin most rodenticides used to control mice around the home are already mixed with an attractant in commercially ready to use baits the rodenticides in these baits are either anticoagulants or other rodenticides such as single dose toxicants and chronic rodenticides anticoagulant rodenticides anticoagulants cause death as a result of internal bleeding which occurs as the animal s blood loses the ability to clot and capillaries are damaged the active ingredients are used at very low levels and the onset of symptoms is delayed so the rodent does not avoid the bait because of its taste or the onset of illness when prepared with good quality cereals and other bait ingredients all anticoagulant baits provide good to excellent house mouse control if placed in suitable locations for the mice the various anticoagulant active ingredients currently registered for use against house mice in california are listed in table table anticoagulant rodenticides for house mouse control registered for use in california common name example trade names chemical name brodifacoum d con havoc jaguar ' bromo ' biphenyl yl tetrahydro naphthalenyl hydroxy h benzopyran one bromadiolone boot hill hawk ' bromo ' biphenyl yl hydroxy phenylpropyl hydroxy h benzopyran one chlorophacinone j t eaton ac formula p chlorophenyl phenylacetyl indandione difethialone d con hombre 'bromo ' biphenyl yl tetrahydro napthylenyl' hydroxy h benzothiopyran one diphacinone ramik diphenylacetyl indandione warfarin d con kaput rat mouse bait acetonylbenzyl hydroxycoumarin always check the label for active ingredients a i the same or similar trade names may be used for products with different a i because some anticoagulants require multiple feedings over several days before a lethal amount is ingested fresh bait must be made available to mice continuously over a period of time in practice baits can be offered to mice for at least weeks or as long as feeding occurs while the newer anticoagulants brodifacoum bromadiolone and difethialone may be capable of causing death after a single feeding the mice do not die until several days after feeding on the bait therefore the method of setting the bait out is essentially the same as for the older anticoagulant products warfarin diphacinone and chlorophacinone anticoagulants have the same effect on nearly all warm blooded animals but the sensitivity to these toxicants varies among species if misused anticoagulant poisoning can cause the death of pets livestock or desirable wildlife that may feed on the bait additionally residues of anticoagulants that may be present in the bodies of dead or dying rodents can cause toxic effects to scavengers and predators however this secondary hazard from anticoagulants is relatively low when baits are used properly symptoms of anticoagulant poisoning in mammals include lethargy loss of color in soft tissues such as the lips and gums and bleeding from the mouth nose or intestinal tract because all rodenticides can be toxic to humans particular care should be taken to keep rodent baits out of the reach of children vitamin k is the antidote for anticoagulant rodenticides although in cases of severe poisoning whole blood transfusion is also used all baits must be used according to the label directions use rat and mouse baits in a way that makes bait available solely to rats or mice the newer anticoagulants brodifacoum bromadiolone and difethialone have never been approved for use in agricultural or field situations or for use against ground squirrels meadow mice microtus pocket gophers or any other rodents except house mice norway rats and roof rats this is because these newer materials are more persistent in the body once ingested and thus they may pose a greater hazard to nontarget wildlife including predators and scavengers careful bait use will reduce the chance that rodenticide residues will occur in nontarget animals bait selection and placement several formulations of anticoagulant baits are available grain baits or pelleted forms often are packaged in small plastic cellophane or paper packets or are sold in bulk the place packs are designed to keep baits fresh and to make it easy to place baits into burrows walls or other locations mice will readily gnaw into place packs and feed on baits anticoagulant baits formed into paraffin or wax blocks are useful in damp locations where loose grain baits spoil quickly unfortunately mice may not accept these blocks as readily as they do other baits baits containing certain grass seeds are often particularly well accepted by mice even in the presence of other competing food items proper placement of baits is important for house mouse control place baits no more than feet apart in areas where mouse activity is evident if mice are living in wall spaces place baits inside the walls other rodenticides in addition to the anticoagulant baits there are currently three other rodenticides available in california for use against the house mouse table although not anticoagulants bromethalin and cholecalciferol are used in a manner somewhat similar to the anticoagulant products these two materials are formulated to serve as chronic rodenticides so that house mice will have the opportunity to feed on exposed baits one or more times over the period of one to several days bait acceptance is generally good when fresh well formulated products are used table other rodenticides for house mouse control registered for use in california

what is the point of a side discharge mower side discharge was designed to keep the clippings from clumping and to direct them for bagging bagging your cuttings is actually taking away beneficial organic material from potentially nourishing your yard it may look awful to have clippings turning brown all over your yard but if they're very visible it means you're waiting too long between mowings as the clippings break down which is actually very quickly they release nitrogen into the soil and feed the live grass the natural cycle if one doesn't want visible clippings it's best to use a mulching blade on the mower which chops the clippings up even more before depositing them back on the lawn  Mower Lawn Comfrey The Lawnmower Man Knife Mulch Compost Tick Hay Briggs & Stratton Airbag Soil Sewage treatment Bamboo Jackass: The Movie Eutrophication Organic farming Organic gardening Biogeochemical cycle Mattress Soil life Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Golf Weed control McMansion Coal Vermicompost Alcohol fuel Organic horticulture Plough Rigging 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Composting toilet Motor oil Glossary of American football Tennis Springfield 1903 rifle M60 machine gun Internal combustion engine Steam engine Ecology Fossil fuel power plant The Inside Nuclear fuel cycle Table tennis Coffee Earthworm Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Fertilizer Silage Equine conformation Tractor Revolver Tobacco Combine harvester Dead Sea Diamond Waste management Photosynthesis Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Biological pest control Material properties of diamond Fluorescent lamp Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Saw Drill bit Vegetation Town gas Gypsy moth Carpal tunnel syndrome Diode Circuit design Honey fungus Time Out of Mind Bowls Thermal power station Vehicular cycling Nuclear explosion Agricultural machinery Nitrogen Rail tracks Nickel-cadmium battery Lightning Paintball marker Crop circle Flowering plant Headlight Xeriscaping Universal Serial Bus Nuclear power New York City Subway Glossary of wildland fire terms Christmas tree Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Irrigation Cavitation Environmental engineering

what are differences beween natural gas and propane grills which one is better the both cook or grill about the same one difference is you need a different gas regulator for each that is important the other thing is you will need a natural gas hook up if you want to use natural gas that is supplied by your utility company the point is if you have natural gas at your home you will have to run a new gas line to the barbeque location propane can be purchased in cylinders and are standard on backyard barbeques therefore on the basis of convenience alone the propane system is probably preferred  Barbecue Propane Grill Natural gas Portable stove Alkane Fuel injection Thermostat Hydrogen economy Methanethiol Manitoba Hydro Hot air balloon Gas turbine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Airsoft Fire Flamethrower Motor oil Stirling engine Saudi Aramco Liquified petroleum gas Diving cylinder Turbocharger Temperature Scuba set Petroleum Sewage treatment Microeconomics Solar power Automobile Explosive material Renewable energy Futures contract Diving regulator D__ner kebab Kitchen Electrical generator M60 machine gun Gasoline Economy of Trinidad and Tobago Pacific Gas and Electric Company Internal combustion engine Glossary of firefighting terms Convenience store Economics Economy of Brunei Helium Dominion Resources Ford Crown Victoria E85 Bunsen burner Bus models used in New York City Transit Caterpillar Inc.

is it karma that all these over extended consumers are losing their homes people are defaulting like crazy on mortgages my friend at work said this is because banks lent out to poor and lazy people who didn't deserve loans and credit in the first place lazy or not everyone deserves a place to call home that being said i can tell you of the experience in my community lancaster ca we have a large amount of homes being built right now most of them are these huge ostentatious mansions built on a postage stamp's worth size plot of land such as kb homes d r horton etc they are on the desert in prices ranging from to and aren't worth even half of that last year many of the people moving in to these homes were and are black families from compton who come up here because they want to get away from the urban problems the gang trouble the noise etc they all have good honest reasons for coming up here namely that we are in cleaner air a quieter area and hopefully fewer gang problems not to mention more affordable housing well many of these families did not have the income level to support the mortgages they were looking at but thanks to one or two unscrupulous realtors and lenders one of whom was in our office building and would not take you on as a customer unless you were black and was finally taken away in handcuffs due to illegal lending practices were offering sub prime loans to people who couldn't even qualify for them but were cooking the books in these clients' favor namely poor black and latino families from the inner cities of l a in order to get the commission as well as making themselves look good to the black or latino communities it was a case of race based lending targeted at people who simply could not afford the loan but was given the loan based upon falsified income records from the agent the same lender from our building as a result we now have a huge amount of homes that are being foreclosed on some of the owners have tried the last ditch effort of opening the houses for rent in the hopes that someone else with real money like about per month will bail them out as a renter while others have simply abandoned the homes or been evicted now we have these huge price inflated homes that aren't worth half of what the banks are asking and so these whole neighborhoods of empty homes have become huge drug and gang dens the few people who do still live in their homes in these areas are now regularly assaulted and victimized as they try to drive to or from home by the gang kids who've taken over some of the empty houses i don't know if it's karma or not i certainly feel the lender who was arrested got what she deserved but the poor buyers were just trying for to find a home to call their own i am in a similar situation but i'm handling it differently i have a patch of land up in the mountains that i bought at auction i can't afford a mortgage but i think with a little help from my friends that i can build myself a nice cabin to live in stick by stick as i get the money it won't be fancy but it will be mine free and clear hopefully that'll be my karma  Predatory lending Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Bank Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Inflation Debt Insurance Urban sprawl Interest Bond Usury Student loan Privatization Real estate bubble Money Credit card MMORPG Economy of the United States Financial markets Capitalism Gross domestic product Economy of Russia Microcredit ACORN E-mail spam Advance fee fraud Donald Trump American individualist anarchism Tax Harlem Short selling Title insurance Bank fraud Islamic banking Bretton Woods system Theory of conduct Urban renewal White flight Wells Fargo Real estate Public policy Education in the United States Central bank Philatelic investment Gold standard Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money supply Poker jargon Public housing Sears Holdings Corporation Hyperinflation Mobile home Capital accumulation Primerica Financial Services Internet fraud Government debt Economics Free trade Debt consolidation History of the United States (1918-1945) History of post-Soviet Russia Suburbs of Johannesburg Babylonian law Social rule Windows XP Economy of Pakistan Prostitution in Germany Mortgage-backed security Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Mutual fund Annual percentage rate Federal National Mortgage Association Tesco Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Estoppel Derivative (finance) Concurrent estate Unconscionability Surplus value IBM PC compatible Mergers and acquisitions Annuity Digital rights management EastEnders CPU cache Final Fantasy XI Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Subsidy

can you bulid a two story house cheaper than a one story everything i've read or heard and logic tells me that for the same square finished footage a two story is cheaper it would need half the size of basement and roof there is the additional expense of a stairway but if it is over basement stairs doesn't require more square footage i suppose there are some internal things that could be more like furnace vent or fireplace chimney have to be longer a two story is certainly more efficient use of land but if you have a huge lot guess that wouldn't be an issue  Stairway Bungalow Basement Property tax Chimney Kitchen Solar power Piccolo Junior Saga Wood fuel Winchester Mystery House Autonomous building Fireplace Furnace Solar cell The Basement Tapes Arlington House Bristol Grammar School The Brady Bunch Paradox Transformer Computer Sin City Floppy disk Elevator Seismic retrofit McMansion Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory DVD Hydrogen economy Derbyshire lead mining history CPU design Dynamic random access memory Theory of conduct Digital photography Little Britain Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Extreme Programming Stove Modem Fiddler on the Roof RuneScape quests Electric arc furnace Urban sprawl Taxicab Law of value Animal Crossing Christmas EastEnders Stairway to Heaven Heinkel He 100 Trafalgar Square Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Radio masts and towers System/36 Jenova Hash table 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sport utility vehicle Tudorbethan architecture The Curse of Fenric Ventilation Andravida Rock Follies Alcohol fuel Stars!

how do i remove tadpoles i have at least three puddles in my backyard and there are easily more than tadpoles in each of the puddles how do i remove them edit i don't wanna kill them necessarily but i do want to say i hated their parents they kept me up all night atleast twenty of them outside of my window at night making their noises lol what are the statistics on tadpoles if only survive out of each puddle then that's ok but i can't have frogs jumping around being weird in my back yard i have a huge dog in my back yard and i dont want him coming back in the house with pieces of frog limbs hanging out his mouth i beg you not to kill them as these are baby frogs duh that will live to eat hundreds and hundreds of thousands if not millions and billions of mosquitos and other bothersome insects a couple things will occur either the frogs know what they're doing and the tadpoles will mature in their own good time before the puddles dry up and just jump out of the puddles and leave when they're ready or in their frenzy to mate the adult frogs didn't really know what they were doing and chose puddles that would dry up before the tadpoles were mature enough to leave of their own accord you don't say why you want to move them but if this is imperative get a bucket and a net fill the bucket with the exact same water that is in the puddles not tap water or water that comes out of your hose catch the tadpoles with the net and move them to the nearest swamp or pond stream if you can't find a swamp or pond please please above all show some respect for nature and for the fact that these little guys are just trying to survive just like you or me and do not try to kill them or to just add bleach to their water in the environment the presence of frogs and amphibians shows that the soil and water are in great shape fertile non toxic full of prey lush and green frogs and toads are one of the first species to disappear and to show genetic mutation when the environment becomes too toxic and unable to sustain life so be greatful they are there it is a really really good sign those little guys represent the best solution to the mosquito problem in its infancy they will grow to become mosquito eating machines i also think the sound of their mating calls at night is one of the best sounds in nature it means your land and the land around you is teeming with life and fertility i have a hard time with idiots who would say something so incredibly stupid life hating and disrespectful to say nothing of bloody ignorant as just add bleach to the puddle i look forward to a time when people this ignorant and evil cease to exist on this planet for they are what is killing what was once a paradise  Mosquito Nile crocodile Bladderwort Amphibian Spider Toad Gray Wolf Fauna of Australia Ecology Kakapo Abortion debate Tetrapod Malaria Wood Hamster Bullfrog Carnivorous plant DDT Biological pest control Irrigation Flood geology Xenomorph Cat Animal Biodiversity Shrimp farm Ren and Stimpy Menstrual cycle RuneScape quests Decline in frog populations Ant Deluge (mythology) Cheetah Human Snake Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Corroboree frog Dilbert Desert Creatures in Bionicle Tenjiku shogi Shogi Renewable energy Lion Goldfish Unreal Ammonia Animal communication Aerial (dance move) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Mario series enemies Kim Possible Piccolo Junior Saga Angling Dog Effects of global warming Final Fantasy: Unlimited Intelligent design Volleyball Jurassic Park Elephant Androgen insensitivity syndrome Shaggy dog story Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Heartworm Dead Sea Seabird Kain (Legacy of Kain) Organic farming Fishing Fish farming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Rice Koala Rocko's Modern Life Alcohol fuel Tooth enamel Tai shogi Bloody Roar IBM PC compatible Chlorophyta Equine conformation The Fairly OddParents Lake Infantilism Carbon dioxide American Alligator The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Dalek Invasion of Earth

what is happening to my rubber tree what is happening to my rubber tree the leaves are falling of but yet new ones are growing is it beacause it is getting to much water or not enough please let me know asap a rubber plant can lose leaves for a number of reasons i am going to assume your problem is the most common very common one you have probably been losing leaves from the bottom up experienced growers used to say problems with bottom leaves means a problem with bottom roots it could be too much or too little water but is nearly always too little water on the bottom roots this happens because the plant may get water frequently but never gets enough water to soak the bottom roots roots always grow downward so it is not critical what the top of the soil is like but it is very important to get water down to the bottom of the pot the plant should be in a pot that has a hole in the bottom when you water you should give the plant lots of water even leave the pot in water to soak up water for maybe half an hour then drain off all extra water too much water is as bad or worse than too little in a day the limp leaves should stop hanging no more leaves should turn yellow and drop off however any leaves with any yellow in them now will continue to turn yellow and drop off leave the plant until it is quite dry on the top of the soil before you water again rubber plants like bright light but never hot sun when your new leaves are emerging even less light is advisable as this will promote larger leaves rubber plants are very susceptible to changes in environment such as warm to a cool room keep them out of drafts and away from heat sources good luck with your rubber plant  Houseplant Bonsai Cannabis cultivation Coffee Hydroponics Carnivorous plant Leaf Bong Poker jargon Hippeastrum Common bean Dairy Desert Garden Strawberry Thermal power station Tobacco Fossil fuel power plant Sugar beet Physiological plant disorders Gypsy moth Textile manufacturing Irrigation Diving suit Vermicompost Apple Water Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide Sorghum Tea Jute Olive Weed control Peach Coconut Pachypodium Plant Eucalyptus Tillandsia Great Lakes Banksia Sulfur Solar power Comanche Wood Christmas tree Water (molecule) Yosemite National Park Fruit tree propagation Brewery Renewable energy Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Ficus elastica Hypothermia Sauna Erosion Alcohol fuel Cheating in poker In-N-Out Burger Begonia Energy development Seismic retrofit Geography of Brazil Kitchen Venus Flytrap Illegal drug trade Quinoa Betting (poker) Carbon dioxide sink Opportunity rover Tofu Light-emitting diode Rubber Charles Goodyear Drainage Comfrey USS Trigger (SS-237) Wheat Orchidaceae Campfire Town gas Auxin Garlic Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Lighting Nuclear power Pea Death Valley National Park Nuclear meltdown Fire Hamster Ocean thermal energy conversion Hydrogen economy Photosynthesis Deforestation

if a watermelon is seedless where do they get the seeds to grow the next batch i do realize there are a couple of small colorless seeds in each one but that does not justify destroying the melon just to get a few seeds actually triploid watermelons seedless are expensive to produce as they must be transplanted to the field rather than grown from seed they do produce seeds but instead of hard dark seeds they are white and immature and can be eaten undetected  Watermelon Fruit Raisin Cucumber Polyploidy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Date Palm Conifer cones Melon Orange (fruit) Banana Seed Colchicine Gatorade Agriculture Grape Sugarcane Pollination Pollination management Cannabis sativa Tobacco Sugar beet Wine Pea Weed control Pine Fanta Pumpkin Barbara McClintock Playoff Fancy rat Cuisine of the Southern United States Black pepper Illegal drug trade Mulch Alfalfa Pebble bed reactor Elis Prefecture Hemp Nut (fruit) Whitebark Pine Rose Barley Mooncake Pomegranate Herbicide Green Revolution Cloaking device Frugivore Ozone Onion Turnip (brassica rapa) Sunflower Vicia faba Coconut Cantonese cuisine Full Metal Panic?

i have a fridge freezer my fridge gets a big mass of ice at the back what causes this ive tried turning down freezer control down no joy should switch off when u turn it down slowly if not then it may be the stat has worn out or it could be that the whole unit has lost some gas in the system making an inbalance so it's freezing more in the fridge than in the freezer it may be worth finding a local fridge engineer who offer free call out to check these things before you decide if it's worth repairing other than that just defrost every few weeks  Refrigerator Freezer Thermostat Freezing Onion Ice cream Life in the Freezer The Tomb of the Cybermen Organic food Solar power Toyota Prius Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Hazing Sento Philip J.

how long can lavendar keep its scent i've just plucked some its dry and its only the top purple part contrary to the first answer i know that dried lavendar can keep it's scent for ages and ages it is only when it is fresh not dried that that air scent lasts such a short time a couple of years ago i made sachets out of dried lavendar i took from my garden to this day when i crush the little cloth sachet in my hand a very strong and clear scent of the lavendar inside is emitted without any friction it will last a super short time if used as a sachet or if it is rubbed in any way the oils inside the dried lavendar will last for months and in my experience even more than a year the sachets i made are kept in my dresser drawers everything in those drawers continue to smell very clearly of lavendar so i suppose the staying power of the scent is dependent on the way in which the dried herb is used i read that lavendar was found in the tombs of the pharoahs of ancient egypt and it still had maintained it's scent now that's a long time also here is a site that give all kinds of info about lavendar including reference to the shelf life of lavendar's scent years they claim see last few lines of the entire article http www incensewarehouse com spotlight on lavender ep html hope this helps ps did you know that you can throw these sachets in the clothes dryer instead of a dryer sheet to help make your clothes smell fabulous when they're dry and did you know that dried lavendar acts as a moth repellant in your closet interesting eh  Lavender Tofu Yarrow Mummy Sage Animal communication Dog Nepeta Essential oil Thermal power station Textile manufacturing Psoriasis Noah's Ark Mosquito Cat Cannabis cultivation Cascading Style Sheets Charles Goodyear Coriander Paris Hilton Sea level rise Massage Undergarment Culture of Korea Cinnamon Garlic Flax Christmas tree Strap-on dildo Diving suit Odor Olfaction Basil The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bong Human sexual behavior Casting Theory of conduct Rose Menstrual cycle Jewish cuisine Shaggy dog story Obedience training Biological pest control Fancy rat Upholstery Eddie Guerrero Ginny Weasley Japanese tea ceremony Cross site scripting Motor oil Tobacco HTML Skunk Lower North Shore (Sydney) Sperm Whale Billiards Aloe Durian Kain (Legacy of Kain) Domestic goat Black pepper Soap American lobster Stage lighting Friction Air pollution Classified information Pharaoh Laundry Pet skunk Transformer Papyrus Carbon dioxide Natural gas Pottery Climate of the United Kingdom Hemp Fire Clipperton Island Trapping Domain Name System Kakapo Top-bar hive Microeconomics Sonic the Hedgehog The Amber Spyglass Burial Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coconut crab Flood geology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Aromatherapy Emergence Harp Housebreaking Uniform Resource Locator

new construction home completed this week what should i look for my wife and i have to sign off on our new home built by pulte this week is there anything specific we should look for before we sign off i have already noticed when i went in the house myself that some of the kitchen cabinet drawers arent pulling out smooth is this something to have them fix or am i just being picky you will want to open all windows and doors in order to make sure they all open and close smoothly also walk around the entire outside checking the foundation and walls for any cracks or areas that are not level check all of the corners inside the house and everywhere the walls meet the floor and ceiling to make sure they are level and straight you should use a level when you do this in my opinion check all of your moldings around the doorways and baseboards to make sure they are level check around doors and windows to make sure they seal completely with no gaps anywhere you should also check every outlet i could go on and on but i would probably forget something the best thing to do is hire an independent inspector who has nothing to do with pulte homes and have them evaluate everything frequently home building companies the size of pulte and many others build homes fairly quickly and skimp on various things due to their speed and costs it is very wise and well worth the cost for you to get an inspection i realize that many of these companies will bring out an inspector for you but they have personal interests with these companies and will not work for you in order to get the honest information that you need before you sign off on your home you should hire an independent licensed home inspector and follow him her around while doing the inspection they should explain every detail to you so that you know what you are getting in to and if there are any issues they can give you advice about them then pulte homes should be required to repair any problems if there is anything major going on you are not required to settle for the home you will be able to get out of the deal and wouldn't you rather find out about potential problems before you sign off rather than after you're stuck with the home get a home inspection its the wisest choice that you can make about your home before you sign off on it  Kitchen Poker jargon Thermal power station Scientology beliefs and practices Door Shaggy dog story Nuclear power Elevator Pretty Good Privacy Plame affair Information Technology Infrastructure Library STS-114 Seismic retrofit Passenger car Doom engine Coming of Age (TNG episode) Mozilla Firefox Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Quality control Xanadu House Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Mach kernel GunZ The Duel The Inside Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq John Hancock Tower Sento Basement Natural Selection (computer game) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Drill bit McMansion Casting G-Man (Half-Life) Downing Street memo The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Nuclear proliferation Fire fighting Corporate governance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Wood Abbey Black Mesa Research Facility Glossary of firefighting terms The Shining (film) About a Boy Hamster Principal-agent problem Sudoku One Tree Hill (TV series) RuneScape quests The Time Machine Public domain Wood carving Windows XP Jumpstart 3rd Grade Dial M for Murder Bus models used in New York City Transit Advance fee fraud ISO 9000 Heinkel He 112 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Air-raid shelter Expert system Public-key cryptography Betting (poker) Game programming House of Leaves Columbine High School massacre Ridge Route Combine (Half-Life 2) De Lorean DMC-12 Heinkel He 100 Chatsworth House Gun politics Motion picture rating system Common criticisms of Microsoft The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Buckingham Palace Inflation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theory of conduct Strategic management Let's Make a Deal Information Services Procurement Library Microeconomics New York Giants

why does chili pepper kill spray bottles i tried a recipe for killing ants i have a sudden unexplainable infestation in my bathroom the recipe involves a handful of chili peppers and a quart of water blended in my vita mix for minutes and then i strained the mixture with a fine wire mesh strainer i put the liquid in a spray bottle and started to spray the ants it lasted for about sprays and then the bottle would not spray at all i rinsed the nozzle with hot water cleaned out the parts and tried again but still it would not spray i tried a completely different spray bottle and the mixture killed that bottle in exactly the same manner i tried soaking all the little nozzle parts in soap hot water bleach and nothing gets them to work again is the problem the acid in the chili peppers or is this just a coincidental melt down of spray bottles so i took care of the ants the real problem is how to get these spray bottles to work again they won't work with any liquid even though the nozzles seem clear they seem to just pump air into the bottle instead of pumping liquid out i am way too lazy to go out and buy new spray bottles and i want to avoid killing new bottles in the future any ideas i gave up a long time ago on making my own spray from chili peppers had the same problem as you are saying you have i suspect we just cannot get it the solution strained enough that it keeps clogging the spray nozzle i know its not melting the plastic because i have bought this product from the stores and it never clogs the bottle yet i can use this same bottle when its empty make my own and it starts clogging they must have a better way of breaking the chili's down so it doesn't clog just not worth the aggravation of trying to know avail i buy it at the store now actually for ants the best product i have ever bought is called terro by it most anywhere put a drop on a little piece of cardboard put in corner of room with problem within an hour you will see hundreds of ants eating it and within hours you will not see an ant again its the best  Fire extinguisher Brewery Water purification Soap Menstrual cup Coffee Thermal power station Fire fighting Bread Textile manufacturing Bong Red Hot Chili Peppers Chile pepper Plastic Fiberglass Carburetor Chili con carne Glossary of firefighting equipment Tea Powder metallurgy Tofu Gas metal arc welding Mattress Laundry detergent Breastfeeding Chocolate Cheese Rocket fuel White phosphorus incendiary Common cold Casting Ketchup Pottery Diseases of the honeybee Irrigation Bulk vending Fuel injection Turbojet Haloalkane Ammonia Single malt Scotch Hydrogen peroxide Champagne (beverage) Alcoholic beverage Manicure Dundas Square Siphon Glass Bacon Poker jargon Dairy Polyethylene terephthalate E85 Paint Hot sauce Ant Planet of the Daleks MTV2 Glossary of firefighting terms Ice cream Energy development Sodium hypochlorite Rum Vinegar Dishwashing Milk Electrophysiology Hydrochloric acid Oplan Bojinka Cube (film) Baby bottle Instant coffee Nitroglycerin Dialysis Urinal Spacecraft propulsion Dry cleaning Space shuttle main engine John Frusciante Beer Toilet humour Smoke-screen Cocaine Japanese toilet Carbon dioxide Explosive material Micro-encapsulation Happy Tree Friends Sulfuric acid Idli Moe Szyslak Cider Biodiesel Water Hamster

i want to build a small cheap and relatively earth friendly home do you know the best way for me to do this i don't have much knowledge or experience in terms of building i am used to being in the office more than construction i would appreciate any non judgemental input if the environment impacts the effectiveness or suitability i live in temperate southeast u s hi trey first get out of the office and look check out every building site every home even every barn or garage check out the areas that you might like to build which suburb which state what are the necessities of the building is it freezing cold for months of the year or is it in the middle of the desert with deg c days and deg c nights start making lists of what you require in a small home bedroom bedrooms bathroom list all of your requirements also keep a check on what you actually like from designs and floorplans to building materials to wall and window styles everything how much maintenance do you want to do in the future minimal maintenance is usually brick whereas mudbrick or strawbale require a reasonable amount of maintenance to keep them up to scratch if you want to owner build start getting some experience every time you see someone building anything ask if you can help this will also allow you to evaluate your skills that would help you decide if you can or actually want to build it yourself go to your local library and borrow every book you can on architecture building self sufficency environmentally friendly building as you read more and evaluate your own skills you may well find your tastes change surf the net there is an absolutly incredible amount of info there more than enough to get you started if you live in an area i am in australia and there isnt anywhere the building code doesnt cover where your building code doesnt need to be followed or you dont need approval there is enough info on the net to get you started and well and truly finished if you want to use recycled materials find somewhere to start storing them be really critical of what you buy there really isnt any point in collecting beautiful doors if you only need build something small start with a dog kennel give it away if you dont have a dog if you enjoy it great if you hate it and dont finish then maybe owner building isnt for you i should clarify that here owner building doesnt have to mean doing everything yourself you can still contract out all of the work it just means that you are not paying for someone else to organise the work being done check out some of the kit home web sites there is some fantastic small homes available you dont have to order one but its great to be able to see what the floor plan actually looks like in reality there is some big difference in what is called small given you lack of experience in building i would imagine the task is daunting but there is a load of help out there there is also many places that offer hands on training many books and websites offer a wealth of practical information much is written in basic terms check out secondhand book shops you may find some really helpful stuff start saving money you will need it in bucketloads small homes dont have to cost a lot but they still cost dont let your inexperience put you off there is no reason why enthusiasm ingenuity and self belief can not see you thru good luck jo  Information Services Procurement Library Construction Solar power Computer Product Lifecycle Management Wealth Lighting Straw-bale construction Extreme Programming Windows 2000 CPU cache Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Betting (poker) Insurance Kitchen Visual Basic MMORPG Gross domestic product Microeconomics Contract Life insurance Neopets Nuclear power Animal Crossing Science CPU design Capitalism Hamster Library (computer science) Information Technology Infrastructure Library Dog agility Craps The Amazing Race McMansion Business continuity planning Economics Perl Political economy Inflation MapleStory RISC RuneScape quests Elevator Library Daylight saving time Wind turbine BASIC programming language Timber framing Legal research Python programming language American individualist anarchism C programming language Loudspeaker Radio controlled airplane National Kidney Foundation Singapore Enterprise content management Lisp programming language Java programming language Forth programming language Energy development Cable television Domain Name System David Hume Requirements analysis Organic farming Subroutine Credit card Computer virus Gramophone record Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Dairy Architecture Open access Embedded system Emacs Bicycle lighting Glossary of firefighting terms Octopus card Fire fighting M16 (rifle) Capital accumulation Law of value Microsoft .NET Book Explosive material

i have canna plants i bought these for the first time this spring they have been left in the pots and have bloomed and rebloomed i need to know what is meant by dead heading also i have found small pods that are fully of small black seeds can these be harvested and replanted in the spring if so how do i go about keeping them over the winter do they need to be dried out i could just put them in a jar but i think thry would mold the plants i bought were very expensive so if i could use these seeds that would be great if they are usable then how do i start them indoors next spring thanks for all answers dead heading is cutting off the exhausted blooms the pods are filled with seeds harvest them just before they 'pop' you can do that by putting a small paper bag over the pod after the flower is done put a twisty or a rubber band on the bag to hold it and catch the seeds do not dead head until the pod pops check the in the bag every two or three days the paper bag will allow air to circulate and if you take it off once in a while it will not mold when the pod does pop keep the seeds in a pie pan saucer unused ash tray one thing good you can use it for or anything flat with a small lip when the seeds have been in there for a week or so they should be dried enough to put them in a white envelope and label it species and date good luck  Cannabis cultivation Common bean Peanut Flax Pea Comfrey Tea Illegal drug trade Textile manufacturing Kudzu Weed control Hamster Wood Maize Stratification (botany) Black pepper Hemp Flowering plant Hippeastrum Alfalfa Casting American Black Bear Wheat Garden Strawberry Jute Sugarcane Vanilla Fancy rat Carnivorous plant Hydroponics Tobacco Bean Flower Wisteria Ham Bladderwort Bamboo Hay Mushroom hunting Sunflower Christmas tree Bonsai Eucalyptus Blood (computer game) Japanese tea ceremony Clover Mattress Tulip Floppy disk Olive Begonia Diseases of the honeybee Dill Sugar beet Customs and etiquette of Japan Apple Apricot Plastic Ecco the Dolphin Fujian tea ceremony Campfire Pachypodium brevicaule Upholstery Pinophyta Diving cylinder Japanese funeral Daylily The Amber Spyglass Tlingit Barley Bong Pine Pysanka Banksia Coffee Chinese tallow Tofu Air pollution Billboard Hot 100 Dairy The Ashes Rambutan Death Valley National Park Futurama (TV series - season 2) Plant I Ching divination Pachypodium bicolor Orchidaceae Ocean's Twelve Coffea arabica CPU cache Idli Biblical inerrancy Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Spinach

how to save my money plant i have a problem with my money plant we used to water the pot twice a week later we bought a water sprayer two or three weeks back and started spraying the whole plant its leaves turned all of a sudden yellow we maintain a temperature of in our ac room it do not get more light as much as through a open window it is far from the window but not too far sometimes i turn on the light so that it can get enough light but i dont know whether it is neccesary or not it used to be twice more than as it is shown in the photograph i want to know why it is happening to her and how to water her and to take care of her thank you very much sonu is the ac blowing directly on the plant s or even in the general direction if so then think about this when you get out of the shower and are still wet damp are you not colder than when you are dry if the ac is hitting you my theory is this keep in mind this is just an educated guess you're plant like any living thing has addapted to it's environment granted that shit can grow almost anywhere any sudden changes can be catastrophic it doesn't have the means to heat or cool itself and it's roots are the most fragile part typically they are underground and the ground heats and cools very slowly being in a n enclosed pot above ground dramatically lowers the ammount of time the roots temp changes also keep in mind that even if you have the thermostat and any ac that doesn't blow continuously has a thermostat set at degrees if you live anywhere where the ave temp outside is more than degrees warmer than the ac unit is set on then it must work double time tomaintain a steady temp it does this one of ways by adjustingtemp up and down periodically or by blowing a slightly cooler temp than what the actual thermostat reads to cool a larger space quicker b shutting off you do the math if it's degrees outside then you're ac must blow about degrees for the first portion of the time that it's on just to cool the room structure back down to degrees if it blew at degrees even then it would have to stay on costantly i can tell you more if i had a make and model of the ac but i figure that combined with the new watering system could very likely have put the plant plants into shock resulting in the discoloration and wilting of the leaves if you're realy worried about the plant then i would suggest first doing as mr obvious suggests and repotting but don't rush it the plant is already in shock and that could kill it give it a few days to settle and make sure that the soil is the same temp all the way through before you uproot it i trust that you know your orrigional soil mixture stick with it remix b you pull roots and let it reach the same temp as the orrigiona soil b you transfer you may want to iincrease the abount of carbon you plant intakes very slightly until this procedure is done and periodically afterwards it will give it a little boost and help the odds a smaller plant producing a heavier yield i highly suggest a growbox made of wood plywood or plexiglass wrapped with three layers inside and outside and all overlappingeach other and sealed as well as possible of industrial strength clear plastic you can buy rolls of it at lowe's or most hardware stores instead of that fiberglass shit that always comes to mind when people talk about insulation you're doing this for three main reasons insullation pest parasite control if the plastic is new and in a roll then it is steril and a less likely habitat for mold and mites also you can see any mold growing onthe walls better with clear plastic and it will draw less heat than black ties in with all that plastic does wonders trapping the smell it won't be but hell nothing realy is with that huh keep in mind the ideal height and width if the plant when you build it you do not want it touching the side and you dont want to scorch the plant with the light which should be mounted to the top of the box you can run a hose like a drier hose from the ac to your box just make sure if you do you seal it well also make sure you put it close to the top on one of the sides cool air drops hot air rises which balances thus nuetralizing the majority of the damage that the light or the ac would do to a plant by themselves and you may want to find a smaller cheap ac to strip the thermostat out lengthen its wires to fit inside the box even with the center of the plant mounted on the opposite side of the box as your ac hose that way it feels what the plant feels it has less to cool so it can get it to temp without freezing your baby out and finally you want to water late at night or early in the morning when it is cooler and the ac isn't coming on as ofter it would probably be beneficial to raise the temp by degrees just b you water which will also increase the humidity level in the box making for a more favorable habitat  Carburetor Explosive material Plastic Casting Spark plug Textile manufacturing

we are looking at a house the house isgoing for and it is appraised for it is ac of land and has a stock pond with a small pier like walk bed bath prefab home sits on a slab it is not a mobile home it also has a tack room and another work building car garage horse stables big trees awesome schools does anyone think this is a good price and does the owner have to sell it for the appraised price how can we get the owner to go down on the price when sellers put a price on their homes they sometimes forget two things one is what the appraised value is and the other is what someone will actually pay i just recently went through the home buying process and had a seller tell me that my offer wasn't good enough and her home was worth much more my response was that her home was only worth what someone was willing to pay and i wasn't willing to pay her asking price it has been three months since i looked at that house and it is still on the market and she reduced her price to what i offered three months ago what it boils down to is finding out what houses in that area are actually selling for and compare that to the asking price and the appraisal then go from there my guess is the owner has a deluded sense of what the market will bare and you would be wise to look elsewhere by the way your realtor can get you that information  Supply and demand Microeconomics Real estate broker Capitalism Stock Short selling Mortgage Real estate appraisal Shaggy dog story Stock market Economics Auction Commodity Insurance Monopoly (game) Surplus value The Market for Lemons Option Enron Corporation Donald Trump Arbitrage Sento Nuclear power Price discrimination Hyperinflation Dodge Charger Illegal drug trade London Congestion Charge Call option Real estate bubble Housing cooperative Chatsworth House Day trading Warren Buffett Temasek Holdings Bond Monopoly Financial markets Great Depression Property tax Fair market value Futures contract Tax Google Capital accumulation Labor theory of value Wheel of Fortune Powel Crosley Jr. Ford Motor Company Law of value Option style Wal-Mart Inventory Sears Holdings Corporation Technical analysis Economy of Russia Whitton, London Gold as an investment Put option PE ratio Gross domestic product RKO Pictures Berkshire Hathaway Kitchen Real estate economics Estoppel American individualist anarchism Adverse selection Public transport Scale model Satchel Paige Atari 8-bit family Carlsbad, California Corporate governance Labor-power Gold standard Warranty Philatelic investment RuneScape locations Inflation McMansion IBM PC compatible Ownership Derivative (finance) Filling station NeXT Best Buy Make money fast Anarchism and capitalism Common Agricultural Policy Margin (finance) Online auction business model ITunes Music Store Economic rent Acorn Computers Boston and Lowell Railroad Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Dairy

something wrong with my toilet it makes noises what do i do it makes watering noises all day its not when it gets flushed and it refills it fills up and then later on it keeps like filling up with water and makes constant noise what could this be had this problem at college tough to tell you how to fix it 'cause different toilets have slightly different systems long and short of it is that the mechanism that allows the tank to finish re filling is off this is most often a cylindrical almost syringe type thing usually has text printed on the top of it the floating arm thing is deflected back to 'level' enough when things are working smoothly this triggers the cylindrical thing to stop filling water in short pull the floating arm up just a bit and it ought to catch causing the filling to stop it'll probably get messed up again the next time the toilet is flushed problem there essentially is that the buoyant force from the water isn't quite pushing that arm high enough needs like another quarter inch when the tank re fills so the valve lid in the bottom of the tank never closes fully thereby filling the bowl slowly and over time triggering the tank to re fill at more than a drip where you hear it for a short time as it pumps all said there should be a bolt machine screw of some sort usually with a flat head slot that you can use to make minor adjustments if the mechanism isn't spoiled you can use this to change the height at which the floating arm will close the valve lid if it's broken check that the valve lid isn't getting the chain stuck under it if that's the case just need to adjust the chain attached from the handle to the valve lid so it doesn't prop the lid slightly open you can buy the part in a home improvement store dunno its name or how expensive hope this solves your problem good luck  Flush toilet Carburetor Siphon Thermal power station Poker jargon Rebreather Japanese toilet Brewery Internal ballistics Bong Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hydraulic machinery Textile manufacturing Timpani Newcomen steam engine Urinal Glossary of firefighting equipment Paintball marker Diving regulator Programmable logic controller Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diving cylinder Tire CPU cache M16 (rifle) Floyd Rose Cruising (maritime) Oscilloscope Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Poppet valve Lawn mower Wave power Steam engine Motorcycle Heckler & Koch G3 PID controller Urinary incontinence Conker's Bad Fur Day Rail terminology Bicycle brake systems M60 machine gun Scuba set Hash table Toilet paper Elevator Irrigation Thermostat Revolver Loudspeaker Automatic transmission 2000 Australian Grand Prix CDC 6600 Mattress Seismic retrofit Sin City Jet engine Pump Snorkel Circuit breaker Car handling Mach kernel STS-61 Two-stroke cycle Slot machine Novelty (locomotive) Bubble Bobble Floppy disk Three Mile Island Mouse (computing) Sailing Tank Dialysis Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Fast bowling Filling station Wind turbine Anchor Indianapolis 500 Intravenous therapy Swimming Machine gun Coriolis effect Windows XP Cheating in Counter-Strike Ammunition Swingout Springfield 1903 rifle Inflation

in my garden i have a low spot that is giving me some problems when it rains the water puddles and my corn is falling over i also have a tomato plant and the leaves sit in the water and they die i thought about just filling it with dirt but was concerned that covering the bottom of the plants might hurt them will they grow more or will this injure them the tomatoes are very healthy and i do not want to lose them i thought about transplanting them but am concerned actually i think they will be okay if you raise the dirt level corn tends to lift out anyhow i don't know about yours but i can see the roots on mine as for tomatoes the proper way to plant them when they are young is to remove all the leaves except the top and bury all the rest of the plant tomatoes will root all along the buried stem so i don't see why raising the soil would cause too much of a problem if they were any other plant or woody perennial then i would say no to raising the soil level but i think corn and tomatoes would be okay with it be aware though that this is just speculation i've never had to do this myself so i can't say for certainty the one thing i can say for certain is that i wouldn't transplant them good luck  Tomato Flowering plant Plant Desert Comfrey Weed control Bamboo Irrigation Agriculture Maize Herbicide Carnivorous plant Hamster Honey fungus Hippeastrum Houseplant Deforestation Garden Strawberry Perennial plant Hemp Physiological plant disorders Soil pH Bonsai Soil Beet Green Revolution Sorghum Elis Prefecture Pansy Hop (plant) Tree Orchidaceae Soil life Plant stem Environmental concerns with electricity generation Textile manufacturing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rice Erosion Wetland Desertification Rainforest Creeping Charlie Potato Drainage Gooseberry Bong Sugar beet Auxin Gypsy moth Lake District Kudzu Simone Weil Greenhouse Photosynthesis Flax Cannabis cultivation Erie Canal Black pepper Fancy rat Pachypodium Banksia Logging Theory of conduct Human cloning Japanese tea ceremony Nuclear power Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chernobyl accident Oregano Eutrophication The Suffering (game) Moss Leaf Boston Bruins Motorcycle Oat Wood Peruvian cuisine Vegetative reproduction Satchel Paige Wheat Genetically modified food Hangi Iris (plant) Pachypodium habitats Tea Ethylene Acorn Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Vermicompost Growing degree day Alfalfa Great Depression Mulch Death Valley National Park

energy consumption someone once told me that the fuller a fridge is the lower the energy consumption is this true sure an empty fridge when opened will loose almost all of the cool air inside it however if there are objects with a higher specific heat capacity than air ie food they will not be warmed significantly by brief openings of the door this means that when the door is closed again the air and the food will return to a thermal equilibrium that is much lower than had there been no food there therefore the fridge compressor will have to do less work to return the fridge to the right temperature  Refrigerator Solar power Fire fighting Ocean thermal energy conversion Turbofan Heat Turbojet Temperature Jet engine Nuclear power Spacecraft propulsion SR-71 Blackbird Future energy development Thermodynamics Renewable energy Insulation Energy Gas turbine Air conditioning Entropy Gas compressor Supercharger Turbocharger Axial compressor Pebble bed reactor Explosive material Internal combustion engine Water (molecule) Nuclear fusion Wind power Helium Autonomous building Nuclear thermal rocket Urban heat island Wind Circuit breaker Peltier-Seebeck effect Water vapor MOSFET Diesel engine Thermodynamic equilibrium Sun Stirling engine Humidity Phase (matter) Brazing Toyota Prius Thermoregulation Hydrogen economy Heat sink Heat capacity Warm-blooded Vacuum Heat pump Energy development Fusion power Nuclear reactor Microwave oven Gibbs free energy Evaporation Hydropower Greenhouse effect Climate change Power station Biodiesel Steam engine Geothermal exchange heat pump Transformer Temperature inversion Hydrogen HVAC Welding Ford Ranger EV Meaning Tesla coil Glass Bleed air Hot air balloon Milk Fuel injection Wind chill Carbon dioxide Swamp cooler Motor oil Thermal energy Standard enthalpy change of fusion Water Environmental concerns with electricity generation Capitalism Diffusion Door Pratt & Whitney J58 Philosophy of thermal and statistical physics Thunderstorm Alcohol fuel Brewery Climate of the United Kingdom Ceramics Action potential Severe weather terminology (United States)

staining cement i just had a new cement step put in front of the existing cement slab by my front door the cement slab of course has been there for years i have cleaned it with a cement cleaner off and on so it does not look dirty the new stop however is very white in comparison how can i stain the step and what color or colors do i use hope someone can give me some advice thanks there are masonry stains you can buy that will not only stain the concrete but also seal them to protect them from corrosion my husband and i recently stained our poured concrete pool patio with a product called transeal wb that we ordered through a local masonry supply store we had about five or six colors to choose from we had a problem similar to yours portions of the patio which had been poured many years ago had been pulled up at some point and the new sections didn't match in color you apply the stain with a regular paint roller it's really easy the most important thing is to make sure that you put on three coats the first stains the concrete the second helps the colors match and the third seals it tight the only problem you might run into is that you only have a small space to stain and the product we bought came in a five gallon drum enough to do our entire patio look in the phone book for masonry supplies and ask if they sell smaller amounts or even samples the company that made the product we used was called umaco but there are probably others good luck  Seismic retrofit Drill bit Reinforced concrete Concrete CPU cache Textile manufacturing Masonry Lionel Corporation Dam Pottery Mattress Poker jargon Brewery Paint Topps Eifel Aqueduct Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Digital photography Bong Microeconomics Anchor Knife Monopoly (game) Stucco Heinkel He 100 Glass Fire extinguisher Sheaf (mathematics) Pavement (material) Sento Casting Dodge Charger M16 (rifle) Portland cement Marching band Diving Staining (biology) Dry cleaning Quicksort Bulk vending Nintendo Entertainment System Debugging Motor oil Building material Central processing unit Internal ballistics Surveillance Tag Wind turbine Dairy Compiler optimization Professional wrestling slang Wayne Corporation Shroud of Turin Soldering Sears Holdings Corporation The Amazing Race Carburetor Christmas tree Amateur telescope making Gram staining Color blindness Panama Canal Locks Welding Supply and demand Hard disk Toyota Prius Fire fighting Kitchen Expert system Dundas Square M60 machine gun Roller hockey Tesco Black IPod Color Drug test Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Handloading Mach kernel Agarose gel electrophoresis Home repair Paintball De Lorean DMC-12 Japanese tea ceremony Patent 2000 Australian Grand Prix Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Rail transport in Ireland Stained glass Corrosion Sundial Condom New Coke Winning Streak Capitalism

where to find huge stackable plastic compost makers i visited some 'old hippie' friends and they had huge stackable compost makers in their city backyard you could then get the bottom layer off must take two people to get the 'finished' compost then use it in your garden the reason i ask is because we have a compost 'bin' which we have used oh ten years now and no one has ever gotten any compost out of it to use ever as the stuff all over the top is so horrifying who wants to bury through it it always stays about feet deep no matter that we have filled it ten years straight now so something that i could 'get' the 'finished' stuff out of would be great i know you are going to say 'make compost areas' but since my husband hasn't dug into the compost in ten years what makes you think he is going to build another compost frame also after ten years and flimsy framing i'm sure if we 'move it' it does have a screen on bottom it will just fall to pieces then i'll have no compost area i guess i have happy earthworms hey check here http www greenhousesandgazebos com compost bins aspx  Vermicompost Compost Comfrey Composting toilet Waste management Cardboard Coffee Houseplant Earthworm Sewage treatment Langstroth hive Dairy Donovan Toilet Traditional animation Biodynamic agriculture Autonomous building Volleyball No-dig gardening Chair The Chemical Brothers Roswell UFO incident Drainage Mulch Door Dustbin Lake District Mattress Textile manufacturing Bassoon Poker jargon Upholstery Christmas tree The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bong Stairway Casting Seismic retrofit Amateur telescope making Air-raid shelter Avalanche Paul McCartney Canoe The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Strap-on dildo Osama bin Laden The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bicycle frame Cultural Revolution Legionellosis Cello Equine conformation John Peel Drill bit Violin Muslim ibn Aqeel Anchor DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Light-frame construction Movie projector Geodesic dome Natural building Glacier Flood geology Recycling Hey Jude Burial Timber framing Sampling (music) Harmonica Piano Agriculture Clarinet Great Pyramid of Giza Wrigley Field Domain Name System Desperate Housewives HyperText Transfer Protocol Tuff Erie Canal Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Solar cell Hamster Woodworking Torquay United F.C.

how to get rid of wasps under driveway it seems some wasps yellowjackets have set up home under our driveway through a little crack between the cement and the garage wall they're smart little buggers their area is not easily accessible to us because there is brick on the wall that ends about an inch or so above the driveway how do we kill them without ideally getting stung ourselves the typical sprays foams can't be pointed into the hole because it's hard to access yellowjackets are somewhat harmless right now but within the next few weeks they're going to start getting agressive and they are nasty if they think their nest is in any danger which they can think simply by you walking by the nest not to mention that the queen will stay there during the winter and there will be a ton more wasps in that nest next year i've got two kids and we frequently have other kids over their protection is more important to me than the wasps instructions for treating wasp nests nest removal or getting rid of wasps particularly social wasps is a fairly simple process finding the nest usually entails a quick survey for heavy wasp traffic during dusk or dawn when wasps tend to return to the nest once the sun is down for the evening and you ve noticed less traffic near the nest dress yourself with multiple layers of clothing and find a pair of gloves just in case then go out to the nest and spray the entrance with any wasp killing agent like raid for example spray liberally but avoid inhaling too much of the poison most wasp poisons kill on contact but it s best to be safe by slowly leaving the area sudden movements can attract attention which wasp killer you use depends on where the nest is for nests that are located underground you will want to use a wasp killer that is not labeled as a projectile spray you want very little spray for yellow jacket nests that are found underground for nests that are elevated you will want to find a can of wasp hornet killer that is labeled as a projectile spray this will ensure a stream of wasp poison roughly feet in length plenty of distance to make a quick escape if necessary repeating this process twice or even three times may be necessary until you re certain the nest has been vacated once you see that there is no traffic it s probably safe to knock down the nest if it s an aerial nest or fill the nest with dirt and gravel if it s in the ground this should be the end of your wasp problem until the next migration cycle  Hornet Fire fighting Airport Yellowjacket Africanized bee Ant Seismic retrofit Shell (projectile) Diseases of the honeybee USS Wasp (CV-7) Wasp CPU cache Hamster Ammunition USS Wasp (CV-18) Quicksort Terminal ballistics Biological pest control Animal communication Traffic light Compiler optimization Dundas Square Thermal power station Casting Stopping power Mattress Glossary of firefighting equipment Paper wasp Zerg Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Panama Canal RuneScape quests Drill bit Tag Bee Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Blood (computer game) Diving suit Chemical warfare Aerial (dance move) Honeybee GunBound Red imported fire ant Naruto jutsu Naval mine Swimming Gypsy moth Air traffic control Haloalkane Motorcycle Air pollution Malaria Welding Space elevator Bedbug Glossary of firefighting terms Extreme Programming Tarantula Carpenter bee Glossary of climbing terms GunZ The Duel Spider Erosion Sniper Illegal drug trade Equine conformation Trench warfare Dinosaur Glossary of graph theory Xenomorph Floppy disk Jackass: The Movie Universal Serial Bus K' Brewery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ethernet Land mine Electrical wiring Password cracking Masonry Robot Master Gramophone record USS Tunny (SS-282) Asbestos Linked list Avalanche Rebreather Dog agility USS Yorktown (CV-5) Drowning Terry Bogard Bubble Bobble Resident Evil (video game)

how do you get rid of a flea infestation with out wasting a lot of money my mother's house is being over ran with fleas she is wanting to find away to rid her house of them however she dose not want to have to try anything unless she is for sure it will work first let me tell you that i own a pest control company and what i will recommend is the complete treatment that should help you completely get rid of the fleas first treat the pet with capstar this is a pill that you get from the vet that will kill all of the fleas that get on the animal for the first hours second use either frontline or advantage these can also be purchased from the vet frontline can be used on pets weeks old or older advantage can be used on animals as young as weeks if the pet is old enough for either product switch back and forth between the two one month use one the next use the other the reason i recommend this is that there are two main types of fleas that infest pets one product works better on the first type and the other product works better on the second type by using both you make sure you have covered all your bases once the pet has been treated you must treat your home and yard the best products to do this would include not only a killing agent but also a sterilization agent inside i would use ultracide if you can get it many on line sites sell it follow the instructions on the label wash all animal s bedding and vacuum frequently throw out the vacuum bag or dump the catch container after every vacuuming you can never vacuum too much do not steam clean your rugs this can hatch flea eggs and make your problem worse outside i would use demon wp mixed with gentrol or nylar carefully following label instructions treat the entire yard paying special attention to under bushes and low hanging branches most of these products can be bought at any do it yourself pest control company either on line or in a store treating your house and yard is just as important as treating the pet it is also very important to stay away from the grocery store or box store products like zodiac or hartz many of these products can cause severe allergic reactions in animals  Dairy Flea Red Hot Chili Peppers Tattoo Diseases of the honeybee Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Wal-Mart Hamster Asthma Gypsy moth Thermal power station Guinea pig Psoriasis Bulk vending Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coffee Animal Crossing Sears Holdings Corporation Mattress Scabies Menstrual cup Heartworm Carpet Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Fossil fuel power plant Energy development Vacuum tube Central processing unit Agricultural wastewater treatment Baylisascaris Malaria Hormone replacement therapy (trans) CPU design Antidepressant Insulin Dog training Hydrogen peroxide Rapeseed Cat Sea-Monkey Glossary of American football Sewage treatment Allergy Cray-1 Union Pacific Railroad Zerg Rail terminology Antiretroviral drug Theory of conduct Beltway sniper attacks Gaia Online Sin City Rabies EastEnders Red imported fire ant Biological pest control Common cold Herpes simplex virus Mushroom hunting Plastic Upholstery Indian Railways Transistor Pet Sounds Solar power Carburetor Livestock Weed control Garfield Milk CPU cache Ascariasis Ferret Alanis Morissette RuneScape quests Embedded system Paracetamol Chlorpromazine Brewery Radiation therapy New York City Subway nomenclature Tuberculosis Hedgehog Computer Menstrual cycle Vegetarianism Maprotiline Chronic fatigue syndrome

need afforadable architect in colorado architecture student ok we're trying to find an affordable architect or someone that know how to draw up plans to work on our new home project real architects just costs so much can you give me some advice for alternative solutions i kinda don't want to buy stock plans since we might as well buy a prebuilt home we're thinking of an architecture student well he has a year degree in architecture design and is starting his masters this coming fall i know that we will need to find a structural engineer to look at the plan please let me know if it's not a good idea to go with the student option thanks for your advice any suggestions would be really appreciated it really depends on how much you expect them to do if all you are looking if for them to be doing space planning laying out the floor plans and designing the elevations and stuff then the student is fine when i graduated with my year degree in architecture this is about all i could handle even though i thought i felt i knew more or could at least fake my way through it however i have worked in the industry for years now in a firm recently left my job and looking back i laugh there is sooo much more to an architect than most people either realize or want to admit a real architect will work with all the other trades such as plumbing electrical structural civil and they will facilitate getting the project through the city with as little hassle to the client as possible they will also usually be dealing with the contractor to ensure that the building gets built according to what you are paying for many times contractors will either intentionally or unintentionally substitute things in the building that might have a severe negative consequence the only person who may realize this error is the architect because they are the ones who specified everything honestly the only time i would suggest that someone use a student to draw architectural plans in lieu of an architect in new construction is if you were specifically a contractor who was knowledgeable in home construction and were going to build it yourself and knew how it was going to be built and were merely going to communicate these ideas to the student to translate onto paper in order to submit to the city for approval if you really want to go without an architect then i suggest that you find a residential contractor who does design build they will hopefully get to know what you want and use their knowledge to try to put together the best idea for a home usually contractors will have a better grasp in terms of how to design things in order to come out with a cheaper construction cost this can be hit or miss depending on their experience and i would ask to see about examples of past projects and possibly talk to their former clients if you can residential contractors should be fairly well able to get through the city approval and either they should be able to do their own drawings which in my opinion tend to be really poorly drawn but since they are the ones who are building it as long as it gets approved by the city that doesn't matter too much or they have someone else do them but i would really be cautious in this route to pick a contractor who does this type of stuff regularly otherwise you are asking for a lot of trouble good luck  Architect Architecture Graduate school Theory of conduct Massachusetts Institute of Technology Microeconomics Crew Exploration Vehicle Social rule Mutual fund Milton H.

need some advice on planting grass seed i'm doing our backyard from scratch the area that i will seed is approximately square feet with rock and other future plant sites located around the yard has tons of weeds since we moved into the house last year and i was waiting for a year to get a lot of the settling out of the way etc what's the best way to attack this i've been constanly mowing the weeds to keep them short and manageable should i rototill and get rid of them that way someone also suggested using roundup or something like that but i have fears that it would affect the seed also i will need to bring in some good top soil how much is standard how many inches then i'm guessing i should just seed it fertilize it press it down and keep it moist any suggestions would be great obviously i'm looking for the best results without having to pull my hair out thanks i agree with bruce j use something that kills weeds but has a short activity life roundup has that then the topsoil then seed one added idea wait until september to seed the reason is the weather will cool down and you'll get more rain you won't have to water as much and the new grass won't fry in the heat the grass seed will still germinate and grow and there will be plenty of time for it to become established before frost and you'll be sure that the weed killer is inactive when you seed use a fertilizer specially made for seed starting it will have no weed killers in it you might want to pick that up now as they'll have all the fall fertilizers out later on i have even seeded in early winter just before the first forecast heavy snow the grass seed sits there over the winter the snow's action pushes it into the earth it comes up first thing in the spring when it's too damp still for me to even consider walking over the lawn to seed very easy  Weed control Weed Herbicide Tobacco Lawn Sorghum Rice Severe weather terminology (United States) Hemp Anchor Compost Carnivorous plant Roundup Lawn mower Seed Climate of the United Kingdom Biodynamic agriculture Weather lore Rapeseed 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Desert Yosemite National Park Sugar beet Apple Maize Oat Jute Mulch Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Winter Agriculture Soil Stratification (botany) Fire fighting Desertification Potato Tick Alfalfa Flax Neolithic Revolution Wheat Houseplant Sub-Zero Textile manufacturing Barley Global warming and agriculture Avalanche Tillage Comfrey Flowering plant Green Revolution Acorn San Pedro cactus Flood geology Fruit tree propagation Fast bowling Garden Strawberry Moss Elis Prefecture Percy Schmeiser Gypsy moth Climate of Salt Lake City Opportunity rover Skiing Puberty Bread Sewage treatment Naruto geography Geography of Brazil Pollination Vermicompost Bamboo Water (molecule) Combine harvester Creeping Charlie Zion National Park Effects of global warming John McDouall Stuart 2005 Atlantic hurricane season M16 (rifle) Cannabis (drug) Renewable energy Norman Borlaug Agricultural machinery Botany Wildfire Hamster Chatsworth House Organic food Disaster Wetland The Championships, Wimbledon Cuscuta Pok__mon Abilities

how to locate and catch the bat in our house i'm staying with friends in cambridge and we found last night at about that a bat had gotten into the house prob through a vent and was flying around this had never happened before we hid in the other room and by about an hour later the bat was nowhere to be found we assumed it was freaked out and hiding somewhere because her husband was banging around looking for it but we couldn't find it we are very worried about the possibility of the bat being rabid as they have a four year old daughter and i've been reading online that most bats to get into your house are rabid as they are disoriented i also read that everyone who's died of rabies in the us has contracted it through bat bites they didn't know they had since they are small and happen when you're asleep i've read on here how to get rid of a bat flying around but what about a bat you can't find i doubt even a specialist would be willing to comb the house and how scared should we be about rabies we cannot call professionals it's too expensive to be afforded right now hi i pulled the following text of the attached link i suggest you call in experts at least this is the key message from the reading i've done as for rabies yes it's a possibility but i think rather remote anyway have your friends seek out a local professional bat control is a unique field it requires specialized training techniques attention to detail and extensive knowledge of bat biology and behavior getting rid of bats requires experience an effective bat removal system ensures that the bat colony will no longer use your home or business as a roosting area urban wildlife control technichians care for the welfare of these beneficial creatures we do not aim to kill any bats a professional merely excludes bats from the premises and make sure they can't get back in while thoroughly cleaning the biohazardous droppings that they leave behind experience counts when working on bat jobs and it takes a skilled eye to get the job done right the first time effective bat control requires a full site inspection and of the structure must be properly sealed including gaps as small as inch wide this can obviously become quite labor intensive in some instances the primary entrance exit holes are the only access points available and basic repairs and an exclusion may be sufficient  Rabies Bat Baseball Education in the People's Republic of China Jumpstart 3rd Grade Blood (computer game) Carburetor Out-of-body experience Cricket RuneScape quests Computer virus Unemployment Fast bowling Vampire StarCraft: Uprising Textile manufacturing First aid M16 (rifle) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hard disk Milton H.

what qualifies as a weed what makes a weed a weed we currently have a beautiful yellow flowerdy plant on a long stalk growing in our yard but my mom told me it is a weed are weeds necessarily bad if this plant is so pretty then what's wrong with it why does it have to be called a weed great question the answer in gardening circles is that a weed is a plant in the wrong place however that doesn't make it a bad plant if it's invasive and taking over your whole yard then that isn't good but many plants that are called weeds are quite pretty or nice to look at frequently plants will spring up in someone's yard that came from seeds from someone else's garden and got there by being dropped by birds or stuck to the coat of a visiting animal and are called volunteers they will look out of place because they weren't planted on purpose but that is not a reason to get rid of them if you like the plant take milkweed for instance some people just chop it down because they don't know that the flowers provide nectar for the monarch and queen butterflies it also is the plant that they lay their eggs on so that the tiny caterpillars have a ready food source when they hatch when they kill the plant they often kill the tiny creatures that would have one day become beautiful butterflies so i hope this helps you understand that just because a plant looks out of place that isn't necessarily a bad thing  Biological pest control Theory of conduct Weed Hemp Weed control Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Asclepias Rapeseed Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Flowering plant Flower Garlic Butterfly Ragwort Agriculture Gooseberry Chicken Insect Goodness and value theory Caterpillar 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bladderwort Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Kudzu Jute Great Teacher Onizuka Pysanka Pansy Compost Monarch butterfly Maize Textile manufacturing Ranma __ characters Botany Biblical inerrancy Cannabis (drug) The Amber Spyglass Capercaillie Gypsy moth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kender Fruit Organic farming My Little Pony YuYu Hakusho Tomato Animal The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Monster Rancher monsters Ant Theodicy Social rule Snowball (Animal Farm) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Animal Crossing Rocko's Modern Life Homestar Runner RuneScape skills Sorghum Dandelion Illegal drug trade Comfrey Conker's Bad Fur Day Simone Weil Cindy Sheehan Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sexual reproduction Species Genetically modified food Intelligent design Coming of Age (TNG episode) Phoebe Halliwell Escape from New York Tobacco The Tale of Genji Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Homer Simpson Puni Puni Poemy Moth Orchidaceae Bee Mandrake (plant) Burdock Agricultural machinery Philosophy of language Tufted Vetch Shaggy dog story Blood (computer game) Bamboo Invasive species Gardening

dryer vent heating dog house i was wondering if it would be safe possible to heat my dog house with the dryer vent he is a husky and does not need constant heat nor does it want it so the dryer heat would be sufficent we do one three loads a day i was wondering if this is unsafe or if anyone had any suggestions on how to do this safely i am thinking it's a great way to recycle the lost heat we pay for does anyone have any suggestions or comments thank you ok before i get anymore rude comments back not all of you yes my dog is an outside dog not indoors he's a husky i had him inside for awhile and he hated it he'd constantly want to be let out and i'd have to drag him inside so i decided to let him have full rein of the backyard i would never chain him so i'm building a dog house and looking for ways to warm it a little in the winter he slept on top last winter but we brought him into the garage two nights that were really cold anyways just to clear things up for the not so smart looking for solutions not critisism this is a really clever idea although i would be worried about the lint blowing into the living space as a potential solution why not consider venting the heat under the dog house assuming it is elevated this might give you a radiant heat effect and would prevent the exhaust from going directly into his living space since heat rises it should still be relatively effective just make sure that you allow for some outbound ventilation under the house so that the exhaust has someplace to flow through also if you insulate the roof of the dog house it will help retain both this heat and your dog's body heat if this doesn't work think about installing an actually radiant heating grid like you would find installed under tile under his floor you could turn it off and on with any timer last bit of advice i promise get an indoor outdoor lcd thermometer with a remote sensor and place the sensor in his dog house that way you can tell if the house is adequate protection from the heat or cold they only cost about and are well worth it good luck  Solar power HVAC Furnace Autonomous building Diving suit Kitchen Wind power Basement Renewable energy Heat Transformer STS-114 Energy development Carbon dioxide Nuclear power Air conditioning Carburetor Thermostat Combine (Half-Life 2) Thermal power station Futurama (TV series - season 5) Space Shuttle external tank 2005 United States Grand Prix Glossary of firefighting terms Dialysis Glossary of firefighting equipment Refrigerator Traffic light Air-raid shelter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insulation Mars Exploration Rover Passive solar Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Rebreather Syphon Filter Future energy development Spacecraft propulsion Elevator Atmospheric reentry B-47 Stratojet Hamster Vacuum Dog Pebble bed reactor Door Ocean thermal energy conversion Electrical wiring The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Amber Spyglass Wind Piccolo Junior Saga Stirling engine Mercury Atlas 6 Light-emitting diode Colonization of the Moon E85 Diesel engine Casting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Dundas Square Mattress Radon Swimming pool RFID Modem Barbecue Hydrogen economy Drill bit Fire fighting Internal ballistics Cat Kim Possible The Death Gate Cycle Straw-bale construction Nuclear reactor Climate of the United Kingdom Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Volleyball The Inside Sento Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune Water Air pollution The Ark in Space Swamp cooler Jet engine Weather lore

need some adives this is kind of long so please bare with me my husband and i and my son are currently living with my family we are a young right now so anyways my questions is about something else beside where my parents live there is a small single wide and its not that big but the people that use to live there left it a mess and so my parents asked aroung and they found this guy that will remolded it for he will change all the floors and walls the windows and doors and the kitchen sink and the bathroom tube and the paint it from the outside and inside okay now there is a single wide for sale and we can put that one there instead of fising up the old house but the thing is that i think its way cheaper to just fix that one becuase the other one is and down payment to move it and pluse finance it will prbably go up to and plus any inspection that it has to go through and the monthly payments of for about years thats just to much for me what should i do so my husband says he is willing to that but i feel that its just way cheaper to fix that we wont have to pay rent and the only thing we have to do is get electricity and move in as soon as its ready and for me that is way easier and faster the sooner the better cause i really want to get out of my parents house but he insists that its better that way any suggestions about this does your husband realize that after the guy remodels the single wide it will be like it's almost new i'm guessing your parents own the single wide so you wouldn't have to pay anything extra for it if the single wides are close to the same size based only on the financial aspect i would say go for remodeling the older one like i said that's based only on the money part since i haven't seen either one maybe you should call a bank and find out how much the financing would be it might help convince your husband to take the other place when you add in the interest you'll be paying a lot more than for the one  Mortgage Friends Sento Annuity Knots Landing Jumpstart 3rd Grade Time Out of Mind Freeters Poker jargon 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Bond Gross domestic product Surplus value Student loan Deflation (economics) Gold standard Microeconomics Babylonian law Humphrey Bogart Keynesian economics White House McMansion Mutual fund Jam (TV series) About a Boy Interest Blood on the Tracks Divorce Futurama (TV series - season 4) Chatsworth House Harry Nilsson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Electrophysiology Debt Avenue Q Blonde on Blonde Capital accumulation Euro Schabir Shaik Trial Unreformed House of Commons Theory of conduct Leasing EastEnders Toilet Ashton-Tate Insurance Citigroup The Shining (film) Monetary policy Quake III Arena Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) The Inside Economy of Russia Personal finance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Fancy Crane Solar power Plame affair Money Internet fraud Primerica Financial Services Haibane Renmei The Emancipation of Mimi CPU cache Make money fast Copyleft Milton H.

why is there an anode rod in water heaters a couple of days ago my dad removed the anode rod or stink rod as we call it because our water smelled so bad that we could'nt drink it w o feeling sick it smelled like rotten eggs and made the water taste like it too well we had only had the heater in for two months but when we pulled out the rod it was so black and gross looking it looked like it had been there for years my questions are why are the rods used what is it made out of my dad has been wondering about these very questions also does it hurt to remove the anode our old heater never had one as far as we know and it lasted yrs and the water tasted great it's probably made out of zinc and it's what they call in the shipping industry a sacrificial anode when you have a combination of metals say iron and copper in a water environment the difference in the number of electron atoms in the two metals actually causes a very small electric current to flow when this current flows it causes a corrosion called galvanic corrosion between the dissimilar metals so a piece of zinc is installed which then corrodes instead of the copper or iron parts that's why it's called a sacrificial anode because you sacrifice a useless zinc part instead of allowing the useful other metal parts to corrode  Corrosion Anode Cathodic protection Aluminium Zinc Rust Welding Vacuum tube Soldering Sulfur Galvanization Metallurgy Steel Titanium Copper Motor oil Brazing Tin Hard water Electrode Sterling silver Lead Sulfuric acid Metal Cookware and bakeware Ozone Silicon Transition metal Magnetism Hydrogen sulfide Chromium Ammonia Diode Copper extraction Heat Hydrochloric acid Fuel cell Bong Lithium Electricity Battery (electricity) Cathode Electroplating Samovar Chlorine Ceramics X-ray Gold Platinum Mercury (element) Water purification Arc welding Mercury arc valve Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Gas metal arc welding Indium Textile manufacturing Volt Solder Semiconductor Thermostat Light-emitting diode Zirconium Furnace Acetic acid Transformer Sewage treatment Nuclear power Bronze Nuclear weapon design Hydrogen Nickel Thermal power station Gallium Fossil fuel power plant Magnesium Solar cell Barium Al-Razi Beryllium Pressurized water reactor Water (molecule) X-ray tube Tenjiku shogi Thallium Spark plug Stainless steel M16 (rifle) Electrical wiring Sulfide

do you know about growing tomatoes i've been left house sitting for my parents and they grow a hell of a lot of tomatoes problem is i know nothing about them at all can anybody give me picking tips like what colour should they be and how long should i leave them to ripen on the windowsill thanks depending on what variety they are usually when they turn red that is the time to pick and eat them some varieties turn a lemon yellow and these will not turn red rule of thumb is when they begin to lose their firmness and just beginning to turn soft then it's time to pick them i prefer to eat and pick them when they begin to turn a pink in color and are still firm and depending on where you live if there is a danger of frost coming on throw some covering on them that will keep them going for a while when the frost gets too heavy pick all that's left and store them in a cool dry place that will not be affected by frost and they will ripen on their own and you will have tomato's long after the frosts have killed all other vegetation and the snow is on the ground good picking and have a good harvest  Apple Potato Common bean Tofu Mango Loganberry Tobacco Banana Coffea arabica Ketchup Fancy rat Carnivorous plant Cuisine of Denmark Color Cheese Date Palm Peruvian cuisine Hamster Citrus Domestic rabbit Cuisine of Brazil Gatorade Peanut Textile manufacturing Maize Butter Durian Wheat Hemp Beet Leaf Basil Japanese cuisine Billiards Peach Cuisine of the Philippines Comanche Capercaillie Mario series enemies Mushroom hunting Fire hydrant Sugar beet Garden Strawberry Frost Coffea Snow Jute Sea-buckthorn Vegetarianism Organic food Acorn Physiological plant disorders Breakfast Fruit Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Bubble Bobble Cat Cannabis cultivation Aerial (dance move) Japanese tea ceremony Sundial Wine Food storage Mario Dairy Professional wrestling holds Chili con carne Pine Green Revolution Pikmin The Invisibles Knife Barley In-N-Out Burger Plantain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traffic light Hamburger Alfalfa Avocado Weather lore Chicken Mattress Squash (fruit) Guinea pig Therion (band) Snooker Illegal drug trade Chocolate Sub-Zero Jean Grey Sin City BZFlag Cuisine of Africa Pasta Curry Mountaineering

hello i wish a christian interpretation of my dream i had a dream i was in a garden field with corn plants a certain portion in the middle is thick corn plants real green with fruit but no cereals on it while at the surroundings there are some corn plants scattered having distance from each other real green as at the middle but they have healthy fruits a teacher was standing besides the corn plants at the middle talking to me while i was there harvesting sweet potatoes i harvested about kilos or more now i have some idea but i do believe it would be great to have others understanding ideas or interpretations since in a thing their could be different views it is better to consider the views of others in this way more ideas more knowledge thanks a lot i'm not going to claim any sort of special revelation but i think you could maybe draw a parallel between the thick foliage minus the cereals and the unfortunate majority of churchgoers whose lives don't bear spiritual fruit likewise it's those who do bear fruit who seem like the outsiders because they are doing what christ tells them to do not just hearing and then not obeying take a look at john i am the true vine and my father is the gardener he cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful you are already clean because of the word i have spoken to you remain in me and i will remain in you no branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me i am the vine you are the branches if a man remains in me and i in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing if anyone does not remain in me he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers such branches are picked up thrown into the fire and burned if you remain in me and my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be given you this is to my father's glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples also matthew that same day jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it while all the people stood on the shore then he told them many things in parables saying a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown he who has ears let him hear  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cereal Holy Spirit Agriculture Maize Apple Potato Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gospel of Thomas Original sin Sorghum Olive Dispensationalism Soul Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Flowering plant Ten Commandments Plant Peanut Hemp Weed control Church of Christ Christian views of Jesus Vegetarianism Pine Christianity Pea Sukkot Tobacco Garden Strawberry Banana Gooseberry Organic food Combine harvester Pysanka Book of Isaiah Sabbath Black pepper Fruit tree propagation Sugar beet Watermelon Hamster Vanilla Trinity Wheat Green Revolution Bonsai Alan Campbell (pastor) Barley Entheogen Jesus John Howard Yoder Pruning fruit trees Sweetcorn Determinism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Meaning of life Kiwifruit Divine grace Merit Satan Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Didache Mary, the mother of Jesus Turnip (brassica rapa) Apricot End times Endowment (Mormonism) Bamboo Coffea arabica Slow Train Coming New Testament view on Jesus' life Coast Douglas-fir Banksia Origin belief Bread Rice Book of Mormon 613 mitzvot Gospel of Mark Sweet potato Simone Weil Historical Jesus Battles of Lexington and Concord Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Eucharist John the Baptist Apostle Socrates Genesis Acorn Johnny Appleseed Karma

notched axe hatchet heads at the hardware store i noticed that many axes labeled for carpentry and framing have triangular cuts or notches in the underside of their heads as opposed to larger camper and fire axes looking normal and lacking any cuts whats the reason for this it doesn't appear to be a difference in size but if its a feature in some specialty tools what does it do not possitive on exact 'notch' but on farm we always added a 'wedged' angled piece into hole with new handle when this wedged was pounded into hole with new handle it prevented axle head to 'slip' off during use however we pounded the wedge into the top of axle head's hole  Screw Floppy disk Glossary of firefighting equipment Knife Drill bit Wrench Pottery Movie projector Game controller Plane (tool) Woodworking Climbing equipment Mouse (computing) Car handling Katana Elbow-joint Handloading M16 (rifle) Internal ballistics Cannon Compact disc Redundant array of independent disks Hand grenade Schwarzschild coordinates Timber framing Campfire Natural deduction RuneScape skills Reamer Punch card Ulna Ice axe Brewery NTSC Wallpaper group B-47 Stratojet Bong Rail tracks Volleyball Chopper (motorcycle) Sacrum Archery Atari ST Metalworking Textile manufacturing RISC Rail terminology C programming language Temporal bone Glossary of climbing terms CPU cache Firearm Roman numerals Lathe Equine conformation Geodesic dome Sega Saturn Bicycle frame Nintendo Revolution Einstein-Cartan theory Stairway Apollo Command/Service Module Seismic retrofit Diamond cut Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Gramophone record Leaf Wind turbine Maxilla British Rail Class 42 Dodge Neon Chainsaw RuneScape Random Events Four wheel drive Fast bowling Robot Wars Glossary of nautical terms Kukri Computer forensics Diamond Inertial guidance system Wire Log cabin Golf Machine tapers Hammer Golf club (equipment) Upholstery Chisel Saw Cheating in Counter-Strike Guilty Gear Battle of Jutland Chevrolet Corvair engine STS-114 Stave church Sprite (computer graphics)

lavender how do i take a cutting i'm totally new to gardening and have never took a cutting in my life we have a beautiful lavender pot at our front door but i wouldn't mind taking a cutting or two to eventually plant in pots ready for next year the only problem is we don't know where or how to take a cutting can anyone help i'm from south of france and usually we don't do cuttings with lavenders except if the plant is big enough the best i think is to take a bit of the root along with their following twigs the most important i guess is the nature of the earth in which you re earth the cutting  Lavender Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Perfume Fruit tree propagation Comfrey Hydroponics Theory of conduct Lavender Line Audrey Hepburn Carnivorous plant Bonsai The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Ron Weasley Essential oil Oh My Goddess!

why does my shower water turn cold when a toilet is flushed i can be taking a nice relaxing shower and bam someone flushes a toilet in another bathroom and the hot water vanishishes it stays cold until the toilet tank is refilled about a minute or two why does the toilet need my hot water it's a cold water device i've been in other showers at other's houses and the water becomes scolding when a toilet is flush that to me makes more sense because the toilet is drawing away cold water for itself leaving nothing but hot but that's not the case in my house why one of two reasons inside your shower are two safety devices a low pressure device that detects water pressure so that the heater cannot be on with no water inside the tank an anti scalding device switches off the heater if the temperature goes too high stopping you getting scalded when the toilet is flushed the cistern is lower than your shower so the water finds it easier to come out of the lower outlet reducing the water pressure significantly device cuts in as water flows into your toilet cistern there is less water to go through your shower slowing the flow means less water is in contact with the heater but for a longer time thus raising the temperature beyond the safe limit device hope that explains it lock the bathroom doors b taking a shower andy  Flush toilet Japanese toilet Autonomous building Thermal power station Siphon Fire fighting Brewery Toilet Plumbing fixture Toilet paper Diode Sewage treatment Sento Solar power Bathroom Naval mine Fossil fuel power plant Menstrual cup Furnace Sauna Rebreather Steam engine Carburetor Washroom HVAC Heat Diving regulator Poker jargon Jet engine Circuit breaker Diesel engine Cold fusion Residual-current device Urinal Fecal incontinence Basement Cruising (maritime) Drowning Vacuum tube Apollo 13 Spacecraft propulsion Glossary of firefighting equipment Urination Rail terminology Temperature Urinary incontinence Bathing Water heater Coffee Items in the Metroid series Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carbon dioxide Nuclear fusion Water Welding Avalanche Internal ballistics Redundant array of independent disks Solar panel Firearm Portable stove Neutrino Vacuum Hot air balloon Toyota Prius Bong STS-62 Iowa class battleship Hypertension Casting Glossary of firefighting terms Sin City Swimming pool Hyperthermia Severe weather terminology (United States) Turbocharger Water (molecule) Yerba mate Soldering Air conditioning Suicide methods Transistor Sailing Land mine Energy development Toilet humour Peltier-Seebeck effect CPU cache Radioisotope thermoelectric generator

japanese beetles i have green bean plants in my garden with japanese beetles all over them they are eating the leaves completely off are there any natural remedies to get rid of the little pests what can i do to get rid of them before they ruin my plants least toxic japanese beetle controls there aren t many natural controls for adult japanese beetles birds aren t partial to them and although some predatory wasps and flies have been imported their population isn t large enough yet to control the japanese beetle problem the most effective natural control is to go into your garden with a jar of soapy water and knock the beetles into it japanese beetles feed in groups starting at the top of plants so it s actually pretty easy to fill a jar with them insecticidal soap will kill adult japanese beetles is sprayed directly on the beetle it does not have any residual effect meaning that beetles that aren t sprayed directly won t be harmed a word of caution about the pheromone beetle traps they will attract beetles but you ll probably wind up with more beetles coming into your yard than you would have without the trap the original intention of the traps was to track when and how many japanese beetles were in the area not as a means of eradication finally if you have repeated intense infestations you should check your soil in late summer to see if you have a large grub population lift a sq ft section of turf if there are more than a dozen grubs in this small area consider treating your lawn with some type of grub control however not every garden that has a japanese beetle problem is associated with a lawn full of grubs the beetles can hatch in your neighbors lawn and find your tasty garden with very little effort more toxic controls to be used with caution there are several insecticides labeled for use on adult japanese beetles including bayer advanced garden multi insect killer concentrate carbaryl sevin neem extracts orthene ortho bug b gon garden landscape insect killer concentrate orthene turf tree ornamental insecticide spectracide bug stop multi purpose insect control concentrate spectracide triazicide soil turf insect killer concentrate these sprays will kill on contact and also have some residual effect keep in mind that these sprays will kill more than just the japanese beetles so use them only for extreme infestations and again japanese beetles are only a pest for a little over a month so don t over react always read and follow label directions when using any pesticide  Mosquito Organic farming Pesticide Insecticide Carnivorous plant DDT Lawn Pesticide toxicity to bees Spider Organic horticulture Weed control Pollinator decline Cockchafer Herbicide Gaucho (insecticide) Bedbug Ant Ladybird Red imported fire ant Irrigation Agriculture Coffee Invasive species in Australia Apple Malaria Chicken Green Revolution Rapeseed Desert locust Pesticide poisoning Hydroponics Organic food Pest control Sewage treatment Zerg Gooseberry Thermal power station Hamster Acorn Honeybee Tobacco Deadly nightshade Vermicompost Weed Colorado potato beetle Neem Cycad Anopheles Cochineal Stag beetle Tick Garden Strawberry Golf Theory of conduct Venus Flytrap Essential oil Japanese beetle Shotgun Banksia Fauna of Australia Waste management Air pollution Gardening Naruto jutsu Spruce Budworm Carbon dioxide Bagworm moth Biodynamic agriculture Quake III Arena Chagas disease Codename: Kids Next Door Lumber Alkane Glossary of wildland fire terms Hedgehog Xeriscaping Eutrophication Central Park Sulfur Scale insect Fire extinguisher Bark beetle Organic gardening Blood (computer game) Sexual dimorphism Blood II: The Chosen Food and Drug Administration

what can i use to kill ants i've had those ants a few times over the years it always seems no matter how clean you keep your kitchen or elsewhere they still seem to come but i've been able to safely get rid of them for years at a time by doing the following old time remedy i also suspect this would be a good solution for outdoor ants as well just so long it wasn't raining during the few days of treatment get a cheap bottle of boric acid powder a very mild and safe form of ant control you can get at places like home depot and lowes in the pest control section next to the gardening supplies also get a small container of mint jelly from the grocery store i found it at albertsons grocery store mix two tablespoons boric acid powder per ounces of mint apple jelly take a thin piece of cardboard or a doubled over piece of paper and tape it firmly against part of the surface such as a counter directly over the pathway the ants are using and make thin rows of the boric acid jelly solution on it with enough space between the rows for the ants to get between so that as many of the ants have access to the edges of the jelly as possible some will get stuck in the jelly but many will take bits of this stuff back to their nest and feed it to the rest of the colony and queen you may have to replace the paper or cardboard with fresh jelly daily for or days and then they'll be gone for good by the way you may actually see more ants in the first hours after you first put the boric acid jelly out but then it tapers down quickly during the nd day because they begin dying as they take the stuff back to their colony the way the stuff works is that it dehydrates them from the inside out  Diseases of the honeybee Boric acid Bread Dairy Ant Drill bit Plastic Water Milk Internal ballistics Breastfeeding Gramophone record Gypsy moth Mattress Cochineal Hard disk Coffee Candidiasis Bulk vending Food preservation SimAnt Tea Apple CPU cache Plastic bag Floppy disk Cookware and bakeware Japanese tea ceremony Cocaine Cell (biology) Fancy rat Sulfuric acid Medical prescription Boron Poker jargon Bee Origin of life Energy development Flax Carbon dioxide Soil pH Domestic rabbit Caffeine Olive oil Titanium Chopsticks Atari 8-bit family M16 (rifle) Protein-energy malnutrition Cremation Psoriasis LSD Bong Wal-Mart Water (molecule) Heinkel He 100 Redundant array of independent disks Strap-on dildo Thermal power station Menstrual cup Nitrocellulose Seismic retrofit Tooth Illegal drug trade Acid Ammonia Mouth ulcer Water purification Christmas tree Brewery Boy's surface Red imported fire ant Turquoise Commodore 64 Bedbug Alcohol fuel Glass Tofu Diving suit Handloading Welding Vinegar Doughnut Printed circuit board Beehive (beekeeping) Canadian dollar Irrigation

how much does it usually cost price range to have a large tree cut down we have a tree in our backyard and its root system is starting to mess with our pipes the cost would depend on access to the tree height of the tree width of the tree and where you live these all factor in becuase the heights determines if they will have to use a climber to top out the tree or a bucket location determines if they can get their larger equipment to it how far they have to carry to load the limbs and base of tree width of tree will factor in on how many trips they will have to take to remove the tree from the property and if they will have a stump grinder to get rid of the stump or if they will have to bring in a backhoe to dig it out where you live will factor in becuase somewhere like ny it cost more to do everything where as if you live in ky it would be cheaper also if the tree is a hardwood the price might go down becuase they might turn it into firewood and sell what they remove all of these will factor in to the price so the price range without seeing the tree would be a large range i would say lowest to k depending on factors  Gypsy moth Tractor Irrigation Wood fuel Vegetation Hash table Glossary of wildland fire terms Wind turbine Coffee Logging CPU cache Christmas tree Dairy Tree Mountaineering Dredge Sport utility vehicle Sequoia Floppy disk Woodworking Loader (equipment) Avalanche Optical fiber Transformer Archery Stairway Biodiesel Paintball Bamboo Narrow gauge Eucalyptus Compiler optimization Hard disk Thermal power station Deforestation E85 Erie Canal Panzer II Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Gold standard Law of value Airline Pharmaceutical company Diamond Drill bit Car handling CPU design Laws of cricket Economic history of Canada Digital photography Capitalism Solar power Honey fungus Glossary of graph theory Ford Thunderbird Inflation Atari 8-bit family Radeon Panzer I Cable television Lock picking Taxation in the United States Hydrogen economy Microeconomics Anchor Nintendo GameCube Solar cell Drainage Economy of India RuneScape skills Exchange value Giant Sequoia Plough Animal Crossing Arbitrage Organ (music) Nuclear fallout Glossary of climbing terms Vanilla Combine (Half-Life 2) Supply and demand Radio masts and towers Windows 2000 Hyperinflation Welding North American Numbering Plan Routing Microprogram Global Positioning System Labor theory of value Free trade Scale model Fuel injection RuneScape locations Air gun NeXT

why do my new pvc sprinkler pipe sections keep cracking i had a small leak in the metal pipes at the sprinkler valves the plumber repaired the leak by replacing that valve with pvc pipe a week later one of the replaced sections had a small crack that also leaked only when that valve was running the plumber replaced it days ago today when i got home from work there was a huge crack in the other pvc pipe he'd replaced and the water was gushing onto my lawn even though the sprinklers weren't even running at the time it looked like it hadn't been gushing for too long as my lawn wasn't flooded yet i was able to turn off the water to that valve set i've left a message for the plumber to have him back out to fix it but why does this keep happening and what can i do to prevent it should i have him replace it with copper rather than pvc pipes i can't afford to pay another plumber to come out to fix this when the work should be warrantied i hope someone has some good advice add' info my water company was out about a month ago to test my pressure it is psi at the exterior faucet about when i run water in the house at the same time rep says i have good normal pressure for our area but probably narrow pipes because they are old galvanized steel so i don't think the water pressure is the problem it sounds like the pvc fitting that is being screwed on is a female adapter pvc female threaded fittings do not have the best strength if this is the case use a metal preferably brass female thread x female thread coupler and a pvc male adapter it will be much stronger  Irrigation Domestic water system Hydraulic machinery Glossary of firefighting equipment Screw Seismic retrofit Trombone Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water supply Novelty (locomotive) Siphon Tap (valve) Thermal power station Rail terminology Drill bit Spark plug Welding Hydrochloric acid Bong Roof Diving cylinder Fire hydrant Casting Diving regulator Flush toilet Diving suit Brazing Containment building Elevator Thermostat Dodge Neon Atari 8-bit family Rigging Oxyacetylene Plastic Electrical wiring Fire Sprinkler Sleeve valve Rebreather Cartridge (firearms) Steam (content delivery) Three Mile Island Urinary incontinence Gramophone record Motorcycle Downing Street memo Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Pioneer Zephyr Pipe organ Dairy Rail tracks Propeller Borehole Carbon dioxide 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mattress USS Tunny (SS-282) Newcomen steam engine Harp Second Battle of the Atlantic Glossary of climbing terms Firefighter Corrosion Heart valve Sento Internal ballistics Electronic organ Heat Suppressor Glossary of firefighting terms Floodgate Knife USS S-38 (SS-143) Heinkel He 112 Poker jargon Naval mine Hurricane Rita Aortic valve stenosis Violin Fire extinguisher Jet engine Aluminium Steel Ammonia Plame affair Bagpipes Equine conformation Coppersmith Cray-1 Rifle

what happens when someone is using your po box and phone number i thought it strange to sometimes be getting the same woman's bills mail recently a debt company called looking for her as well why am i getting her messages and mail what should i do first check your credit make sure it's only your phone number and po box make sure no credit cards show up that you do not have no lines of credit that are not actually yours this person clearly has your address and phone number that's too close for comfort make sure this is not blossoming into identity theft then put a fraud alert on your credit that will make it so you'll be contacted in the event that anyone tries to open any accounts set up any credit in your name talk with the post office and tell them that you are getting mail to a person who is not known to you tell them you are getting and explain you suspect fraud they should have you complete forms to show what name s are on the mail that is not yours ask them to let you change your po box number free of charge call the phone company and talk with them about the situation consider changing phone numbers and getting an unpublished number that is unlisted not in the phone book and cannot be gotten by calling information in case you discover this is identity theft http www ssa gov oig hotline index htm idtheft

how to kill spiders besides smashing them i live in an old house and i had it sprayed professionally times last year and this year it seems like its worse i hate spiders im going to the store later tonight to get spray and the stuff you lay around the foundation of your house but until then is there anything around the house i can mix together and spray on them to kill them i was spraying our sideing off and they just started coming out everywhere i dont want to touch them ughhhhh also i have had it sprayed professionally by the orkin man and they didnt do a good job that is the only company in my small town steps to non toxic spider control individual spiders can be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows corners of rooms storage areas basements and other seldomly used areas helps remove spiders and their webs vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive this process indoors a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider to prevent spiders from coming indoors seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they must have for food indoors keep clutter to a minimum place boxes off the floor and away from walls to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within clean up clutter in garages sheds basements and other storage areas be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites outdoors eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash leaf litter heavy vegetation and other accumulations of materials trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors  Identity theft Internet fraud Bank fraud Surveillance GSM services Gmail Fraud Advance fee fraud Phishing Credit card Mail fraud British national identity card Spam (electronic) Mail E-mail spam Social Security number (United States) Phreaking Skype HyperText Transfer Protocol Roswell UFO incident IP Multimedia Subsystem Automatic teller machine Voice over IP The Inside Emergency telephone number Identity document United States Postal Service Timeline of hacker history Telephone tapping Spyware ChoicePoint HTTP cookie Data retention Inspector General 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines United Airlines Flight 93 Direct marketing MSN Messenger Public-key cryptography Virgin Mobile Phone sex Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail Poker jargon Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act America Online Credit card fraud Microeconomics Schabir Shaik Trial Octopus card The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Electronic Arts Karl Rove Anonymity Beltway sniper attacks Musical Instrument Digital Interface Telephone numbering plan Social Security (United States) Electronic commerce Password Cross site scripting Opera (web browser) Telephone directory Ocean's Twelve Anonymous remailer Telephone booth Credit score Minitel 7 July 2005 London bombings Hacker (computer security) Credit repair Privacy Social rule Pretty Good Privacy Payphone Florida Central Voter File Call for help Compiler optimization Plame affair timeline Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Mail-order bride Network Switching Subsystem Short message service UK telephone numbering plan Enron Corporation Post Office box Wireless Application Protocol Han twins murder conspiracy Debit card Private branch exchange ZIP Code Contract bridge Aliens of London Patricia Ford

can anyone tell me a really good effective product to get rid of clothes moths i live in a small block of flats and me and my neighbours have had a problem with the infestation of clothes moths now for over a year they continunally come into my flat from under the carpets and have already eaten bits out of my carpets as they are made of wool the block was sprayed with pestiside to no effect also the lavae nest could'nt be located ive been told lavender and cedar wood moth balls are suppossed to be quite effective at driving them away but as i live in central london ive had difficulty trying get either ones as no one seems to sell them only the plain ones which im reluctant to use as they give off chemicals which can be damaging to clothes and make them smell id really apprieciate any ideas to get rid of these pests and also if any one knows where i can get either lavender or cedar wood mothball easily or any prouduct with these in them for getting rid of moths ps is there a plug in device you can buy like the ones for rodents but for getting rid of insects interrupt their life cycle by killing the eggs and larvae all clothes that are possibly infested should be dry cleaned or washed after you have done that place the clothes in the freezer smaller items can be placed in large ziploc bags and frozen for two or three days take them out to thaw and then shake them vigorously to remove any dead larva next clean wherever the clothing was stored preferably use a bleach solution and clean it thoroughly taking care to get into every single nook and cranny if it s a closet remove the shelves and rods if it s a dresser remove the drawers and clean the underside and interior surfaces moth eggs and larva can hide in even the cracks moth repellants now that you have gotten rid of the moth infestation the final step is to prevent them from coming back here are some ways to deter moths from making your home their home store clothes in a cedar chest or add some cedar chips moths don t like cedar chips blocks or oil keep your house clean avoid any standing water try placing peppermint gum in your pantry simply unwrap the gum and set it on the wrapper on the shelf place bay leaves in your cabinets you can also place them in bags of flour or tape them inside boxes of cereal peppercorns or cloves might also keep moths away place a tonka bean available at most herbal stores in a small cotton bag to repel the moths use lavender sachets or soak cotton balls with lavender oil and place them where you previously found moths if you work with dried flowers freeze them for a day before allowing them in your home empty vacuum cleaner bags frequently they can contain moths which can eat right through the bags if your house has any nearby bird or rodent nests which are empty destroy them moths are attracted to these empty nests two other commonly used ways to get rid of moths are mothballs and insect foggers mothballs not only smell bad but they are poisonous it is best to avoid the use of them whenever possible especially if you have children or pets you can try using an insect fogger to kill moths but many moths are resistant to the spray and it also poses a health threat to all the other occupants of your home moths are persistent creatures and you might have to treat your home several times before you have completely gotten rid of them if you live in an area prone to moths follow these preventative measures year round to keep your home moth free  Snake Rattlesnake Brown recluse spider Antivenom Spider Pit viper Recluse spider American copperhead Vital Brazil Hobo spider Snake handling Venom (poison) Widow spider Peafowl Snakebite (bite) First aid Spider monkey Sea snake Black widow spider Fauna of Australia Nitroglycerin Church of God with Signs Following Poison Daddy long-legs spider Arachnid Copperheads (politics) Copperhead (DC Comics) Red-back spider Meerkat Frog Araneomorphae Grand Teton National Park Serpent Society Crossed Viper Deadly Viper Assassination Squad Opiliones La Brea Tar Pits Spider silk Animal communication Agatha Christie Taipan Kill Bill Pok__mon Colosseum D'ni wildlife Coral snake Jumping spider Lizard Orb-weaver spider Lava Beds National Monument Red-cockaded Woodpecker Banana Snake oil Creatures in Bionicle Naruto jutsu Minor Harry Potter Beasts Termite Crane fly Tarantula The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Headcrab -phobia Big Basin Redwoods State Park Carnivore Ant Spider hole Linyphiidae Bellamy Brothers Snake charming Mackerel Cottonmouth Dog Mount Diablo State Park Tsuga City of Rocks Moult Characters of Naruto Pok__mon Abilities Robert Templeton Preston, Minnesota Huntsman spider Arthropod Professional wrestling throws Ungoliant Trapdoor spider Woolly spider monkey Great Basin Aqua Teen Hunger Force Shannara creatures St Andrew's Cross spider Spider wasp Albert Calmette Krait Sea spider Toilet humour Moray eel Common house spider Osiris Insect Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Goanna

are keys made to be stuck in locks when turned on purpose or is it purely because of chance that every lock iv seen the pins never go in increasing order of how much they need to be raised from back to front thus allowing the key to come out after being turned i meant ur standard pin tumbler locks and i understand the inside and why the key is held in but i was curious cuz i realized it is possible that with certain key shapes it wud not hold it in i started thinking about this cuz i was wondering how many different combinations were possible and didnt know whether or not to discount the ones where the key wud not be held in yes you want the key to be trapped unless in the withdrawal position that way the the lock is fully locked or not depending on it's function if a key could be withdrawn at random points the cylinder could be inadvertently be left unlocked manufacturers and master key programs should always reject key combination with descending cuts and anyway the points on the key would have to be filed down to be level with the cuts to pull the partially turned key  Refrigerator Ice cream Freezer Dairy Air conditioning Sento Refrigerator car Food storage Haloalkane Ammonia Refrigerant Refrigeration Bone marrow transplant Insulation Autonomous building Jet engine Basement Puff pastry Cray-1 Floppy disk Negative feedback Freeze drying Major appliance Dehumidifier Fuzzy logic RISC E85 Shelf life Heat Heat engine Helium Organic food Diseases of the honeybee Ozone depletion Urban heat island Food preservation Swamp cooler Spinach Icehouse (building) Room temperature Superconductivity Railroad car CPU design Bong Ozone hole Cryogenics HVAC Freezing Carburetor Ice Milk Gas compressor Propane Amana Colonies Bagel Beatmania IIDX Crane (machine) Genericized trademark Brewery Anchor Heat pump Weighting filter Temperature PID controller Slow cooker Boiling water reactor Butane Carbon dioxide Atmospheric pressure Circuit design Pasteurization Redundant array of independent disks Explosive material Consumer goods in the Soviet Union Warehouse STS-87 Residual-current device Heike Kamerlingh Onnes Knife Helicopter Phase change heat pump Economy of Lithuania Aircraft engine controls Phase (matter) Mobile weapons Supercharger Stirling engine Gas absorption refrigerator Fuel cell Hash table MOSFET Gustavus Franklin Swift Compiler optimization Stock car (rail) Tofu Insulin Quintuplets Compost Cuisine of Denmark

trapping bugs my brother is doing a project and he has to catch bugs hes caught an ant moth beetle grasshopper mosquito and a horsefly and he need around more where could he look to get some or how to catch some besides looking outside that is any help would be nice get a butterfly net or some sort of light weight jar or box that has a separate lid wait until night and turn on the outside light stand away from the house and wait and low and behold the light area will fill up with bugs you can catch them all buy being quick with the jar and lid or taking a quick sweep with the net and taking it directly to the house side to keep the bug in it until you can put them in a jar another way to catch crawling bugs is to use a pure while cloth like a hankerchief it must be white because for some reason the bugs are attracted to that bright color place it in the garden or in the low cut grass where you know you have seen bugs in the daytime and shine a flash light right onto the cloth sometimes you have to wait quite some time but bugs will crawl onto the cloth another way to catch bugs that like moisture is to wet the mulsh or grass and put a good sized board or rock onto it do that in the evening and in the morning when it is light out quickly turn the rock or board over and you can find rolly poly's and centipedes and eerwicks under the rocks also in the heat of the day you can find japanese beetles all over the sides of light colored houses on the side where the sun is on the house usually between and pm and if you dig in any mulch around a garden or decoration around a house you will find a good amount of just any kind of bug  Ant Bee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Africanized bee Apocrita Chicken Piccolo Junior Saga Rainbow Bee-eater Carpenter bee Honeybee Wasp Conker's Bad Fur Day The Subtle Knife Hornet Tag Bumblebee Beehive (beekeeping) Termite Spider Mario Basic English Volucella pellucens House Sparrow RuneScape quests Hamster Pesticide toxicity to bees The Amber Spyglass Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hun-Apu Red imported fire ant Timon and Pumbaa Night (book) Static Shock Diseases of the honeybee Insect The Time Machine Sleeping Murder Kain (Legacy of Kain) The Inside Supercedure American Alligator AFI 100 Years series Drill bit Tarantula hawk Housefly Joker (comics) Chalkboard Chalk Animal communication Tokusatsu Tarantula Poker jargon Yellow Xenomorph Eisner Award Jak II Battlefield (Doctor Who) Biological pest control Yellowjacket Russian joke Ninja Scroll Neoptera Second Battle of El Alamein Digger wasp Hymenoptera Flower-fly -phobia Cigarette Smoking Man Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Agatha Christie The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Professional wrestling throws Charles Peace Nest box Transformers: Cybertron Common Wasp Swamp Thing The Legend of Zelda series enemies Cretaceous European Kingfisher Dave Lister German Wasp Drawn Together 10 Things I Hate About You Buckingham Palace Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Avengers Disassembled Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Climbing equipment My Life as a Teenage Robot The Chemical Brothers USS Wasp (CV-18) Kakapo Homer Simpson Pica (disorder) Adam and Eve P-47 Thunderbolt Ecology ChalkZone Fable (video game)

siding what do you ask for when getting an estimate my brother is paying for siding on my home he is a wonderful brother by the way he told me to get estimates for windows also i dont know what to ask for i need the old siding removed and i want to keep the price down since he is paying for it please help thank you the first answer that i recieved from john was fantastic thank you so much this is an old house at least yrs old my dad and mom built it they had no experience building it is a plain ranch type home with wood siding the wood is really moldy and is roten ineed to know what type siding to go with there are many types i not able to wrap the house myself i wish i could i'd like to but physically i am not able that is the main reason why we are hiring someone i am checking around the neighborhood to see if good work was done it is not easy finding someone you can trust i will consider all advice given to me and thank you so much i would like to get it done during the summer i have heard that the windows are put in first so i know that will take time thank a rd time wow john you are great after all that imformation now come and do the work lol take care all of you will sleep well tonight knowing you helped this unexperienced woman sorry thats inexperienced read below for choosing contractors do more research on siding and removal through google yahoo searches if you do have the siding removed have the contractor give you an estimate on installing house wrap to the exterior under the new siding house wrap when you go out in bad weather you wear a jacket to protect yourself from rain wind and other elements a home should be protected in the same fashion without a protective barrier the home can get wet which can lead to wood rot and mold growth is there a better way to protect a home from these elements using a house wrap during the framing stage of construction will prevent moisture from entering the home this will protect the house from rotting and from developing mold or fungus additionally air infiltration through the framed walls will be blocked the best practice for protecting your home from wind and water while allowing it to breathe is to install a layer of house wrap made of a thin layer of spun bonded polyethylene here's how to do it start at a corner but make sure you have to feet of house wrap to overlap the corner wrap it around the corner and continue nailing or stapling as you move wrap the entire building including door and window openings use button nails or minimum inch staples to fasten the house wrap every to inches along the vertical studs make an inverted y cut or martini glass cut over the window openings fold the flaps in through the opening of the two sides and the sill and fasten them inside many builders do not install a drainage plane at all the builders who do often install building paper a sheet of asphalt impregnated felt paper to protect the house from exterior water penetration unlike house wrap however building paper doesn't effectively reduce air infiltration because it has many seams while house wrap is a continuous sheet with minimal overlaps house wrap produces a breathable weather resistant barrier that will reduce energy costs and prevent wind driven rain from entering the walls of a home windows if you are actually going to have the windows replaced the best way to do this is replace the whole window including the frames have the windows removed to the rough opening many contractors will tell you this is not necessary if the house is quite old the space between the rough oping and the window frame is likely not insulated and sealed properly leaving the existing window frames in will not eliminate drafts properly also it allows you to see if there is may moisture damage to the structure that has to be repaired here is an excerpt from this link http www doityourself com stry retrofit how do i decide between retrofit or new construction windows by bill kevin burnett q what are the disadvantages to retrofit windows as opposed to the advantages of new construction windows i've been shopping for new windows for my home and have found that labor and materials for retrofit windows is about one half the cost of new construction windows i understand that with retrofit windows the old window is removed and the new window is installed into the old window frame which certainly cuts down on labor however is there a quality issue can there be more of a chance of leakage around the window with retrofitted windows retrofit installers swear by their product my contractor said he won't install retrofit windows what's a homeowner to do a retrofit windows are installed into existing window frames new construction windows are secured to the frame of the house by nailing flanges the cost difference is related to removal and repair of existing window trim and siding the major advantage of flanged windows is that they are one integral unit that is easy for the contractor or homeowner to install plumb and square within a framed opening retrofit windows are installed into existing frames and if those frames are not plumb or square there may be problems to install flanged windows the old windows must be completely removed exterior trim and often interior trim will have to be removed exposing the framing so the new windows can be nailed or screwed to it siding will also need to be cut back so that the edge of the framing is exposed if you have a stucco exterior installation will require some stucco to be chipped or cut away then patched after the new windows are installed trim must be reinstalled finally everything must be repainted sounds like a pretty big job doesn't it it is retrofit windows on the other hand use the existing frame as the opening in which to install the new windows no trim removal no stucco or siding to repair a seemingly much simpler and cleaner job it can be so what to do from our perspective it depends on the type of existing windows you have and the exterior trim and siding involved most of our experience has been with the double hung wooden windows that are common in old homes to install retrofits in this type of frame the old sash is removed stops are installed if necessary and the new unit is attached to the old wood frames with shims and screws a little caulking around the joints and you're done this type of installation if done properly will provide an airtight seal if your existing windows are the steel casement windows used in the s or the aluminum windows commonly used in the s ' s and ' s we'd suggest you do some serious digging into the possibility of using retrofits if we were in the market to retrofit these windows we'd undertake major research look at some existing installations and satisfy ourselves with the looks method of installation and quality of these products all this being said we don't think we'd be happy with existing steel or aluminum frames with new window inserts unless we were convinced that the frames were covered and the installation was airtight tip we've always found it better to install flanged windows with screws rather than nails if minor adjustments have to be made to properly fit the window into the opening it's much easier to remove a screw or two rather than pull a nail with a cat's paw use stainless steel or zinc coated screws selecting contractors look up local contractors first work out form the closest to your location if some you trust has had work done similar to yours ask them about the contractor they used if they were completely satisfied with their contractor s ask for their telephone number select at least your are interested do a google yahoo search on each of the contractors you are interested in look for praises check who is writing the praises to see if they have any connection to the contractor scam artists and coffident persons often work in groups google yahoo search the people giving the praise or references when you are satisfied with at least contractors per job have the give you written estimates with details of work to be done terms guarantee s cost of extras how much do they charge if they find something not covered by the contract paymant schedules if necessary and whatever else you can think of to protect yourself if the contractor tries to pressure you into signing the contract immediately with a high deposit more than reject that contractor be careful high pressure can be someone who sounds very convincing but has many reasons why you should sign on the dotted line now it is always good to have another adult with you when a contractor inspects the work to be done if you do not get at least written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet go back to repeat until you get written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet read the estimates over with some who has some knowledge of the work that has to be done this may take longer than you thought do not rush into it research resaerch research helps when you are ready choose by being informed good luck  Carpenter bee Bee Spider Tarantula Flickr Black widow spider Butterfly

what is the difference between a modular home and a mobile home none of the answers you received specify the differences i went thru the same thing so here are the key differences a manufactured home mobile is built to hud code a modular home is built to the irc standard which is the same standard a site built home is built to all replacement parts in a modular are standard and therefore all plumbing electrical seals etc can be found at your local home depot you will have to go to a special mobile home place to get parts for your mobile home there are different types of modular homes off frame and on frame on frame is built on a steel frame just like a mobile home it will come to your house on wheels they will take the axles off because it is a modular home and built to the irc code just like a site built your modular will be put on a permanent foundation system mobile homes contain x pieces on the side a modular home is built just like a site built with x 's everywhere in some cases you can and should upgrade to x lumber in your modular also a modular home qualifies for conventional financing just like a site built a manufactured home does not also a manufactured home will never qualify for a home equity loan but banks view modular homes like a site built and you will qualify for a home equity loan off frame modulars are the best modulars possible they will come to your home on a flat bed truck with no axles on the home like the on frame modulars a crane has to be used to place the sections on the permanent foundations also do not underestimate the irc code it is a stricter standard of workmanship and materials than the hud code on frame modulars generally cost more than a manufactured home plus the cost of the permanent foundation but you will have a home that competes with a sitebuilt and that financial institutions view as appreciating in value that is why they will finance modulars just like a site built and qualify for home equity loans in the future should you need it  Kitchen Menstrual cup Hydrogen peroxide Japanese toilet Diseases of the honeybee Brewery Ant Dishwashing Sento Toilet humour Fire fighting Blood Simple Textile manufacturing Dairy Plumbing fixture Towel Vermicompost Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Hamster Married... with Children Sewage treatment World War Three (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling holds Jackass: The Movie Poker jargon Betting (poker) Mattress The Shining (film) Bathroom Refrigerator Joke Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Tattoo Jumpstart 3rd Grade Sauna Caving Water Cheese Basement Menstrual cycle Hogwarts Floor Directory Volleyball The Brady Bunch Autonomous building Paper towel Electrophysiology The Inside Bong Compost Dustbin Hemp Toilet Diving Seismic retrofit American Black Bear Ozone Columbine High School massacre Genericized trademark Cannabis cultivation Foodborne illness Cuisine of Denmark Fire extinguisher Bulk vending Medical prescription Cantonese cuisine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Casting Chatsworth House Dymaxion house Organic peroxide The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Second Battle of the Atlantic McMansion Mathematician Rathfarnham Air conditioning Computer virus Milk The Empty Child Bleach (manga) Dormitory Drag racing Coconut crab Drill bit Fancy rat

toliet seat question i realize this question is kinda strange i've yet to find an answer that makes enough sense to me in most cases toliet seats in public restrooms are horseshoe shaped and in private home bathrooms are a closed circle why i've heard it has to do with sanitary reasons but if that's the case if the horseshoe shaped seats are more sanitary why wouldn't more home bathrooms have them wow definitely a weird question never pondered it myself public toilet seats have a gap because that area is in the line of fire so to say when used by a man peeing if it's not there it reduces the amount of janitorial work home seats have no gap because it's nicer and there's not too much worry of them getting too dirty since you'd probably take more care in keeping your furniture clean and they're used by less often  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Refrigerator car Kitchen Food storage Zucchini Hamster Indian Air Force Dairy Ada programming language Pacific Fruit Express Durian Passover Seder Kosher foods Coriander Foodborne illness Animal Crossing Fruit Bat Tropicana Products Folland Gnat Contredanse Autonomous building Vinegar ROT13 Breakfast Basil Organic food Refrigeration Juice Train Mango Refrigerator June 2 in baseball Military history of Egypt during World War II Persimmon Lychee Gooseberry Leno LaBianca Hawker-Siddeley Hawk Coconut Snow Scouts Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Freezer Sunnyvale, California Tomato Banana Best Buy Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables Major appliance Community-supported agriculture Very special episode Apricot Japanese tea ceremony Rambutan Ernie Irvan Tofu The Catcher in the Rye Upholstery Leo Frank International League Cuisine of Denmark Norouz Babe Ruth Food Seitan Red Sox Nation F-86 Sabre Tattoo Billboard Hot 100 Emergency preparedness 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands Surtsey Command School Ken Jennings Something Fresh Big Brother UK series 6 Lemonade Ice cream 613 mitzvot Fruit Growers Express $ale of the Century Ebola I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Food irradiation Covent Garden Certified Nursing Assistant Universal Product Code Charles Peace Fasting Playoff Food science Stock car (rail) Danville, California Weebl and Bob Pineapple Ethylene Hygiene Fenway Park Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Air conditioning Tetra Pak

huge fire ante pile i need to get rid of a massive fire ant pile beside my backdoor i am on a budget and i also have two small children so i want to do it naturally without poisons anything homemade any suggestions there are no 'homemade' fire ant killers if you pour hot salty bleach water on the mound it will simply relocate and you will think you killed the first mound but more ants have moved in the problem is that the queen may be as far as ten feet down in the ground you kill the ones on the surface and the workers simply open a new tunnel to the surface several feet away best to use amdro fire ant killer logic tells me you aren't going to allow your children to get in the fire ant mound anyway so using a chemical that will actually kill the pests is the thing to do hope this helps  Dishwasher Menstrual cup Fire extinguisher Washing machine Dishwashing Irrigation Water purification Thermal power station Hydroponics Sodium hypochlorite Pottery E-6 process Car washing techniques Sento Halitosis Cheese Hydrogen peroxide Fire fighting Hard water Vinegar Car wash Riot control agent Ammonia Hydrochloric acid Electrophysiology Dam Fountain Laundry detergent Textile manufacturing Herbicide Manicure Dundas Square Soap Energy development Detergent Fecal incontinence Organic peroxide Autonomous building Rebreather Sugar beet Acid Osmosis Jet engine Flue gas desulfurization Sauna Brewery Nitroglycerin Soil pH Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Protein sequencing Hydrogen Chromatography Disinfection Cookware and bakeware Oscilloscope Onsen Battery (electricity) Ozone Staining (biology) Toilet paper Casting Hard disk Weed control Flour Gilding Portland cement Newcomen steam engine Wound Champagne (beverage) Drawing Sodium percarbonate Decompression sickness Water (molecule) Lignin Pebble bed reactor Sterling silver Carbon dioxide Two-stroke cycle Reverse osmosis Industrial wastewater treatment Sulfuric acid Hydrogen economy Pepper spray Concentration Methanol Soap bubble Breastfeeding Extreme Programming Contact lens Atmospheric pressure Mattress Phase (matter) Weathering Wood pulp Fossil fuel power plant Turbocharger Siegfried Line Callus Cavitation

growing cotton plants i got cotton seeds and planted them and they seem to be growing but now the leaves are some what turning brown and looking like they are dying and it is a very small plant what should i do to keep it healthy is it bad to have it inside the house instead of outside cotton grows best in subtropical to tropical climates so it needs to be kept in bright light and warm temperatures if you can't get full sun for your cotton inside take the pots outside during the day at least cotton also needs soil that is moist yet well drained such as think of a damp texture like a wrung out sponge rather than wet mud or clay you will need to water it frequently as often as every day if it's outside in a pot cotton also needs lots of food so you will need to fertilize it frequently try a regular plant food and feed it weekly one possible reason you might have the problems you're describing is disease or insect infestation mites are a problem with many houseplants if this is the case and your plant is very damaged you may need to replant but you can certainly try insecticidal soap or manually removing the mites try looking up these sites http www plantcultures org plants cotton grow it html http www evergreengardenworks com mites htm http www gardensalive com article asp ai bhcd  Computer University of North Carolina at Charlotte Suburbs of Johannesburg Tariff Education in Portugal CPU design Hydrogen economy Economy of the United States White flight Wachovia Entropy Asian financial crisis Acorn Computers Plastic Education Novel NeXT Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bank of America Data General Wall Street Illegal drug trade Software engineering Culture of the United States Freeters Suburb Moorpark, California Inflation Land use forecasting Economics Modem Microeconomics Mach kernel Wal-Mart Health insurance Arbitrage Surveillance U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Trade union Arguments for and against drug prohibition Labour economics York County, South Carolina The Ashlee Simpson Show CPU cache Education in the United States New Deal Insurance Interstate Highway Leicester City Centre Economy of Nigeria Nuclear reactor MapleStory Drag racing Insider trading Alcohol fuel Economy of Europe Grand Forks, North Dakota Automobile Surplus value Supply and demand Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Filling station Capital accumulation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Atari 8-bit family The O.C. $ale of the Century EastEnders Atari ST Charlotte, North Carolina Sport utility vehicle USB flash drive Management Hybrid vehicle Urban sprawl The Apprentice 2 Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Education reform Criticisms of socialism Apple Newton Petroleum Anarchism and society Ernie Irvan Octopus card Autonomous building Strategic management Unemployment Charter school 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Solar power Economic growth Future energy development Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Controversies in autism RISC Marie Antoinette Economic inequality Winston-Salem, North Carolina

how much does it cost to have a septic system put in my wife and i are trying to see how much it is going to be before we order a set of house plans so we know about how much we can afford also we are seeing about buying a lot and wanted to know if the lot is priced at how much should we expect to pay for it we are only years old and have never bought a lot before we did buy a house years ago paid no closing costs or anything like that so i am asuming a lot is going to be the same way i am in the construction business and all of my home builders told me to expect to pay anywhere from a sq ft to a sq ft depending on appliances and fixtures things of that nature figuring in at a sq ft is what we are hoping to build it for and then if the costs rise higher than that we just wait on getting a pool and dip into those funds the lot has water electric and phone at the street does all of what i am saying sound do able my experience has been that a system would cost about plus permits of course your mileage may vary substantially due to location drainage local ordinance actual size of the tank actual lot size etc also if you are required to construct a sand trap as part of the system that may cost additional funds as well it seems like most localities are now making that a requirement but you may find different where you are located  Tomato Agriculture Cucumber Vegetarianism Cuisine of Singapore Pickling Flowering plant Melon Sugarcane Basil Fruit Roman eating and drinking Maize Pollination Coffea arabica Vanilla Cuisine of Malaysia Plant Jam Watermelon Garden Strawberry Pruning fruit trees Common bean Renewable energy Photosynthesis Weed control Japanese cuisine Perfume Loganberry Peanut Vicia faba Alcohol fuel Agriculture in Australia Environmental concerns with electricity generation Tree Cuisine of Brazil Hamster Coffea Salad Chayote Auxin Equine conformation Sugar Ginkgo Veganism Cajun cuisine Thermal depolymerization Breakfast Apricot Kiwifruit Carnivorous plant Luther Burbank Black pepper Soup Vegetative reproduction Peruvian cuisine Soybean Date Palm Future energy development Plant stem Soil life Cuisine of the Southern United States Comfrey Jewish cuisine Banana Energy development Waste management Organic farming Coriander Sewage treatment Fungus Fusion power Biofuel Bean Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Market gardening Strawberry Raspberry Deforestation Seed Agriculture in Hong Kong Hot dog Bukidnon Vitamin C Green Revolution Beetle Biological dispersal Cereal Refrigerator car Quince Bamboo Power station Biological pest control Cuisine of Denmark Nuclear power plant Citrus Indiana

help my room is burning hot how can i cool it down heya my room is currently degrees fahrenheit even though it s around midnight and i'm pretty much dying the rest of my house is around degrees but even with my bedroom door open and hearing my idiot father's tv while he snores and the window open it doesn't cool down i have one of those evaporative coolers but somehow it actually makes my room feel hotter i guessed that was because it increased the humidity since it uses water to cool the room and bought a dehumidifier to try to counter act the humidity while still getting the cooling this didn't work either my room is a ' x ' heat box during the day and at night i have expensive gas insulated windows with blinds and curtains to keep the heat out i also have a ceiling fan two mini desk fans and a medium table fan plus the aforementioned cooler and dehumidifier please help me cool my room off i think i m starting to boil thank you you have a lot of heat sources in your room evepourative coolers are not effective in small rooms they do cool somewhat but increase the humidity which offsets any cooling dehumidifiers actually cause heat gain raises temperature air out is hotter than air going in the fans are producing heat possible solution turn off the ceiling fan dehumidifier and evapourative cooler only open your bedroom door a crack do not know the type of window but if it slides up to open sash window or opens out at the bottom awning window open it about to inches turn the small desk fans around to blow air out the open window this should draw air into your room from the rest of the house if the small fans are powerful enough to create a slight vacuum in your room an alternative to the two small fans is to purchase a window fan best are the ones with fans in the unit they fit in the opening created by open up the window there are controls on the unit one for each fan you can have both fans blowing the air out or have one blow air out and the other blow air in hope this helps good luck and pleasent dreams  Pottery Chinese export porcelain Transformer Wood Cookware and bakeware Glass Porcelain Screw Korean pottery Weight training Mattress Knife Bicycle frame Glaze Strap-on dildo Rope Welding Timpani Diamond Korean tea ceremony Equine conformation Soap bubble Brewery Aluminium Japanese pottery Golden Plates Rococo Upholstery Casting Rise of Nations Piano Clarinet Gas metal arc welding Campfire Tank classification Chopsticks Amateur telescope making Raku Gilding Dental caries Airsoft Hair Antenna (radio) Houseplant Ethernet Cuisine of Denmark Internal ballistics Mithril Reading spark plugs for racing Kitchen Bokken Smoking pipe Geology of the Moon Porcelain crab Seismic retrofit Mineral M16 (rifle) Earthquake MP3 Wind turbine Heavy metal music Pearl USS Tunny (SS-282) Earring Anchor Spark plug Computer and video game genres Plastic Snowboard Guitar Kakiemon Tank GunZ The Duel Toilet humour Japanese cuisine Textile manufacturing Synchrotron Solar sail Teapot Armour Leaf M4 Sherman Reflecting telescope Dim sum Oscilloscope Corrosion Poker jargon Diamond cut Glossary of climbing terms Chinese art Violin Electrical wiring Movie projector Japanese tea ceremony Tap dance Climbing equipment Pizza Guqin Metallica

how do i get my petunias to not die every year my potted petunias die after about weeks i water them and make sure they have the right amount of everything but they just die none of my other plants r dying so why do they always die i live in texas and have had petunias survive for years without dying out we had a few very mild winters when they started looking shabby i cut them back to the newest set of leaves on each stem i did this in the evening after having watered good early in the day it was quite interesting to see how they survived each season although they were pretty shabby looking and had become more of an experiment than anything else when they finally died out for good if your petunias are in pots you might want to move them to a place where they are only getting the early morning sun late afternoon sun will burn them up pretty quick petunias are very easy to grow from seed you might get more and longer enjoyment out of the flowers if you planted the seeds yourself and witnessed the first blooms  Satay Ford Crown Victoria Zip drive Barbecue University of S__o Paulo Grilling Hot dog Grill Japanese cuisine Principia Discordia ZIP Code In-N-Out Burger Goatse.cx Tom Prichard Ford Cortina Dodge Charger Bacon Cuisine of Malaysia Dodge Challenger Grilled cheese sandwich S__rv__gur Inverted Jenny Aperture grille Gzip Irish breakfast Kebab Jeep CJ Chipotle Mexican Grill ZIP (file format) Chrysler 300 letter series Arepa Tour de France Buick Century The Land (Disney) Volkswagen Golf Pp-wave spacetime San Marino, California Yellow Pages Mena Suvari Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Yellow Toyota Cressida Roe Door MRE Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) MOS Technology 6502 EMD F7 Barsoom series The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) GNU Hurd Lothar von Trotha Wile E.

what is the best option for swimming pool safety swimming pool covers nets or fences it really is best to use several layers of protection locking gates fences covers pool alarms are all important but it's best to have a backup in case one fails gates not latching power failures kids being able to climb fences etc most places these days call for fencing around the pool anyway so i would probably go with the one that would stop a child or pets from getting into the pool altogether a safety cover fences can be climbed over and alarms can fail and they dont go off until something has already happened but a properly installed safety cover will be able to stop anything from going into the pool at all they're probably the most expensive and the most time consuming to take on and off but that's what i'd recommend if you're going for the most peace of mind  Floristry Charlotte, North Carolina Bulk vending Target Corporation Sears Holdings Corporation Cooperative Extreme Programming Shopping mall Wal-Mart Chinatowns in North America Microeconomics Indianapolis, Indiana Flower Supermarket Urban sprawl Retailer W.

is it ok to dispose of my oil down the rainwater drain i've got about litres of waste car oil to dump and i imagine the easiest method is to tip it down the drain and allow it to break down naturally i was thinking of tipping some sand down afterwards to aid with 'soaking it up' failing that i would have to dispose of it on the edge of the local playing fields as there is a secluded area which it wouldn't pose a hazard no take it to your local council's rubbish tip they will dispose of it all of your suggestions will poison the local environment big style  Swimming pool Mixed martial arts Garth Brooks Pikmin Fountain Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Marshall Mathers LP Topps Life insurance Ocean's Twelve Plame affair timeline Tag Full Metal Panic?

how can i end once for all with ants invation are years now we're living with these ants they're small brown and millions of them when i find a nest i kill them with anything i have on hand they has ruined my vhs recorder a portable dvd and tons of video cassettes seems that they are decided to end with my film making dream please heeeeelp i dont want to use hazard chemicals if anyone have a good advice to end this problem all suggestions are welcome i've had those ants a few times over the years it always seems no matter how clean you keep your kitchen or elsewhere they still seem to come but i've been able to safely get rid of them for years at a time by doing the following old time remedy get a cheap bottle of boric acid powder a very mild and safe form of ant control you can get at places like home depot and lowes in the pest control section next to the gardening supplies also get a small container of mint jelly from the grocery store i found it at albertsons grocery store mix two tablespoons boric acid powder per ounces of mint apple jelly take a thin piece of cardboard or a doubled over piece of paper and tape it firmly against part of the surface such as a counter directly over the pathway the ants are using and make thin rows of the boric acid jelly solution on it with enough space between the rows for the ants to get between so that as many of the ants have access to the edges of the jelly as possible some will get stuck in the jelly but many will take bits of this stuff back to their nest and feed it to the rest of the colony and queen you may have to replace the paper or cardboard with fresh jelly daily for or days and then they'll be gone for good by the way you may actually see more ants in the first hours after you first put the boric acid jelly out but then it tapers down quickly during the nd day because they begin dying as they take the stuff back to their colony the way the stuff works is that it dehydrates them from the inside out  Basement Refrigerator Kitchen Wood fuel Solar power Vacuum tube Insulation Thermal power station Chevrolet Corvair Torpedo Thermostat Furnace Volleyball Autonomous building HVAC Apollo 13 Fireplace Hot air balloon Dundas Square Fan (implement) Water heater Energy Fossil fuel power plant Bus models used in New York City Transit Marine aquarium Biofuel Diesel engine Nuclear weapon design Bi-metal Carbon monoxide Air pollution Japanese toilet Lighting Carbon monoxide poisoning Passive solar Seismic retrofit Fire fighting Solar panel Ventilation Windows 2000 Silicon Cold cathode Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Aquarium Fireplace poker Mars Exploration Rover Swimming pool Town gas Ideal gas Chimney Rathfarnham 1973 oil crisis Polyethylene terephthalate Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Transistor Printed circuit board Derivation of the partition function Door The Time Machine Explosive material Fire Branch Davidian Debye model Large numbers Toast Chatsworth House Thermodynamic equilibrium Pressure Wilton House Mozilla Firefox Optical fiber Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Templeogue Welding Incandescent light bulb Ammonia Gas core reactor rocket STS-62 Cold fusion Energy development Mazda 323 Oscilloscope Renewable energy Natural gas Wall Street Opportunity rover BMW E23 Radon Rail terminology Breathing gas Smoking ban Animal Crossing Samovar Six Flags Over Texas Process control Scuba set Firefighter Thermocouple

is it all right to cut the stalks on hosta plants when the flowers are done you can cut them off at any point and time including when they are flowering just watch out for the bees it will not hurt the plant at all i do this all the time with mine you can cut them off at any level you want to flowers are not really necessary on them as they grow new plants by spreading out their roots if you are wondering about splitting the plants you can also do that at any point and time just be forwarned that the newly split hostas that you are going to plant elsewhere will look absolutely crappy at this time of year after you plant them they will look like they are gonna die they more than likely won't no worries they will look beautiful next year though  Outsourcing Breathing gas Hydrogen economy Charles Goodyear Fred A.

why do some states use gas over electric stoves i used to live in seattle every stove i ever had was electric until i moved to the east coast i really got used to gas and liked cooking with gas stoves very much now i have moved to va where my apartment has electric why such a change i tend to see more gas stoves in the midwest or east coast and electric in the west is that an overall feeling why do you think this is or am i just too bored at work overanalyzing i think a lot of it has to do with when gas electricity became available in a particular area here electricity was kind of late getting to individual homes as compared to more urban areas consequently most of our parents grandparents were brought up in houses which used either wood or coal stoves for heating cooking you tend to stick with what you know grew up with and gas is the most like the wood coal stoves as it cooks with a flame on the other hand i think as far as your rental that many landlords install electric stoves because it may be a cheaper option as far as the appliance itself and in installation there is a little less danger of fire vs gas stoves especially with someone who is inexperienced in using gas stoves some people are uncomfortable cooking with gas stoves personally i love my gas stove  Refrigerator Sento Ice cream Dundas Square The Brady Bunch Changeroom McMansion Courtyard Audi A2 Swimming The Time Machine Car handling Whitton, London Backdoor Kitchen White House The Smoking Room Rum Car body style Enlightenment (Doctor Who) Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Saki Planet of the Daleks Invader Zim St. Elmo's Fire (film) Blankets (graphic novel) Stairway Neopets Autonomous building Freezer Poker jargon Erectile dysfunction Electroshock gun Colony in Space Abbey Cyberspace Utility Food storage The Death Gate Cycle Bong Items in the Metroid series Behavioral finance UK telephone numbering plan Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Grace Cossington Smith Easthampton, Massachusetts Thermal power station Jam (TV series) Shaggy dog story Fulham F.C.

what can you tell me about kinetico water treatment systems for your home i'm thinking of getting a home water softener and am having trouble deciding between the one's they sell at sears culligan or kinetico when my dad built his house he installed a water softener system he had to do many repairs to it before it got old he finally ripped it out and installed a kinetico water softener system he never had a problem since then and that was years ago or so it does a fantastic job i have replaced the salt in it a few times it's very easy i think you just have to be sure not to let the barrel that holds the salt go empty of salt kinetico systems do not have any electrical parts therefore they don't break down they are the only ones without electrical parts instead they use the kinetic energy of water to keep the flow going it's a great system that will never break down go with the kinetico it's essentially a big plastic barrel with a lid that has water lines running to it all you have to do is pop the lid and add the salt once a month or so it holds about big bags of salt  Vinegar Apple Dishwasher Cider Wine Brandy German cuisine Beer Cuisine of the Philippines Dandruff Collodion process Roman eating and drinking Chinese cuisine Hamster Acetic acid Alcoholic beverage Cuisine of Austria Drosophila Malus Glass Jewish cuisine Apple pie Potato Cuisine of Denmark Fish and chips Breakfast French cuisine Champagne (beverage) Bong Dishwashing Cashew Sauce Martini cocktail Cheese Haggis Johnny Appleseed Sushi Tofu Peruvian cuisine Agar plate Ice cream Polish cuisine Fanta The Cider House Rules Microbiology Japanese cuisine Soul food Cookware and bakeware Hair conditioner Lemon Korean cuisine Fenway Park Lead Toilet humour Normandy Genericized trademark Herefordshire Cuisine of the Southern United States Distillation Barbecue Cuisine of Argentina Kosher foods Mead Fondue Food preservation Culture of Jersey Pie Customs and etiquette of Japan Ketchup Genital wart Laptop Cuisine of Brazil Soup Curry Stir frying Pickling Potato chips Norouz Jersey Timeline of alternative rock Volume Water Molotov cocktail Chile pepper Culinary mustard Hard disk Sunburn Gelatin Withnail and I Fruit Dim sum Almond Fecal incontinence Menstrual cup Marbles Liquid crystal display Cantonese cuisine Titan (moon) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gooseberry

question about keys and locks can you get a key to open locks sorry if this is a stupid question but i know absolutely nothing about keys and locks recently moved into a flat and we each have one normal sized key which opens the main front door into the building which contains flats and also the front door into our flat we were worried that might mean that all the tenants of the building must have the same key which opens the main door and all the doors to the flats but my friend told me when she was in university halls she had a larger than normal key which opened the door to her building with ppl as well as her room but that only her key could open the door to her room so is it possible that my key opens this main door and only the door of my flat we don't know the neighbours well enough to ask them about this havent really heard seen them about and i don't wanna just go up and try sticking my key in their door yes it is everyone would have like a 'skeleton key' which would open the main door and then that same key would only work for one other door yours  Japanese toilet Towel Paper Menstrual cup Married... with Children Menstrual cycle Toilet paper Fecal incontinence Bathroom Paper towel Durian Pomegranate RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diaper Washing machine Blood Simple E-6 process Toilet Hand washing Organic peroxide Sento Relative clause Brush Hazing Tattoo Campbell, California The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Bidet Sauna Hamster Drainage Foodborne illness Textile manufacturing Banjo-Kazooie Wood pulp Washroom Saw (film) Gilding Ragging The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence Palindrome Dishwasher Euphemism Ron Weasley Ayyavazhi mythology Genericized trademark Coffea Dymaxion house Feet washing Ragtime Flags of the Confederate States of America Linen Avocado Bloody Stupid Johnson Upholstery Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dormitory Weaving Car washing techniques Coral Tampon Kitchen Manicure RuneScape Mini-Games Pervertible Baptism The Invisibles Today I am A Clown Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Laci Peterson Twinworld Rainforest The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening characters Megabat Midway College House Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Salah Karma in Hinduism Hanscom Air Force Base Collecting fossils Hindenburg disaster Towel Day Babe Ruth Toad the Wet Sprocket Johnny Appleseed Linseed oil Seven and the Ragged Tiger Ron and Fez Hydrogen peroxide Douglas Adams Sermon on the Mount Common cold Coriander Montclair State University Villains in Power Rangers: Wild Force Petrified Forest National Park

how can i squirrel proof my existing bird feeders i have two bird feeders that suction onto the windows of my second floor apartment recently at least one squirrel has discovered them i saw one climbing up the side of the house house has wood not vinyl siding to get at the feeders and it proceeded to knock them to the ground i didn't think squirrels could ever get to the feeders what can i do well that is the question of the century d squirrels are just too clever in finding a way in i don't think it's possible my advice is to use foods that squirrels might simply consider unworthy of such herculean efforts in my yard a lot of safflower seed is provided to the great satisfaction of cardinals chickadees titmice and other species that winter in the area but to less favorable reviews from the local squirrel population niger thistle is a food of choice for the local goldfinches and others of their kind while the squirrels disdain it completely suet cakes left out for the nuthatches and woodpeckers are rarely molested by my squirrels although what the crows do to these is another matter on the large platform that is especially intended for mourning doves and house finches a mixture of white millet seed and others is served which seems to raise little interest from the squirrels in the neighborhood  Garbage truck Dustbin Dumpster diving Landfill Jackass: The Movie Debris Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Equine conformation Textile manufacturing Trash of the Titans Wood fuel Wood Shoe Christmas tree Airbag Animal Crossing Glossary of climbing terms Back to the Future Illegal drug trade Skinny Dip The Contender (television series) Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling match types Canasta Biff Tannen The Star Wars Holiday Special Stephen King Rigging Truck Knots Landing Hay Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City EastEnders Archery Kitesurfing Skateboard Collyer brothers Happy Tree Friends White trash USS West Virginia (BB-48) Shotgun Piccolo Junior Saga Deforestation Waste Snow removal Hubert H.
