how do most year old girls in america act these days in your opinion a lot of year olds think they're mature when they're really not in dances they're almost always dancing inappropriatly and a lot of teens swear constantly some don't care about school and get pregnant at a young age which i am totally against while others actually act their age many of them of those who act that way think that not swearing and not behaving like monkeys is immature when it's really the other way around i'm not saying that everyone is like that but i know a lot of people who are there are a lot of year olds however who act completely mature and don't think that inappropriate and immature jokes are funny they laugh at other people's immaturity and focus on more important things like grades and what college they're going to  Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Statutory rape Jennifer Lopez EastEnders Squidward Tentacles Adolescence Saved by the Bell Humour Pitaten Marilyn Monroe Family Guy Bart chalkboard gags Newbie George Burns The Catcher in the Rye Theory of conduct Dilbert Aqua Teen Hunger Force T.A.T.u.

is it possible that one of my boy cousins got a girl cousin pregnant i have like a million cousins and one just got pregnant at that year i had visited all of them and on of my boy cousins locked himself in a closet with the other cousin they were there for like a few minutes he also talks about sex all the time these cousins are the only ones that aren't christians in the entire family now a few more are turning atheist and getting pregnant because of his big mouth and retarded ideas like oral sex is the only way to keep your virginity ughh lol we aren't rednecks not even close you made me laugh of course it's possible but that baby will most likely have problems if its parents are cousins i would be careful to suggest that people who become atheist just start getting pregnant right away like their morals go down the tubes or something what people in your extended family want to believe in is their own thing not yours if you really think your cousin got your cousin pregnant you need to seriously think about what to do with this information tell the whole family maybe just discuss it with your parents basically it could have happened but it sounds like you don't know everything about the situation so i'd just let sleeping dogs lie  Friends EastEnders Abortion debate Sex and the City Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Mary, the mother of Jesus George Costanza Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Something Positive About a Boy Oral sex Marriage Ron and Fez Child sexuality Code: Lyoko Hearing impairment My Family (television) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eric Cartman The Virgin Suicides Prenatal diagnosis Drawn Together Sexual intercourse Great Teacher Onizuka Atheism Family Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Vernon Schillinger The Young Ones (TV series) Sharon Tate Theodicy Care Bears Recurring South Park characters 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Boston Public Urinary incontinence Mojave people Infantilism Human sexual behavior Adoption Mario The nature of God in Western theology Trainspotting (novel) Teenage pregnancy AFI 100 Years series Mental retardation The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Avenue Q Shawn Michaels Madonna (entertainer) American Psycho The Inside Sex education The Catcher in the Rye The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Birth control Sexual orientation Milton H.

were you a bed wetter if so at what age did you stop my son is and wets the bed quite often is this something he'll grow out of i am going to discuss it w his doctor on wednesday as he has a physical the last time he prescribed him pills that seemed to work continued to work there after until recently will he have this problem for a long time to come missthang do you have kids have you seen how common it is for kids to wet their beds if you want to tell me my child is stranger than the average teenager just because he soils his sheets every now and then than you can take your crap else where i asked the question obviously to get some advise not to read a stupid assumption such as yours you are the strange one on top of being an idiot w your reply thanks for nothing p s you're a jerk i was on a nightly basis until i was but unfortunately continued to have occasional accidents for a long time afterward this happens to a lot more people than you would think usually it's just a case of the bladder not developing quickly enough to keep up with the rest of the body and will go away with time as his body catches up with itself although it could be a very frustrating couple of months or years if you simply wait for that to happen at his body is growing and changing rapidly in many ways and if his bladder hasn't kept up with the rest of his body's growth spurt bedwetting could be a very common symptom this would also explain why the pills might have stopped working even though they worked previously although teens with this problem will usually grow out of it it's unfortunately not a certainty perhaps to of those who bedwet into their early teens will still wet the bed at least occasionally as adults there's no real way to know for sure whether this could happen for your son based on the odds it probably won't perhaps if you get a referral to a urologist they could do tests to check out your son's bladder development and such things and let you know how big a deficit there is for him to grow out of though teens' bodies do grow rapidly and there's no foolproof way of predicting when or if it will happen if you want to try to treat the problem more aggressively the best option according to medical research to this point is to use one of those alarms that senses the first instant of urine hitting the mattress and wakes him up at that point so that over time he will learn to feel it when he needs to urinate at night and wake up and use the bathroom these do not work overnight they usually take several weeks or months of constant use before his body will start to make the adjustment but if he ultimately stops wetting the bed it would be well worth a little investment of time and lost sleep these alarms can be bought online for less than at http www bedwettingstore com good luck to both you and your son i know this is a very difficult and frustrating problem but keep trying the odds are good at least that he will grow out of it in time  Prostate cancer Bedwetting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kimberly-Clark Corporation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Traumatic brain injury Mattress Shaggy dog story Sleep Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Child sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Medicine Multiple sclerosis Insomnia Chronic fatigue syndrome Clinical depression Autism Ben Johnson (athlete) Guinea pig Narcolepsy Craps Roswell UFO incident Daylight saving time Sin City Infantilism Jam (TV series) Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding The Shining (film) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep apnea Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cancer Poker jargon Hyperinflation Growth hormone treatment Pregnancy Social rule Diaper Extreme Programming Pitaten Lucid dreaming Dream Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Menstrual cycle Human height Sharon Tate The Venture Bros.

i am planning a teen year old birthday party and i need some ideas asap about friends fairly large house we are on a budget it has to be a sleepover throw an indoor camping party set up tents and sleeping bags inside the house and let the kids make microwave s'mores assemble in this order graham cracker chocolate bar marshmallow graham cracker microwave for about seconds on a microwaveable dish tell scary but not too scary stories and put fake bugs in their sleeping bags boys love that says singer mom to two boys have a glam girl party set up the living room like a salon where the girls can give each other pedicures manicures and hair styling to ensure safety stick with nail filing nail polish braiding brushing and hair ornaments no hair cutting allowed you can also rent or even find in your closet some dress up clothes for the girls to wear wigs and glasses can be a hoot too take plenty of pictures to distribute after the party or to put in a scrapbook as a keepsake if you re looking for supplies check out the slumber party at birthday in a box get crafty craft projects are a great way to fill time and they also give guests something to take home try these easy ideas autographed pillowcases give each guest a white pillowcase and have everyone sign or draw pictures on them using fabric markers or paints be sure to insert a piece of cardboard into each case so the markers paint don't bleed through friendship books have guests make mini scrapbooks with pages crafted from fun questions or projects things like draw your favorite outfit what's your favorite food or on my best day i would plus for over craft activities visit kaboose crafts have a sorta sleepover party the perfect solution for little ones too young to stay all night guests arrive in pajamas with their pillows at dinnertime but leave by p m make ice cream sundaes play games and tell stories the best part the kids are gone early enough so that you get a full night's sleep says singer note that even if you decide to do the full night it s a good idea to keep it short get details in our sleepover party tips make it a movie night have the kids make a box office and concession stand out of cardboard boxes then give them monopoly money to buy tickets and snacks set up lawn chairs or beanbag chairs where the kids can watch movies but none that are too scary some good bets old classics the love bug swiss family robinson the absent minded professor the shaggy dog the apple dumpling gang new classics sky high cheaper by the dozen holes hoodwinked chicken little the incredibles the chronicles of narnia harry potter and the sorcerer's stone chamber of secrets prisoner of azkaban just for girls high school musical the princess diaries i and ii raise your voice ice princess the lizzie maguire movie ella enchanted just for boys star wars clone wars vols and justice league unlimited saving the world batman the animated series the iron giant bionicle web of shadows play some old fashioned games try these ideas from laurie wrigley vice president of www birthdayinabox com and mother of three children or as she puts it hostess of more than sleepovers name that tune an adult or child plays popular songs on a cd player the first person to guess the title of the song after it starts gets a small prize or the person who guesses the most songs correctly gets a bigger prize at the end of the game anyone who also guesses the artist gets an extra point telephone everyone sits in a circle the host starts by thinking up a goofy line such as purple cows sit in the pasture eating grass and making grape flavored milk he she whispers this line in the ear of the person sitting to their left until it's gone around the whole circle ending with the last person saying what they think they heard ghost in the graveyard played outside after it gets dark if it's a safe neighborhood one person is the ghost and stands at home base she he counts out loud one o'clock two o'clock etc up to o'clock while everyone else runs and hides the ghost then looks for people and if he she spots someone that person can try and run back to home base and be safe from being tagged whoever spots the ghost coming can yell ghost in the graveyard run run run to warn others if the ghost tags someone while he she is running back to home base then that person becomes the ghost scavenger hunts for an inside hunt create a list of famous people or clever but not too clever current events references and have guests try to find them in a stack of magazines or newspapers for an outside hunt send kids looking for things found in nature such as a leaf or flower or stir their creativity by having them find items that begin with s or are made out of wood rise and shine breakfast doesn't have to be complicated to be fun a few ideas from laurie wrigley to get kids up and at 'em funny face bagels cut bagels in half and toast them if desired slather cream cheese or peanut butter accounting for peanut allergies on the bagels for a base then let guests make funny faces using shredded cheese for hair sliced sausage links for eyes strawberry jelly for a mouth and dried cherries for noses smiley face pancakes use canned whipped cream chocolate chips chocolate syrup blueberries halved strawberries diced bananas dried fruit or other edibles to make eyes a nose mouth hair etc on the pancakes get creative restaurant style breakfast let the kids decide who will help cook wait tables and clean up then have them create an actual menu using standard breakfast foods such as pancakes eggs bacon sausage bagels etc the waiters waitresses can take everyone's orders and pass them on to the chefs wearing chef's hats and aprons of course who will assist mom and or dad in the cooking waffle bar set up a waffle bar with a selection of syrups and toppings such as cherries whipped cream strawberries chocolate chips nuts etc let everyone make their own waffles have fun with it  Tofu Wu-Tang Clan

why does everyone believe that teen dads are not responsible i mean i'm sixteen and i have a four month old son everyone i've told is always like you're too young or the first thing that they ask is if i ever spend time with him i don't live with him but i spend as much time as i can with him but i have a job and send money to the mother i read through the other answers before i started this just to remind some of them just because a condom is used does not mean that you still can't get pregnant no birth control is effective i admire you for making the decision to help take care of your baby it is true that most teen dads are not responsible enough for that i've known some that couldn't properly take care of a tank of fish just keep in mind that you will always get some smart mouth saying something stupid by staying in your babies life and being a caring parent shows that you are older then your years age is just a number good luck  One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Abortion debate Social rule Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Condom Kate Vaiden Kurt Cobain Rocko's Modern Life Alois Hitler Childbirth Radio Yerevan About a Boy I Am Sam Joke Kodocha Hollyoaks Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Birth control Phoebe Halliwell The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pregnancy Breastfeeding The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Married... with Children Days of our Lives Charmed Teenage pregnancy Infantilism Peter Griffin Saved by the Bell Jon Secada Wonderland (McFly album) Identity Crisis (comics) Pitaten Everwood The Catcher in the Rye Sex education Shaggy dog story Simone Weil Great Depression Father's Day (Doctor Who) Trouble (comic) Emperor Xuan of Han Good Times Earth Girl Arjuna History of As the World Turns (2000-present) The Fairly OddParents The Amber Spyglass Paradox Fertility awareness Kender Wolfrider Game show Suspicion (film) Lorelai Gilmore Adoption American Dad!

im and i want birth control how do i tell my mom q has been asked but i haven't see any good answers alright as i said im so i cant go to plannedparenthood because you have to be atleast without parent notification i've tried and well i just turned in may so yeah i want that protection now and not when im almost and pregnate anyway i cant tell my mom its for cramps because i've mentioned to her that one of my friends got bc for cramps and she kind of though oh well now you have another slut friend then huh maybe not those exact words but you get the picture anyway she also knows i get barely any cramps i mean maybe once a year they get really bad but other than that i get none at all she told me a while ago that when i wanted to talk to her about this stuff then i just should then she'd break it to my dad in a way that wouldn't get my ass kicked but i dont want my dad to know and i know she cant keep a secret oh and im afraid if i even do ask she will expect me to have already had sex which i have once and she wont let me ever see my bf okay here's the thing i've had my period since i was yrs old so my mom know's my cycle haha so i cant make an excuse with that the asprin guy you are retarded its kind of a sore subject with my mom because my oldest sister has two kids now and she's oldest is and my mom still has to support her even though she's engaged to a huge idiot by the way so if i start talking about bc then she'll never let me see my bf again and i dont want that to happen i really love him and i trust him with absolutly everything i have also my mom wont really like it because my bf is almost and i am even though both my parents like him i know that they'll hate him if i ask so please help many of you have been somewhat helpful already thanx so much the best birth control for any unmarried girl or woman is to take one aspirin put it between your knees and hold it firmly in place my wife was a virgin almost years old until our wedding night when we first engaged in the act of marriage that was the most precious gift she ever gave me a gift a female can give only once for the past years neither of us has had sexual relations with anyone else dear sweet stupid and naive kciwtsob the best thing and our heavenly father's plan btw is celibacy until marriage and monogamy after marriage you can call me names all you want i only have a bachelor's degree in psychology but this information and advice is the absolute truth so i guess that means you also consider our creator god to be retarded too oh yes just one more bit of info from a retarded person depending where one lives in the united states when one of the persons involved is or older and the other one is a minor the adult might be in violation of the law against statutory rape statutory rape is the crime of sex with a minor under the age of consent aoc the age at which individuals are considered competent to give consent to sexual conduct statutory rape differs from other types of rape in that overt force or threat need not be present by law statute any such sexual activity is assumed to be coercive since the minor is considered by law to be incapable of giving consent to the acts from wikipedia  Statutory rape Marriage Kyle Broflovski Rape Pedophilia Human sexual behavior Recurring South Park characters Friends Theory of conduct Same-sex marriage Eric Cartman Consensual crime Religion and sexuality Child sexual abuse Birth control Abortion debate Laura Schlessinger Sexual abuse EastEnders Sexual abstinence Divorce Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Zoophilia Age disparity in sexual relationships Contract One Tree Hill (TV series) Incest Sexual orientation Lawrence v.

what's your opinion about this issue do you dislike gays i don't mean to sounds offensive but i do not like people who don't like them i believe people can love who they love yes it does say in the bible man and woman but would god like us hating each other for our sexuality how would you like it if you were gay and people hated you for who you liked i don't understand how someone could hate someone for that reason it confuses me i have an older brother who is gay it makes no difference between our realationship in fact in probably makes it stronger knowing that there are no secrets between us what is your opinion hating someone for the sexuality is like hating someone for the color of there skin or the gender or for heaven sake the color of there hair i think gays are just people just people who have sex just people who love their significant others just people who talk eat live breathe just people when it comes down to it they are no different than straight people really i wouldnt even mind if one of my kids turned out to be gay sure less grandkids but id be happier knowing they werent afraid to come out to me i utterly despise people who hate gays ill be friends with them but i think their views are stupid especially if they oppose racism what is the difference between someone who hates a certain race and someone who hates those of a certain sexuality absolutely nothing and the people who think its a sin and are really religious are huge hypocrites everyone has committed sins what gives them the right to condemn someone else for 'committing a sin' put yourself in someone elses shoes what if everyone hated straight people pretty sure you would be mad about discrimination based on sexuality something that makes me really sad is that homosexuality used to be classified as a mental illness in the dsm and the only mental illnesses that go in there are ones that are potentially harmful to the sufferer themself or others yea thats my two cents on the whole thing dont really care if i get thumbs down  Sexual orientation Gay Homophobia Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Gay rights Human sexual behavior Paraphilia Laura Schlessinger Religion and sexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality Reparative therapy Human Anglican views of homosexuality Transsexuality Political correctness Ex-gay Recurring South Park characters Ten Commandments Capital punishment Same-sex marriage Zoophilia Original sin Infantilism Homosexuality and transgender Homosexuality in China Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Michael Savage (commentator) 613 mitzvot Orson Scott Card History of sex Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Church of Christ Pedophilia Bisexuality Domestic violence LaVeyan Satanism South Park Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Outing Homosexuality and Islam Summa Theologiae The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Anti-gay slogan Arthur Schopenhauer Polyamory Jon Secada Evil Masturbation Fred Phelps Criticisms of Christianity Abortion debate History of Christianity and homosexuality Sin Sodom and Gomorrah John Howard Yoder Racism Book of Isaiah Eastern Orthodox Church Merit North American Man/Boy Love Association Equal Protection Clause Seventh-day Adventist Church Married... with Children The Smoking Room Sexism Discrimination Little Britain Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Blacks and Mormonism Roman Catholic Church Infidels Human sexuality Feminism Charles Grandison Finney Shaggy dog story Sexuality in Christian demonology Bondage (BDSM) Skinhead Sola fide Sexual abstinence Love Anorexia nervosa Sin City Cult God and gender Rick Santorum Humphrey Bogart

teenager going nowhere with her life help my year old sister has absolutely nothing going for her right now she's been successful in being kicked out of nearly every alternative high school program our town has to offer why because she simply refuses to attend she was even too lazy to show up once a week to meet with her instructor while she was doing independent studies my parents and i try to help her with job opportunities but she refuses to follow through and even fill out an application it's always i'll do it tomorrow she wakes up every day between pm and basically hangs out with friends sometimes she comes home at night other times she will stay out without contacting home she has been an on again off again regular pot smoker and drinker since she was i am currently working full time while living at home after graduating college two months ago and i hate to see how helpless my parents are in this situation it's hard on our whole family any advice she turns in a few weeks and my parents know that at that point they no longer have to be responsible for putting a roof over her head however they are heartbroken at the thought of putting her out without job education car or a dime to her name they've tried stripping her room of everything except a mattress pillow and blanket but she always seems to improve for a few days and gets all the items back they have taken away her house key locking the door if she's not home by curfew but this just ended up encouraging more nights away from home they are fresh out of ideas and i know they would never turn to the internet so i am here to gather ideas thanks all to answer someone's question my parents do not give her any spending money yes they provide her with a home food water etc but she mooches off friends for things like pot booze junk food and movies my parents even offer to take her to the mall for new clothes she has none but she would rather wear the same ragged sweat pants and hooded sweatshirts each day it's really hard to find something that will entice her to change because she really isn't passionate about anything sigh tough love you work or go to school help around the house and abide by the rules here our go somewhere else the thing is she has no reason to stop doing what shes doing sure your parents get upset yell a little but obviously nothing really happens and shes back to do whatever she wants she may leave for a few days weeks even a cpl months but she'll figure out there's no free ride friends and there parents may let her stay a few nights but how long would you let some live your house and do nothing she'll be back good luck and shes jus her lifes not over yet she'll grow up and more then likely become a productive member of society she obviously has a family that loves her very much  EastEnders Mattress One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Sin City Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Kodocha Neighbours Married... with Children Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ocean's Twelve Education in the People's Republic of China Alcoholics Anonymous Fancy Crane Pitaten The Dalek Invasion of Earth Characters in the Smurfs Garfield The Critic Piccolo Junior Saga The Amazing Race About a Boy Columbine High School massacre GED Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) George Costanza Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Apprentice 2 Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Catcher in the Rye Past teachings of Prem Rawat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Customs and etiquette of Japan W.I.T.C.H.

does every teen do drugs get tattoed and party today i was looking at myspace and i found out my year old cousin does drugs and his girlfriend and all her friends have matching tattoos on their backs i'm only about years older than them but i've never done drugs or tried to get a tattoo is it even worth it to tell his mom he's buying and giving drugs to his friends or do you think she would even care these days or that it's even a big deal my own sister did marijuana then moved to meth and finally committed suicide at age no not every teen does these things and yes absolutely tell his mom either your cousin will deny it and nothing will happen after that or his mom will confront him and possibly save his life how would you feel if your cousin's life goes down the tragic road your sister's life followed you would feel guilty for knowing and not saying anything until the day you die i do think kids these days run amuk more than in past generations but it doesn't have to be that way parents need to be vigilant and sometimes they need others' to help them see what's going on it takes a village to raise a child because parents can't be everywhere at once i hope your cousin straightens out for his own well being best of luck  Pitaten The Adventures of Pete & Pete About a Boy Friends Vernon Schillinger Kodocha Kurt Cobain Kyle Broflovski Too Short a Season (TNG episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Incarnations of Immortality Infantilism EastEnders Angel Sanctuary Days of our Lives The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Ben Johnson (athlete) Suicide The Fairly OddParents My Life as a Teenage Robot Great Teacher Onizuka Chester Bennington Daredevil Oz (TV series) Charmed The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air The O.C.

who would you give everything up for just to be with them i would give everything i had just to be with my bf what about you thanx absolutely not my parents matter to me more than anyone can imagine for that reason i refused to be in a relationship with anyone who didn't respect them and whom my parents didn't respect well i set that standard when i was years old after marrying the wrong person but here's the point the right person won't require you to give up everything if you love your parents and they're good people then you shouldn't have to give up everything to be with them the right person should add to not subtract from it admittedly my parents wouldn't condemn someone in my life on the grounds of racism religious intolerance or other issues that would make me consider my loved one before them however if a person has good parents than a good boyfriend shouldn't require this sort of decision when you commit to someone this deeply you find yourself committed to their family imagine that you would demand your boyfriend cut ties from his family for some reason regardless they would be an issue for the rest of your lives together signing up for that makes very little sense instead work on resolving the issues by keeping what you love together if you can't what you love may not be what it seems  Theodicy Theory of conduct Polyamory Appeal Plame affair Summa Theologiae Fathers' rights Justification (theology) Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Love One Tree Hill (TV series) Capital punishment Abortion debate Infant baptism Transsexuality Sex and the City Marriage Homosexuality and Christianity Evil Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Excommunication Ten Commandments Consensus decision-making Deconstruction Abortion in the United States Friends Same-sex marriage Avenue Q Knots Landing Royal Assent Freedom of speech Who is a Jew?

this question is for bill d why is it that you felt the need to critiscize me for having a baby at again i did not go on welfare and did not have much help from my parents you are the reson why us young mother can't catch a break p s and by the way i was on birth control when i got pregnant taking it every day with no mess ups when i found out i was pregnant i took responsibility for my actions and didn't throw my child in a garbage can i'd appreciate it if you didn't critiscize my hard work and dedication to my child no one asked for your little opinion i asked for advice on what to do with a little girl who misses her father and wants to see him not ask your opinion on teen pregnancy thank you by the way i've seen your outher answers pretty immature i have to say i don't care about someone else's opinion i just think it's rude to crtiscize someone who has worked extremely hard to support their child and give them a good life great job for sticking up for your beliefs but don't let him get to you no need  Abortion debate Kodocha Pregnancy EastEnders Friends Charmed Abortion One Tree Hill (TV series) Roe v.

how do i make my parents allow me to have long hair i'm years old boy i live in the philippines but i study in an international school i know my parents will want me to have a haircut soon even if my hair isn't even considered long i need some kind of argument that would tell them to allow me i'm an honor student and i've not done anything wrong at all i believe they are becoming unreasonable i need things to say you know you're right you should be able to represent yourself in any way you want it's your body however you aren't and parents seem to think that they own you until you are therefore it would be advisable to simply ask them for a legitimate reason why you can't keep it long my guess is that they won't be able to come up with a good reason because there really isn't one maybe once you cause them to realize this they'll be more reasonable good luck  Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Ranma __ characters Kender Ontological argument Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Childlove movement Pitaten Abortion debate Drug test Intelligent design movement Economics One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Friends Friedrich Schleiermacher Kodocha Value system The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Teach the Controversy Normal distribution Great Teacher Onizuka Hair Goodness and value theory Badly Drawn Kitties Negima Singlish About a Boy Bernard Williams Soul Lincoln-Douglas Debate The Price Is Right School choice Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sampling (music) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Class (computer science) Speed limit Utilitarianism Marriage Fathers' rights Circumcision Pubic hair Autism rights movement Spanking Password Warez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Haven (TNG episode) Separation of church and state Quicksort The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Theodicy Haircut Judicial review Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Baroque chess Franz Boas Ex-gay Milton H.

okay do i ask do i not here's this gal that i like and have told her how i felt last year but she said she just wanna be friends however now i feel that some things have changed recently she showed more interests and especially today there were more conversations between us and often she asked me about things she seemed more interested she also teased me more but there's this guy who likes her too this guy's friend started it first by asking her and her friends to play bowling next week on the government election day i think he s been planning it so far should i be worried if they agree does it mean that she likes that guy this is the first time though and in my case i've hanged out with her together in groups a couple of times we're involved in more activities though when he asked her about that she seemed rather clueless she did not seem to really look for him though they re in different class what should i do it shattered my heart into pieces i'm planning to ask her friend about it not about asking her out about asking what that guy told em should i do it how to begin hmm if you focus on the other boy that likes this girl more than the girl you don't really have too much of a chance forget the boy focus on the girl i know it seems a scary thought to talk to her about your crush but at this point what do you have to lose simply call her up meet her or text her and bring it up do you think that the two of us could ever be more than friends this way if she says no you can move on if she says yes you're on your way good luck  Friends Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show About a Boy Cliff Richard Avenue Q Jon Secada Good Morning, Vietnam Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Teen Girl Squad Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Viterbi algorithm Little Britain The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Chemical Brothers Full Metal Panic?

i'm years old possibly pregnant scared to death please don't judge i've been on birth control nuvaring since march in the middle of july the ring came out during sex and my boyfriend and i couldnt find it i had my period a couple days after it was out we continued to have sex alot only a few times with condoms when we had them i know it was very irresponsible i put in a new ring on the first to stay on schedule but now i've been having more headaches more tired dizzy and lightheaded very frequently i've been having to pee alot more than usual as well and the other morning i felt nauseous i'm not sure if i'd count that or not i'm really worried that i'm pregnant i'm taking a test next week when i'm back at my dad's house if it's positive i'll have to get an abortion if i tell my mom she wouldnt let me but i'm years old a sophmore i cant raise a child now my boyfriend is i also don't know where i'd come up with at least dollars and to add to that i'd have to go to illinois b c you need pc in mo pc parent consent suggestions opinions comments a calming voice of reason the question of whether or not abortion is wrong is an entirely separate issue here understand you were not mature enough to handle sex obviously you screwed up and made a stupid decision potentially that stupid decision has come back to bite you in the ass you need to buck up and stop making a series of mistakes the parental consent is important here because it is a policy that is designed to counteract the decision making and irresponsibility of immature individuals vis a vis you that said you need to speak to your parents if they decide that you should not get an abortion you should probably heed that they likely have much better judgment than that which you have displayed  Abortion debate Birth control Rick Santorum Condom Roe v.

how can parents kick kids out as soon as they turn i have teens they have both brought home stray kids to stay for a few days these kids arrive with a backpack of change of clothes and sometimes not even that i feed em buy toiletries and help them search for alternatives in our community these are not bad kids we have house rules and they abide i think i will open a shelter for year olds it breaks my heart my parents kicked me out when i was years old a full time college student and i worked full time i paid room and board and did chores around the house they began remodeling their home when i was and my father told me i wasn't included in their remodeling plans they literally removed my bedroom from their floorplans well the good thing is that i survived i'm now a mother of amazing children and a returning college student i was never a bad kid i never smoked or drank i was home at pm curfew and i never did anything to bring shame to my name i hated my parents for the longest time because i felt they were just selfish and they felt they had done their job and it was over it was hard on me i really think their 'reason' was because my grandparents became very ill and i moved in with them for a little while to help take care of them putting my college dreams on hold because my parents didn't make the time to help with my grandparents they passed that responsibility on to me both my grandparents became very ill and i moved out but still stopped in and took care of them ran them to the doctors and hospital appointments for years shortly after i moved in months later with my boyfriend who is now my husband to whom i became engaged to at the time we're about to celebrate our year wedding anniversary i've been with my husband for years and over the years i've learned a valuable lesson my children are my world i would let them live home forever i could never kick one of my children out when you become a mother it isn't a job that you retire from when your child turns a certain age it is a job for life you are wonderful person to help these young folks out and let me tell you those kids will always have respect for you being there for them and they will never forget that in their eyes you and your family were their guardian angels i've had quite a few of those people in my life and i take in strays as well family isn't just biological family is those who you love and love you back with no question over the years i've learned to forgive my parents and i truly love them i thank god for what had happened because i learned a lot of life lessons and i met my husband and had amazing children and even though it was a very hard thing to go through i'd do it all over again the same however i find it ironic that my younger brother who is is still living home and doesn't contribute a dime to the food or shelter fund i just have to laugh when i think about it but i love my brother unconditionally and tell him stay home as long as you can and don't budge guess i still harbour a little anger inside afterall o lol  Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Kodocha Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Friends About a Boy Jon Secada Avenue Q Phoebe Halliwell Everwood Marilyn Monroe The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Theory of conduct Kimi Finster W.I.T.C.H.

i need help with my yr old she has been through a lot in her young life but here it goes i am years old and i married her father who i had been with for six years he went into the air force and he hit me and our relationship went bad we are seperated and i have now been with my current bf for years i have a month old with him and my five year old still wets her pants i have tried everything to help her i have a college degree and a great job a really great job one most would dream about i am at the end of my rope i feel horrible that her father doesn't want her to live with him and won t take her he barely calls her but when he does see her he's a great dad she insists on living with her father and i don't know what to do or how to make her better please help any rude comments on my parenting will be flagged i have done the very best that i can and for being only and still getting my college degree and having a great job and living on my own without welfare so nothing rude first i want to thank everyone for their kind answers but here is a bit more info i have taken her to her doctor and he suggested that she is very constipated which she is and somehow that will help her as her bladder and bowel work together and help each other so she is on a mild laxitive that is safe for children i'm not worried about the wetting of the pants as much as i worry about the impact her father has on her all she wants to do is be with her father who clearly doesn't want her to live with him he lives in arkansas and i live in mass he won't take her to live with him and i can't seem to make her understand without talking badly about him so i have avoided the whole subject this is so hard i have no misgivings regarding her father he was young when he hit me and had not yet gone to boot camp since coming back he has been very controlled and very reserved he has totally changed he hit me once or twice before that and i decided to leave for many other reasons also besides that he is a good father to her but he is also extremely young i feel bad for him in a way but that does not excuse him from being a parent he also pays support regularly and i am defensive because i do not like or appreciate hearing how i am too young to be a mother and everyone who is pro abortion and all of that i also do not like being categorized as a young mother on welfare which most people decide to put me in i am not on welfare and i have a degree this is why i am defensive i do not like the horrible comments on how i am too young and i cannot provide for my daughter not at all so forgive me for being defensive being a mother is about prioritizing even for year old women this is still a feat so don't feel behind or ahead i can see that you're trying to live up to all the ideals that others would suggest ie get a good job be supportive of her father's skills include her in family etc you second guess yourself and think that the circumstances and choice you've made are somehow delaying or disturbing her true children are psychologically impacted by divorce and sometime exhibit physical manafestations of those types of impacts ie sass mouth whining bed wetting defication insomnia etc however not always are the circumstances the cause take her to her doctor she may have a small bladder she may have an infection or some other medical problem that is beyond her control at that point would you stop blaming yourself i know it's our tendancy as mothers truth is if you keep blaming yourself your daughter will learn how to blame you too thus not taking responsibility for her own actions how do you think we have this society of blamers do the best you can but don't bare the burden of someone else's actions we can sympathize with our children understand them and even help them cope but to take on the blame is a whole nother facet  Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Hillary Rodham Clinton Unemployment Abortion debate EastEnders Abortion Divorce Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Autism Breastfeeding Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Fathers' rights Pitaten Avenue Q About a Boy Knots Landing Kodocha Rape God Emperor of Dune Friends Charles Darwin's illness Abortion in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.

teen mom are we doing the right thing i am ill be next month and my boyfriend will be in oct we have been dating for years and moved in with each other about months ago i am mnths pregand found out in june we are both working multiple jobs to save our money for our baby and were both going to college in the fall he is in the military got medically dropped in jan but going back nxt june both of our families know and a lot of our friends i am amazed by the support they have given us i was on bc and we used condoms i play sports and model so we wanted to be extra safe its kind of like god wanted us to have a kid i know it s a sin to have sex befor marriage but my bf and i have talked about marriage before and we do still plan to get married we didnt plan to have children for about more years after i got my teaching degree which i am still going to do and he was back from serving our country are we doing the right thing by keeping our baby instead of giving it up for adoption i will be blunt babies change things they really do and babies turn into children and children are around for two more decades until they are ready to go out on their own in the meantime they need to be fed sheltered trained educated and loved and you don't get a break from it you are very fortunate to have such a supportive family and a committed man in this situation it makes the ramifications of your final decision easier to deal with to know there's help out there if when you need it either keeping your baby or giving it up for adoption are the right things to do both however will give you different futures since both have different consequences keeping your baby will radically change your life and plans for the next few years your time for yourself will be cut and compromised drastically and you will be exhausted beyond what you ever can imagine now as you juggle school study work house and motherhood money you wanted for school will be eaten by pampers formula the extra room you'll need when the baby gets older and day care you will be responsible for organizing and maintaining a cadre of babysitters and day care people in your circle of family and friends mind you this will not last forever but for the first two or three years of your child's life you can expect this and plan accordingly kids babies take up less time as they get older but especially in the first few years they will devour every moment you've got and the moments you need for yourself for your careers educations and relationships not to mention sleep you will need to leave them with someone safe and responsible and loving every single time no breaks otoh you will have a child and there is nothing like it the love and joy of a child is incomparable to anything most people experience you will grow as a person and your life before your little one will fade into shadows as you fall in love your child and this bond lasts for the rest of your life if you give your child up for adoption you are able to have your life back as you planned it and your timetable for your school and plans with your boyfriend will not be changed for more than a few months if when the two of you decide to marry and start a planned family you will love those future children just as much you will have the mental and emotional burden however of wondering what could have been if you decide upon a closed adoption you will spend the rest of your life wondering when a stranger will show up at your door to ask if you are his mother if you decide on an open adoption where you participate in the child's life you will watch someone else raise your child and not be the mother can you handle this  Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Polyamory Infantilism Charmed Everwood The Amber Spyglass Abortion debate Days of our Lives Laura Schlessinger Social rule Marriage Sin City Sex and the City Divorce Neighbours Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Adoption Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Pitaten Kodocha Avenue Q Series finale Gender role Cliff Richard Abortion in the United States Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hillary Rodham Clinton Humphrey Bogart Spice Girls History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Breastfeeding John the Baptist Love Married... with Children Boston Public The Brady Bunch Philip J.

teenager advise please i have a year old girl she is a person that my wife and i marvel at most of the time she is smart and studies hard she is good to her sister willingly babysitting when asked she has a big heart and is willing to help people we go to church and she volunteers and plays volleyball here comes the problem she is very pretty and mature looking for like most teenagers she is interested in sex and curious about alcohol we have caught her having sex and know she has been dipping into our liquor cabinet marked bottles her mother and i are at our wits end and don't know what else to do we have caught her having sex before and thought that we had said and done the right things to get her to think about the consequences of her actions but we have caught her again the alcohol is a new development any advise for a father that doesn't need to pull his own hair out mother nature is taking care of that naturally thanks yes we are punishing her she is grounded until the second coming of christ no computer no phone extra chores etc we are also obviously taking extra precautions with the liquor cabinet we had already marked the bottles but now it has a new lock and we have hidden the key when this happened to me my father sat me down and got me drunk to the point i was throwing up that cured the problem for me for a few years isn't this age fabulous no one gets raising teenagers until they have one first you don't mention your religious or cultural beliefs on safe sex well the issue is now here and no punishment you can effect will put the genie back in the bottle while education shouldn't be a punishment this is a fantastic time to make the punishment effective in at least one regard it is time for you to have sex talk with your daughter we learned that there are many versions of the sex talk it seems sex talk is when you explain to your little child that babies do not come from any of the other species or methods they hear about at television and that they're called privates for a reason sex talk is when you tell your child later on that sex is a very serious deal and that now that cable television has shown then it may not be as gross as they thought it's still not the recreational choice you would prefer sex talk is the big one in which you need to make sure that if they have it or have it again you don't need to get ready to have sex talk redux with a grandchild or check your medical insurance to see what stds are covered and if you will have to mortage your house for aids treatment your daughter will not find this talk entertaining or recreational she does not want to hear this from her father which is why you must reach deep down into yourself and find that mischievous evil part of yourself you hid when you became a parent and bring it back out feel glee at the fact that she's going to be deeply uncomfortable and get your supplies first get a copy of the guide to getting it on and see if you can also find a copy of a medical manual that has great pictures of warts hepatitis c symptoms aids symptoms childbirth and domestic violence make sure those pictures are as grisly as possible and include patients near her age then find a few nice pictures of people who are clearly grownups with solid lives make a little are you ready for sex quiz no one really is at her age but this is a great object lesson here are some good questions can you recite the middle names of everyone you've had sex with if not that also means you wouldn't know your baby's father's full name did you use a condom and if so did you check the expiration date did you worry about getting caught and getting in trouble adults only worry about being caught and getting embarrassed have the talk in a comfortable place for you large dining room tables are great living rooms aren't she can get comfortable enough to zone out what you're saying and you can get comfortable enough to ease up on her things you need to cover she now needs to see a gynecologist she engaged in grown up behavior and grown ups need to see to their own health she could have contracted something schools are rife with hpv and chlamydia and she wouldn't even know she had either let alone something more serious her mother should cover what to expect at the gynecologist you can cover circumcision vs non issues with her to prepare her for encountering them and add to her misery at having her father say these things together you should cover every single option for birth control in extreme detail this is for her health and to reinforce that adults actually face their decisions before they make them methods to cover are in the book i mentioned she can't hang out with boys at all until she's sufficiently mastered the information you've given her take the steps you've demanded and earned back your trust how does she earn back your trust by completing her punishment maturely no arguments tantrums or misbehavior a trustworthy person doesn't whine about what they've brought upon themselves you might want to add volunteering at a hospital's maternity ward or a local homeless shelter for teens to the list if she's as bright as you say information is everything she will experiment and the best you can do is give her information and demonstrate consequences addition drinking is unfortunately something you can't innoculate her against the best thing you can do is to give her the information she'll turn to when she's made mistakes and show her as much as you can drink responsibly in front of her if one of her parents has one drink away from home let her watch you hand over the car keys to the other as a matter of fact mature decision let her get used to seeing that now so she does it later as habitually as she buckles up drink responsibly with friends but also drink non alcoholic drinks when you feel like it and voice the choice in other words actually say the wine here looks good but i think i'm in the mood for a soda coffee water tea this is how she learns how a responsible adult with the opportunity to drink behaves in the presence of beverages she can't read your mind when you make these decisions every day and it's necessary to show her also don't shield her entirely from behavior you don't want her to see while i don't think using friends as examples of poor behavior to your children is the right thing to do by your friends strangers are fair game if she sees how idiotic people can get when intoxicated she won't associate intoxication with coolness or fun teenagers are more sensitive to noise and light ask a doctor and dislike bars that's where much of the alcohol is so going to one especially a sports bar for one good sports game even if only for one drink and some appetizer is a good way to see the animals in the zoo don't announce it's a lesson that way she will observe without feeling schooled  Sexual abstinence Pitaten The Shining (film) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern

help me understand my year old son he's a great kid and i love him very much it seems like in the last months he is only interested in his friends i'd be happy with minutes of conversation a day i understand that teens are supposed to be way more interested in their friends than their mom but i feel completely cut off its nothing personal teenagers just really enjoy freedom and want to go out and see what there is your son will settle down soon enough and want to spend time with you it just takes time to find the right balance i wouldn't personally attempt to engage your son through 'activities' as this can come across as patronizing even with the best intentions just be there for him and when things do go wrong you'll be appreciated i promise you if you weren't there he'd miss ya  Shaggy dog story Infantilism Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Kurt Cobain About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Adolescence Saved by the Bell Human sexual behavior Neighbours Nicomachean Ethics Hey Jude Friends Theory of conduct Happiness KaBlam!

what can i do there's this gal that i like and have told her how i felt last year but she said she just wanna be friends however now i feel that some things have changed recently she showed more interests and especially today there were more conversations between us and often she asked me about things she seemed more interested she also teased me more but there's this guy who likes her too this guy's friend started it first by asking her and her friends to play bowling next week on the government election day i think they've been planning it so far he even teased her about me i think is to eliminate any suspicion of him trying to unite them should i be worried if they agree does it mean that she likes that guy this is the first time though and in my case i've hanged out with her together in groups a couple of times we're involved in more activities though when he asked her about that she seemed rather clueless she did not seem to really look for him though they re in different class and i doubt if she realized he was absent today what should i do it shattered my heart into pieces i'm planning to ask her friend about it should i do you and a million other boys are at the age where you notice a girl and the emotional merry go round takes over and we all had a first girl that we wanted in the worst way you are in school and there are a few priorities to tend to home school your future girls will always be around you hardly have time for a serious relationship neither does she or that other guy this is no big deal you all should be having fun when you do get a date relax and take it easy remember that guys and gals are different emotionally she will be attracted to all sorts of guys simply because she is ready for a love and wants to have thatexperience you do too and it is still her choice to decide on you or him if it is him so what she is free to choose you must always be the good sport if she picked you i imagine you would be real happy so don't push it in this other guys face both of you should be courteous and allow the winner to move on and have some dates with her she may not even be ready for a steady relationship who knows just be a nice guy you will not explode over this remember you have your priorities to see to good luck  Friends Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Cliff Richard Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Teen Girl Squad The Emancipation of Mimi About a Boy The Fairly OddParents Dead Like Me EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rod Stewart Sex and the City Pok__mon Live!

should i marry him or would it be throwing my life away i am currently years old and about weeks pregnant with twins this is my second pregnancy but my first was a miscarriage both pregnancies came from the same person he has been my best friend through everything and has never left my side but he wants me to marry him now because we're going to have children however i've seen the show engaged underaged and those marriages don't always work out as planned besides even though we've been together for years and are madly in love with each other i can't picture the two of us growing old together it could be just an influence of fear from television but he is in a really bad situation right now with the people he runs with a gang that is not a huge problem to me though the bigger problem is whether i should say yes to him and get married at would being tied down with a marriage ruin school for me do you think or would it help by giving both of us equal opporitunity with the kids a lot of you are bringing up a good point with the gang situation but the gang is really not that deadly they try to be but in reality they're whack but they're like my family too and i love them all however i do get what you're saying but on that show some of them do most people don't stay together for years especially not when their teenagers and marriage won't make school any harder than taking care of two babies it just means that he'll bether no matter what he'll be living with you helping you but if you don't love him then you shouldn't get married but you said you do so heres what i say if you get married and things don't workout you can always get divorced but if you don't marry him you might later regret it and im sure your kids would be really happy i you got married but make sure your relationship really works do you communicate well does he give you what you need emotionally and physically how often do you fight make sure those little things like that are great before getting married cause those are the keys to a good marriage make a life plan find out anything you don't already know i would really suggests that you live together for a couple of months before getting married that way you really do know whethewr or not you feel comfortable living with him waking up to him and going to bed with him i think you have a really good chance of making it considering youve been together for years and your still a teen that really says how much you care about him think things over and whatever you decide good luck  Friends Marriage EastEnders Days of our Lives Abortion debate Neighbours Laura Schlessinger Pregnancy One Tree Hill (TV series) Hollyoaks Knots Landing Social rule Theory of conduct Marilyn Monroe History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Jennifer Lopez Teenage pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Divorce Infantilism Polyamory Sex and the City The O.C.

should boys in school be taught about women's birth control when i was in school sex ed they taught us all about condoms how to put it on the banana etc but after that the boys had to leave the room for break while the girls were taught the deeper stuff pills periods etc do they still do this would you want your son to hear about all the women's stuff too birth control is the responsibility of both sexes they should both be informed men need to know about ovulation birth control pills periods etc because the guys shouldn't assume that the gals know everything the only reason the genders should ever be separated is if it's a younger grade not quite high school and the kids feel awkward asking questions in front of the other sex but they should both be taught the same thing actually i'm slightly appalled by what your school did making boys be ignorant and not give a fair opportunity of learning to both genders if it was a public school i'd get on the school board's as's about that who knows maybe one of the boys would turn out to be really interested in how the female human body works maybe inspire him to become a gyno that's just rude what your school did  Birth control Fertility awareness Condom Gender identity Boston Public Homosexuality and transgender About a Boy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Menstrual cycle Feminism Social rule Sexual revolution Sexual orientation One Tree Hill (TV series) Girl Abortion debate Infantilism Transgender Education in the United States Gender-neutral language Emergency contraception Gender role Masculism Avenue Q Human sexual behavior History of intersex surgery Sex Gender Beavis and Butt-head Incarnations of Immortality God and gender Sento Pedophilia The Giver Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bah__'__ Faith and Education Sex-positive feminism Sharon Tate Friends Puberty The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Intersex surgery Cross-dressing Equal Protection Clause Sexual abstinence Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Orgasm Shaggy dog story Heteronormativity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Urinary incontinence John Money The Invisibles Twin Sexual intercourse Neighbours Woman Sex and intelligence Little Britain Milton H.

why do year old girls have to be so mean i really dont get it they feel the need to diminish everyone elses self confidence and call them the b word etc any pyscologists out there why im not generalizing all yr old girls but i live in a very wealthy town think the beverly hills of another state so yeah everyone around here is they have issues up the wazoo i have a friend that lives in a town like yours in north carolina they have girls still in elementary school that come down on other girls about their hair where their clothes come from which town and or sub division they live in etc it's awful many of these girls are taught by their parents older sisters that because they have mega they don't have to follow the rules of society and that where you shop and live determine what type of person you are these girls are in for a rude awaking when they get into the real world and their boss could care less where they live or shop my advice is to never ever let them see that it bothers you they'll see this as a weakness and keep on and on at most girls are still trying to find out who they are and when these expectations are heaped on them they try to conform but it's not a good fit it could also be that their parents don't really care who their kid is on the inside where it counts they just care about appearences good luck and keep your chin up  The Fairly OddParents Kyle Broflovski My Life as a Teenage Robot Timmy Turner Saved by the Bell Pitaten Gender role Humphrey Bogart The Critic The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Doug About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Teen Girl Squad Jon Secada The Devil Wears Prada John Howard Yoder The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Religious Society of Friends W.I.T.C.H.

i'm wondering what to do to about so many young pregnant girls adolescents and parents what can we all do do to avoid this to keep happening don't you think is preocupant to see the amount of questions like can i be pregnant am i pregnant what to do i'm adolescent and i am pregnant can we all talk about it i am a mother of a twelve year old boy and i don't want him to have to deal with this kind of situation and any of his friends either but i don't know how to talk about it with him i don't know what to say adolescents what can i do help me and let's help other young people please it is good that you bring this subject up yes young people will have sex and obviously nothing is going to stop them from expressing their feelings i feel that there should be a talk from either the parents or sex education in schools about different forms of birth control my mom as akward as it was talked to me about sex and told me how it was done and such when i was young around when i asked it was very simple and she stressed to me that it was ok to want to know i was shocked to find out what it was but i appreciated my mom being honest with me later when i was around i had a serious boyfriend she came in my room and told me about the whole urges thing that they are natural and that having them is not bad after that she told me that when i was ready to act on these urges to protect myself she told me about condoms and how they worked and the pill she also told me that whenever i felt ready to have sex i could come to her and she would take me to get put on the pill well around a year later i felt ready and had yet another uncomfortable talk with my mom she wasn't mad or anything she actually gave me a hug and told me she was proud of me for being responsible we went and around a year after being on them i became sexually active i never became pregnant but if my mom had never told me i proably would be or would have been by now there is no way to get past the uncomfortable stage in this it's odd becuase it's your kid and it's odd for them because you are mom and such words as penis condoms and sex are never to be said by mom right wrong as gross as it is kids will appreciate that they can come to you with this stuff most learn it from their friends one of my friends said two condoms were better than one so you can see that the information gained at school is not right let them know you wont be angry with them if they so choose to ask questions or want to become sexually active and don't by being open with them it may gross them out a bit but be sure to talk to your kids about it i love my mom even more for being there for me and letting me know it was ok that i wasn't dirty and giving me information in fact all my friends were jealouse because their parents simply told them you have sex you get aids std's death kicked out of the house pregnant which can be true or go to hell this doesn't make them stop it just makes them not come to you until it's too late just let him know that it will be odd and you know it's not something you want to hear from mom but it's better that it is you before he has sex than you after he has a girl pregnant good luck  Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha EastEnders Avenue Q Birth control Sex education Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Sexual abstinence Oral sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Milton H.

i'm so frustrated why do i feel this way there are a lot of times when i feel like i want to have a baby in order to stop my period for months my periods are horrible i have cramping headaches dizziness and a flow that causes me to have to change a tampon and a super maxi pad every two hours or so and on top of that it lasts for a week i've thought about birth control but my mom just blows off that there is a problem and tells me it will get better so there's no other way that i can get it i'm any suggestions i take advil and other pain killers for the pain even though they don't help much sweetie i have had horrible periods since i was and i think you should probably ask your mom to make you a doctor's appointment talk it over with a doctor and you may find some answers i know how you feel and i've been through it certainly the answer is not to have a baby babies are a huge responsibility and not one to be taken lightly i'm sure your doctor will be able to help try talking to your mom calmly and asking her if you can go to the doctor and ask him about it my parents took me more seriously when i asked to go to the doctor because i hated doctors and they knew if i felt bad enough to see a doctor then something needed to be done good luck and keep us updated on what happens i'll be thinking of you  Menstrual cycle Sanitary towel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story EastEnders Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

am i pregnant ladies only please okay this is the deal i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend but he didnt ejaculate inside me we had to stop because someone came in is it possible i could be pregnant i havent really had any sighns my period is suppose to happen next week do you think i should just wait before over reacting i wouldn't jump to conclusions just yet i mean there is a great possiblity that you could be because a man doesn't have to actually ejaculate for you to get pregnant they secrete sperm the entire time you are having sex so if you truly don't want a baby right now and you find out your not pregnant wrap it up next time or see your doctor about birth control as far as taking a pregnancy test for it to be most accurate you have to actually be late on your period so i would wait about a day or two after you've missed your period and then take one good luck either way  Pregnancy Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Pornographic movie Menstrual cycle Oral sex Neighbours Friends Abortion debate Birth control Social rule Gonorrhoea Miscarriage Sexual intercourse EastEnders Infertility In vitro fertilisation Orgasm Safe sex Premature ejaculation Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Jam (TV series) Obstetrics Sexual abstinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Charmed Emergency contraception Sex and the City Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Sexual reproduction Breastfeeding Niddah Condom Sharon Tate Abortion Maury Futurama (TV series - season 5) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ejaculation Cytomegalovirus Characters of Lost Vernon Schillinger Ocean's Twelve Endometriosis Childbirth Drawn Together Gay slang Turner syndrome Psoriasis AIDS Sex education Strap-on dildo Big Brother UK series 6 Twin Masturbation History of sex Soap opera Spina bifida Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Sterilization (surgical procedure) Stewie Griffin Semen The Sims 2 Breech birth Kodocha The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga The Children of Men The Inside Prolactinoma Crystal methamphetamine and sex Pregnancy fetishism Kurt Cobain Reservoir Dogs Penis Ben Johnson (athlete) Taken The Five Doctors Jennifer Lopez One Tree Hill (TV series) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Premature birth Human sexual behavior Partial-birth abortion My Family (television) Boston Public Satanic ritual abuse Days of our Lives Roswell UFO incident Melanie Wilkes Survivor (novel)

why would the law consider sex amongst teenages rape laila is pregnant years of age her boyfriend just recently turned yesterday we just found out that if either parents had been against this whole situation they could sue since both teens are were under age they have no right to consent towards a sexual relationship i don't understand with teens now a days being more sexually active and no one doing anything about it statutory rape is a crime because the law considers your ability to consent to what you are doing it doesn't matter if the people thought they were consenting the law says you are too young to have the ability to consent check out the wikipedia for more info there are lots of conditions and lesser crimes and lots depends on what state you live in if you're asking why the law hasn't changed even though it seems teenagers are more sexually active than they used to be i can't imagine any state legislature changing the law becuase it would look like they were endorsing teenage sex  Age of consent Statutory rape Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Teenage pregnancy Pedophilia Abortion debate Adolescence Ephebophilia Child sexual abuse Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Rape Marriage Consensual crime Same-sex marriage Homophobia Theory of conduct North American Man/Boy Love Association Lawrence v.

why do children change so much when they leave elementary school for junior high when i was going into middle school everyone one was so different last year when i was in th grade last year i saw the th graders wearing different clothes and dating why is there such a big change when changing one grade because when you go from elementary school to junior high you are doing more than gaining one grade you are going from baby school to big kid school at least that's the way kids like to feel they like to act grown up and start dating to prove how grown up they are  High school Education in the United States Middle school E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

watching porn at ok so im now but have been watching porn since i was i know that is waaaay to early but eh u cant change the past my dad found out when i was and wasnt to pleased to put it very nicely lol so im a lot more careful lol since its gay porn and if my dad found out i would end up with a back hand across the face but any way is this bad like i mean i know its bad but how bad i think im addicted is there a way i can become not addicted thanks for the help and yes i know porn isnt like real life and its morally wrong etc etc but eh at least im not having sex right wow this is tough well you're right you can't change the past but you are in control of your future you make the decisions for good or ill what do you want to do you think you're addicted so that should tell you something right there this might be difficult to think about but what if you were the adult and it was your child you yourself said you know you saw it at too early an age it's a pretty easily accessible thing after all but again you make your choices in life i know this may sound creepy and maybe because it is but it's almost like allowing yourself to be molested you know sex and children just don't go together you've cheated yourself out of a small part of your childhood it will be difficult but you should stop now before you find yourself lost and obsessed don't you want a better life for yourself sex will always be there but your youth won't spend your time more constructively you watch porn i bet partly because it's just so darn easy it's just there how can you not watch it and you've been doing it for so long it's become a regular part of your life you said you're now do you still want to be sitting in front of a screen at keep in mind that a lot of porn is portrayed in a very abusive way it's sick sex isn't don't warp your view stop wasting your time your youth you'll be very happy you did i promise there's more to life i really hope this helps  Theory of conduct Pornography Avenue Q Social rule Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation Poker jargon Child pornography Male prostitute Friends Motion picture rating system Time Out of Mind Alcoholics Anonymous 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sexual abuse Procrastination John Holmes (actor) Pitaten Transsexuality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Rocko's Modern Life EastEnders Pedophilia Boogie Nights Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha Laura Schlessinger Sexual addiction Boston Public Sex Pistols Childlove movement 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Nine Inch Nails Microeconomics Serial killer Pornographic movie Divorce Sento Daredevil Knots Landing Sex and the City The Fairly OddParents Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Craps Goodness and value theory Kurt Cobain Wonderland (McFly album) Child sexual abuse Textile manufacturing Larry Flynt Infantilism Sydney Riot of 1879 Sinfest Abortion debate The Ashlee Simpson Show Incarnations of Immortality Polyamory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Child sexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses B3ta Health insurance Great Teacher Onizuka Domestic violence Utilitarianism Internet pornography Recurring South Park characters Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Catcher in the Rye Boba Fett Alfred Kinsey Philip J.

teenagers to answer honestly how often do you use cell phones to cheat in class hey i know that texting is huge with teenagers and i've heard alot use them to store info for when they're taking tests or they use them to txt each other answers is this true do teachers do anything to combat this i'm going into the th grade i would never use texting to cheat on a test but then again i already get all a's i only use it during class to talk to friends but not during a test i've seen people cheat useing texting once or twice well were not supposed to have our cell phones out or even on during class the same with i pods ect if we're caught using our cell phones at all during class it get sent to the office and you can get it after school after the first time you have to have a parent pick it up most students only use thier phones to talk to each other when the class is boring most of the time lol but not really to cheat hope this helps  Short message service GED Columbine High School massacre Social rule Boston Public Education George Costanza Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Hey Arnold!

i'm and i don't have a cell phone okay i'm and all my friends have phones except for me they're younger than me too i could easily afford a prepaid cellphone i babysit water plants for people watch pets and get a week for allowance my parents think i'm responsible and many other adults have told them i have a good head on my shoulders whenever i bring up the subject of getting a cell phone my mom says sure okay i don't care if you waste your money in a mean tone my point is if i can afford the phone why not have it how do i work things out so i can convince my mom i can responisbly have a phone my dad will go with what she says oh and i was forgetting that i go to a barn to ride horses often i have to ask people to use their phones and it's embaressing i don't want to waste other people s minutes to call my mom okay understand this i live in a fairly rural area and i can walk miles to the nearest walmart or convinience store and i have a really good relationship with my mom so i pretty much drop the subject when she says no cuz i don't want her to get mad my daughter had a cell phone when she was paid for by my ex that helped bring her up she had it for about years and then went without until i got her another for christmas last year i use it to keep tabs on her sometimes she gives me the lame excuse that it wasn't turned on or charged or something though if you have a birthday coming up soon drop the hint about how nice it would be to be able to keep in touch with your mom and dad when you're out and wait to see what happens if no birthday is coming up and you really want a cell phone then start saving your money and when you have enough for at least months of payments approach the easiest parent and discuss it with him her think up many reasons such as them being able to contact you or the people you babysit for being able to call you if they need you the most important thing when negotiating is to never ever get upset or raise your voice or whine just show complete maturity good luck  Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Milton H.

wednesday was one year for my boyfriend and i i cried not from happiness my boyfriend wasn't really talking to me so i wasn't talking either because i could tell by looking at him that something was bothering him he's quiet as am i and it's easier for us sometimes especially since i tend to break down and cry easily to write things down so i asked him what was wrong and he said he couldn't explain it i didn't know if i did something or if he didn't want be around me he said that wasn't it it's just that sometimes he would rather be nowhere like somewhere not on this planet i cried anyway and he gave me a hug but he was still feeling down about something he left soon after that and that night i couldn't sleep because i was feeling nervous and worried i have told him to be more open with me and i realized that i don't always open up to him i wrote him a note explaining some deeper things about me do you think this might help him realize that he can open up to me since i was comfortable and open to him sorry for the typos my mind is all over the place and i was trying to hurry i think the note might help but while he is feeling down respect his wishes just imply or tell him that you will be there if and when he's ready to talk if he said you didn't do anything wrong then you should just believe him just show him all the love you can give him and respect his decision of not telling you hope that helped good luck  Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Smoking Room One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga The Ashlee Simpson Show Pitaten Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q Social rule The Emancipation of Mimi W.I.T.C.H.

how do i help my mom my dad's really sick and just about given up on life he's depressed and angry and takes it out on everyone mostly me and my mom cause we're here the most but at the same time he's also worried about my me and my sisters particularly my older sister because she's currently pregnant with twins and is financially struggling enough with her two kids as it is well how can i help my mom get through this she's trying really hard to lift my dad's spirits but he seems to just be slipping deeper and deeper and if he dies then i don't know what i'l be able to do for her we've already lost family members close friends within the last years what are ways i can be there for her besides praying my other older sister is a bum who's still living with us but going to college goes out alot with her friends and drinks and never contributes anything around the house leaving me to do everything possibly the only good thing i could say about her is she has a job the best thing you can do is tell her how much you love her and that you're there for her no matter what she needs kids need their parents but sometimes parents need their kids too try to get her to talk about what she's going through it might be just what she needs some parents don't like talking to their kids about personal problems though so if she won't open up don't push just make sure she knows you're there when i was younger my parents were going through a very hard time it seems similar to your parents they ended up divorcing when i was and the difficult times actually ended up making me closer with both of my parents my dad also had given up and was an alcoholic for years your story really hit me because i know how hard it is to deal with a parent going through depression if you feel comfortable maybe try talking to your dad too i know that people going through such difficult times are often not even the person you used to know so i totally understand if you feel that it wont help just be sure your parents know you're there for them if they're at all willing family marriage counseling may help i really hope things get better for you and your family please feel free to message me if you need to talk anymore  Friends Kodocha Fathers' rights Social rule The Fairly OddParents One Tree Hill (TV series) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Humphrey Bogart Rent (musical) The Marshall Mathers LP Polyamory Hollyoaks EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye About a Boy Knots Landing The O.C.

can you get aids from kissing no i think the only possible way is if there is a bleeding cut from the infected person's mouth and it bleeds straight in to yours while you're deep kissing but still the chances are sooooo slim that you really don't need to worry about it a person infected with aids will be watchful enough when they are bleeding especially in the mouth and wouldn't want to deep kiss at that time anyways  Bleeding Oral sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wound Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Shaving Stomach cancer Transmission (medicine) Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS The Marshall Mathers LP First aid First aid kit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tourniquet Anal sex Traumatic brain injury Wisdom teeth Triage Safe sex Toxoplasmosis Avalanche Rabies Ebola Diving Hearing impairment HIV test Sexually-transmitted infection Friends Yoko Ono Sheepshead Dobermann Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Poker jargon Polygon Records Coma Ulcer ROC presidential election, 2004 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Eminem Zhao Yun New York Knicks Breastfeeding AIDS pandemic Artificial respiration George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Proprioception Miscarriage Smallpox Urinary incontinence Aspergillosis Viral marketing Mara Jade Jon Secada Pulp Fiction Kaposi's sarcoma Infectious mononucleosis Back to the Future Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Kiss Dawn of the Dead (2004 film) Anthrax Humphrey Bogart AIDS Certified Nursing Assistant Barbed wire The Invisibles Futari wa Pretty Cure Etoposide Gonorrhoea The Authority Duesberg hypothesis Hepatitis B Fisting Body piercing Push It (Garbage's song) Kasparov versus The World Common cold Sesshomaru Marburg virus Milton H.

is it wrong if i use sparknotes okay so i have to take notes on jane eyre to discuss in class i already read the book months ago but forgot to take the notes the notes are to help me study for the test i dont get graded on them is it wrong if i use sparknotes com to get summaries of every chapter theme ideas and character traits and i re word them to only study from and use in class i mean i'm not getting graded on my notes use them but remember that sparks or cliff notes only talk about the main events and ideas a good teacher will have also read the sparks notes and will make sure that some of the questions on the test can not be answered by people that have only read the sparks notes i know you said you read the book months ago but you will probably want to review certain key parts of it to make sure that you really remember and understand what happened  Education Fahrenheit 451 GED Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Socrates A Course In Miracles SAT Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Goodness and value theory Fictional character The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Republic (dialogue) Cliff Richard Philosophical skepticism Federalist No. 10 Church of Christ, Scientist Standardized testing Culture Theodicy Eugene Onegin Classical education God Emperor of Dune Guns, Germs, and Steel Book of Mormon Discordianism Password God Aesthetic Realism Second language acquisition Jeopardy!

closed campus or open is your school campus open or closed that is do you get to leave school for lunch all of ours are closed after several fatal accidents involving teen drivers the reason is that to the immature teenage brain if someone pulls in front of you the instinct is to swerve into the next lane not to simply stop also teen logic dictates that if you only have a half hour for lunch that means you have to drive like crazy to get to the mcdonalds and back not that you simply don't have time to go to mcdonalds what's the situation at your school i think it is closed our lunch is very short because we have min clases so we dont have time for a huge lunch but that is a good thing i totally agree with what you said about teen drivers  Vehicular cycling Teen Girl Squad Shaggy dog story Reversible lane Adolescence Driver's license One Tree Hill (TV series) Abortion debate Drag racing Auto racing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bike lane debate Manual transmission School bus Traffic Indianapolis 500 Rules of the road Road traffic accident Formula One regulations 24 Hours of Le Mans Ernie Irvan Lee Harvey Oswald Chris Amon Car handling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ayrton Senna Speed limit Elevator Meat Loaf Sport utility vehicle Freeway Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Traffic light Columbine High School massacre Road safety Autobahn Jacky Ickx Dog training Earth Girl Arjuna Professional wrestling throws Bristol Grammar School Hitchhiking Doomsday argument Sonic the Hedgehog Railway signalling Philosophy of language STS-51-L Spidey Super Stories Condon Committee McDonald's Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lydia Lunch Kill Bill Interstate Highway Sunnydale Epistemology Terry Labonte Aqua Teen Hunger Force Taxi Driver Teen Titans Go Death Sydney Riot of 1879 Social rule Scuderia Ferrari Ron and Fez Full Metal Panic?

when i try to make people happy i want to help other people and do nice stuff for them but i always end up getting hurt or feel unappreciated my friend asked me i would make him a cd and download like songs for him i did it and brought my laptop to school i didn't even get a thank you i spent hours yesterday doing health homework for the rest of my class and today i found out that i did the wrong part lack of communication and the rest of the class just yelled at me and the hours i spent was wasted i tried to do some nice things for my bf as well and he didn't even say thank you i can't help but help other people and do nice things i've tried to stop but i can't i said something about not feeling appreciated to my bf and now he wont talk to me and he's gone off in a sh tty what do i do i feel like i can't win gussie i live in new zealand we start school in jan and finish in november i am at school currently i go to university in feb next year i don't tell people my friends about my past they know nothing and i want it to stay that way first and foremost you cannot make everyone happy no matter what you do dear you should understand that you are not unique to be in this dilemma millions of people are i was exactly like you at young age but now i have become wiser though sometime even now i fall into this trap of helping others basically persons are good natured and they remain so for a long time but the systems circumstances make a few of them just the opposite however people are also selfish the selfishness comes basically from inertia not willing to do things unless forced but grooming also plays a large part in it if most people don't even say 'thanks' it is more likely that they are lazy in saying so the irony that people like you and me face is that most of the time we are taken for granted the reason for this lies in the fact that the thing which is available free or cheap does not carry any value why diamond and gold are costlier than other things because you and also me are easily available to others for the help they do not value our help and take us for granted by readily agreeing to help others we set up a standard for us and any time we fall short of that standard we are frowned upon the reactions of your class in health homework case and your b f are the results of this both of them didn't expect you to act the way you did and now both are angry with you i know it is not easy to change your helping nature and i am not advocating for it but i suggest is to change the perspective also use a little discretion continue helping others not because you can't help it but because it is the right thing to do you are a fine person who has compassion for others just stop expecting anything from others even a 'thank you' if any cost is involved tell them in advance that they would have to bear the cost if you can gather some courage then put a little cost on your efforts time also you will see most of them would back off use a bit of discretion while helping others first find out whether they can do it without your help or not help only when they can't do it any other way you can site shortage of time as the excuse for denying them your help if you must help go ahead and do it and then forget about it in any case stop considering your position as a 'no win' situation a good samaritan is never a loser losers are those who are ungrateful hopefully it will put some smile back on your face  Theory of conduct Prisoner's dilemma Poker jargon Social rule Objectivist philosophy Microeconomics Avenue Q Altruism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rich Mullins Dog training The Amber Spyglass Singlish Kodocha Economic inequality Bernard Williams Vegeta Goodness and value theory Sydney Riot of 1879 Daylight saving time Current teachings of Prem Rawat Supply and demand Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ben Johnson (athlete) Fathers' rights Education in the People's Republic of China The Apprentice 2 Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Extreme Programming Strategic management Evil Sant Thakar Singh Socrates Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cliff Richard Jon Secada Transactional analysis Inflation Pitaten Milton H.

alot of problems ok i'm around or not going to give anyone my age my mom got a divorce when i was seven years old and since i was so young i took that very hard and honestly i'm still not over it so then my mom got a boy friend when i was about or and from the beginning i did not like him or trust him so after my dad left my mom was sober for a year then this guy comes and she starts drinking again and she moves him into our home my mom has kids including me i had only met him once before and my moms boyfriend made both my sisters move to my dads because they couldnt stand the way he acted then my brother moves out to live with my dad so there was on'y me and my one brother left to suffer so years past and they stated drinking more and more and one day he hits my mom after that my mom let him stay then he kept doing horrible things and my mom would still keep him there then they tried to quit drinking and he screws up again so my mom called the cops and they arrested him so i thought that all my misery was done and god was working in my life but then my mom starts to blame herself for everything that happened and lets this horrible man my moms boy friend back into our home to live there again and by that point i had become suicidal and i don''t wat to be that way so my question is what do i do to handle this and i do believe that her boy friend is the reason my life and family is totally torn apart and i try to talk to her every day and yesterday i even told my mom that i was suicidal and she only said i'm gonna take you to a doctors what am i suppose to think and i when i do tell her straight up how i truly feel she turns the whole thing around and makes me feel sorry for her and blames me is that a good mother i know i love my mom and i do want to live with her but how can you live in a house where you hate someone in it and you feel trapt everything is always about her boyfriend she tells me that we are all me my brother my mom and her bf going to be a family but i hate him i can't help but to cry when i see him and i feel like i'm nothing to my mom and i don't want to live with my dad my dad is always gone he is a work aholic and i every day of my life i feel like i belong no where i have no where to go or hide and i dont want to feel sorry for myself sounds tough first write a list of how your mom family used to be before this man came into your life every little detail emotional economic etc then write another one of how your mom family changed after this man came into your life show it to your mom and tell her that this man has not only been hurting her physically but has also been hurting her in every other way since he has torn her family apart tell her that you need her and that you need the family you had but that with that man it's not going to be possible due to the fact that you've witness how he has hurt your family so much i believe she needs profesional help maybe after her divorce she feels like no one will ever love her and that's why he's with this idiot because she fears she will never be loved i have a friend who is yes she was dating this guy at first their relationship was almost perfect but then he got really possessive and he started hitting her she's a pretty girl but she's not like one of those drop dead georgeous supermodels so he would constantly tell her that he would hit her because she didn't agree with him or because she would do things that weren't proper as if beating the crap out of her was anyways they came to my house he used to be my brother friend and they got in an argument and he hit her in my house so i got really mad and she was mad too i found out that he was telling her that she was ugly and no body would ever love her as much as he loved her and that if a guy ever dated her it would be because he wanted to have sex with her she had a really low self esteem but i talked to her and kind of helped her learn how to love herself again she is no longer with him and he's currently in jail for a bunch of crimes he commited maybe that's the way your mom feels talk to her and make her see that someone who is capable of hitting her is not worth it and it's not someone who truthly loves her  One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Sin City Knots Landing EastEnders Recurring South Park characters About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Pitaten Megan Griffin Shaggy dog story Social rule W.I.T.C.H.

travel tips im and im flying by myself from san antonio to omaha i have a two hour layover in atlanta which is good in case my plane is late from san antonio and so i can find my gate and stuff im just kinda nervous becuase i have flown by myself before but that was when the airplane ppl helped me i mean if they ask they can help but not like im under there thumb my mom said after im not a minor so they wont help me i think i can do this by myself but im so nervous becuase i have never done something of this magnitude by myself before but im very organized and meticulous if anyone has some advice i would greatly appreciate it thanks so much i know exactly how you feel when i was i flew from houston to san diego by myself but the airline was there and they helped me since i was an 'unaccompanied minor' so things went well and i was fine then when i was i flew from houston to indianapolis by myself because i was over the airline didn't help me so i was on my own i was so nervous here's my advice to you go to the airport and have whoever is dropping you off come in with you and go up to the airline counter with you to check in your luggage ask them where to go say goodbye to your mom dad whoever then go through security then go straight to your gate and just sit in one of the seats until they start boarding your plane don't worry about getting on the wrong plan they scan your tickets and the airline people will make sure you are on the right flight bring a good book or a cards or something to do while you wait when you get to atlanta are you flying delta by any chance they always make everyone go through atlanta it's so dumb just go straight to the gate for your connecting flight and just wait there for your flight to take off don't worry about getting lost airports are good about having tons of signs and if you still can't figure out where you are going go up to any airline counter or gate counter and ask someone for directions to where you are going in my experience the airline people are always willing to help you out as long as you stay calm and don't get rude with them and while airport food tends to be a bit over priced it's usually not bad so if you get hungry during your layover pick up something just keep an eye on the time so that you make sure you are at your gate when they start boarding although they do make announcements but i sometimes find them hard to hear have fun in omaha and don't worry traveling by yourself isn't difficult i got all worried for nothing you'll be fine happy travels  McCarran International Airport Airport Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport O'Hare International Airport John F.

what should i do about witnessing a pregnant teen smoking weed this is funny i just had an experience like this happen i called planned parenthood and they helped answer this same question they were also open minded about the situation but the bottom line is that if you are not caring about your babies health before it is born chances are you wont when it is born so she is already off to a rocky start weed out of all drugs including ciggarettes is the least harmfull to the baby but it is still doing harm it sounds like she has a lot of maturing to do especially becuase a parent is the largest influence on a childs development and life if she doesn't mind her child thinking that she is a druggy and blaming her for any issues they might have then she should think about her actions befors she acts you should be a friend and relize that its not horrible and that a child is a lot of responsability i just had my first months ago where is the father he should be helping out aswell it takes to not to just make the kid but to raise it too hope this helps you out  Abortion debate About a Boy Breastfeeding Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Adoption Social rule Hollyoaks EastEnders Friends Parenting Urinary incontinence Psychology Charmed Cannabis (drug) Hillary Rodham Clinton Lex Luthor Roe v.

sometimes i want to get anorexic i just don't know why i look at my stomach pouch and i want to just stop eating welcome to being a teenage girl i used to think the same thing sometimes but then the actual thought of not eating very much got old really quickly it may seem like the best solution in theory but if you do cut back too much the tiredness and grumpiness is just not worth it also did you know that scientists are discovering that true anorexics have some different sort of biological things going on than a normal person they respond differently to starvation than we would on a biochemical level so unless you are wired to be inclinded that way trying to be anorexic just won't work as your natural instincts will kick in i have found that when i feel the way you are feeling if i increase my exercise i feel better it gets my good hormones flowing and the added muscle tone makes me look better plus you can be proud that you are doing something that is helping your body instead of hurting it good luck  Insulin Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Autism Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Stuttering Puberty Transactional analysis Stomach cancer Sexual differentiation EastEnders Fecal incontinence Hypoglycemia Protein Traumatic brain injury Theory of conduct RuneScape skills The Inside Aikido Omega-3 fatty acid Action potential Chronic fatigue syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Nutrition Social rule Breastfeeding Adjustable gastric band Testosterone Weight training Biology and sexual orientation Species Brain Diabetes mellitus Electrophysiology Aerial (dance move) Biology Inflation Infantilism Grumpy's Three Wishes Orgasm One Tree Hill (TV series) Shark Nicomachean Ethics K' Obesity Dieting Human height Transsexuality Water (molecule) Goodness and value theory Eye Altruism Milton H.

is it illigal i am about to be yrs old next month i havea yr old boyfriend i've been with him for about if i became pregnant can my parents still put him in jail i would check with the laws in your state some states have a younger age law for rape charges which is what it could be called if you are still a minor in your state the usual age is but some states i think are and years old if you are not considered under age for sex with an older person then he cannot be charged for anything as long as you have given your personal consent however i would not have sex with anyone that didn't plan on a perminent relationship with me where a ring was involved with that age difference there is a good possibility that all they want is the infatuation of the relationship and they do not plan a perminent commitment that is no way to bring up a baby because the child will not be loved and the majoriety of relationships break up once the child comes between the now mother and father i would do whatever i could not to get pregnant so that a 'have to marriage' wasn't the reality some guys won't go through the marriage even if they claim they would it's a whole different ball game for them once they are confronted with the reality of a baby rather than a possibility that hasn't happened yet example my nephew got a girl he claimed he was madly in live with pregnant then he ditched her while she was pregnant her parents also ditched her so my sister took her in since it would be her grandchild and it was her son's baby she finally convinced him to at least support her while she was pregnant financially baby came and he helped with the care of the child and then told the girlfriend he would try to make the relationship work so he moved in with her in the house my sister was letting her stay in and got her pregnant a second time as soon as she was pregnant he told her it was her fault and he never loved her and he moved out of course my sister was so mad at him that she wouldn't let him move in with her either he is giving the girl child support for kids now and so far she can't even find a good decent guy that wants to date her let alone marry her with two of someone elses kids on the tow that she got from playing around before marriage i suggest you refrain from having a child even if he says he wants one until he is really committed in a marriage bond that is so much better for the child anyway  EastEnders Friends Neighbours Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Age of consent Days of our Lives Kodocha Charmed The O.C.

spotting two weeks after period long but pls help hi i was on my period from july which was short and light my periods are never short and light they usually last about days and with a heavy flow the first two days and regular the rest of the time about two weeks later on aug or i started spotting it continued for about p or days and then stopped but only for a day after one day of no spotting i'm spotting again its not heavy spotting because i only see it after i use the restroom and whipe i'm thinkin that it is because of sex but i'm not sure i've had spotting before but never lasted more than days i'm not on any birth control pill so thats not why oh and i did have some cramps on monday when i had soccer practice i always get bad cramps during excersice before i'm about to get my period but besides that i haven't experienced any symptoms of any kind thank you for your help spotting between periods is totally normal especially if you are on birth control it might be from sex but only if you are having rather rough sex sex itself could not cause uterine tissue bleeding since you got your period it is highly unlikely that you are pregnant unless you have had unprotected sex recently while this isn't an emergency you should check with an ob gyn if this continues because persistent spotting especially when you are not on birth control can be a sign of something more serious like cysts good luck  Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Miscarriage Childbirth Emergency contraception Obstetrics Guinea pig Puberty Anal sex Soap opera First aid USS Chicago (CA-136) Ovarian cyst New York Giants Endometrial cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Acne Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Premature birth Penis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tocopherol Turner syndrome Asthma Migraine Prostate cancer Passenger car Depo Provera AIDS Prenatal diagnosis Diabetic retinopathy Cephalic disorder Oral sex Coeliac disease Birth control Decompression sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ectopic pregnancy Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Diazepam Hypertension Stroke Intrauterine device Multiple sclerosis Transsexuality Hepatitis C Hebrew calendar Incandescent light bulb Spina bifida Methamphetamine Nuclear fallout Folic acid USS Wasp (CV-18) Sex Pistols Sex education Niddah Marilyn Monroe Breastfeeding Breech birth Professional wrestling slang Traffic light Cramp Gonorrhoea Sewage treatment Peleliu Orgasm Syringomyelia LSD Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Capercaillie Toxoplasmosis Medicine Aortic dissection Abortion debate Apollo 8 Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dialysis Cancer 1957 World Series Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Narcolepsy Motor neurone disease Insulin Ebola Black Ben Johnson (athlete) Neighbours Equine conformation Cytomegalovirus Antidepressant Alcoholism Battle of Kursk Eye USS Washington (BB-56)

more advice need about seventeen year old my seventeen year old neice has asked to live with us you can find info on my previous questions asked my husband is leaning towards telling her no i am very torn i just can not see leaving her in the situation she is in and the thought of calling social services on the family really bothers me i really do understand that is a possiblity in helping her what other ways can i help her do i pull her dad aside and start a conversation with him about what is going on do i do it with both parents even though that risks a verbal and emotional attack on my neice how do i handle this i feel like time is running out and i am really torn it would be a lot to take on to have her move in with us as i have three children eleven and under and the oldest has asperger's a type of autism she would need counseling support rules and curfews and all sorts of stuff not to mention the basics like love and understanding and trust what should i do when you're standing before god do you want that on your conscience that you could have helped another human being in there time of need but you chose to say no because it would be a nuisance she's family she's reaching out and wants help that she's clearly not getting from home and you're thinking about shutting her down again a person can only be shut out and have a helping hand snatched from their reach before they give up i know that you have to consider your own family's happiness and health as well but think of the lesson this will teach them what it means to truly help someone out in their time of need they will adjust if i was in your situation and i knew the girl wasn't violent towards my family already living at home i would take her in this girl needs you the fact that your torn means you're considering it and a good person at heart don't let your husband talk you out of a doing something that could save this girl good luck edit just read your other question i would confront mom and dad together and tell them what their daughter told you tell them that cutting and depression are not to be taken lightly tell them that with their help you'd be willing to take their daughter in and get her the help she so desperately needs it sounds like they ignore and dislike her for whatever personal twisted reasons they may have she's better off with you but if you need their assistance for insurance etcetera confront them in a non emotional non confrontational way and say hey you can't help thats fine i will but i'm going to need some legal matters settled first good luck and god bless you for trying  Social rule Asperger syndrome Autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story EastEnders Kodocha Babe Ruth Controversies in autism God Emperor of Dune Plame affair Scientology beliefs and practices The Death Gate Cycle About a Boy She Loves You Pitaten Blood on the Tracks Hey Jude Autism rights movement Dead Like Me One Tree Hill (TV series) Fathers' rights Past teachings of Prem Rawat Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show The Marshall Mathers LP Extreme Programming Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Good Times Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Time Out of Mind Charmed Narcissism Knots Landing Scenes from a Memory Obi-Wan Kenobi Predestination Microeconomics Infantilism Big Brother (USA TV series) Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Anorexia nervosa The Amber Spyglass The Subtle Knife Great Teacher Onizuka Ethics Meaning of life Theodicy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Humphrey Bogart Goodness and value theory Grandview, U.S.A.

goodie bags or no goodie bag that is the question for year old girl's birthday party i've been looking online for pre made goodie bags but they all seem like they're either too remedial for year olds or they're way too expensive for a bag of plastic toys that will likely break or get thrown away maybe by this age goodie bags should no longer apply i'm not sure does anyone have any goodie bag ideas for this age group or perhaps any ideas on one gift item in lieu of an entire bag of crap there's no party theme we are going roller skating there will be about children mostly girls i would forget the goodie bags for year olds and instead take a lot of photographs candid as well as some posed you can then create a collage or scrapbook for your daughter and send the guests a picture or two of them with your daughter enclosed within the thank you cards it could be either plain photos or digitally enhanced with borders etc i think that would be more appreciated by this age range than a goodie bag  Child pornography National Day Parade Driver's license Shoe Traditional animation John Cleese EastEnders Credit card Customs and etiquette of Japan The Prisoner Japanese tea ceremony Plastic Genericized trademark Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stereoscopy Lewis Carroll Copy protection Digital photography 7th Heaven Dice Photography Live 8 Bong Collage Loch Ness Monster Sgt.

how to find a denim jean to my size i am normally my mom chooses most of my dresses now she has given me the responsibility to choose on my own i am really proud but need some advice how to choose my size with some thing decent and fit me perfect i am particular that mom should not yell at me for what i buy lol so that i can get her trust to make my choice of buy every time thanks well its important to try things on in the store before you buy it this way you can see how it looks and fits try on several pairs in your size and nothing that fits too tight nothing too loose either how about asking the store clerk how they look on you make sure you keep the reciept so you can return them in the event that your mom doesn't like them and before you try on the pant to show your mom say mom if you don't like them i will return them ok good luck meg  Jeans The Adventures of Pete & Pete My Life as a Teenage Robot Shit Quicksort The Apprentice 2 Mr. and Mrs. Turner Hash table Brigadoon Clown Poker jargon Denim Diving suit Trousers Kim Possible American Dreams Punk fashion Calvin and Hobbes RuneScape quests Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Tag Piccolo Junior Saga Phoebe Buffay's songs Xiaolin Showdown Trailer Park Boys Bart chalkboard gags Minor characters in Seinfeld Family Guy Pantyhose Great Teacher Onizuka Mattress Laura Schlessinger The Inside Small business Sock The Fairly OddParents Disturbing Behavior The Warriors Shaggy dog story Recurring South Park characters Cosmo Kramer Badminton Humphrey Bogart Teen Girl Squad Theodicy Minor characters in Morrowind Kyle Broflovski Marilyn Monroe CPU cache Jackass: The Movie Undergarment Best Buy Luck Ethical consumerism Treehouse of Horror V Animal Crossing Microeconomics Pok__mon Live!

why do some women have things against men as a whole has the media changed the way you look at us there is always women on t v and stuff having a go at us as if we as a whole are animals and wrong all the time and that you are always hard done by please tell me this is only a minority of ladies today in america tv is geared towards mainly women and tv shows cater to women and frequently depict men in a bad light basically with the exception of a few channels specifically for men tv is a big vagina with rabbit ears this reflects a larger female bias in american society where there are many double standards and inequities that favor women over men on the majority of tv shows men are usually depicted as hapless jackasses that can't do simple everyday things for themselves like cook or clean they are insensitive unable to care for their children and just overall useless slobs while women are portrayed as calm collected smart and always having to step in and get things done when their slob husbands fail see everybody loves raymond as a prime example of this another common element in tv shows is how the women are usually more attractive than their husbands see the king of queens everybody loves raymond and 'till death as prime examples of this advertising routinely uses this distorted view to sell products that are marketed towards women examples of the use of common male stereotypes that men can't cook won't do housework or won't repair things around the house are to numerous to mention again art reflects life and in a society that is heavily biased in favor of women it isn't too surprising that television would be the same to jillian h no entire group or gender automatically deserves respect respect is earned on an individual basis when you talk about people respecting women what does that mean why are all women somehow deserving of respect in your mind i know plenty of women that deserve absolutely no respect at all to kovasmomma your husband does more than you realize for you and your family do you realize that all of you and your children's material needs are provided to you you do not pay rent utilities pay for groceries pay for clothes shoes or car and insurance payments all the necessities of life are provided to you i don't think that ensuring that he comes home to a hot meal folded socks and living children is such a bad tradeoff considering what you get you even admitted that when you both worked he helped out around the house he doesn't now because once you stopped working keeping the house became your job i don't mean to belittle what you do because it is a lot of work but you have to compare what you do and what benefits you get another non monetary benefit is that you have the opportunity to experience firsts with your children that your husband will have to hear about secondhand or on film being a stay at home mom you will most likely be on hand to see your kids first steps hear their first words watch them get on the school bus for their first day of school his working at the office everyday affords you the opportunity to see those things and this benefit should not go unappreciated as for dealing with rowdy children you went into that with your eyes open you knew before you had them that you would be caring for them after the first one you had a pretty good idea what caring for a child would entail and if you thought that it would be too much work for you to handle you should not have had so many kids women have the final say in whether they have a child so that is completely on you  Microeconomics Economic inequality Theory of conduct Advertising Insurance Transsexuality EastEnders Japanese tea ceremony Law of value Capitalism Pitaten Poker jargon Strap-on dildo Gender role Social rule Human sexual behavior Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blackjack Hillary Rodham Clinton Milton H.

do you know anything about this my year old daughter came in from school today and her arm was really red i asked her what had happened and she said that she had been digging her fingernails into her skin i asked her why she would do that and she said because i am half emo i dont know if that is spelled right i have never heard of that before so i asked her what is half an emo she said that it is people that like to cut their selves i ve never heard of it being called emo ive always heard it being called cutters anyway she said that she has some friends that are emo and that she is falling into peer pressure but she said that she would never cut her self with anything but im worried her going from scratching to actually cutting her dad and i sat her down and had a long talk with her about peer pressure she said that she would never do it again but im worried that she may actually end up cutting any advice would be appreciated sorry this was so long but i wanted to explain everything thanks for reading the term 'emo' basically lost it's entire meaning it used to represent unique now it represents gothic black hair teenagers who cut themselves grow their hair long listen to gothic music write sad poems about how they want to die etc that's not very unique is it she shouldn't have friends that are like that in the first place definately friends who fall into peer pressure and maybe she should consider talking to them on what that pressure is doing to her her friends i'll give you a thumbs up for discovering that in the first place so she considers herself a half emo i know someone who calls themself an emo she's really happy all the time and i'm not sure if she cuts but she follows the whole black nail polish and mascara thing i guess kind of unique so i consider them a half emo if she says that she'll never do it again i think i'd trust her on that just do some check ups on her if she decides to cut again look for places such as the bottom of her wrist common well that's basically all i know sorry if it wasn't enough you can check more out here http en wikipedia org wiki emo slang best wishes to your daughter  Emo Shaggy dog story Hair Social rule The Inside High school subcultures Theory of conduct Kodocha 21st Century Emo One Tree Hill (TV series) House of M Singlish Time Out of Mind Milton H.

this is just something i'm wondering about not something i'm going to do i know that teenagers who get pregnant on purpose are stupid and need reality checks but what if a teen got pregnant on accident like if their birth control didn't work or something would you still think they were bad people do you think it's fair that some teenagers get treated badly for making a mistake i dont think that any teenager who gets pregnant is a bad person really i jus think if it's planned it may be a bad idea or not the best situation for the baby every child on this earth is a blessing from god whether that child belongs to a married couple or to a young teenage girl i wish more people saw it the way i do  Pregnancy Situation comedy EastEnders Teenage pregnancy One Tree Hill (TV series) Days of our Lives Marriage Phoebe Halliwell Lucille Ball Hollyoaks Runaways (comics) Incarnations of Immortality Friends Jennifer Lopez Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Infantilism Abortion debate Horus Adolescence Neighbours Mr. T Birth control Married... with Children Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rocko's Modern Life Diana Ross Alois Hitler Mama's Family Street-Legal Joseph Jackson Teen drama Full House Anne Boleyn Lex Luthor Knots Landing Rais massacre One Life to Live The Golden Girls Charmed Randy Jackson (musician) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sharon Tate Donna Summer Goodness and value theory Prenatal diagnosis Series finale Ayyavazhi mythology Little Britain Father's Day (Doctor Who) Kim Possible Statutory rape History of sex Roe v.

what is raising a bipolar adhd teenager like kids answer too my year old son has bipolar and adhd as he gets older some characteristics improve others worsen the past few years have been rough can anyone tell me their experiences with teeneagers with either both disorders i would love to hear from kids too i had add growing up and my mom had me on rytalin for years and it caused severe depression and muscle spasms in my neck that even today cause problems medication should be a short term thing to help kids adjust to focusing techniques and not as a permanent solution i remember getting made fun of at school not only by kids but by teachers one girl in rd grade refused to sit next to me because i made a noise when my muscles would spasm and the teacher told her i know she sounds like a pig grunting but you have to deal with it that was years ago and i sill remember it clear as day my older brother and sister finally told my mom she needed to take me off the medication and she finally did by this time i was so used to not having friends that all i could do was focus on my school work eventually i got friends and i was making decent grades but no one not even my teachers thought i would amount to anything i proved them wrong and became a military working dog handler in the usaf i have an a s in criminal justice and i'm working towards my b a in biology there ae certain thing that i do now that take me back to my horrible child hood and i think about if i would have done those minor things if i didn't suffer from add i know it will never go away completely but i have found ways to deal with it my best advice would be to see a therapist and see about a group therapy session so that your son knows he isn't alone it also helps for a kid to have someone to relate to don't give up and don't rely solely on medications  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stuttering Medicine Transsexuality Neighbours Adult attention-deficit disorder Milton H.

scared of pysicals going into seventh grade have to have a physical in two days what exactly do they do i don't want any shots ughhhh just thinking about blood totally creeps me out anyone had their physicals so i know what to expect i'm a girl ugh did i forget to mention that and i've heard from others that you might get a shot but thats all i was worried about thanx spunky girl i think u mean shots not shorts lol i just found that somewhat funny and i had my tetnus shot in november of so do i need another one they are pretty easy just long uusually the doc just has you get at least partially undressed with a johnny on and checks your lungs heart blood pressure heigfht weight reflexes etc they ask you if yuo have any probs with anything and just basically check you over for basic stuff its kind of like a baseline to compare you to when you get sick throughout the year they can look back at your physical and see what your normal answers responses are so they can tell the extent of any sickness you might get you are old enough though that they may do a breast exam i'm not suer when they start thopse but be prepared if they do they basically would have you lay down and would put pressure all over your breasts to see if you have any lumps anywhere just look at the ceiling and try to relax if you don't get this at this appointment you probably will in the next few years as you get older you should preform breast self exams to watch out for cancer so this is a part of that as for shots i believe tetnus is only once every years you might have to get mmr or something i remember at that age i had to show my school proof that i was immune to measles and that's why i didn't have to get that shot just don't look and relax your arm it hurts less if you relax good luck  Prostate cancer Cancer Social rule Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

why are teens in such a hurry to get old i'm and i'm just fine with being that age for now i have a roof over my head most of my bills paid for the ability to drive and see my friends often some responsibility but not an overwhelming amount and i still have a lot of freedom everyone else my age is eager to get out of their house and be on their own b c then they'll have freedom i dont understand why they want this we have the rest of our lives to be adults why do they want to stop being kids too soon i understand that some teens have a rough homelife and that could be a reason but many of the people i know that want to grow up faster have great lives at home they may not get along with their parents too often but when they're older they'll just have kids to fight with most teens mistake age for maturity so they want to be older and therefore more 'mature' they've learned or think that people respect others who are mature and so thats what they want to be others have a very tough home life and would actually be better off to get out of their homes as quickly as they can but they dont want to deal with cps or anything like that so they just want to get older so they can leave  Adolescence Puberty Pitaten Polyamory Grief Simone Weil Open Directory Project Homeschooling Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Second language acquisition Saved by the Bell Abortion debate The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Vegeta Transactional analysis Mennonite Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Billy the Kid Fast bowling Piccolo (Dragon Ball) M.A.U.R.I.C.E.

please help ok im and going to a new high school this year im soo shy i dont know what to do because of this because even when i went to my last school and knew all of the kids there i would goto the bathroom and not beable to leave it coz of me being so shy and worrying how i look can u please help thanxs in advance here is a video and pic of me video http s photobucket com albums z myprinceofdarkness action view current me flv pic http i photobucket com albums z myprinceofdarkness l ad b f e e jpg in the video i was just playing around going to a new school can be terrifying especially for girls and especially at your age when i was your age i used to worry so much about what other people thought of me i wore glasses and was scared that people would make fun of me i wanted to fit in and be liked so badly i moved to a new state and new school in the middle of th grade i was and let me tell you it sucked i spent most of my first day of school in the bathroom because i was so shy and i hated being the new girl i didn't have anyone to eat with at lunch and didn't want to eat by myself so i hid in the library looking back i wish i hadn't wasted so much time worrying once i finally stopped hiding in the bathroom i made friends pretty quickly i met people in my classes people who seemed nice and were willing to talk to me they introduced me to their friends and before long i had a group of people who i could hang out with or at least eat lunch with o i wasted so much energy and time worrying what people thought about me that i forgot to be myself and have fun as i got older into my later years of high school i started to realize how happy i was with myself i liked who i was how i looked how i acted i was happy so if other people couldn't accept that and like me then screw them i began to understand that what other people think about me isn't all that important as long as i am happy once i realized all this i started to really enjoy high school and i had a lot of fun i even still keep in touch with some of my friends from high school and it's been years you are a very pretty girl and you seem very nice and i know everyone tells you to be yourself and don't worry what other people think and i know that this is much easier sad than done i've been there going to a new school doesn't have to be scarry you can make it exciting this could be your chance to be whoever you want you get the rare opportunity to start over so don't waste it you say you are a shy person so try forcing yourself to step outside your comfort zone a little and don't spend your high school years hiding in the bathroom talk to the people in your classes try and make friends i guarantee if you stop worrying so much about how you look and if people will like and you start just being your wonderful self you will make friends you will be happy and people will like you for you  Shaggy dog story Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Pitaten The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Knots Landing Milton H.

do you agree that true love doesnt have a happy ending because true love never ends that is very profound in return i will give you a profound answer well i think that what you have just stated is very true true genuine love will last forever in conclusion to that idea true love will never have an end and because it will never have an ending the ending will not be happy or sad or bitter for that matter then there is the matter that many people think what they have found is true love so when their love turns sour they will believe that there is no true love because every love has a terrible ending in conclusion yes i do agree with you very much it may take a few tries but eventually i think everyoe will find true love without the ending xd  Meaning of life The Amber Spyglass Arjuna Epistemology The Brothers Karamazov Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theory of conduct Theodicy EastEnders A Course In Miracles Socrates Halting problem Vladimir Peter Tytla Bertrand Russell Pitaten Kurt Cobain Street-Legal Batman Beyond Objectivist philosophy Chobits characters Tristan und Isolde Sant Thakar Singh The Second Coming (TV) Church of Christ, Scientist One Tree Hill (TV series) Atomic Kitten Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism True Crime: Streets of LA Philosophy of science Merit James I of England Futurama (TV series - season 5) Aristotle Derek Parfit Summa Theologiae Belief Max Stirner Jewish eschatology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Exact solutions in general relativity Numerology Philipp Melanchthon Eastern Orthodox Church Knots Landing Richard Wagner Biblical inerrancy Origin belief Falsifiability Moral objectivism Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Altruism Martin Guerre Hypnosis Tidus Goodness and value theory Human Sydney Riot of 1879 Sly Cooper Determinism Paradox Paranoia Agent Discordianism Christianity Past teachings of Prem Rawat Four Quartets Adam Mickiewicz Justification (theology) Religion Goldstein's book Miguel de Cervantes Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Monomyth Alcestis (play) Islamic philosophy Cliff Richard Mary I of Scotland Wuthering Heights Adi Da She Loves You Hey Jude Darth Revan Kimi Finster Deconstruction Problem of evil Logic Economic inequality Jon Secada Mary Jane Watson Mathematician Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Family (Buffy episode) John Wycliffe Augustus De Morgan History of the British constitution Karen Horney A Day in the Life Current teachings of Prem Rawat Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ulic Qel-Droma Ludwig Wittgenstein

ok lot of people joke about being pregnant but what about those who do and are just looking for answers cause when we look y a answers for answers and all we get is comments on oh this age or that age is too young to be doing this or this its the fact that we are teens and yes i myself messed up i made a mistake i had a baby at who now i am the sole person that cares for him and people say you cant give a child a good future if you are this young yes you can all you have to do it try and talk to your parents when you find out oh yeah i am so fat let me tell ya sorry i aint on welfare never have been never will i work i live at my parents house i pay them to watch him and i pay rent i am trying to make it to where teen mothers can say hey look someone did it why cant i and yes i am online you can just im me when you want ok just because i use the word aint i get made fun of so great i have been called much worse by a lot more people k and second i never said it was something to celebrate its just that crap does happen ok and second at least i am trying to better myself and my sons its like people feel the need to say oh look their is a teen mother or father they must be on welfare or whatever then don't stop to think that just cause it happened does not mean that some of us are not going to take responsibility for our actions in our current western culture becoming a parent while a teenager is hardly recommendable and this is because our society has no real system in place by which a teenager can support himself or herself much less a child a teenager in the usa normally cannot find living wage employment nor can a teenager in most states get married if he or she is younger than aside from those two very daunting facts most of our families are ill equipped to handle a teenager bringing another child into the home typical american family finances are usually tight and both parents are most likely working then of course there's our victorian attitude that children are to be children and thus cannot be expected to be responsible for anything which is adult this victorian attitude incredibly effects our society because adults and parents take a half hearted approach in educating and mentoring our teenagers in america we have a tendency to grant a gross moratorium to adolescence sometimes to the age of we do a disservice to our teens and ourselves when we don't provide our adolescents the knowledge and skills to mature and also when we choose to avoid the sometimes uncomfortable tasks of teaching our boys and girls important moral lessons about love respect of self and others courtship relating to the opposite sex choosing a mate sexuality commitment to self and others how to be an adult how to work how to be married and care for a family etc yet the hard cold truth is this yes a teenage parent can handle the tasks of properly raising a child but not by himself or herself the teenager is going to require the support and dedication of his parents and others in his or her family as long as there is a supportive family a teenager can begin on the path of properly providing for his or her child working towards a day when he or she can become independent through personal financial means or marriage i truly recommend marriage over single parenthood as it is good for a child to grow up in a home which has both a loving mother and father i hope i've been able to help or at least given you a thought provoking answer i am glad to hear you have taken such a proactive attitude in caring for and learning to care for your child i am sure it has been difficult i am also happy to hear you have a family which supports you even if it's just moral support your life did not end because you had a child so young nor should you think your life has been permanently knocked off its rails you are perfectly capable of raising your child working and even earning a high school diploma and a college degree let no one say you can't better yet do not let yourself believe you can't  Divorce Abortion debate Sex education Sexual abstinence Infantilism Laura Schlessinger Pedophilia Adolescence One Tree Hill (TV series) Polyamory Same-sex

is this weird or does it happen to a lot of people my parents have never talked to me about sex drugs smoking drinking anything it has been my personal choice not to smoke or drink or do drugs they smoke and i have asthma so i think it's disgusting but i have found out most things about sex and a lot of other things through my older brother and sister they have pretty much talked to me about most of the things your parents would normally lecture you about my brother is the one who told me santa wasn't real and he made me understand what death was i'm now and i don't get along with my parents because it's like impossible for me to feel comfortable talking to them about anything anyone else's parents never talk to them about all that stuff i think what bothers me the most about it is i was molested by my mom's father until i was about years old they never tried to talk to me about it or help me understand what had happened to me of course i'm fine now i just don't feel accepted by my parents they kind of ignore me my sympathy goes out to you i can't say i ever really talked that much about those things with my mom but it's not like we avoided it altogether either my advice to you is to always stay close with your brother and sister it seems like they really care about you and look out for you maybe they can be like your surrogate parents as for your mom i can't believe she wouldn't do anything about that i wouldn't care if it was my dad you don't ever put your hands on my child in that way i would fight to have him put in jail honestly sweetie i'm wondering if your mom never talked about it with you because he did it to her and she has never told anyone  About a Boy Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Milton H.

is this fair to you please answer im and my brother is so its only two years really in a couple of months hes gunna be and i will be my brother is allowed to do just about anything he wants my mum will let him go into town on his own on the bus she'll let him go to parties even if she doesnt know the persons house it is and she'll leave in whilst we go away on holiday if he doesnt want to come my brothers even been to parties and got drunk at and had parties whilst my parents are away without them knowing im not allowed to do anything like that im not allowed into town on my own if my parents went away i would have to go and if i wanted to see a mate my mum would have to know them first iv never done anything behind my parents back and iv never got drunk or anything not saying i want to but why does my mum let my brother do just about anything he likes when he has done stuff behind her back before why does she not let me do anything like that for the first answer it does not matter if she can get pregnant and he can't if he did get a girl pregnant he would still be responsible for the welfare of the child just as much as she would be you need to sit down and talk to your mum about this if you really feel that you are not being treated the same way as your older brother you should bring this to her attention don't pick a time to ask when your brother is around wait until he has gone off to one of his parties or into town on his own then ask because then you have a real example of the double standard that is in your household ask your mum in a very nice non confrontational way about this matter don't give her a reason to be mad at you good luck  Little Britain About a Boy Shaggy dog story Social rule Friends Humphrey Bogart Atomic Kitten One Tree Hill (TV series) Ocean's Twelve Alois Hitler The Regina Monologues Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sharon Tate Stolen Generation Teenage pregnancy Knots Landing Theory of conduct The Young Ones (TV series) Game show Birthday Ted Kennedy Pitaten Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus It's Walky!

what do you think there's this gal that i like and have told her how i felt last year but she said she just wanna be friends however now i feel that some things have changed recently she showed more interests and there were more conversations between us there's this guy who asked her for bowling tomorrow but when his pal asked her about it i think it s about that if not what else she was just like acting stupid and said 'don't know' and they ve been asking this for a few days and every time she seemed rather clueless during break his pal was like bugging her and saying pity him lah later he'll cry and peered thru the window trying to communicate with her and when he mentioned the boy's name who liked her she just ignored him and gave a 'you're crazy' look seemed irritated and used her hand to signal that he s crazy then there's this classmate of mine who took her thing and gave it to this boy who passed by the room and she seemed so angry about it they rarely talk now never or at least much much much less than they used to a few months ago and this bowling plan i don't know how it's going what do you think of her behavior to this guy who likes her well it sounds to me like she doesnt really like him she ignores him and his friends and that is a bad sign it seems like she is getting aggravated with his friends if they are the ones who are asking her out for him then a girl gets really turned off about that because he should be a man and ask her himself maybe she is waiting for you to say something since there is more chemistry between you guys now i think you should just sit her down and have a heart to heart talk on if she likes him or what  Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Friends The Shining (film) The Ashlee Simpson Show Phoebe Buffay's songs Cliff Richard Blonde on Blonde Teen Girl Squad Social rule Great Teacher Onizuka Kodocha Salad Fingers She Loves You The Catcher in the Rye Knots Landing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Singlish Kim Possible Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ren and Stimpy Rod Stewart Conspiracy (TNG episode) Eric Cartman Humphrey Bogart Beavis and Butt-head Full Metal Panic?

i'm and have chronic pain i have complex regional pain syndrome relfex sympathetic dystrophy in my right leg i'm super frustrated because i feel so different from any other teens what can i do to help feel more comfortable and to help explain to my friends other teens when i'm in severe pain i've had my rsd crps for almost years and i've had many many treatments done which all have failed i have also been in phsysical theraphy which made my pain get worse and begin to spread i think you and i both know how difficult it is to live with rsd especially at our ages i'm pretty sure that i don't have any great advice on feeling comfortable in high school with this disease as i never achieved that particular victory however i did survive and graduate from high school and college as well with rsd over the years my approach has changed somewhat in high school i really didn't know how to let people know when i was in pain now i sometimes don't say anything and i sometimes just say something like my leg hurts when i feel it's necessary i guess i've decided that i'd rather not make a big deal out of it if i can avoid doing so like you i feel that it separates me and not so much in a good way sometimes it's unavoidable like if i need to ask if a certain activity is doable for me or if i need to explain why i have trouble walking then i generally tell people that i have a neurological problem with my leg if they want to know more i explain a little bit and tell them what it's called in nine cases out of ten people are fine with the first explanation my really close friends know more of course and i can tell them when i'm having a bad day ususally they can tell just by how i'm acting or how i'm walking i've explained it all to them pretty thoroughly and although they can't fully understand what it's like they accept that i know what i'm capable of and what i need part of this acceptance is simply maturity because i'm a few years older than you so are my friends and they've learned to accept what is different high schoolers are a little more judgmental which is a difficulty i encountered when i was your age and younger right now i'm in the position of having to decide how much about rsd to divulge to my new coworkers and the kids i will soon be responsible for as a part of my work a few know a bit and i think that they have all started to realize that there's something wrong with my leg i'm not sure if or when i'll go into detail about what rsd is right now i'm just careful about guarding my leg and my responses to pain when that fails i hope this helped a little bit remember you can talk to me about this stuff anytime you want you have my email address right b  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

talking to my mom about birth control prefer girls answer and probably moms i know some of you may be tired of my questions about my mother but i'm clueless when it comes to her anyway the reason i have been thinking about trying birth control is because i have weird periods heavy flows and unbearable cramps i have had sex i don't currently but it would still be a good idea if it happens the thing with my mom is we don't talk much we don't get along she likes to assume and yell i was molested as a child she never talked to me about it because it would have made her uncomfortable we don't talk about sex drugs alcohol anything i don't do any of those things and i'm an honor roll student and that is another thing she doesn't pay attention to it's usually a yep good job and she leaves the room i don't want her to get all upset and angry i just want it because of my periods and nothing else seems to work for me my doctor told me it was an option but my mom made that decision for me that was a couple years ago wow first of all i feel for you sweetie because i have been in both places first as a teenage girl with a very old fashioned mother who was seriously old school and then as a single parent raising three daughters they are now and and finally finally after many years of screaming crying fighting and general major drama we have come full circle and have come friends but there was a time when none of us got along and it felt like it was against me i feel sad that you were molested and that your mom couldn't talk about it with you but for what it's worth and not to stand up for your mom but it's a hard gig to be the parent of a teen girl she might feel horribly guilty because she wasn't there to protect you and maybe by ignoring it although she is hurting your relationship that's the way she keeps from going crazy from the guilt you don't say if she is a single mom or an overworked mom but those things have a lot to do with keeping a parent's mind preoccupied and worried like about the bills and how they'll get paid and how your job is going etc i am also sorry to say that there are very few parents who don't assume and yell we try to protect our children the best we can and sometimes unfortunately we overdo it and forget to listen or communicate i don't know if you know how she was brought up but if she was brought up by a parent who yelled and was generally uncommunicative she may be just imitating what she grew up with you sound like a super young lady and i would love to have a daughter like you you seem to have a level head on your shoulders as well please have patience with your mom one day you may be a parent and you can look back at this as a learning experience a hard one but a necessary one that said you don't need your mom's permission to go to a local planned parenthood and get on the pill at least not in california if that is really why you are going to get the pill then you should do it but know that they don't always work the first time you have to try several god bless you and keep doing well in school we all have to go through these trials while growing up  One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Knots Landing EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Kodocha Little Britain The Inside She Loves You Kurt Cobain Humphrey Bogart The Marshall Mathers LP Social rule Charmed Abortion debate The Catcher in the Rye Cindy Sheehan Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q Recurring South Park characters Infantilism Kim Possible Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Daria Le Malade imaginaire Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune Sin City Sex education Great Teacher Onizuka Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dawson's Creek The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Marilyn Monroe Good Times Child sexuality Theodicy The O.C.

is it normal for teens to go through an activist phase i swear i am i get all worked up about something but do little except research and preach to my friends would that even be considered activism activism is when you feel so strongly about a cause that you go out of your way to take part in changing what you feel is wrong with the world talking to people is activism because you are trying to teach what you have learned and plant that seed within others and i think it's normal for you as a teen to start to see that the way things are done isn't always the way things should be done and feel that you want to change it up until now you've learned to trust those around you and now you can see that there is wrong in the world and you want to right it  Theory of conduct Milton H.

why are kids so worried about what to wear for their first day of high school i see all these questions on yahoo answers about what to wear for the first day of high school whats up with that what you can't make an impression or make friends wearing non brand name clothes i remember thinking for days about what i would wear to the first day of class it wasn't so much about brand name but more about setting the tone for the whole year i guess i used to think that i could find the perfect outfit that would show how mature and beautiful i had become over the summer lol it just seemed like if i found the right clothes the year might start out perfect and yes i know it is silly to think an outfit can do that and i knew it then too but for girls at least sometimes we think there can be magic in our apparel i e cinderella's ball gown and the wedding gowns we spend thousands of dollars on i agree though that you can still make a great impression wearing non brand name clothes in fact some of the coolest kids i knew wore vintage stuff but i am guessing that even they spent a little time worrying about what to wear  Teen Girl Squad Prom Vegeta The Magic School Bus Recess (TV series) Black Cinderella TLC Barbie Shaggy dog story Clothing Little Britain Infantilism Skirt and dress Kimono Hilary Duff Springfield Elementary School Piccolo Junior Saga SMTV Live Legion of Super-Heroes The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Social rule Academia Avenue Q Son Gohan Empire Burlesque Court dress Good Times Michael Jordan Anne Boleyn High school subcultures Doug Friends Corset Whose Line Is It Anyway?

my friend has a baby and shes help my friend has a week old baby shes the babys daddy is and hes her best friend when she got pregnant and asked for help from him he denied that it was his baby what can i do to help my friend and to prove to everyone that he is the father sometimes it's better to focus on what you have control over rather than trying to force a boy into a situation he's not ready for or does want to be a part of it can just make things messier i think you should just focus on being supportive of your friend as a new mother it's tough business try not to make a drama out of the baby daddy situation and just stay positive about the precious gift your friend has been given hopefully the father will come around on his own but forcing the situation will only make it worse unless she's looking for child support then i think she'd have to take him to court to get a dna test even so i don't know how that would work for year olds good luck you sound like a good friend  EastEnders Tupac Shakur Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Babe Carey Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Billboard Hot 100 Situation comedy Sheryl Crow For Better or For Worse Father Sharon Tate Slow Train Coming Ray Winstone Infantilism Sean Combs Jon Secada Kodocha Shaggy dog story History of As the World Turns (1990-1999) Social rule One Life to Live John Lennon Everwood 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters AFI 100 Years series Ol' Dirty Bastard Love and Theft Bow Wow Wow Knots Landing Childbirth About a Boy Sin City Phil of the Future Fred Phelps Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Baby Blues David Blunkett Timon and Pumbaa Alois Hitler Sami Brady Hip hop rivalries Laci Peterson Comanche The Beach Boys Phoebe Buffay's songs Pitaten Care Bears Piper Halliwell Breastfeeding The Chemical Brothers Sex and the City The Fairly OddParents Clint Eastwood Abortion debate William Carey Reservoir Dogs The Care Bears (television series) Reggaeton Theodicy The Emancipation of Mimi Great Teacher Onizuka The Jazz Singer Neighbours In vitro fertilisation Elvis and Me Miscarriage of justice Fathers' rights All My Children Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Vernon Schillinger The Family from One End Street Harry Nilsson Los Rold__n Birthday Spice Girls The Ashlee Simpson Show Doug Extreme Programming Ben E.

how can anyone care soo much about what other people are doing i have a white bf and dont appreciate people pre judging us i mean i really hate it i dont care what other people think but it still frustrates me when random people give us dirty looks or even have the nerve to say snide remarks seriously if it nots hurting anyone how can people care so much about what other people are doing because a lot of people dont like change or things that are 'different' just turn the other cheek and soon enough they'll shut up if you keep responding to it they'll just keep doing it to get a rise out of you everybody has their own opinions about the way the world should work but it takes a mature person to realize that life is not burger king and you cant 'have it your way ' so only hang out with mature people and return those snide looks by kissing your boyfriend very publicly in front of them ever seen save the last dance great examples there  Jennifer Lopez Beavis and Butt-head Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Capital punishment Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Kim Possible Mary Jane Watson Theory of conduct Kodocha Anger management Everwood Rose (Doctor Who) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pitaten Rei Ayanami Eddie Guerrero Teen Girl Squad Chris Jericho Characters in the Smurfs Justification (theology) Social rule Embedded system ROC presidential election, 2004 Smallville (Season 4) Shaggy dog story Gothic metal American Idol Karen Horney Chicago Cubs The Death Gate Cycle SpongeBob SquarePants Shawn Michaels Page widening Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Richard Nixon About a Boy Saved by the Bell Things in Atlas Shrugged Characters of The Sandman EastEnders Stone Cold Steve Austin Hip hop rivalries Alignment (role-playing games) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Charmed Notting Hill Carnival Boston Public Angel Sanctuary The Empty Child Ranma __ characters Atomic Kitten Green Goblin John Howard Yoder Hillary Rodham Clinton Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Oh My Goddess!
