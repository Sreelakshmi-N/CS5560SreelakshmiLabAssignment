politically correct from pat lewis human resources director to everyone re christmas party date december i'm happy to inform you that the company christmas party will take place on december starting at noon in the banquet room at luigi's open pit barbecue no host bar but plenty of eggnog we'll have a small band playing traditional carols feel free to sing along and don't be surprised if our ceo shows up dressed as santa claus from pat lewis human resources director to everyone re christmas party date december in no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our jewish employees we recognize that chanukah is an important holiday which often coincides with christmas though unfortunately not this year however from now on we're calling it our holiday party the same policy applies to employees who are celebrating kwaanza at this time happy now from pat lewis human resources director to everyone re holiday party date december regarding the note i received from a member of alcoholics anonymous requesting a non drinking table you didn't sign your name i'm happy to accommodate this request but if i put a sign on a table that reads aa only you wouldn't be anonymous anymore how am i supposed to handle this somebody from pat lewis human resources director to everyone re holiday party date december what a diverse group we are i had no idea that december begins the muslim holy month of ramadan which forbids eating drinking and sex during daylight hours there goes the party seriously we can appreciate how a luncheon this time of year does not accommodate our muslim employees' beliefs perhaps luigi's can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party the days are so short this time of year or else package everything for take home in little foil swans will that work meanwhile i've arranged for members of overeaters anonymous to sit farthest from the dessert buffet and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms did i miss anything from pat lewis human resources director to all employees re holiday party date december so december marks the winter solstice what do you expect me to do a tap dance on your heads fire regulations at luigi's prohibit the burning of sage by our earth based goddess worshiping employees but we'll try to accommodate your shamanic drumming circle during the band's breaks okay from pat lewis human resources director to all employees re holiday party date december people people nothing sinister was intended by having our ceo dress up like santa claus even if the anagram of santa does happen to be satan there is no evil connotation to our own little man in a red suit it's a tradition folks like sugar shock at halloween or family feuds over the thanksgiving turkey or broken hearts on valentine's day could we lighten up from pat lewis human resources director to all employees re holiday party date december vegetarians i've had it with you people we're going to keep this party at luigi's open pit barbecue whether you like it or not so you can sit quietly at the table furthest from the grill of death as you so quaintly put it and you'll get your salad bar including hydroponic tomatoes but you know they have feelings too tomatoes scream when you slice them i've heard them scream i'm hearing them scream right now from teri bishop acting human resources director to all employees re pat lewis and holiday party date december i'm sure i speak for all of us in wishing pat lewis a speedy recovery from her stress related illness and i'll continue to forward your cards to her at the sanitarium in the meantime management has decided to cancel our holiday party and give everyone the afternoon of the rd off with full pay i really want you to have written this and if you did you are wasting your talents get a job with the bbc and bring laughter back to the united kingdom well done hours and hours of drawling through some of the abysmal dross on here and every decade or so we find a gem like this i wish it were in my power to give you a thousand stars as you can tell my enthusiasm is so great this is almost too close to my heart ex h r officer large corporation uk
