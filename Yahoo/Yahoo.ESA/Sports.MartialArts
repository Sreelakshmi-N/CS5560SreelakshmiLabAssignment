choosing the correct martial art for myself kali hello i am and am interested in taking up martial arts and am woudering which one would best suit me i am looking for a form that focuses on disarming and defending yourself one in which you are in control a martial art that focuses on knocking someone down or restraining them a bit like jason bourne i am not looking for any aggresive martial arts like muay thai and i was thinking fillipino kali which i believe is what bourne uses but i believe that is mostly involing weapons is this true i would prefer being unarmed myself and being able to disarm someone rather than both of us needing weapons all help is appreciated thank you in advance hi i'm boy roque a kali practitioner for about mons now your question caught my attention because of your age it is suitable at your age to start ptk training i would like to see the filipino youth take interest in our own martial arts i myself had wonder about in my younger day i tried karate muay thai and a few other system all of them are good don't get me wrong but pikiti tersia kali have something more to offer kali has been a part of our history even before the battle of mactan this system is the pride of the filipino warrior ancient or present ptk is the training system used by the force recon unit of our very own marines ptk involves a lot of weapons training which is the essence of the system you should understand that to disarm a weapon you should yourself know how to handle such a weapon to be really good at ptk is along and tedious process that requires dedication patience and years of training and practice training though strenuous could be fun with a supportive group which i'm very fortunate to have the manila pit bulls headed by sir rommel torla try to discover the system along with it discover the filipino pride good luck with your quest and i hope you'll find a fma system that will suit you god bless  Eskrima Mixed martial arts Muay Thai Jujutsu Aikido Chinese martial arts Taekwondo Tai Chi Chuan Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Jeet Kune Do Lightsaber combat Social rule Wing Chun United States Marine Corps Nunchaku Eagle Claw Yoga Culture of the Philippines Kickboxing Blood (computer game) Sagat Karate Ninjutsu The Book of Five Rings Grappling MS-06 Zaku II Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ninja Tantra Wushu Muay Boran Ayyavazhi mythology Confederacy of Independent Systems Mahabharata Theory of conduct Ranma __ characters Kung fu Scientology beliefs and practices RuneScape skills John Howard Yoder Korean martial arts Runaways (comics) Iraq disarmament crisis Extreme Programming Mobile Fighter G Gundam Kali Society for Creative Anachronism RuneScape AMOK!

who knows where good martial arts gyms are located i live nearsaint paul and looking for a place to learn martial arts like kung fu the best recommendation is to find out names and go shopping you want to avoid what are called mac dojos ask friends and acquaintances visit each dojo and ask if you can attend some classes you will be given the opportunity to see the style of the instruction and the kind of student they have at each find out the qualifications of the instructors and with whom they studied also important is how long they have been a black belt what degree they have and their teaching experience determine your own comfort level with the students and instructors at each dojo you will be engaged not just in learning a martial art but there is a social experience and interaction between instructors and students that can be very important  Martial art Aikido Shotokan Black belt (martial arts) Judo Karate Taekwondo Chinese martial arts Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Graduate school Tai Chi Chuan Mixed martial arts El Goonish Shive Kung fu Teacher McDojo Hapkido Double Dragon Funeral Koichi Tohei Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Dan (martial arts) Bruce Lee Sokaku Takeda Bowing (social) Education in the People's Republic of China Eagle Claw Education in the United States University of Maryland Baltimore County Homeschooling Master's degree American Kenpo Japanese tea ceremony The Karate Kid Education in Australia Jujutsu Shorin-Ryu Parachuting Choi Kwang-Do Eskrima Tekken characters Past teachings of Prem Rawat Kata (martial arts) Professional wrestling school Robert Garcia Kyokushin Ranma __ characters Martial The Book of Five Rings Hung Gar Education Martial arts film Professor Miyamoto Musashi Morihei Ueshiba Qigong Genseiryu Army Cadet Force Ryo Sakazaki Second language acquisition Education in Japan Academia Pushing hands Vovinam Drill instructor Shito ryu Kenwa Mabuni Air Training Corps Scott Shaw Education in Taiwan Harvard Division of Continuing Education Hogwarts subjects Community college GED University of British Columbia Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Stephen K.

weight training for mma fighter i would hit the gym about times a week to work on heavy weight training since like most males liked being very strong and look built i would also take a supplement called celltech every now and then i am a lightweight and i got quite big but then realized the muscle mass was slowing me down in my boxing the strength i acquired helps me push guys around while grappling but made me a bit slower my coach told me i don't need to lift heavy weights at all several guys have told me that bulking up will really slow down my boxing basically i want to know some of your weight lifting workouts i've been considering circuit weight training added on to my regular cardio workouts so what do you all do to keep strong and look muscular and roids are not an option yet remain speedy and fluid a few years ago i ran into the same question after talking with a couple of personal trainers and some close friends who are weight lifters i've come to this conclusion in essence your body is built to handle a certain amount of bulk while performing at your optimum speed and agility if you go beyond that then you will lose speed agility and believe it or not straight up hitting power even though by then you can bench press a city bus you are also more prone to muscle tear at a larger size especially when grappling i am technically a middle weight but a few years ago i was fighting heavy weights do to a rather large gain of muscle mass no roids just supplements i was getting my a handed to me all the time at that weight by both heavy weights and a couple of middle weights i lost alot of speed and hitting power from bulking up so i decided to try circuit training and uping my cardio huge difference after a year i was back into middle weight class and faster than ever i also looked better because the circuit training did more for toning than straight up weight training i was able to hit harder do to a better core work out from the combination of both circuit and cardio my advice would be tone what you've got find what your optimal weight is and run with it bruce lee or oscar de la hoya did not or do not look like punks but niether of them are what you would call big good luck  Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Bodybuilding Boxing Unreal Martial art Muscle The Contender (television series) Drill bit Internal ballistics Computer M16 (rifle) CPU design Weightlifting Terminal ballistics Knife Jet engine Armored Core Urinary incontinence Triathlon Boxing training Tank Mass Exercise Dog agility Heinkel He 112 Swingout Poker jargon Sport rowing Swimming Aerial (dance move) Piccolo Junior Saga Heinkel He 100 Explosive material Carburetor Passenger car 24 Hours of Le Mans Professional wrestling throws Rugby union positions Table tennis Skateboarding trick Car handling Puberty Professional wrestling slang Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

is too old is it possible for a person of years old to start practicing martail arts and hope to possabley compete in any programs not at all although the mma type fighting and training may be too much for you depending on what kind of shape you are in and how good your health is or has been that type of training and fighting requires so much more and so other types of martial arts like the traditional stand up ones may be a better choice for you injuries are less frequent in those martial arts and in many of the tournaments they have and the training does not take as much of a toll on your body not only that but on the naska and nbl national tournament circuit they have a division that is for competition as well as a and and above division now for all those that still want to compete you are also starting to see older divisions in the smaller local and regional tournaments since there are more people each year still competing as they get older  Mixed martial arts Martial art Chinese martial arts Judo Ultimate Fighting Championship Sumo Tai Chi Chuan Jujutsu Archery Aikido Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Karate Quizbowl Paintball Royce Gracie Football (soccer) Education in Portugal Rickson Gracie Playoff PRIDE Debate Qigong National Academic Quiz Tournaments Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Taekwondo Tekken Ultimate (sport) University of Alabama Tennis Lincoln-Douglas Debate Drum and bugle corps (modern) Kung fu Weight training Jeet Kune Do Auto racing University of Houston Muay Thai Bowing (social) Kimono Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eagle Claw Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Kalarippayattu Wing Chun Savate Appeal The Contender (television series) Magic: The Gathering Jet Li Black belt (martial arts) Dog agility Prisoner's dilemma Eskrima Swimming Silat Robert Garcia Wushu Akebono Taro YuYu Hakusho Tenkaichi Budokai Acupuncture Go ranks and ratings Randy Couture Hapkido Tekken characters Science Olympiad Quake III Arena Policy Debate Court system of Canada Sport in the United Kingdom National Provincial Championship Triathlon First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Copyleft Scuderia Ferrari Ice Hockey World Championships Wang Chongyang Kung Fu Hustle Kazushi Sakuraba Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game British Rail Class 42 Rugby union Kendo University of Illinois at Chicago Qi Football World Cup Computer Capoeira Poker jargon Paralegal Wanderlei Silva Bass guitar Domestic rabbit Education in Australia Frank Mir Tenshinhan National Basketball League (Australia)

advice for a beginner in martial arts i am going to soon start martial arts when i graduate high school i am going to move somewhere with a great program and go to college and train is there any advice for a martial art to start with to teach me to basics and princaples but at the same time is useful enough to set me up for later advanced arts depends on what you want if you want an emphasis on the psycholigical and spiritual aspects of martial arts or you want to learn cool looking moves like you see in the movies then look toward traditional martial art forms like aikido wing chun kung fu tae kwon do etc these styles are great for your physical and mental well being and if trained consistently will keep you agile and in great shape however despite what many on this site will have you believe most traditional martial art forms are not realistic for fighting or self defense check out www bullshido net for more info on the pros and cons of different art forms if all you care about is learning to fight and defending yourself i suggest kickboxing boxing jiu jitsu don't ignore the ground game and or wrestling these styles are much more effective in real life fighting situations because they require you to practice against live resisting opponents that's the only way to be sure you are able to execute the techniques against someone who is trying to hurt you for real keep in mind however that if you chose to get serious in one of these art forms you will get hurt if you're squeamish than it's not for you it all depends on what you want hope that helps edit hey adam the guy who called me an idiot a few posts down what do you suggest people do against multiple attackers i'll bet you would just bust out some chuck norris and spinning crescent kick all your attackers in the head and then finish them off with the touch of death you are obviously completely ignorant with regards to the real life combat effectiveness of various systems of martial arts and have no business answering questions or giving your opinion in a martial arts forum go back to your fantasy world of jackie chan movies and anime leave the real fighting to the big boys now for the rebuttal you can't learn how to defend yourself with choreographed moves life is not a kata i'm not saying there is anything wrong with learning katas just saying that they are not very helpful in learning real life self defense i know this from experience i studied tkd for several years and learned many katas unfortunately we didn't do much sparring and no groundwork when i started college i joined an mma school because it was the closest thing available i learned quickly that i did not know how to fight the only way to learn how to fight is to practice live and full contact there's no way around it it's just like anything else you learn by doing it you wouldn't expect a boxer to become pro by punching a bag and shadow boxing i don't understand why people think they can train forms and practice against non resisting opponents and automatically kick someone's ass do they think when the time comes i will magically know how to defend myself because i have practiced these movements on someone who just stood there and let me hit him sorry it doesn't work that way as for weapons attacks i mentioned in a previous post that krav maga is a good style for learning how to defend yourself from knife gun or blunt object attacks however this system alone is inadequate because many of its other attacks are too dangerous to be practiced on a live resisting opponent if you can't practice them live then you don't know if they work as far as multiple attackers first i suggest running if you can if you must stay and fight than i stand firmly by my previous answer train kickboxing boxing wrestling and jiu jitsu there is no great way to train for this just learn how to fight the crap you see in the movies does not exist you're not going to knock people out one by one with flying spin moves and pitter patter strikes i apologize if i have offended any of the traditional martial artists on here except for adam you can go fight a real kickboxer and see what happens and sorry for hijacking your thread tyler i just couldn't hold back  Eskrima Professional wrestling attacks Wing Chun Kata (martial arts) Goju Ryu Capoeira Krav Maga Jeet Kune Do Punch (strike)

martial arts types what is the most realistic martial art that could be used as self defense is a real world situation in a nutshell any system or style that teaches with a real world application it'll take some hunting for you to find what you are looking for because no one style that is taught will have the same approach hypothetical example a tkd school in one city will not have the same feel and approach as in another the instructors are different and may apply what they know in a different direction some schools teach for money and sport while other are training for combat it's really up to the instructor i've met some very capable and smart tkd instructors and i've met some pompous and pathetic bjj and mma instructors who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag with a scalpel summary look to the reputation of the school and to the training philosophies of the instructors if they practice real world situations from weapons to empty hand to ground work and deal with multiple attackers and gang mentality then you're on the right track i hope this is helpful for you mabuay ang inayan eskrima  Martial art Eskrima Mixed martial arts Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Tai Chi Chuan Chinese martial arts Taekwondo Grappling Jeet Kune Do Krav Maga Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Judo Graduate school Wing Chun Musical Instrument Digital Interface Eagle Claw Kung fu McDojo Kung Fu Hustle Vovinam Bruce Lee AMOK!

now i've been watching some fights and i see how people kick someone in the leg and from a kick to the leg the person falls down where how do you have to kick in order to get them to fall down getting someone to fall down from a kick isn't really an intentional thing its more of a really good bonus it would require almost inhuman timing and accuracy to do it whenever you wanted to it happens when the person has most of their weight on that leg and you kick them in the back of the knee so that you contract their tendons and force that leg to collapse you can try and see how it works by tapping someone in the back of the knee while they're just standing or haave someone try it on you if your weight is balance between your two legs you might stumble but you shouldn't fall like i said falling happens when all their weights on that leg if you're trying to do it it only works about once every times sometimes it just happens when your aiming for the thigh and miss the other thing you might be thinking of which is much more consistant is called a sweep a sweep does look like a kick but its actually more of a block trip what you do is move them push them so that they have to step to keep their balance but then you stick your foot in the way so that they cant take a step you block their step its hard to describe you'd have to get someone like a wrestler or judoka to show you its actually harder to do if you think of it like a kick though it really does look like one  Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Skateboarding trick Swingout Casualty lifting Glossary of ballet terms Powerbomb Glossary of partner dance terms Charleston (dance move) Marching band Breaststroke Muay Thai DDT (professional wrestling) Guilty Gear Backstroke Biped Judo Circle (dance move) Glossary of climbing terms Piledriver (professional wrestling) Batting (cricket) Jazz dance moves Volleyball Figure skating Suplex Professional wrestling slang Butterfly stroke Backbreaker Glossary of American football Shaggy dog story Shoot boxing Big Apple (dance) Swimming Lightsaber combat Trapping Parade (military) Fast bowling Piccolo Junior Saga Water polo Side pass (dance move) Neckbreaker GunZ The Duel Front crawl Rugby union positions Wing Chun Weight training Chair Pump It Up Wrestling Goju Ryu Dressage Professional wrestling 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Boxing Field hockey Boston crab Cross-country skiing American football strategy Bass drum PRIDE Suicide methods Extreme Championship Wrestling Theory of conduct Shawn Michaels American football Pole vault Proprioception Lindy Basic Horizontal bar Tai Chi Chuan Kick Internal ballistics Clean and jerk Theodicy Ice hockey Punt (boat) Naruto jutsu Goaltender Dropkick Lindy Hop Childbirth New York Jets Tango (dance) Chris Benoit Sugar push Mojave people Indiana Pacers Rugby union Ric Flair Canadian football Capoeira Football (soccer) Terry Bogard

how long does it take to achieve black belt in htf taekwondo i am a white belt and i am getting ready to get tested for my yellow belt how long will it take me to achieve my black belt i just stated taekwondo about a month ago relax and don't worry about the belt if you focus on a piece of cloth instead of truly understanding what you're being taught you will be cheating yourself expect years minimum at most schools less than that and i would get a little worried about moving up too fast if you really want to learn and be an instructor then just focus on understanding the techniques you are taught well enough to explain them to everybody else remember people who know absolutely nothing about tkd will be coming to you for instruction and help it will be your responsibility to lead them down the right path and not let them down best of luck to you stick with it and you'll do great  Taekwondo Martial art Choi Kwang-Do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black belt (martial arts) Hapkido Aikido Nunchaku Judo Tai Chi Chuan International Taekwondo Federation Past teachings of Prem Rawat Reiki Tenshinhan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Capoeira Shotokan Karate GED Vovinam Scientology beliefs and practices African American Vernacular English Milton H.

what martial arts are good for multiple attackers wondering what martial arts work good for self defense against multiple attackers i looked into aikido but it seemed to be more of a spiritual art then a proven method for self defense please recommend a few good martial arts i can get started thanks following the teaching methods of grand master helio gracie the gracie jiu jitsu academy was established in by grand master rorion gracie to provide the most effective jiu jitsu instruction in the world by giving students the elements to defend themselves as humanely as possible roice won the first of the ufc bare buckels tourneys and his brother rickson has a record of he never lost a fight most of the gracie jiu jitsu is tought for only street defence and if research the style you will see the the father as well as the brothers have hardly ever lost a fight so i''d say gracie jiu jitsu it dominates over all the martial arts  Jujutsu Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Royce Gracie Martial art Ultimate Fighting Championship Mixed martial arts Aikido Rickson Gracie H__lio Gracie Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira B.J.

about pressure points and martial arts well i know i'm not much of a fighter i only like to fight the way i know but there's a friend who learns martial arts and he used to learn also ju jitsu so he's practically unbeatable lool neway i don't want to hurt him but he always picks up with me and tries some new moves and sometimes he uses pressure points and i can't escape from it the last time he did a pressure point on my neck my neck hurted for a whole day i wanted to ask if u could give me some hints how to defend myself and how maybe to turn a bit the situation and do me something to him don't get me wrong he doesn t wnat to hurt me he only jokes but i always finish hurting and pls don't tell me to leave him cause he's a maniac or something like that i only want some advices to defend a bit myself and don't tell me to avoid fighting him cause i only defend myself plsss help me if u can well as long as you say it is under control then i would have to agree with the first statement made learn some pressure points as well in reverse counter moves are always the best when someone is at you and wont let you go you have to use self defense techniques that cause minimal harm and temporary with those pressure points to learn these though you should really have a physical teacher show you them safely one safe one i know is directly behind the ear lobes with your fingertips both hands on both ears hurts like heck while pressure is applied great for making someone let you go have fun learning but do find a teacher it is the best way to learn them safely  Martial art Mixed martial arts Aikido Jujutsu Social rule Aerial (dance move) Vegeta Tai Chi Chuan Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Diving YuYu Hakusho Breastfeeding Eskrima W.I.T.C.H.

what is the best way to knock someone out with one punch or just make them completely immobile looking for answers im a black belt in tae kwan doe fought internationally and have studied other disciplens including wrestling grappling first i would like to say that the human body is very brittle and it is very easy to knock someone out or even kill them with a strategically placed stike nearly anywhere on the body im just going to name a few simple methods to incapasitate someone in a defensive manner above the lip and below the nose is a cluster of nerves that can be stiked resulting in severe pain watering eyes and will immobilize your opponent briefly exercise caution when using this technique however because if you miss and stike the nose there is a possibility you will puch his nose bone into the back of his head puncture is brain and kill him you dont want that perhaps the easiest and most effective method is to simply strike the side of the neck there is a very large vain the jugular vain i believe that runs up to your brain along your neck use a knife hand stike stike with the side of your open hand and you should only need to do it once i would suggest practicing it on a brave friend its reasonably safe he will be knocked out for a few seconds hit him in the stomach kinda near the top of your abbs you can feel a tender spot thats your solar plex if youve ever had the wind knocked out of you you were hit in the solar plex a simple punch knee or basic kick will do to carry out this move those are the easist and really all you need to know for basic self defense purposes ive read a few other comments on hear and let me just say dont stike the throat you will sever the esophagus and basically suffocate them stiking the chin is very effective but a fair amount of pressure is needed as opposed to the list i gave you also there is a good chance you will break the jaw you dont want that keep in mind that you only want to incapaciate the attacker not severly injure or kill them if you have any questions on the information i gave you or would like to learn other methods feel free to contact me oh and practice these moves so your actually prepared  Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling throws Aikido Martial art Strike (attack) Mixed martial arts Jujutsu Eskrima Boxing Naruto jutsu Tenshinhan Diving Suplex Muay Thai Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers The Two Doctors Volleyball Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Carpal tunnel syndrome Fast bowling Hapkido Unreal Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Professional wrestling YuYu Hakusho Alexander Technique Autonomic nervous system Stomach cancer Stuttering Characters of Naruto Equine conformation Pressure point Combine (Half-Life 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Punch (strike) Professional wrestling match types Shawn Michaels Drowning Human anatomy Water polo The Book of Five Rings Worms weapons and tools Professional wrestling slang Judo Knife Muslim ibn Aqeel Stopping power First aid Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Table tennis Breastfeeding Weight training Swimming Guilty Gear The Dalek Invasion of Earth Seppuku Baseball Kurt Angle Suicide methods Gray Wolf Happy Tree Friends Oral sex Force powers Akuma (Street Fighter) Piccolo Junior Saga Traumatic brain injury Cognitive science Electroshock gun Tag InuYasha (character) Cephalic disorder Limit Break Brain Skateboarding trick Anchor Naval mine Battlebots Theory of conduct Hip fracture Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Final Fantasy magic Chinese martial arts Chris Benoit Grappling Glossary of partner dance terms Backstroke Spanking Cancer Terminal ballistics Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Neckbreaker

what martial art is tault to marines just interest to know thanks well above they gave you the technical term for it but where it got it's history comes from several art forms of martial arts in the beginning judo was taught to basic infantry men in ww as history gets closer to us now the military has taken aspects from several differant arts such as judo ju jitsu silat karate to name some today the good stuff is kept to the special forces most average training is taught in basic level techniques an th grader can learn they make it simple and easy so simple that is sometimes in my opinion is no longer effective the best thing i think though is that many already have had personal training in real life in martial arts before they joined and others take it up after they join and find a school nearby to train with i have had many marines and other military forces in our class programs  Martial art Aikido Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Chinese martial arts Jujutsu Mixed martial arts Karate Korean martial arts Kata (martial arts) Tai Chi Chuan Shotokan Silat Hapkido Eagle Claw Eskrima Bruce Lee The Book of Five Rings United States Marine Corps Taekwondo Genseiryu Military Ninja Wing Chun Kyokugenryu Karate Kung fu Tekken Ultimate Fighting Championship Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Muay Thai Air Education and Training Command Xingyiquan Black belt (martial arts) Education in the United States Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Education in Romania Recruit training Shaolin (martial arts) Goju Ryu Warrant Officer Zen McDojo Kalarippayattu Lisp programming language Grappling Structure of the British Army Martial arts film Sparring Virginia Military Institute Corporal Military science Military of the United States Infantry Steven Barnes Sword Royce Gracie Double Dragon The Karate Kid Japan Self-Defense Forces Commando Division (military) Art Graduate school Sport Choy Lee Fut American Kenpo CLAMP School Detectives Hung Gar Visual Basic Parkour Vovinam Military police Royal Marines Kenpo Homeschooling Education in Portugal Wang Chongyang Japanese tea ceremony Qigong BASIC programming language America's Army Regiment Kenwa Mabuni Motobu Choki Robert Garcia Stereoscopy Drill instructor Yang Guo (fictional) Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira M60 machine gun Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RISC Akuma (Street Fighter) Chuck Norris Kyokushin

is aikdo effective in real life fight there seems to be some soft akido which is more like a dance to the oth other end where i have seen it be brutal sharp hard and dangerous any thoughts aikido in my opinion tends to be naturally soft but it can be hard in some ways hard and soft martial arts or a combination of the two like goju ryu karate for example can be effective in fighting aikido has a lot of deep training in the mind it may not sound important but having the right mindset to use the right tactics and strategy work well for any situation whether you are fighting or not you use techniques to heighten your chances at getting a good outcome but being smarter than your opponent is an easy way to counter adversity such as less strength speed et cetera the techniques there's joint locking with some throwing mostly there's two major styles i've heard of ki aikido and i forgot the other one smacks forehead i don't want to go to wikipedia p most of the training is around learning how to use your opponents force against them for a throw or something to knock your opponent off balance in some way softness is about how the techniques are done by the way it's not style dependent nor does training have anything to do with it to some extent training style has a lot to do with whether or not training can be effective but regardless if that is true or not practicality and ability are very subjective no one person can defeat an entire style just people within them it is effective but the training in some cases is not very good and that may or may not break a student of aikido i've had my experience sparring with a couple of them and a good student with good training can do a good job lawless you obviously know nothing about either art because a hapkido classes involve sparring almost all the time i knew that before i started the style guess what is included in sparring too throwing and grappling b if you knew how to separate the concept of martial arts style and training method you would say a smarter comment than omgz dat style duz not werk omgzzzzzzzzzz one eleven  Jujutsu Hapkido Mixed martial arts Goju Ryu Judo Tai Chi Chuan Chinese martial arts Eskrima Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Muay Thai Taekwondo The Book of Five Rings Grappling Professional wrestling holds Tenshinhan Lightsaber combat Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Akuma (Street Fighter) Sub-Zero Wing Chun Ranma __ characters Kalarippayattu Naruto jutsu Theory of conduct Kyokushin Social psychology Shaolin (martial arts) Genseiryu Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Eagle Claw Shotokan Bruce Lee Explosive material Consensus decision-making Sparring Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Social rule Chess strategy and tactics Choy Lee Fut Hatake Kakashi Wado Ryu Ninja Koichi Tohei Yoda Baseball Capoeira American football strategy Piccolo Junior Saga Password Music Neuro-linguistic programming Kata (martial arts) Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Redundant array of independent disks Meditation Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Computer chess Fast bowling Wushu Poker jargon Boxing Yagyu Shinkage-ryu Kung fu Experiment Force powers Vulcan (Star Trek) Ansatsuken Microeconomics Kumite Combat stress reaction Kenpo Scientific method MP3 Characters of Naruto Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Philosophy of language Parkour Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Drizzt Do'Urden Professional wrestling match types YuYu Hakusho Vovinam Weight training Cross-country skiing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tank

has tai chi ever been used for fighting i guess not but i saw this on pbs a tai chi master was studied carefully as he struck something and the force of the blow supposedly was very strong in fact they traced the motion of the tai chi master's body with sensors strapped all over his body the tai chi master was so quick that he would slip off the sensors as he made a movement it was amazing to see an old man move that quick and strike with such power has anyone ever seen this the martial artist jet li who starred opposite aaliyah in romeo must die did a movie long before he broke into hollywood it is a hong kong production about the founder of tai chi a monk called zhang san feng the monk left shaolin temple after a dispute with one of the senior monks and it was only after he left shaolin that he came up with tai chi he used it for fighting of course as he had several enemies after coming up with the art so to answer the question yes tai chi can be used for self defense  Tai Chi Chuan Jet Li Eagle Claw Wing Chun Xiaolin Showdown Bak Mei Kung Fu Hustle Aikido Martial art Guan Yu Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat) Choy Lee Fut Hung Gar Shaolin Shang Tsung Sammo Hung Sub-Zero Kung fu Chai Xianghua Eskrima Avatar: The Last Airbender Southern Praying Mantis (martial art) Bodhidharma Bruce Lee Xingyiquan Wushu Taoism Stephen Chow Jinyong Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Kowloon Motor Bus Martial arts film Zhang Sanfeng Culture of China Chinese martial arts Pushing hands Dragon Kung Fu Shen Gong Wu Hwang Jang-Lee Declared monuments of Hong Kong Shaolin Soccer The Book of Five Rings Kung Lao Force (Star Wars) Noob Saibot Islands and peninsulas of Hong Kong Qigong Kalarippayattu Yang Guo (fictional) Donnie Yen Yang style Tai Chi Chuan Cinema of Hong Kong Northern Praying Mantis (martial art) Pai Mei Shaw Brothers Studio The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Saber 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Jade Empire Wu style T'ai Chi Ch'uan Lightsaber combat Mortal Kombat Five Animals (martial arts) Hong Kong Hong Kong action cinema Yang Chengfu The Return of the Condor Heroes Ng Mui Chinatown Gosei Sentai Dairanger Karate Vietnam War First Indochina War Northern Shaolin (martial art) Wudangquan Quan Chi Lin Kuei Wuxia Soul Calibur Johnny Cage Miyamoto Musashi Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards House of Flying Daggers Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Jackie Chan Wong Fei Hung Yin Shun Qi Naruto jutsu Mandarin (comics) Professional wrestling match types Wang Chongyang The 36th Chamber of Shaolin Hip hop culture Tsing Yi

how to perform kick i tried all my best to do tornado but i don't know why i keep landing on my nonkicking leg all the time does any one who is martial art expert can show me how to perform kick properly please try this tutorial at trickstutorials com http www trickstutorials com index php page content t it took me a while to get it i think one of the most important things is getting enough momentum to swing around hard fast assuming you have an excellent tornado kick all you need is to generate enough torque for the kick to travel through so you can land on the same leg look up some tutorials videos on youtube you will see that some people twist in the opposite direction first then spin in the direction of the kick i think this method is best for people who have been doing the kick for a while but you should try whatever works for you another way to do it is to do a roundhouse kick very fast in the direction of your carrying that momentum to swing around and do the hope this helps  Aerial (dance move) Swingout Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling throws Skateboarding trick Kick Suplex DDT (professional wrestling) PHP Professional wrestling holds Helicopter Fast bowling HyperText Transfer Protocol Professional wrestling aerial techniques Tennis Muay Thai Mixed martial arts Volleyball Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Torque Martial art Charleston (dance move) Ajax (programming) Circle (dance move) Taekwondo Bicycle Lindy Basic Glossary of partner dance terms Horizontal bar Hapkido Capoeira Neckbreaker Spin (physics) Equine conformation Electrophysiology Robot Master Manual transmission Drifting (motorsport) Angular momentum Serve (tennis) Chinese martial arts Einstein-Cartan theory Web crawler Types of bowlers in cricket Naruto jutsu Vovinam Software engineering Dropkick 2Step Professional wrestling slang Balboa (dance) Tricking Shotokan Piledriver (professional wrestling) Diving Karate Aikido Car handling Spacecraft propulsion Precession Mario Lindy Hop Special relativity Cross-country skiing Side pass (dance move) BitTorrent Action potential Web design Bass drum Python programming language Glossary of ballet terms Momentum Wireless Application Protocol The Best Page in the Universe Backstroke Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Sonic the Hedgehog Punch (strike) C plus plus Swimming The Roundhouse Butterfly stroke Classical mechanics Cross site scripting Web server Uniform Resource Locator Computer-supported collaboration Nuclear magnetic resonance Pink Floyd Takuya Kanbara Miles "Tails" Prower Powerbomb XMLHTTP Coin flipping U2 (band) Devil sticks Field hockey Textile manufacturing Warez

muay thai training mat for the backyard i wanted to buy a heavy punching bag and other training equipment for the backyard the only thing is the backyard is full of dirt and grass making it hard to practice spin or leg kicks is there any kind of special mat you can recommend to lay over the grass one way to go around the dirt or grass would be to buy a about ftx ft sheets of plywood and lay them down next to each other like a puzzle then put a mat on top of it if you want a long term practice area then level the dirt and lay cement then put mat on top of that even though the dirt or grass gives you problems it may help you with your balance as well as leg strength in thailand in some fights they would use leaves or pieces of wood in their rings to add challenge to their fight some would practice in the rice fields where the water would be up to the middle of the shins the reason for a lot of this is to help build dexterity as well as excellent conditioning hope everything goes well for your training area i teach muay thai so if you have any questions feel free to email me take care muaythaimaniac  Muay Thai Mattress Martial art Shoe Professional wrestling holds Chinese martial arts Taekwondo Professional wrestling attacks Kickboxing Japanese tea ceremony Suplex Southeast Asia Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Textile manufacturing Wood Sant Mat Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Go (board game) Diving Rice Massage Akuma (Street Fighter) Rigging Chair Fast bowling Equine conformation Glossary of climbing terms Judo Volleyball Golf Bruce Lee Pok__mon types Professional wrestling aerial techniques Tennis Seismic retrofit Wushu Theory of conduct Airport RuneScape quests Adon Yerba mate MapleStory Professional wrestling match types Violin Building material Jujutsu Snooker Aikido Cuisine of Thailand Illegal drug trade Pikmin Pump It Up Weight training Swimming pool Piccolo Junior Saga Sagat Brewery DDT (professional wrestling) Shaggy dog story Belmont Park Kyokugenryu Karate Textile manufacturing terminology Sushi Infantilism Tai Chi Chuan YuYu Hakusho Mat Cauthon Skateboarding trick Thai language Hydroponics Laws of cricket M16 (rifle) Society for Creative Anachronism Scientology beliefs and practices Thailand Hay Stunt Chopsticks Euphemism Casting Sudoku Repouss__ and chasing Anchor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tobacco Motorcycle Grappling Sant Baljit Singh Tiger Woods Drifting (motorsport) Education in the People's Republic of China Hamster Climbing equipment EastEnders Shrimp farm Boxing training

question about aikijutsu i've been watching a few videos on it and i'm quite impressed however i've noticed that in the displays the person's attack being reversed is flipping his herself on purpose to avoid getting hurt so i was wondering in a real situation would the attacker's arm actually break since they would not flip on purpose or does it really and work they do flip the flipping is called ukemi or body protection this allows the technique to be performed with a lower chance of injury to the reciever or uke someone who does not know how to fall or perform ukemi would most likely sustain injury most falling injuries are caused by someone trying to put their arm on the mat to catch their fall which results in sprained dislocated wrists elbows shoulders or all three now that said some techniques can be crap when it depends not on uke protecting himself but on uke making the technique look good  Aikido Professional wrestling holds Ukemi Professional wrestling aerial techniques Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling attacks Powerbomb Piledriver (professional wrestling) Equine conformation Diving Volleyball Strike (attack) Amateur wrestling Swimming Mattress Mixed martial arts Fast bowling DDT (professional wrestling) Humerus Neckbreaker Weight training Boxing Archery Breaststroke Strappado English cricket team Spinal cord injury Punch (strike) Gesture Tai Chi Chuan Shawn Michaels Hip fracture Skateboarding trick First aid Glossary of climbing terms Dice Martial art Butterfly stroke Compiler optimization Ultimate (sport) Motion capture Tenshinhan Elbow bondage Backbreaker Wing Chun Chair Parkour Swingout Decompression sickness Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon Terminal ballistics Judo Computer animation Table tennis Spanking Drowning Softball Straitjacket Fencing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Coin flipping Piccolo Junior Saga Elbow-joint Glossary of partner dance terms Ice hockey Snowboarding Arm Bondage (BDSM) Shoot boxing Torture Repetitive strain injury The Shining (film) Blackjack Probability Canoe Suicide methods Land mine Alexander Technique Philip J.

is it easy to follow tia chi video's without being taught your best best is to ditch the video and find yourself a competent teacher which can be very difficult to do especially if you do not live near a big city be careful though there are a lot of people teaching tai chi chuan who are not very good most only know of its slow motion appearance and see it as a means for health there are places however where tai chi has been preserved in its traditional form and exists as means to develop power and exceptional mo gong good kung fu a video will only suffice for so long if you really want to learn this deep art i suggest googling teachers like chu gin soon vincent chu h won gim  Tai Chi Chuan Qigong Yang style Tai Chi Chuan Eagle Claw Kung fu Ho Chi Minh City Zhu Xi Wu style T'ai Chi Ch'uan Southern Praying Mantis (martial art) Aikido Sub-Zero Yang Chengfu Islands and peninsulas of Hong Kong Chinese mythology Wing Chun Falun Gong Cheng Man-ch'ing Baguazhang The Book of Five Rings Pushing hands Shen Gong Wu Wu Chien-ch'uan Force (Star Wars) Eskrima The Return of the Condor Heroes Simplified Chinese character Wu Kung-i Culture of China Bak Mei 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Chinese martial arts Meditation Sai Kung District Qi Mid-levels Prayer Sport Chu nom Kowloon Motor Bus Shotokan Zen Warring States Period Xingyiquan Jet Li Phan Chu Trinh Cangjie method Quan Chi Hogwarts subjects Yang Guo (fictional) Hong Kong legislative election, 2004 Mahjong Tai shogi Shau Kei Wan I-Kuan Tao Citybus (Hong Kong) Places in Singapore by alphabetical order Old Tongue Xiaolin Showdown Shang Tsung Current teachings of Prem Rawat David Carradine Spring and Autumn Period Socrates Shao Kahn Wushu Vietnamese language Hung Gar Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat) Declared monuments of Hong Kong Korean martial arts Reiki Karate Dragon Kung Fu Bowing (social) Chinese University of Hong Kong Taikyoku shogi Alexander Technique Chu-Han contention Jeet Kune Do Chu (state) Equine conformation Guqin Culture Northern Shaolin (martial art) Religion in Hong Kong Past teachings of Prem Rawat Choy Lee Fut IBM PC compatible Alchemy Wudang Mountains Scott Shaw Wu/Hao style T'ai Chi Ch'uan Terry Bogard Sant Mat Empress L__ Zhi Taipei Bilkent University Chai Xianghua

any legitimate website that teaches the basics of fighting at the moment all i know about fighting is that you tackle someone make a fist and then attempt to bludgeon them in the face repeatedly and also are there any particular fighting styles that are easy for novices to pick up quickly and are effective and most importantly that you can learn without signing up for a class you can learn any style without attending a class or having an instructor the difference is you can't learn it well without those things it's akin to watching ufc and thinking you'll be able to learn how to grapple it just doesn't work that way i would strongly advise against trying to learn to fight from a website you are only partially right about fighting as well not all fights begin or even end up with a tackle in fact tackling someone is a very risky maneuver not only are you setting yourself up for an attack but you're effectively putting your head at a good level to get punched and or kicked and you might end the fight for yourself to answer the second part of your question what's easy for one person may be difficult for another so that's hard to answer however dependant upon your personality and dedication you may find a style with a school close to you that fits you you would just need to seek it out i would advise checking out what's in you area and even if you aren't looking to master a style trying them out and learning some of one at the very least if you spend months training to fight you'll be much better off than you were before hand good luck in your search for skill and knowledge  Martial art Mixed martial arts Aikido Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Chinese martial arts Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Alexander Technique Tenshinhan Eskrima Taekwondo Fast bowling Theory of conduct Jujutsu Parachuting Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling attacks Social rule Capoeira Eagle Claw Tekken characters Graduate school Piccolo Junior Saga American football Ultimate Fighting Championship Hapkido Jade Empire Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Lightsaber combat Karate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Miyamoto Musashi Vegeta Shaolin (martial arts) Aesthetic Realism Jeet Kune Do Paragliding Fist of the North Star Royce Gracie Expert system Alcoholics Anonymous Professional wrestling holds Diving GED Volleyball Esperanto as an international language Tank Plame affair A Course In Miracles Naruto jutsu Akuma (Street Fighter) YuYu Hakusho Artemis Entreri Team Fortress Classic Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Reiki Education Jiddu Krishnamurti Blood (computer game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boxing Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Lebesgue integration Kalarippayattu Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of language Storyteller System Rugby league God Emperor of Dune American football strategy Consensus decision-making PRIDE Japanese tea ceremony Double Dragon Second language acquisition No Child Left Behind Act Carolina Panthers Autism Rugby union Visual Basic Drowning Rugby union positions Judo Tag Obedience training Quizbowl Xingyiquan Son Gohan Obi-Wan Kenobi Choy Lee Fut Scientology beliefs and practices Columbine High School massacre

i'm asking this question to anyone who knows anything about karate and tae kwon do i'm pretty sure but i want to be positive is it or is it not correct to call tae kwon do karate i don't think it is because karate is from okinawa and tae kwon do is from korea am i right or am i right thanks in advance yours truly d i'm pretty sure but i want to be positive is it or is it not correct to call tae kwon do karate i don't think it is because karate is from okinawa and tae kwon do is from korea am i right or am i right oh and please add anything that you know about the origin of karate if you have time thanks in advance yours truly d yes i know that i put my question in twice try to ignore that d karate comes from okinawa not japan karate did not make an apperance in japan untill when funokoshi was invited to teach karate in japan by the emperor karate developed in okinawa by combining the indigenous fighting art called te with teachings in combat from china it was originally called uchinade te which means okinawan hands it was also called tode which means china hand tode is also pronounced karate in the 's a decission was made to change the spelling from china hand to emprt hand to make the japanese people happy the karate that was taught to the japanese was not okinawan karate okinawan karate did not have deep stances and high kicks the japanese military mentality desired these and the okinawans that were in japan gave it to them this is the origin of shotokan this is when karate went to japan in the 's japan occupied korea many people from korea went to japan and among them was grand master hwang kee of tang soo do fame he brought karate from japan to korea calling it tang soo do it can be seen that the forms in tang soo do are very similar to japanese karate and okinawan karate in the 's the korean government wanted something uniquely korean so they mixed up the forms and called it tae kwon do this is the origin of the old forms later in the 's or 's the new forms were created the origin of these styles is easy to trace it is known that soken matsumura chief bodyguard to the last okinawan kings created pinnan and or as some people claim channan sho and dai naihanchi and passai sho and dai and gojushiho seisan is perhaps the oldest okinawan kata chinto cane from a sailor that was shipwrecked on okinawa and befriended matsumura kusanku comes from the teachings of kusanku a military atache to the okinawan government in the 's and grandfather of matsumura's wife these kata are found under different names in shotokan and tang soo do and they can be seen throughout the old tae kwon do forms now i am not saying that japan and korea did not have fighting arts of their own i am sure they did and that aspects of that were combined with the teachings of karate as it moved from place to place but even practitioners of these systems must be honest about their origins  Kata (martial arts) Shorin-Ryu Genseiryu Okinawa Prefecture Kenwa Mabuni Motobu Choki Anko Itosu Shito ryu Isshin-ryu Shaolin (martial arts) Ryukyuan history Kyokugenryu Karate Hapkido Wing Chun Uechi Ryu Jujutsu Kenpo Tai Chi Chuan Nunchaku Chinese martial arts Hangul Korean martial arts Tekken characters History of Korea Hironori Ohtsuka Okinawan weapon Muay Thai Chuck Norris Punch (strike) Korean name Confucianism Kenjutsu North Korea Kyokushin Korea Japanese American Baekje Chinese character Kobudo Hung Gar Tang Dynasty Japanese language Korean language Kickboxing Gojong of Joseon Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Peleliu Gando Ragnarok Online Jeet Kune Do Kumite Takuma Sakazaki Korea at the 2004 Summer Olympics Eagle Claw Zen Mixed martial arts Hanja Chojun Miyagi Japan Baseball Ethnic issues in Japan Korean Buddhism Military history of Australia Pyongyang Taido Seven-Year War Buddhist art Kick The Karate Kid, Part III Sanchin Choi Kwang-Do Masutatsu Oyama Kung fu Emperor of Japan Okinawan language Joseon Dynasty History of Japan Japanese people

is japanese jujitsu good self defense i spent a year taking jujitsu then quit the one thing i couldn't get past was who complicated it was joint locks are fine however you have to be able to manipulate someone into position in order to apply them any jujitsu people out there what do you think some styles of jiu jitsu are more complicated than others and it takes a while to learn how to do that as well as master other aspects if you watch a master he will go from one technique to another very easily and sometimes executing several techniques in just a second period and these techniques are in a logical order and performed as his opponent moves shifts and tries to counter or evade techniques so the master is taking advantage of the situation sometimes as much as manipulating or maneuvering his opponent this only comes after you have mastered a number of individual techniques and some of their variations as well as the counters for them fully and completely the point that i am trying to make here is that i am sure some of these masters had problems learning their art and all that is involved with mastering it i would take another look at it with a fresh set of eyes and see if maybe your approach to it was not quite what it should have been a year is not really much time especially if you are only working out a few times each week for only an hour or so to learn how to do this  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling holds Aikido Judo Professional wrestling throws Martial art Chess strategy and tactics Suplex Lightsaber combat Volleyball Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling aerial techniques Tenshinhan Marching band Central processing unit CPU cache Karate Database Extreme Programming Eskrima Bubble Bobble Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers CPU design Wing Chun Logic Bitwise operation Object-oriented programming Dog agility Chess terminology Strategic management Legacy of Kain Professional wrestling attacks Second language acquisition Electrophysiology Backgammon Hapkido Master's degree Contract bridge Blackjack Classical music era Expert system Graduate school Glossary of American football Milton H.

am i the only one who thinks mma is way overated seriously these guys are not pure athletes none of them would make it in any other sport most of them are upper twentys to yr old men who are still trying to prove they are tough the crowds at these events are such white trash they boo every fighter that comes out except in japan every ppv i have seen i never see a good fight im talking about a good high action competetive fight also ive noticed that these fighters dont get paid shit yet they all say they have a lot of boxing experience if that was true wouldnt they box instead this sport to me is an overated bar fight nothing more not to mention it seems that the entire sport is on steroids besides anyone who watch's half naked men wrestle is probably gay what do you guys think is this sport way overated to answer some of your comments dustin b let me add that chuck liddel was paid k for his last fight with rampage he is face of the sport meanwhile ricky hatten will make somewhere around mill his next fight and most americans can give a shit about him see the difference as for steroids well royce gracie mma legend was caught with steroids phil baroni was caught with roids and he was very obviously on roids his entire career and is just now getting caught sherk and the guy he fought for the belt both were caught for roids and thats just within the past few weeks as for athletes go you trying to tell me tim sylvia who ran the hvyweight division is athletic and i dont consider baseball players pure athletes either so are you comparing tim to an offensive lineman first off tim is no athlete and if you are trying to make that arguement you are nuts he just lost to a yr old man too offensive lineman are between and pounds and are going against the most athletic big men in the world so i dont see your comparison as the mma just booming that has nothing to do with fighters pay ufc makes assloads of money and they dont pay their fighters shit most of the guys you see get between to thou a fight as for the steroid thing i mentioned names in mma who are among the top known fighters in the sport and thought of as some of the best if mma seriously tested phil baroni would of been tested positive years ago he has always been on roids should i add wvandlei to that list too of known fighters who roid there is an obvious difference between someone on roids and someone not on roids and yes i do consider men in tights with their legs around each other real gay tone a mma fighter can compete in boxing because in boxing you lose all respect when you quit also boxers dont have the luxary of laying around on the ground which many mma fighters do while they catch their breath plus boxing has one of the best drug testing programs and in boxing you actually have to have to be able to take pain theres no count in mma and if your in a hold you can quit basketball is tougher than mma yawn i've heard all this crap before thanks for putting it all together at once a baseball player would never make it in football does that mean he's not an athlete if you really think gsp isn't an athlete you're kidding youself crowds go to philly and tell me that they're a nice clean crowd no sport has super respecting crowds huerta vs garcia wasn't a high action competitive fight watch pro wrestling if you want more k a fight is shit how much do you make they don't all say they have alot of boxing experience the sport is still growing and no fighter has complained about his salary in the ufc if it's just a bar fight than anyone can do it right then why do some people win more than others steroids huh everyone on the planet is roiding i suppose i've said it before and i'll say it again if you're so immature that you think one guy punching another in the face is gay that's your problem you should try not making things up if you want to be taken seriously  Martial art Ultimate Fighting Championship Royce Gracie American football New York Giants Boxing

whats the best martial arts class for street fights possibly jujitsu or any other ones like wrestling hmm not sure if this is considered martial art most likely in street fights people end up fighting really close to each other so anything that puts some emphasis on close combat will help in those situations wrestling and other stuff will also get you stronger since you cant really practice them without lifting or trying moves on another person  Mixed martial arts Jujutsu Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Professional wrestling Judo Korean martial arts Shaolin (martial arts) Professional wrestling match types Jeet Kune Do Aikido Royce Gracie Grappling Bruce Lee Eskrima Teen Girl Squad Antonio Inoki Professional wrestling holds Wrestling Computer and video game genres Professional wrestling slang Savate Amateur wrestling Professional wrestling throws Wing Chun Pankration Jade Empire Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Muay Thai Eagle Claw Naginata Capoeira Historical European Martial Arts Sambo (martial art) Professional wrestling attacks Parkour Krav Maga World Wrestling Entertainment First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Ken Shamrock Kung fu Frank Mir Shoot boxing Ultimate Fighting Championship Taiwan independence Medieval reenactment Fighting game Sword Chun-Li Goju Ryu Tag team McDojo Skateboarding trick Eric Bischoff Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan) Karate Yiquan Wushu Professional wrestling promotion Sport Kung Fu Hustle Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling The Wrestling Channel Piledriver (professional wrestling) Sport in South Korea Ryu (Street Fighter) Tekken Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tank Vovinam Xingyiquan Akuma (Street Fighter) Suplex Pancrase Boxing Schutzstaffel Wuxia Society for Creative Anachronism Southern Praying Mantis (martial art) Taekwondo Tamil people Bodhidharma Pacifism Zangief Ranma __ characters David L.

is it possible to become good at styles of fighting in months i have a small boxing background now i am trying to incorporate in order first to last tae kwon do aikido ju jitsu mauy thai kali into my arsonal if i train months on each style is it possible to take away what i need from each one then make the transition into training one on one with a mma sparring partner if not how long should i train each one minimum time until i can be good and remember what i learned and know egnough to consider myself rounded in that style with all do respect to all martial systems tae kwon do is not going to help much if you want to fight mixed style mma if you seach around or talk to many fighters in different styles you will find a common opinion that tae kwon do is not for close contact fighting though i repect the art and wish like hell i could spinning kick like some of those guys it won't be much use to you in close quarters fighting it's an art developed to knock riders off of their horses by kicking them during a suprise attack muay thai should be your kicking style add some sanda kicks if you can find someone to teach you similar to mauy thai but faster and not quite aspowerful generally but the muay thai leg is the one to use months in each style is not nearly enough unless you are living and training hours a day for that period even then you will not absorb the system in any real depth i have tried to do exactly what you are hoping to do it doesn't work even when you are living and breathing it new movements take a month at least before they become comfortable and natural and a year before they are second nature i know this varies person to person but i am what i would consider and people i train with and teach as well to be a gifted martial artist months a system is not enough forget aidkido that's against the philosophy of the art the 'do' means it's a system of harmony for study jitsu or jutsu means it's for application juijitsu muay thai and kali or escrima if you can find it will be the three to focus on for ground fighting grappling stand up boxing long range and hand work if you have months do months of each like the guy posting before me said together is better than one after another and then spar and apply with a partner i would even suggest more jiujitsu and mau thai together and a little kali once your foundation in those is laid you will pick it up faster after becoming fluent in jiujitsu's grappling styles especially if you already have some boxing behind you which will help muah thai tremendously i applaud your energy vision and will remember though the focus is what will make you great not a little bit of many styles my teacher and si gung teacher's teacher say this is the problem with westerners they want to do everything si gung says do one thing well and no one will stop you jiayo good luck brother  Chinese martial arts Karate Jeet Kune Do Bruce Lee Ultimate Fighting Championship Hapkido Kickboxing Punch (strike) Grappling Tenshinhan Wushu Professional wrestling holds Tai Chi Chuan Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Social rule Goju Ryu Royce Gracie Eagle Claw Kung fu Kyokugenryu Karate Wing Chun Eternal Champions Kata (martial arts) Tekken characters Wanderlei Silva Kick Judo A Course In Miracles Massage Xingyiquan Frank Mir Dragon Kung Fu Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of partner dance terms Sport Double Dragon Boxing Thai language Vale tudo Music K-1 Akuma (Street Fighter) Blood (computer game) The Star Wars Holiday Special Mobile Fighter G Gundam Breaststroke Professional wrestling attacks Horse Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Lightsaber combat Choy Lee Fut Meditation Ragnarok Online Asperger syndrome Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sub-Zero Theory of conduct The Book of Five Rings Vegeta Wassily Kandinsky The Contender (television series) Jiddu Krishnamurti Aerial (dance move) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dragon Booster Swingout Negima Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Education in the People's Republic of China Tank Education Butterfly stroke Mao (game) Kalarippayattu Reiki Buddhism in the United States Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Force (Star Wars) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Dog agility

what is the closest martial art to ninjutsu is shaolin kung fu or wu shu similar or something would really prefer a martial art that relies alot on speed accuracy distractions etc like ninjutsu taijutsu thx ha bushido is absolulutly not similar ninjitsu the ninja is the polar oposite of the samurai there is no simularity i believe jujitsu has alot of similar joint manipulation minus the nerve striking and dim mok the samurai is honor bound bent on fighting and dying in glory not to steal murder run silently spy use throwing weapons nerve attacks to paralyze etc  Ninjutsu Martial art Naruto jutsu Jujutsu Ninja Mixed martial arts Samurai Ninpo Karate Tai Chi Chuan Wuxia Sub-Zero Bruce Lee Kim Possible Chinese martial arts Kung Fu Hustle Togakure Ryu Wing Chun Kung fu Aikido Shredder (TMNT) Wushu Bushido Lin Kuei Eagle Claw The Revenge of Shinobi Jet Li Tokusou Sentai Deka Ranger Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat) Yamabushi Eskrima Shaolin (martial arts) Batman Miyamoto Musashi Mobile Fighter G Gundam Bujinkan Samurai Champloo Jackie Chan Rock Lee Professional wrestling holds Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Fighting game Onimusha Shaolin Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) Judo Kung Lao Hatake Kakashi Final Fantasy character classes Nunchaku Ashida Kim Ranma __ characters Naruto kekkei genkai Forty-seven Ronin Uzumaki Naruto Hapkido Cinema of Hong Kong Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Xingyiquan Naruto (manga) Shang Tsung Eldar (Warhammer 40,000) Ronin Warriors Bak Mei Hong Kong action cinema Dragon Kung Fu Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bodhidharma Foot Clan Imperial Japanese Army Kendo Katana Stephen K.

thoughts on wing chun kung fu kind of curious about this there isn't any instructers in my area well i take that back there is one but it's a mcdojo who here is really into wing chun what do you think about it wing chun is beautiful you practice subtly feeling out your opponent's energy by maintaining wrist to wrist w w contact you practice the delicate balance between sticking to your opponent w w but without being heavy giving away your energy by pushing down out all the while maintaining your forward striking intention you don't have to be big or muscular at all whoever relaxes most wins even at a mcdojo ask if you can just observe a couple classes ask the instructor about his her qualifications lineage who was his sifu who was his sifu's sifu if he can look you in the eye and genuinely enjoy discussing his lineage you probably got a decent instructor  Wing Chun Tai Chi Chuan Martial art Chinese martial arts Jeet Kune Do Sifu WingTsun Punch (strike) Aikido Eskrima Chan Wah-shun Eagle Claw Choy Lee Fut Yip Man Ice hockey Bruce Lee Kung fu Shaolin (martial arts) Wushu First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Equine conformation Weight training Tenshinhan Hapkido Professional wrestling throws Autogyro Hung Gar Boxing Professional wrestling holds Pushing hands Parachuting Alexander Technique Qigong Table tennis Snooker McDojo Professional wrestling attacks Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Martial arts film Milton H.

which is better karate or kung fu if you can be a master in karate or kung fu chinese martial arts which would you be considering you are at the same level in both mas all martial arts have they're good points i prefer kung fu much more than karate and have studied both i only did karate for year now have done kung fu for so i can't say i gave karate it's full chance my reasons primarily based on my experience only karate felt like i used only my arm to punch just my leg to kick where with kung fu i feel that i've been taught to use my core muscles primarily and the arm leg as extra i feel like i can hit a lot harder this way kung fu is more versatile the things to learn are a lot more varied so i didn't get bored so easily being phsically a smaller person i feel like kung fu was much more beneficial because it teaches the idea of not only using my whole body to defend but also how to redirect my opponents energy against them karate i felt was more like force impacting force where with kung fu it felt more like redirecting their energy right back on them b t w karate is not based in china  Martial art Wing Chun Aikido Karate Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Goju Ryu Taekwondo Mixed martial arts Hapkido Punch (strike) Shaolin (martial arts) Kung fu Bruce Lee Shotokan Kung Fu Hustle Jujutsu Strike (attack) Wushu Bak Mei Eskrima Judo Qigong Sport Eagle Claw Muay Thai Professional wrestling holds Kickboxing Choy Lee Fut Kick Anko Itosu Volleyball Kata (martial arts) Kenpo American Kenpo Genseiryu Professional wrestling attacks Kung Fu Master Jeet Kune Do Martial arts film Lightsaber combat Pushing hands Piccolo Junior Saga Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Sanchin Zen Nunchaku Korean martial arts Xingyiquan Bodhidharma Terminal ballistics Diving Professional wrestling throws Weight training Tenshinhan Hung Gar First World Martial Arts Championship Saga The Karate Kid, Part III Qi Kajukenbo Uechi Ryu Equine conformation The Karate Kid Fencing Akuma (Street Fighter) Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat) Ranma __ characters Tekken Kung Fu (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Wado Ryu Wang Chongyang Northern Shaolin (martial art) Yiquan Ansatsuken Kung Lao Shorin-Ryu G.I.

should i take up boxing or muay thai my main martial art is gracie ju jitsu and wrestling at my gym they also offer boxing and kick boxing classes do you think i should take up boxing or kickboxing for i only have enough money for one or the other for now also i have already taken years of tkd when i was younger and i can kick very well but i know muay thai is not like tkd wich would benefit me more do you think boxing is great for hand techniques many mma people cross train in boxing to increase their power and speed however boxing is also limit to that just hands mauy thai is also a popular stand up art in the mma world it would greatly supplement your jiujitsu right now because in addition to being able to fight on the ground you can box similar to a boxer but also have the advantage of devastating knees elbow and kicks also if you learn boxing st you might get too use to bobbing weaving slipping ducking which isnt used as much in thai boxing and western boxing because you have to worry about getting kneed kicked in the face while you are going down also boxers dont worry much about defending themselves below the waist because competing they dont get hit in the legs but a vital area thai boxers like to kick is to the legs which often leaves their opponent immobilized another thing you might like being a jiujitsu person is the clinch in muay thai in boxing the clinch is often use for a break when someone is tired they'll 'hug' the other person and the ref will break em up not so in thai boxing the clinch can be a dangerous position to be in because you can use your jiujitsu grappling skills to throw your opponent around and deliver some nasty knees yea tkd is quite different from thai boxing though the flexibility you gained through tkd can be beneficial tkd kicks are typically chambered kicks in which they snap from you knee and kick the target with your foot they are usually faster kicks than thai kicks however thai kicks come straight out with the power coming from the rotation of the hips and you kick with the shin instead of the foot they are often more powerful than tkd kicks being like getting hit by a baseball bat tkd and thai boxing stance are different too tkd has many types of kicks considered to many to be flashy and not practical in a real fight thai boxers main to kicks are the push front kick and the roundhouse some other kicks are used but these are the main ones i would suggest you doing muay thai and then later on if you want to focus on improving your punches go for boxing good luck http en wikipedia org wiki muay thai http www history com minisite do content type minisite generic content type id display order mini id  Professional wrestling attacks Taekwondo Wing Chun Ultimate Fighting Championship Aikido Grappling Baseball Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Punch (strike) Fast bowling Eskrima Professional wrestling aerial techniques Chinese martial arts Professional wrestling throws Kick Royce Gracie Wushu Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Karate Tai Chi Chuan Glossary of American football Skateboarding trick Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Backstroke Softball Jeet Kune Do Naruto jutsu Wanderlei Silva Dog agility Judo Tenshinhan Savate Rugby union Weight training PRIDE Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling Tank Lightsaber combat Diving Butterfly stroke Vale tudo Professional wrestling match types Football (soccer) Stunt Swingout Hapkido Batting (cricket) Shoe Swimming Fencing Horse Pole vault Marching band Neckbreaker Professional wrestling slang Capoeira Muay Boran Piccolo Junior Saga Kyokugenryu Karate Water polo Muhammad Ali Welterweight Frank Mir Cleveland Browns Bruce Lee Terry Bogard Powerbomb Archery Cricket Field hockey Strap-on dildo Piledriver (professional wrestling) Boxing training Undergarment The Contender (television series) Charleston (dance move) Fighting Spirit Fist of the North Star Akuma (Street Fighter) Guilty Gear Isan

how is the winner determined in a wushu competition at the olympics china will be holding a wushu tournament and i was wondering how this style of martial arts works i have seen karate taekwondo and judo tournaments but never wushu the performance will be based on three scores a b and c the a score overall performance is points of the b score is quality of movement and is points of the c score is called nandu level of difficulty and involves the artist following a prescribed set of difficult movements mostly jumps and variations of landings though there are others as well each with a set amount oof points depending on whether or not it is followed my a connecting move ex jumping inside cresecent kick to horse stance mabu or into the splits into the splits will give you more points thus is greater nandu when you register for a tournament you send in a form showing the order all of your nandu will be performed in and the possible points each nandu will bring you totalling up to points any more is not nandu points but quality of movement and overall performance and you must follow it or risk large deductions most nandu is between and depending on how you connect moves together not all athletes start with nandu possible i have teammates that start with possible meaning you can't get a perfect but no one ever does anyway even china's all around champion and they work their a and b scores more nandu is very tiring so it's better to keep good form and not risk blowing a jump which can result in up to a fall depending on how badly you blow it and how many nandu points you miss by not performing it these scores are only for longfist changquan and southernfist staff and spear broadsword and straightsword most other open division weapons in wushu are not judged with nanu in fact weapons in general are not usually judged with nandu at this point in the us in the future they may be required to have nandu in all forms generally it's only handforms non weapon that have required nandu whether or not this changes depends very much on what the chinese wushu federation decides to make its international standard i hope this helps it's late and i'm really tired so i'm maybe not as clear as i'd like to be though cheers please enjoy wushu and support them at the beijing games where it will debut as a demo sport  Tai Chi Chuan Karate Taekwondo Mixed martial arts Chinese martial arts Jet Li Volleyball Dog agility Judo Football (soccer) Diving Boxing Sumo Aikido Skateboarding trick Yelena Davydova Norway national football team Dressage Table tennis Tennis Summer Olympic Games Nanquan Rugby union Ultimate (sport) Mahjong Quizbowl Sport Quake III Arena Eagle Claw Trampolining Fencing Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Basketball Paintball Society for Creative Anachronism Softball International League Korean martial arts Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Fast bowling Figure skating Xiangqi Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Professional wrestling attacks Playoff Equine conformation Olympic Games Billiards New York Giants Rock, Paper, Scissors Swingout 2004 Summer Olympics Kurt Angle Poker jargon Go ranks and ratings Cheerleading EXpanded MultiPlayer Water polo DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Show jumping Rugby union positions National Football League 1957 World Series Glossary of American football Martial arts film Professional wrestling throws Kyokugenryu Karate Australia national football team 2000 Summer Olympics Competition Asian Cup 2004 Hearts (game) Tag Aerial (dance move) Sudden death Bubble Bobble Snooker National Hockey League All-Star Game CPU cache Chinese language Compiler optimization Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Peter Shilton World Chess Championship $ale of the Century

learning martial arts without an instructor there are a few classes around here but they're like tae kwon do and karate every miles if i wanted to learn something exotic like ninjitsu or muay thai could i just study the books diligently please use the money you would waste on books and videos on a good karate or tkd class i know you probably don't want to go there because you have heard some bad things or because it's not the cool art at the moment but consider this you are not stuck with one art you can always do another art when you are older and or move to another area i wanted to learn kendo i studied in japan for a year and came back home where there were no schools but ended up learning iai instead i am very happy i did i have gone back to kendo once or twice for seminars and i realize i had a lot of new prespective i didn't have before and it helped me greatly your first art will teach you many other things other than technique like discipline focus quick reaction time hard work ethic etc when you switch to another art the instructor will not have to teach you these things and no matter what you will always be able to find something helpful to retain technique wise so my advice to you is to find one of those karate tkd schools that you can stomach and stick with it you might love it you might be able to switch later but you will be training which you won't do by reading books  Martial art Muay Thai Aikido Mixed martial arts Kata (martial arts) Chinese martial arts Kendo Ninjutsu Iaido Eskrima Bruce Lee Hapkido Kickboxing Ninja Tai Chi Chuan Shotokan Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Genseiryu Pitaten Bas Rutten Goju Ryu American Kenpo Past teachings of Prem Rawat Graduate school The Book of Five Rings Tekken characters Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Jeet Kune Do Kung fu Anko Itosu Eagle Claw Punch (strike) Robert Garcia Ryo Sakazaki 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kenpo Blood on the Tracks Korean martial arts Milton H.

martial arts i'd like to learn a martial art i don't know what would be best for me i'm calm and can keep focus even in a variety of situations i never get mad angry sad i know that is a huge bonus in martial arts also i'm big ' lbs keep in mind i'm but i have never really been a good fighter but have been prone to fights i've been in four street fights and hundreds of confrontations where there were no punches but was close i would like to train my body and mind i don't want to go in and kick some ass or anything like that i just want to be stronger also my legs are weak and the slightest hit to my knee knocks it out of place it's extremely painful and i have to go to the hospital i want this to not be able to happen i'm not really worried about defending myself i can diffuse situations pretty easily my ultimate goal would to be more solid just like trying to fight a brick wall i want to be the wall just not be able to be hurt i'm emotionally strong i don't get sad or angry over anything i just want to learn how to be even more emotionally strong and become physically strong have you had your knees checked out as to why they go out so easily weak legs might not explain why they go out so quickly if you can resolve the knee problem first then leg strengthening can be accomplished through body weight exercises as the safest alternative in karate size does not matter a large person can become just as proficient as a smaller person with both gaining the benefits alike strong legs with weak upper body is not so good most styles of karate work you in a manner upper and lower body as to solidity karate also has a focus on strong stances that are easier on the joints strong stances mean your knees are bent and better able to take a hit of course you have to be able to give when struck to better absorb the energy of the blow you sound like an intelligent and thoughtful year old take care of your knees very important a well balanced martial art can help strengthen your whole body and mind  Aikido Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Equine conformation Muay Thai Weight training Karate Taekwondo Jujutsu Bruce Lee Wing Chun Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling holds The Book of Five Rings Tenshinhan Chinese martial arts Ranma __ characters Punch (strike) Boxing Lightsaber combat Eskrima Scientology beliefs and practices YuYu Hakusho Vegeta Spanking Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Akuma (Street Fighter) Diving Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) King Piccolo Saga Hapkido Blood (computer game) Judo Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling throws Goju Ryu Fast bowling Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu PRIDE Social rule Tank Theory of conduct Vulcan (Star Trek) Kick Son Gohan Alexander Technique Kodocha Clinical depression Pacifism Anxiety Chess strategy and tactics Strike (attack) Warrior (World of Warcraft) Geese Howard Characters in Bleach series Pitaten Breastfeeding Shaolin (martial arts) Horizontal bar First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Childbirth One Piece minor characters Kyokugenryu Karate Dragon Booster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kalarippayattu Prostate cancer Kata (martial arts) Force (Star Wars) Grappling Characters of Naruto Tekken Fencing Force powers Kim Possible Unreal Wushu Savate Professional wrestling aerial techniques Dualism (philosophy of mind) Swimming Stomach cancer The Karate Kid, Part III Shoot boxing The Karate Kid Kung Fu Hustle Traumatic brain injury Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost

teaching an old dog new martial arts tricks the past year and a half has been my worst for injuries so i've gotten more into judo and aikido it's been really hard to set the other stuff aside and learn new tricks any advice on setting the old aside for just a while to bring in the new i want to mix everything up once i have a good healthy streak thanks for any answers d an old dog new tricks well i can tell you a few things that have helped this old dog get through one is that you have to take warming up stretching and injuries even little ones more seriously not less your years of experience and training do not make you impervious to injuries they actually make you more susceptible to them due to the affects of the aging process on your body while still trying to do the same things you did when you were younger so on those days or workouts that you are working out hard you have to take more time warming up and stretching also injuries need to be avoided since your body now takes longer to heal and recover from them if you do get an injury then take extra time and extra care to treat it and let it heal so that it does not become a nagging injury avoiding injuries may mean less physical contact less physically demanding workouts and more rest in between along with that another thing that has helped me is the old japanese masters and their approach to things they rely on their experience skill and understanding of martial arts more so than their athletic and physical abilities as they get older this is especially so in workouts where hard physical contact will be encountered this way they tend to save their bodies somewhat and can extend the time that they can be active in doing martial arts if you start to take the above approaches now and change your approach to things you may find in the long run that you will be much happier not only that you will still be able to stay active and do martial arts at a satisfying level good luck  Martial art Aikido Mixed martial arts Weight training Exercise Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Prostate cancer Karate Professional wrestling holds Traditional Chinese medicine Medicine Dog Negima Aerial (dance move) Insomnia Hapkido Jujutsu Bubble Bobble Sauna Drowning Alexander Technique Breastfeeding Miyamoto Musashi The Book of Five Rings Dog training Taekwondo Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Scientology beliefs and practices Piccolo Junior Saga Paragliding Vegeta Traumatic brain injury Parkour Bodybuilding Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Vulcan (Star Trek) Wolverine (comics) Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Skateboarding trick Dog agility A Course In Miracles CPU cache Addiction Massage Stomach cancer Kalarippayattu Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Pitaten Puberty Tekken characters Shen Gong Wu Urinary incontinence YuYu Hakusho Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Happiness Fecal incontinence Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Healing Factor Satchel Paige New Age Sleep The Subtle Knife Traumatic incident reduction Kim Possible Marathon (sport) Thermoregulation Koichi Tohei Andr__s Galarraga Aphasia Alchemy Psychology Phoebe Halliwell Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Milton H.

ufc lyota machida what are your thoughts undefeated shouldn't he get better fights lyoto machida is a counter striker waiting for people to make mistakes some may think this is not as exciting and thus not pay to see him but he's beat bonnar franklin and penn yet forrest griffin whom i like btw gets the major fights and is headlined more often if machida were to get the good fights i believe people would become bigger fans either that or he should get on the reality show what do you think convince me otherwise he is going to have a top fight against kazuhiro nakamura at ufc stay away from the reality scene for him it has been great for other people but not machida i think he is a great fighter the reason they push forrest more is he seems to push the action a little more plus the is really stacked right now but if he keeps chipping away he will get his shot soon enough i think the fight agianst nakamura will put him in the top setting up a fight with tito evans babalu or the loser of the chuck jardin fight forrest shogun hendo page they will either one bring him up slow or feed him to some so the other person can get a title fight it wouldn't surprise me if some day we saw him fight bj again if bj get or different ufc belts and if fraklin beats the spider we might see franklin move up to fight lyota after franklin losses the belt for the second time machida has a bright future so no worries mate  The Ultimate Fighter Ultimate Fighting Championship B.J.

are we defending ourselves better according to a cnn report that i just watched of people surveyed were more afraid of online theft then being mugged does this have anything to do with the martial arts self defense or just a rise in reports of online crime statistics can be misleading online theft is easy and sneaky it's a new wave of crime yet i personally think that people are learning to defend themselves better although they could have a false sense of security streetfights are so unpredictable but with mma's popularity it seems that everyone is training cross training and more educated in how to defend themselves years ago martial arts were mysterious now they are common place having said that if we worked on our character half as much as we worked on our technique the world would look a lot different good question  Martial art Mixed martial arts Jujutsu Phishing Plame affair Identity theft Aikido John Lott Bayesian inference Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Eskrima School violence Equilibrium (2002 film) Fast bowling Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Theory of conduct Tai Chi Chuan Rape Statistical survey Magic (illusion) Chinese martial arts New York City Police Department Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 America's Army Crime Criticism of libertarianism Slander and libel Detective Piccolo Junior Saga The Colbert Report British national identity card Civil disturbances and military action in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Kung fu Grand Theft Auto III 2003 Invasion of Iraq George W.

i am interested in starting jujitsu i would like to know what it incorporates and weather it is well rounded practitioner of judo for and a half years well i can only comment on brazillian jiu jitsu becuase that's what i do it's not very well rounded at all at my school we concentrate about of our time on the ground game and the other on takedowns no striking or weapon defense a lot of it is geared toward competition grappling with that said doing bjj will make you extremely good on the ground and that's it my bjj experience has been the polar opposite of what someone described earlier as a jack of all trades master of none style is this a good thing it depends on what you want i love it because i think it's fun and i compete for self defense it's not so good by itself that's why i kickbox as well in most street fights you want to stay off the ground but many street fights i have witnessed still go to the ground so it can be usefull although it's especially useless if multiple opponents are involved i don't think i need to explain why but if that's the case you're probably going to get your kicked anyway with that said it depends on what you want if you do bjj you will be very good on the ground and in combination with your judo experience you will have a very well rounded grappling game but it sounds like some of these other styles have it all tough choice jack of all trades master of none or grappling master what to do what to do edit i also have to add that i agree with samurai if you can find a school that incorporates all those styles equally that would probably be the best place to train if well roundedness is your main goal however be very careful if you find one single instructor that claims to be a master of all these styles there's a good chance that it's bullshido if you found a school that has a resident black belts in each of those arts whom are reputable and competition tested you've landed on a gold mine  Jujutsu Martial art Judo Royce Gracie Muay Thai Aikido Taekwondo Grappling Ultimate Fighting Championship Karate Football (soccer) Professional wrestling holds Capoeira Tennis Eskrima Professional wrestling throws Eagle Claw Poker jargon Tai Chi Chuan Norway national football team Rugby union Boxing Kickboxing Jeet Kune Do Hapkido Savate Ra (board game) Pittsburgh Steelers Skateboarding trick Kalarippayattu Akuma (Street Fighter) Bruce Lee Masahiko Kimura Ultimate (sport) Black belt (martial arts) Eternal Champions Extreme Programming Piccolo Junior Saga Lightsaber combat Double Dragon Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Gliding Shoot boxing Social rule Fencing RuneScape skills B-47 Stratojet M16 (rifle) Sub-Zero Warrior (World of Warcraft) Counter-Strike Super Bowl XXVII Rugby league Kajukenbo Volleyball Korean martial arts Miyamoto Musashi Wrestling Sambo (martial art) The Contender (television series) Lincoln-Douglas Debate West Bromwich Albion F.C.

do martial artists run a higher risk of prosecution when involved in an altercation that ends in injury you know the old idiom about a martial artist needing to register his her deadly hands and or feet along those lines do you think the police would be more likely to charge you if they knew you held a ranking in a martial art most states have a duty to retreat clause on their law books this means that you may use reasonable force to defend yourself or repel an attack but can only legally use deadly force death or great bodily harm when faced with a deadly or great bodily harm threat yourself otherwise you are obligated to retreat if possible or practical use only that force you believe to be reasonable and neccesary and be prepared to justify your actions john junker a university of washington law professor specializing in criminal law and self defense issues state's if the person using force believed he needed it to defend himself and it was reasonable so the key is what is reasonable to defend yourself so you have a guy yelling bullying threatening you put your hands up to protect yourself and state you do not want to fight he is not backing down and takes a swing at you you kick his knee and he falls to the ground in pain unable to continue the attack you stop someone contacts the police peter hobart esq further addes the law and the facts underlying a cause of action are rarely clear cut statutes and case law vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction lawyers are skilled at recasting the facts in their client s best interest juries are given broad discretion with respect to determining guilt or innocence and may feel the need to compensate an injured party regardless of fault and even if a defendant successfully raises one of the defenses discussed above litigation is costly both in terms of time and money it would be foolish to try to rely on a general understanding of the legal principles at work in these situations in order to engage in behavior which falls just within the realm of legality rather the wise martial artist will attempt to avoid any hint of liability or criminal conduct the following general principles may be of value in this endeavor avoid physical confrontation if there is a safe avenue of retreat use it regardless of jurisdiction at a minimum retreat to the wall if confrontation is inevitable give a warning when defending property unless doing so would be dangerous or futile which is often the case this does not mean that you should list your qualifications as the samurai of old were wont to do rather you should simply give the aggressor notice that you intend to use force against him in order to allow him to reconsider his position ensure that you are not seen as the aggressor this does not require taking the first hit but it does require being certain that physical contact is imminent prior to reacting for an in depth examination of the danger here see the goetz case be aware of the aggravating and mitigating factors is there a size age or ability differential are you or the attacker armed or trained all of these factors will help you determine the appropriate level of force use only the amount of force necessary to deter the attack this does not require the use of ineffective technique but rather mature reflection prior to a confrontation about what technique including flight is appropriate in which situation it would be wise to introduce this as part of training once the initial threat is neutralized stop this does not mean that you must give your opponent a fighting chance rather you may immobilize the attacker while awaiting the police but do no further damage when intervening on behalf of a third party ensure as much as possible that the intervention is justified and necessary as a rule interference in domestic disputes is unwise reconciliations can mean trouble for the would be rescuer remember that in this country human rights are superior to property rights the use of force in the protection of property is very risky as an instructor you are both morally and legally responsible for the actions of your students both inside and out of the

muay thai information or persuade me to other martial art alright well we have a muay thai school by us and i was considering taking it heres a few aspects its dollars a month for classes per week there is no belt system i guess they want traditional style i called the school but they gave me no real descriptive answers its called the ohio muay thai academy does anyone know anything about this what types of exercises will we practice i want all details on muay thai and also if you suggest any other martial art over this one please let me know i live in ohio so obviously some are limited muay thai is a combat sport known as the art of eight limbs because you can punch kick elbow and knee thai boxers are known for harder kicks cause they kick with the shin instead of the foot also generating power from the hips rather than snapping from the leg most of the moves are simple no fancy movements and pretty powerful making it a very popular stand up art in competition striking like k and mma like ufc also kinda unique to muay thai is the clinch aka neck wrestling where two thai boxers are holding around each others necks often times delivering knees to the body and if your lucky enough to pull the other person's head down that a knee to the face thai boxing shouldnt have belts its similar to western boxing in the since that you train and compete without colored belts to establish your ranking if you choose to compete your record will be your ranking thai boxing training is similar to western boxing training they both focus on conditioning you'll probably be running alot and doing a lot of push ups sit ups squats lunges medicine ball training and jump roping thai boxers work on focus mitts like boxers for punches and thai pads for kicks knees and elbows also you'll be hitting the heavy bag thai bag too and you'll do shadow boxing a lot too they'll start you off with basics of course how to wrap your hands proper stance moving around different punches kicks etc and then work you into combos blocks and counter attacks all the technicals things about the sport once you got all the basic stuff down and the coach thinks you are ready you'll start sparring if you want to to learn timing reading an opponent all that fun stuff bucks for twice a week sounds kinda steep to me though my gym offers classes x a week throughout the day and you can go to as many classes as you want to and that is per month like i said muay thai is becoming popular throughout mma so if you find a mma gym they'll probably teach muay thai and perhaps cheaper as for other arts to take it depends on what you are looking for and how the local teachers instruct for instance if there is karate in your area and they teach you how to realistically fight and focuses on conditioning sparring etc then go for it but then again there could be a karate dojo that is just teaching you b s and cashing in on you if you chose not to do muay thai see if you can drop by whatever art you are considering taking and see how they train ask it they participate in any tournaments or matches and see how well they do see if they spar full contact of for points avoid points if you are looking for self defense or in ring fighting see how long the instructor has been doing martial arts teaching or if he won any competitions http www history com minisite do content type minisite generic content type id display order mini id  Wing Chun Shotokan Volleyball Hapkido Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Strike (attack) Tenshinhan Boxing training Professional wrestling match types Wushu PRIDE Suplex Professional wrestling Royce Gracie Grappling Skateboarding trick Wanderlei Silva Goju Ryu Rugby union Weight training Breaststroke Softball Baseball Bruce Lee Kyokugenryu Karate Eagle Claw Swingout Guilty Gear Archery Capoeira Kumite Powerbomb Naruto jutsu Shawn Michaels Jeet Kune Do Kata (martial arts) Computer and video game genres Shoot boxing Neckbreaker American football Table tennis K-1 Ultimate (sport) Muhammad Ali Savate Professional wrestling slang Leon White Glossary of American football Fast bowling Japanese tea ceremony Kurt Angle Marching band Nunchaku Swimming Sport YuYu Hakusho Dog agility Diving MapleStory Shoe Glossary of climbing terms Lightsaber combat Kyokushin Welterweight Fencing Horse Pump It Up Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Sumo Greg Valentine Piccolo Junior Saga Paintball

krav maga has anyone does a course in this self defence strategy and if so what was it like im an unfit year old female with an unfit year old partner are we the right candidates for this type of caper i took it for about months if you're unfit it'll make you fit they focus on conditioning as of all martial arts with good instructors they'll push you to your limit and set realistic goals for the individual its more a system of self defense than a combat sport it borrows many techniques from other arts like judo brazilian jiujitsu muay thai boxing etc im not saying that you cant defend yourself with say muay thai on the streets you most definitely can its just krav maga places more emphasis on certain scenarios that you'll encounter on the streets such as someone grabbing you from behind with a choke hold or someone putting you in a bear hug tons of things the goal of krav maga is to get you out of a situation alive using anything from punching kicking grappling to groin kicks eye gouges etc the good thing about many krav maga techniques is that it uses the body's natural reflexes making moves easier to learn when i was in it we did a lot of situps and push ups and worked a lot on focus mitts heavy bag then we'd do some specifically self defense techniques such as weapon disarming and getting out of holds etc the problem with krav maga is that its getting pretty commercialized therefore many people are opening up krav maga gyms in which the training is not so great for a quick profit if you have a good instructor i say go for it i dont think it'll be anything you cant do if you are willing to stick with it after a lil while you should be in good shape  Jujutsu Eskrima Aikido Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Judo Chinese martial arts Taekwondo Tai Chi Chuan Grappling Bruce Lee Professional wrestling holds Wing Chun Kickboxing Ultimate Fighting Championship Boxing Wushu Piccolo Junior Saga Kajukenbo Karate Skateboarding trick Self-defense Computer and video game genres Vovinam Shoe Weight training Double Dragon Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling match types Royce Gracie Professional wrestling throws Shoot boxing Punch (strike) Baseball Professional wrestling attacks Fuzion Jeet Kune Do Tank Strike (attack) Glossary of climbing terms Star Trek Customizable Card Game Glossary of partner dance terms Table tennis Lightsaber combat Airsoft Kyokugenryu Karate Glossary of American football Fast bowling M16 (rifle) Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Chokehold Vale tudo First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Water polo Norway national football team Chess strategy and tactics Society for Creative Anachronism Characters of Naruto Neuro-linguistic programming Miyamoto Musashi Rugby league Guilty Gear Tenshinhan Trench warfare Rugby union positions Alexander Technique Kung Fu Hustle Theory of conduct Korean martial arts The Contender (television series) Sport Volleyball Xingyiquan Amateur wrestling Strategic management Swingout Welterweight Palmach Kata (martial arts) Batting (cricket) Blitzkrieg Sambo (martial art) Requirements analysis Capoeira Battle of the Bulge Muay Boran Fighting game Professional wrestling Shotgun

brawler competition fighter street fighter alright i have debated over the last few months on what martial art to take i am a fighter at heart but would like to be sufficient at fighting i want to be able to brawl street fight and competition fight now i know martial arts is supposed to teach self descripline but so what i took tae kwon doe biggest waste of money in my opinion what martial arts would fit street fighting competition fighting im leaning towards muay thai i am also wanting to be able to do mma competitions there are a number of different types of competition type fighting but from what it sounds like you want something with real contact muai tai would give you good stand up skills and many of those fighters also fight in kick boxing and they either fight united states rules or european rules the difference being no elbows or knees in u s rules and european rules allow knees but no elbows many states still don't allow elbows in stand up fighting and some of the states that were have recently changed back to not allow them in stand up or even in mma type events that change just came about recently in illinois for one and missouri for another that i know of by doing muai tai you could get more than enough fights in kick boxing and if you wanted to get into the mma type fighting you could also do that although you would probably want to pick up some good training in wrestling russian sambo or brazilian jiu jutsu to round out your ground fighting skills  Ultimate Fighting Championship Taekwondo Kickboxing Jujutsu Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Tai Chi Chuan Wanderlei Silva Punch (strike) Royce Gracie Grappling Professional wrestling attacks Frank Mir PRIDE Chinese martial arts Sport Professional wrestling holds Wing Chun Fighting game Rickson Gracie Fedor Emelianenko Vale tudo Professional wrestling aerial techniques Antonio Inoki Wrestling Eskrima Shaolin (martial arts) K-1 Wushu Skateboarding trick Aikido Volleyball Hapkido Boxing Vitor Belfort Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Muay Boran Jet Li Akuma (Street Fighter) Equine conformation Professional wrestling Professional wrestling match types Ryo Sakazaki Ken Shamrock Capoeira Naruto jutsu Jeet Kune Do Sambo (martial art) Rugby union Dan Hibiki Shawn Michaels Strike (attack) Bas Rutten Kyokugenryu Karate Tekken Welterweight Eternal Champions Ultimate (sport) Xingyiquan Hulk Hogan Adon Chun-Li Judo Breaststroke Football (soccer) Eagle Claw Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Sagat Professional wrestling slang Softball Silat Dog agility M.

kung fu or tae kwon do i have a year old daughter and would like for her to begin martial arts training in the near future i trained in kung fu for about years when i was younger and know that it can be extremely difficult my question for anyone who has martial arts experience is if you think i should begin my daughter with tae kwon do which mostly involves kicking defense and you can advance more quickly since she is so young or can i start her immediately with kung fu either way i want her to eventually learn kung fu which is something dear to me thanks you so much for your help yes i know not all schools are equal i tried a different school since i'm in another state and it could not compare to my first sifu and his teaching style it was too relaxed and i did not get any on instruction to help me advance either ha ha i know sometimes my mother made me go to class she was my motivation when i was low on energy because she left me no choice my sifu use to tell us there is really no better style of martial arts it depends on the student and how often and hard they train although kung fu is a bit complicated if the fighter w k f style only trains a few times a week and someone in tkd style trains everyday who do think will win in combat yes i agree tkd and kung fu should compliment each other because tkd uses kicking and distance combat and fighting kung fu is good for close hand to hand combat the difference between asian western cultures is that the asian children are trained to obey so there is no backing out if and when the parent tells them to go attend tkd school so go for kung fu or tkd whatever just do not pull any punches when you have her trained go for the gold never settle for second best but that does not mean subjecting your child to abuse or abusive training it means proper guidance and disciplined training my korean instructor started his own daughter now he has a yr old black belt hope i encouraged you  Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Kung fu Aikido Eagle Claw Jeet Kune Do Karate Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Qigong Hapkido Tenshinhan Eskrima Goju Ryu Bruce Lee Muay Thai Punch (strike) Sifu Shaolin (martial arts) Kata (martial arts) Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Choy Lee Fut Korean martial arts Jujutsu Dog training Xingyiquan Shotokan Zen Piccolo Junior Saga Yip Man Judo Capoeira Education Choi Kwang-Do Double Dragon Black belt (martial arts) Education in the People's Republic of China Tekken characters Sport Lightsaber combat Sub-Zero Boxing Kalarippayattu Education in Germany Hung Gar Education in Taiwan Pushing hands Chan Wah-shun Kick Japanese tea ceremony Past teachings of Prem Rawat Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Vegeta Chuck Norris Kodocha Wang Chongyang Education in Japan Savate Fighting game Genseiryu No Child Left Behind Act Meditation Baguazhang Graduate school Milton H.

i am wanting to know a bit more about kenpo and kuk sool won also any personal experiences me and my wife have been looking and trying our best to decide a martial art to join so when our son gets older he can learn an art cause lets face it this world is goin to hell no offence to anybody but still we have a choice between kuk sool won and kenpo we are leaning more towards kenpo but kuk sool won is still a choice for us so any info for personal experience is greatly welcomed firstly it is important to understand that kuk sool won refers to a specific system of korean martial arts that incorporates elements from several traditional korean arts it includes strikes kicks grappling throws weapons joint locks acrobatics and more kenpo kempo is a bit more generic term referring to a wide variety of styles that can range from the very rigid structural composition of karate to the fluid transitional character of some styles of kung fu some styles of kenpo may incorporate grappling throws takedowns pressure points joint locks and weapons while others may not some may employ high kicks while others may not the point is that it is important to identify the style of kenpo and its characteristics before trying to make a decision between kenpo and kuk sool won kuk sool won has a lot to offer as does kenpo both can develop solid self defense methods though i imagine your kenpo school will place a greater emphasis on this visit the schools talk to not just the instructors but students and parents as well be sure to observe both beginners and high ranks to see what they are doing and how they train in the end it often boils down to which school instructor and then style you are most comfortable with p s i love kenpo and think that everyone should study it at some point but that's just me  Kenpo Jujutsu Aikido Kuk Sool Won Mixed martial arts Taekwondo Hapkido American Kenpo Eagle Claw Chinese martial arts Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Judo Korean martial arts Eskrima Grappling Kung fu Wing Chun Wushu Kajukenbo Shorinji kenpo Jeet Kune Do Korean swords Professional wrestling holds Goju Ryu Kickboxing Bruce Lee Choy Lee Fut Nunchaku Amateur wrestling Education Royce Gracie Xingyiquan Kalarippayattu Tekken characters Phase (matter) Muay Thai Music Qigong Lightsaber combat Welding Association for Renaissance Martial Arts MapleStory Fist of the North Star A Course In Miracles Genseiryu Steven Barnes McDojo Professional wrestling throws Shaolin (martial arts) Chinese language Economics Capoeira Graduate school Social psychology Kumite Cantonese opera Kata (martial arts) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Hong Kong Kyokushin RuneScape Tide Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Weapon The Book of Five Rings Explosive material Sonata form Parachuting Hung Gar Ed Parker Education in the United States Baguazhang Pump It Up Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Homeschooling Wu style T'ai Chi Ch'uan Natural Selection (computer game) Frank Mir Miyamoto Musashi Dojo Kung Fu Hustle Past teachings of Prem Rawat Uechi Ryu Information warfare Free will Theory of conduct Korean language Black belt (martial arts) Boxing Hong Kong action cinema

the old ufc i liked the old ufc when the rules were limited not this watered down stuff we have now it looks like glorified hugging nowadays agree dachman this question isn't about putting wrestling down you dumbass i agree in a way i do think that it should be the fighters responsiblity to get himself off the ground personally i've never been bored by ground fighting but thats because i understand it its like how europeans are bored by american football and americans are bored by soccer im bored by cricket and most modern mma fans are bored by groundfighting its hard to keep your interest when you don't understand whats going on i also don't like how almost every rule change has favored strikers gloves standing them back up rounds and standing up at the beginning of every round really most things that have made it less realistic have favored strikers so i did prefer the old rules because they were more realistic and didn't favor strikers so much the part i liked the most though was the style vs style part of the old ufc i thought it was fascintaing to see how they matched up against each other that being said i think the changes where inevitable all athletes want to win and cross training was the best way to ensure you'd be able to match your opponent or at least not be taken by suprise and be flailing around helplessly and with the rules well most of the public understands striking and finds it more exciting than grappling so its natural rules would change to encourage striking so that people find the fights more exciting and will thus pay more to watch them  Martial art Ultimate Fighting Championship Laws of cricket Boxing Jujutsu Chuck Liddell Vitor Belfort Football (soccer) Professional wrestling holds Cricket Frank Mir Sydney Riot of 1879 Wanderlei Silva Randy Couture Australian rules football PRIDE Matt Hughes (fighter) Alex Ferguson Newcastle United F.C.
