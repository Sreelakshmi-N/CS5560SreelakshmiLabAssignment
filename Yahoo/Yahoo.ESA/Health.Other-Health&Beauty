why do our fingers go wrinkly when we have been in the water for a long time your skin is made up of two layers the outer layer is called the epidermis and the lower level is the dermis the outer layer epidermis produces an oily substance called sebum you can see this substance when you touch a window or mirror and your oily fingerprint is left there one job sebum does is it keeps water out of your skin a job that it does very well however after long periods of time in a swimming pool shower or bathtub much of the sebum is washed off and your outer layer of skin starts to absorb water as it absorbs water it swells but since the epidermis is tied down to your dermis in certain spots it expands more where it is not tied down and this causes your skin to wrinkle the difference between your skin and a raisin is that raisins wrinkle because they shrink but your skin wrinkles because it is getting bigger  Skin Leaf Sebaceous gland Moisturizer Acne Root Swimming Mammal Sento Diving suit Skin cancer Puberty Jellyfish Ultraviolet Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Melanin Solar power Tattoo Manicure Hair Menstrual cup Glass Ulcer Water (molecule) Psoriasis Urticaria Soap Stoma Erogenous zone Fire fighting Photosynthesis Apollo Command/Service Module Neutrino Epidermolysis bullosa Ozone depletion Butterfly Rice Keratin Eye Otitis externa Textile manufacturing Opportunity rover Backstroke Ozone hole Body piercing Oily fish Deck (ship) Butterfly stroke Geology of the Alps Scar Beaches of Hong Kong Beryllium Burn (injury) Upholstery Glycolic acid Oddworld Diaper Skin graft Intravenous therapy Basal cell carcinoma Smoke-screen Hydra (genus) Sea ice Spectroscopy Mycosis Swimming pool Transition metal Diving Deodorant Earth Sweating Wood Roach Black pepper History of ancient Egypt Earwax Bubblegum Urinary incontinence Hydrochloric acid Brain Hyperthermia Kryptonite Trichome Sponge Biological tissue Mantle (mollusc) Kimono Structure of the Earth Cloud Gelatin Tooth Feather Human skin color Ozone layer Cosmetics Mattress Glycerin

a stitch ouch whilst walking my dog tonight i got the most painful stitch in my abdomin and i was a mile from the car as i walked back it got more more painful in fact i didn't think i would make it back after sticking my fingers in my belly and supporting it it did ease a bit i have a big male dalmatian and is quite demanding so there was no let up or sympathy from him the bugger any how the question is what is a stitch is it a weakness of some kind like ageing or not as fit as i should be perhaps enlightenment would ease the worry appreciated a stitch is a sharp prolonged contraction caused by a buildup of lactic acid in an area of muscle when it is vigorously stretched and used it's the equivalent of a cramp in your calf muscle don't know why a 'stitch' only refers to the abdomen though oxygen in the blood disperses this lactic acid and gently stretching or massaging of the tensed up muscle whilst taking long deep breaths inhaling large amounts of the much needed oxygen will ease the pain that is why it felt better when you pressed on the area  Cramp First aid Weight training Lactic acid Massage Equine conformation Pneumonia Biochemistry Professional wrestling holds Breastfeeding Milton H.

why do as many humans put into the sun each animal tries to protect against it why we not uwe good question the unfortunate answer is for the sake of beauty we have two characteristics that make us do some really illogical acts we are quite social creatures peer pressure and the fear of loneliness make us seek out friends and do with them what we would never do alone we can sacrifice for others that's the good side of our social nature but we'll double dog dare people into stupid acts that we will do we are always in heat many animals have a mating season primates including us do not so we're always looking for a way to look good and for some reason each season has people agreeing together that the ugliest fashions are beautiful fashions of the s look really weird today even fashions of the s and s look strange to us today's fashions will look odd years from now today we emphasize the abdominal muscles years ago it was the pectorals in more years but through it all there are a couple of images that have stood steady leisure which means money and reproductive ability which means sex and children once upon a time when everybody lived on farms pale skin meant that you spent your time indoors and didn't need to work in the fields so pale skin was beautiful today when most people live in cities and work in offices pale skin means that you are a drone without authority and without disposable income so tans are beautiful so people expose themselves to cancer causing uv rays when young to attract a better class of mate which desire they then proceed to waste by spending time in bars and going home drunk with contagious selfish idiots all for the sake of beauty and sex and kids while we are young and foolish the reason for it all is really quite understandable we just do some very silly things with it corsets were popular once even though they made women faint big wigs were popular once even though they made men look silly but they did the job they were meant to do attract the opposite sex that's what tans and six pack abs do today we hope  Physical attractiveness Human Dog Human sexual behavior Human skin color Infantilism Nicomachean Ethics Shaggy dog story The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Ren and Stimpy God Emperor of Dune Puberty Simone Weil Gray Wolf Sin City Sex Social rule Sexual attraction Poker jargon Clothing Alignment (role-playing games) Sexual orientation Undergarment Aquatic ape hypothesis Gay slang Elves (Elfquest) Sola fide Babe Ruth Dead Like Me Dairy Bondage (BDSM) 3rd Rock from the Sun Kibbutz Dinosaur Azumanga Daioh Breast Transsexuality Justification (theology) Maison Ikkoku Abortion debate Characters of Naruto The Amber Spyglass Dragon Booster Dilbert Goodness and value theory Dragons (Pern) Charles Darwin Aesthetic Realism Same-sex marriage The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pedophilia Art Kitsch Kim Possible Make money fast Cheetah The Catcher in the Rye Professional wrestling holds Strap-on dildo Wig (hair) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scientific method Hair South Park Recurring South Park characters Sex and the City Bizarro Wolfrider Tightlacing Mami Wata Artificial selection Beavis and Butt-head Kodocha Heterosexuality Animal testing Infinite Ryvius Buttocks Static Shock Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Moral Politics Sexual selection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Orgasm Rocko's Modern Life Irony 2000 Australian Grand Prix Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Death Gate Cycle The Apprentice 2 Zoophilia Cat One Tree Hill (TV series) Baldness

why do i have such a big crash in moods i have natural highs which are very high but then i crash badly even in the same day when it happens i hate myself and feel incredibly hateful to myself i have a underactive thyroid which is stable apparently and pernicious aneamia does anyone know what i can do to stop the highs and lows you say that you have anunder active thyroid hypothroidism and anemia is this being treatment with medication like synthroid medication after having a blood testmfor it and having lab work for your anemia symptoms of low thyroid is having symptoms of fatique weight gain because your metabolism is sluggish and depression some symptoms of anemia are variable some are somewhat like the ones of slow thyroid also you will more than likely be tired and sluggish weight problems possibly from the lack of minerals in your body and more than likely moodly from the lack of what the body needs to function the dislike of yourself could be from the loss of your ability to function as normally as you once did the crash and burn sessions that you experience is not what you are accustomed to have had before these problems begain you did not express your age to the readers also sometimes other persons donot understand what is causing you do be like you did at one time they probably believe that you should snap out of it and be the way that you use to be number one that i suggest is to ignor the negative remarts if you canbecause you wont be able to do until you seek medical attention if you have not seen your primary care doctor or go to the clinic or try a walk in daytime care facility you definitely require lab tests to determine your medical problems and have the correct medicines for the low thyroid and the anemia if your body is not functioning properly then other things begin to fail also it is not uncommon to acquire signs of depression some doctors or even research will show that if your thyroid problems are in slow range that depression is a very likely symptom i would discuss this problem with the doctor about the mood changes and the highs and lows you are having some councelling would be a positive aid in the problems you are having this would be something that you would benefit from and ignor people that are negative about your good intentions to help yourself mentally and physically  Prostate cancer Folic acid Clinical depression Coeliac disease Cancer Hypoglycemia Medicine Stroke Anemia Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anorexia nervosa Bipolar disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homeopathy Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Adult attention-deficit disorder Stomach cancer Insulin Myocardial infarction Autism Neurofeedback Hypothyroidism Alcoholism Tocopherol Alternative medicine Weight training Hypertension Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Borderline personality disorder Chlorpromazine Fibromyalgia Sleep Psychiatry Cytomegalovirus Schizophrenia Colorectal cancer Obesity Transsexuality Sleep apnea Mesothelioma Post-traumatic stress disorder Meditation Down syndrome Thyroid Multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's disease Lupus erythematosus Pneumonia Turner syndrome Decompression sickness Malaria Androgen insensitivity syndrome HIV test Endocrinology Growth hormone treatment Haloperidol Sickle-cell disease Antidepressant Postpartum depression Dyslexia Atkins Nutritional Approach Addiction Puberty AIDS Doxepin Cephalic disorder Hyperthyroidism Electroconvulsive therapy Balance disorder Amiodarone Mental illness Asthma Hypnosis Charles Darwin's illness Breastfeeding Autoimmune diseases Scientology beliefs and practices Graves-Basedow disease Vitamin C Controversies in autism Atherosclerosis Explosive material Antiretroviral drug Psychotherapy Sexual dysfunction Acute lymphoblastic leukemia First aid Dialysis Veganism

do you trust your doctor just wondering how many people feel like their doctor is totally un sympathetic and really does not care about you personally i think my doctor is great he always has time to chat about my problem and i really trust him and he always recommends self help books from amazon to me to many doctors spend their time prescribing unnecessary pills to patients there is a great deal to be said for not ending every consultation with a prescription at least books have no side effects most doctors start of sympathetic but most patients have no concept of how gruelling the job is some doctors get ground down over the years they often react to this by poor quick prescribing antibiotics sleeping pills anti depressants and pain killers and on demand medical certificates we all know a good number of gps that get through their days like that others loose their compassion and just try and get through each day with as little involvement as possible however not all doctors are tarred with the same brush and many care even more the longer they are in practice  Psoriasis Physician Clinical depression Medical cannabis Medicine Prostate cancer General practitioner Migraine Chronic fatigue syndrome Palliative care First aid Transsexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Social rule Stomach cancer Quackery A Course In Miracles Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence National Health Service Traditional Chinese medicine Bipolar disorder Acne Pharmaceutical company Nurse Psychiatry Sedative COX-2 inhibitor Hypnosis Buprenorphine Health insurance Cystoscopy Physical therapy Canadian and American health care systems compared Pneumonia Antibiotic Sigmund Freud Church of Christ, Scientist Traumatic brain injury Emergency contraception Publicly funded medicine Insomnia Diabetes mellitus Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Oral contraceptive Milton H.
