yeast infections and doctors i have a yeast infection im almost positive im going to the go the regular doctor tomorrow but i don't want to go to the gyno i am virgin and everyone says it hurts horribly will my regular doctor be able to tell if it is a yeast infection they can do a swab without going deep or using a speculum so your virginity won't be an issue also if you do have a yeast infection you'll be given a prescription for a pill that is a one dose cure if the doc says to get monistat or similar ask for the yeast pill instead cream cures require insertion of the applicator and it wouldn't be as effective if not pushed past your hymen in the future if you feel at all itchy have a bottle of acidophilus pills handy and take one or two a day at the first signs it's a natural remedy that works for yeast infections it's not great if you've got a raging infection but will prevent or stop infections that are just beginning it's also a far cheaper cure than monistat which rings in around compared to for acidophilus the acidophilus will last for months of prevention though whereas the monistat is used up on one infection eating yogurt daily or often helps prevent yeast infections yogurt contains acidophilus gl and welcome to womanhood p  Candidiasis Psoriasis Lactobacillus acidophilus Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Herpes simplex virus Medical prescription Emergency contraception Common cold Rabies Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Garlic Patent medicine Medical cannabis Stomach cancer Acne Homeopathy Rum Fecal incontinence HIV vaccine Eczema Yoghurt Fertility awareness Methamphetamine Pharmaceutical company Athlete's foot Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Multiple sclerosis Coeliac disease Malaria Yeast Otitis externa Prostate cancer Tocopherol Vitamin D Guinea pig Brewery Menstrual cup Syphilis Characters in the Smurfs Breastfeeding Smallpox Cephalexin Lactose intolerance Antiretroviral drug Antidepressant Tuberculosis Wart Tattoo Ketoconazole Migraine Hyperglycemia Nutrition Enzyme Allergy Sexually-transmitted infection Flatulence Diazepam Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Days of our Lives Resident Evil Outbreak Computer virus Medical analysis of circumcision Genetically modified food Diabetes mellitus AIDS Quackery Childbirth Avian influenza Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Antibiotic Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Tobacco smoking Baldness treatments Clostridium difficile Anal sex Bacteria Aspergillosis Gonorrhoea Ulcerative colitis Alternative medicine Vitamin C Group A streptococcal infection Insomnia Gastroesophageal reflux disease Crohn's disease Anthrax Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fibromyalgia Medicine Clinical depression Alcoholic beverage Hiccup Brewing Senescence Subjunctive mood

taking birth control pills i've been taking birth control pills for about a month now i talked to my doctor about everything but then tonight i had some questions i hadn't thought to ask him when about will i get my period will it be right after i take my first inactive pill or shortly after also my doctor told me that women on birth control pills usually experience shorter periods well i noticed that i have seven inactive pills does this mean my period will last seven days or will it start after i've taken a few inactive pills and end before i've taken them all my periods normally last three days and if i'm going to have it for every day i have an inactive pill well i really don't want to go from three days to seven yuck i think it's different for everyone it takes me or placebo pills so or days before my period starts and then it only lasts days once you're on the pill for a few months you'll know exactly which day you're gonna get your period it's awesome to know you can plan all your beach activities around that one week or days another thing the pill does is make your periods very light which is also cool good luck if you ever have any questions you can also ask your pharmacist  Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Menstrual cycle Placebo Fertility awareness Psoriasis Baldness treatments Urinary incontinence Birth control Endometriosis Apollo 8 Alanis Morissette Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Antidepressant Migraine Slow Train Coming Childbirth Social rule Abortion debate Mid-Autumn Festival Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Depo Provera Friends Medical prescription Tocopherol Soap opera Randomized controlled trial Theodicy Aliens of London Oh My Goddess!

depo question my girlfriend has been on deprovera for about a year now and we still use a condom we have been faithful to each other for the entire length of our relationship so stds are not a concern for me i just want to know that she will not get pregnant if we have sex without a condom and i get off inside of her some expert or personal advice please it's a small risk but it is possible to still get pregnant according to my doctor and other studies the effectiveness rate is over depo provera works because it prevents the release of an egg from the ovary thus there is nothing to be fertilized by the sperm and a pregnancy cannot occur cervical mucus is thickened and it also thins the lining of the uterus which would make the uterus less hospitable to a fertilized egg should ovulation occur thankfully for me i have not gotten pregnant while on depo i've heard that some birth defects are possible if you do  Birth control In vitro fertilisation Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Condom Miscarriage Pelvic inflammatory disease Ovary Infertility Sexual reproduction Gonorrhoea Ovulation Sexual intercourse Puberty Abortion Childbirth Female reproductive system (human) Safe sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Twin Ovum Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Depo Provera Cervix Obstetrics Endometriosis Fertilisation Diaphragm (contraceptive) Oral sex Herpes simplex virus Progesterone Sexual abstinence Cervical cancer Sex education Spina bifida Premature birth Endometrial cancer Intersex surgery Ovarian cancer Folic acid Abortion debate Teenage pregnancy Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Intersexuality Anal sex Sexually-transmitted infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Estradiol Cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Cystic fibrosis Human cloning Cryptorchidism Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Colorectal cancer Estrus cycle Human papillomavirus Psoriasis Sterilization (surgical procedure) Turner syndrome Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Flowering plant Multiple birth Swyer syndrome AIDS pandemic AIDS Pornographic movie Human penis size Chimera (genetics) Tsetse fly Breech birth Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Endometrium HIV Malaria Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual differentiation Tobacco smoking Hydatidiform mole Intact dilation and extraction Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Cytomegalovirus Sex assignment Gynaecology Homosexuality and medical science Health issues and the effects of cannabis Prenatal diagnosis Roe v.

scarred can girls only help im scared of puberty u no peroid and mood swing and cramps but im more nervous about wen it will come and i have a check up soon what will the doctor do im hey there i know this will sound like a bad sex ed nurse speech but here goes i know its an intimidating time in your life where you will experience changes etc etc blah blah however despite how scary it seems its not actually that bad you are sorry if i make you feel too young immature only these changes usually do take their time and periods you get used to its just something you will learn to adjust to everyone is different and have their own preferences processes etc there is also plenty of guidance available i found through my early puberty stages that my mom was a god send even if it was a little embarrasing the most important thing to remember is that you are most definetly not alone hope that helped by the way i don't think you're doctor will be too intimidating i'm a nursing student uni and i've found that most doctros are quite welcoming and understanding only discuss what you feel comfortable discussing and ask questions throughout the whole process so you know you're in the loop  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Little Britain Iggy Pop Puberty Milton H.

girls only question about period school hi im and i don't feel comfortable carring around a purse all year in school so i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for carring pads tampons around school ps we can't use the bathroom between classes my backpack is to big to carry around with me i can't leave a pad on for the whole school day i hope someone can help me i know what you mean about the bathroom thing in middle school we had minutes to change classes when i got into highschool we had but more area to cover too so going in between classes was hard if you have lockers in the hallway then keep a little stash in there inside a small bag if your lockers are in a classroom then i wouldn't do that you wouldn't want to inerupt a class in middle school we had a cabinet in the bathroom and a group of use girls got together and would bring stuff to put in there you could also ask the nurse if she could keep some pads and tampons in there for the girls i used to have a pair of shoes called roos they have a little pocket on the side i would keep my lunch money in there but i'm sure you could keep the compact tampons in the pocket too go during lunch to change if you stop by the nurses office to pick up what you nee if you don't have it most nurses have a bathroom in their office so you can change in there if you don't feel comfortable using the other bathrooms if you carry a pencil pouch for like your pens and calulator and stuff you could get a little change purse to keep in there with some essentials i'm starting to run out of ideas haha these are all things i've done and i'm still alive if the teacher won't let you do during class just wisper to them that you have to take care of female stuff if they still say no then just walk out my friend has actually done that they really can't keep you from going to the bathroom not going puts your life in danger hope some of that helps you good luck in school  Columbine High School massacre Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Tampon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Friends Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sanitary towel Menstrual cup Great Teacher Onizuka Neighbours Fecal incontinence Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Paul Is Dead The Adventures of Pete & Pete Shit Shoe Sento Coming of Age (TNG episode) Blood on the Tracks Milton H.

i want to go see a ob gyn i want to go see a ob gyn but im a virgin ive only had oral a couple times what do they usually do do they put anything in there i want to see him cause i think im too tight down there ive tried to loose my virginity a couple of times but it doesnt open enough i would recommend going to a real ob gyn not a general practitioner although i am sure you are healthy gps are notorious for not detecting cervical uterine cancer i just buried my year old friend last week because her gp saw her uterine cancer but didn't recognize it as cancer i first went to a gyn when i was because i hadn't gotten my period in quite a while i started at it was horrible and traumatizing because the gyn was a complete buffoon it felt like rape to me be sure to talk to the nurse practitioner gyn before you go for your pelvic there are some gyns that specialize in first exams here is how most exams go breast exam to check for lumps it doesn't hurt the doctor will use a speculum metal instrument to take scraping from your cervix for a pap if you want to be tested for stds the sample will also be taken at this time the speculum isn't great fun but should not be painful many women get scared and have psychosomatic symptoms the doctor will do a digital exam she will use her fingers to feel your vagina and cervix for abnormalities she will also look around your vulva for any lesions this does not hurt either the doc will use ky jelly for the speculum and her fingers that is pretty much it no big deal if you are old enough to have sex you are old enough to get an exam it was traumatic for me because at i had never had sex it was degrading and looking back that doctor should not have needed to do a pelvic i didn't have sex until i was however i did hear that this doctor died horribly from brain cancer a few years back  Gynaecology Human papillomavirus Cervical cancer Endometrial cancer Cancer Gonorrhoea Cervix Colposcopy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fertility awareness Endometriosis Medicine Ovarian cancer Stomach cancer Abortion Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Urinary incontinence Vagina Sexual intercourse Breech birth Medical analysis of circumcision Colorectal cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Premature birth EastEnders Pap smear Breast cancer Masturbation Post-traumatic stress disorder Oral sex Anal sex Vulvovaginal health Fecal incontinence Genital wart Rape Strap-on dildo Brain tumor Miscarriage Ectopic pregnancy Physician Dyspareunia Pelvic inflammatory disease Sexually-transmitted infection Great Teacher Onizuka Breastfeeding Hysterectomy Futurama (TV series - season 3) Multiple sclerosis Traumatic incident reduction Cancer of the larynx Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cup Pregnancy AIDS reappraisal The Shining (film) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Massage General practitioner Condom Malignant melanoma Milton H.

periods and lifelong warfarin hi i am and since having my frst child yrs ago i have been on the depo provera contraceptive and have only had the normal bleed after each of my subsequent pregnancies before returning to the depo however having never had periods and thinking of having another baby the depo will have to be stopped so i guess my question is as i am on life long warfarin treatment for recurrent pe how am i going to know if my monthly bleeds are normal or heavier than someone not on warfarin and are my periods going to be heavier i am also very aware that i do have do discuss continuing warfain treatment with my gp when i wish to become pregnant i don't know the specific answers to your questions however i would like to point out that when i was on depo for only months when i quit taking it it took me a year and a half to finally get my first period after stopping so don't expect to get pregnant right away i would assume it may be quite a while until you even get a period after using depo for years it is one of the normal side effects check with your obgyn good luck though hope all goes well with your conception efforts  Depo Provera Miscarriage Abortion debate Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Amiodarone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Maprotiline Endometriosis Pulmonary embolism Childbirth Stomach cancer Friends Breast cancer Obstetrics Pelvic inflammatory disease Charmed Coagulation Chlorpromazine Maya calendar Autism Polycystic ovary syndrome Antiphospholipid syndrome Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Psoriasis Cephalic disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sharon Tate Normal distribution Gynecologic hemorrhage Growth hormone treatment Abortion Emergency contraception Social rule Knots Landing EastEnders In vitro fertilisation Progesterone Paroxetine Capecitabine Prostate cancer Atrial fibrillation Gonorrhoea Teenage pregnancy Controversies in autism Traumatic brain injury Ovarian cyst Stuttering Alcoholism Tocopherol Cancer Kurt Cobain Premature birth Neighbours Ectopic pregnancy Infertility Eugenics Prenatal diagnosis Folic acid Ulcerative colitis Glycogen storage disease type I Tobacco smoking Melanie Wilkes Scientology beliefs and practices Vitamin C The Joker's Wild Cytomegalovirus Laura Schlessinger The Amazing Race Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Abortion in Canada Migraine Crohn's disease Infantilism Coeliac disease Annuity Baldness treatments Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Malignant melanoma Bipolar disorder Sex education Ovarian cancer Hypoglycemia COX-2 inhibitor Condom First aid Ximelagatran Reservoir Dogs Malaria Turner syndrome Hypnosis

what might cause cloudy urine it's been that way for a few weeks btw i'm pregnant on prenatal vitamins i was thinking it might be a uti but i don't have any other symptoms well i have to urinate frequently but that's pregnancy what could it be i have an appointment in a week is that too long to wait i've also been drinking more fluids got cranberry juice i was a bit dehydrated for a while morning sickness and it was worse then it could be contributed to the prenatal vitamins there are several possible causes leading to cloudy urine certain types of food or drink can affect urine consistency and coloration including certain vitamins normal vaginal secretions can cause the urine to appear cloudy dehydration bladder infection or cystitis but if you are experiencing no symptoms i would rule out this possibility uti sometimes there can be no symptoms its very important to make sure when you are pregnant that you do not have a uti or developing one there are home tests you buy at the pharmacy blood in urine any blood in the urine may lead to cloudy urine which can be linked to a uti proteinuria condition in which urine contains an abnormal amount of protein usually caused by a kidney disease i do not believe you are experiencing this problem in my opinion i would make sure you are do not have a developing uti and talk to your doctor in the mean time drink some cranberry juice just to be on the safe side cranberry juice produces a hippuric acid in your urine which acidifies the urine and prevents bacteria from sticking to the walls of the bladder make sure its cran juice and not a juice cocktail i hope this helps  Prostate cancer Obstetrics Urine Urinary tract infection Pneumonia Vitamin C Diabetes mellitus Kidney stone Dehydration Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stomach cancer Nutrition Pregnancy Hypoglycemia Lupus erythematosus Guinea pig Psoriasis Gout Chronic fatigue syndrome Anemia Cancer Hyperglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetic nephropathy Medical analysis of circumcision Cytomegalovirus Cirrhosis Folic acid HIV test Malaria Tocopherol Fecal incontinence Escherichia coli O157:H7 Diabetic ketoacidosis Diarrhea Acne Blood Nephrology Tooth enamel Cystic fibrosis Coeliac disease Aspartame AIDS Diabetes insipidus Turner syndrome Alzheimer's disease Menstrual cycle Warfarin Gonorrhoea Dementia Herpes simplex virus Common cold IgA nephropathy Autoimmune diseases Stroke Bearberry Nephrotic syndrome Domestic rabbit Sickle-cell disease Hepatitis Multiple myeloma Vitamin Rabies Cephalic disorder Endometriosis Breastfeeding Prenatal diagnosis Protein-energy malnutrition Fibromyalgia Tooth Cystoscopy Schistosomiasis Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetic neuropathy Spina bifida Coagulation Diuretic Vitamin D Ebola Crohn's disease Prenatal care Mesothelioma Alcoholism Cocaine Hypertension Decompression sickness Inborn error of metabolism Cholera Leptospirosis

i'm scared okay so here is another question posted about possible pregnancy i know go buy a pregnancy test but i can't do that actually kind of hard to hide it from your mom hah but anyway let me explain what happened i did somethings got some stuff on my hand just a minor bit though and then as soon as it happened like i mean the second it happened i went to the bathroom and washed my hands throughly after that i went to go to the bathroom but before i wiped or even came within close contact with my vagina i washed my hands again and then once more after i used the bathroom and when i wiped i barely even touched it and i stayed right on top just incase i still had anything on my hand then afterwards i even changed my shorts i was wearing you know just incase i've still been worried about pregnacy for some reason i even called a health center and they said it was a in a million chance i could've gotten pregnant what do you guys think tell me this all happened a week and a few days ago ever since then i've felt awful but that is only because i've been sick with some sort of a stomach flu i think i'm just overreacting and the health center said they think i though about it to the point of getting my stomach so stressed out i can't relax my stomach is tight and in knots it feels like but i think the reason it's like that is because i can't go to the bathroom yes i'm constapated p but thismorning i woke up and one of my breats were sore i think that is also just because i've been sleeping with a bra off something i normally don't do and because i went camping over the weekend and worked many muscles in my body i know if your pregnant your breasts get sore but i thought that happened more into pregnancy and both of them would ache not just and it isn't continual pain it just hurts a little if i lay on it does anyone have any advice for me i'm not nauseated and i don't feel hungry like at all oh you poor thing you are getting yourself worked up for nothing it really is highly unlikely that you could be pregnant and your worry is making your body play tricks on you you did the right thing being careful and washing your hands i think you should be just fine relax worry like this can even cause your period to be delayed which will only compound the situation because you will be thinking you really are pregnant when you're not  Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Knots Landing EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Common cold Mattress Menstrual cup Social rule Abortion debate Milton H.

question about cerazette contaceptive pill hi iv been on the pop micronor for about yrs maybe longer and have had no problems with it i went to doctors today to get more and the doctor said i should try cerazette i have children all planned are only month old twins so when she mentioned that it can stop periods and ovulation and is more reliable i thought id get some to try children is plenty for us but now iv read the side effects im not sure i dont know if its worth swapping because micronor has always been reliable and never caused me any side effects anyone out there that uses has used cerazette would you like to tell me how you got on with it if you had any side effects etc to help me make up my mind it would be very helpful and appreciated thanks micronor is a progesterone only pill too its side effect profile is identical to micronor it also works in exactly the same way micronor also tends to stop ovulation and periods cerazette is a newer version of the same thing doctors and patients tend to prefer cerazette as it has a much longer safety window this means that unlike micronor which needs to be taken within hours of the set time each day cerazette has a hour window much like the combined pill there are few other differences  Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Progesterone Birth control Psoriasis IBM PC compatible Apollo 8 Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma In vitro fertilisation Urinary incontinence Ovulation Acne Pregnancy Puberty Progesterone only pill Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gregory Goodwin Pincus Antidepressant Bipolar disorder Abortion debate Radiation therapy Polycystic ovary syndrome F.

birth controll pill side effects i was taking birth control pills i was on ortho try cyclin lo i started taking them i took the first pills of the pack then i made the decision to stop the useage due to the bad side effects that i was getting from the pill so i has been days since i have not taken the pill and today in the morning i had spotting i didnt have any spotting while i was taking the pill my question is is it normal for this spotting to occur even though im no longer taking the pill i have not had sex in the past month so im not preganat as one the post states the spotting is probably your body's reaction to the withdrawal of hormones it had been getting it's the same principle as when you start the placebos at the end of the pack it's normal if it doesn't go away in a week or so call your doc for advice i know those side effects are awful but you only gave the pill days it can take months for all of the side effects to subside if you can handle it i think it's worth it to be patient however i know sometimes it's just too much and some women's bodies just will not accept those hormones do what's right for you  Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acne Emergency contraception Psoriasis Fertility awareness Antidepressant Endometriosis Prostate cancer Birth control Depo Provera Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Placebo Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glucocorticoid Abortion debate Amiodarone Puberty Caffeine Nutrition Vitamin D Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homosexuality and transgender Transsexuality Baldness treatments Diazepam Randomized controlled trial Allergy Pregnancy Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy Testosterone Cancer Turner syndrome Sex education Human penis size COX-2 inhibitor Sex assignment Stomach cancer Radiation therapy Alanis Morissette Atherosclerosis Breastfeeding Childbirth Legal aspects of transsexualism Insulin Growth hormone treatment Intersexuality Syphilis Obstetrics Paroxetine Signal transduction Herpes simplex virus Hypoglycemia Homeopathy Maprotiline Breast Gregory Goodwin Pincus Mid-Autumn Festival Social rule Breast cancer Bupropion Haloperidol Progesterone Hypertension Drug addiction Multiple sclerosis Strap-on dildo Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Chemotherapy American football Sleep Hormone Rocky Mountain spotted fever Baldness Placebo effect Gallstone Morning sickness Anabolic steroid Neighbours Pharmaceutical company Migraine Adverse effect (medicine) History of intersex surgery Resident Evil Outbreak Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clinical depression Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sexual revolution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tag Treaty Growth hormone deficiency Sexual differentiation Dietary fiber Katharine McCormick

pap smear tests while doing a pap test does the doctor test for hpv my last pap smear came back normal my question is if my test came back normal could i still have hpv normally an initial pap smear is just to see if there are abnormal cells when it does come back abnormal they usually do another one to see if it is hpv or something else they may be able to tell from the first sample whether or not you have it but usually they do it if you have an abnormal sample it's this is a very slim to none chance btw possible that you can have hpv but it's not likely since it came back normal of course when you go again next year you could have contracted hpv so make sure to always use condoms with your partner as you usually get it from males because they're carriers for it of course it can be passed down from your mom but more likely than not it came from a guy so congrats you most likely don't have hpv  Cervical cancer Human papillomavirus Cancer Genital wart Medical analysis of circumcision Herpes simplex virus Prostate cancer Colposcopy Endometrial cancer Obstetrics Sickle-cell disease Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Gynaecology Complete blood count Sexually-transmitted infection Circumcision Gonorrhoea Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tag Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anemia Metastasis Infertility Condom Malaria Oral sex Blood film Cystic fibrosis Apoptosis Medical laboratory Cytogenetics Histology Mesothelioma Huntington's disease Hemolytic anemia Duchenne muscular dystrophy Lumbar puncture Color blindness Inclusion body myositis Thalassemia AIDS reappraisal Urinary incontinence Ovarian cancer Coagulation Cryptorchidism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Staining (biology) Acne Cardiac stress test Lymphocyte Intelligence quotient Turner syndrome Hypoglycemia Pat Smear Medical test Vulvovaginal health Penile cancer In vitro fertilisation Safe sex Normal distribution Puberty Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Haemochromatosis Leukemia Lupus erythematosus Multiple sclerosis Cephalic disorder Pneumonia Acute myelogenous leukemia Cardiac arrhythmia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Atheroma Autism Cancer of the larynx Iris (anatomy) History of Singapore Genetic disorder Kidney Rabies Plasmodium falciparum IgA nephropathy Cervix AIDS Breech birth Chromosome Anal sex Genetic fingerprinting Pedophilia Intersex surgery Bipolar disorder Electrocardiogram Gaucher's disease Down syndrome Kurt Cobain Intersexuality Fecal incontinence

question about sex being unusually painfull for the past year or so every time my fiance and i make love it is extremely painfull i have cramps for the next few days after we do it and he is scared to even do it with me sometimes is there anything i can do to stop this from happening i mean i thought making love felt good and it's not even bearable at all anyone experienced this i am going to make an appointment i was just seeing if anyone else has ever experienced this from the information i have looked up it may be ovarian cysts which can come and go from strees etc yes i have and it's not normal or so i have been told sounds like a trip to the gyn is warranted you want to rule out things like pelvic inflammatory disease or other things that could be causing you this pain seriously go to a male gyn and tell him you can't enjoy sex with your partner because it's too painful and he will make sure he does everything he can to help you find some relief for that it's in the male handbook i think but really they are very helpful and want to get to the cause of the pain so it's time to check it out i am assuming you have tried different positions to find one that is anatomically comfortable for you and your partner it could be an anatomy issue and you would be surprised at what a little positioning can do good luck  Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Sexual intercourse Prostate cancer Ovarian cyst Orgasm Medicine Dysmenorrhea Pelvic inflammatory disease Anal sex Fecal incontinence Sin City Child sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Happiness Infantilism Medical analysis of circumcision Milton H.

my friend and i were debating this if your on the birth control pill and your scheduled period doesn't happen on time can it be late from stress or other factors even if it's starting time and ending time is determined by the pill well the period you get with bc pill is not real period which is why its different in how many days you have it or how crampy you get you are right about that the pill determine you period but sometimes it can be affected but stress or hormonal changes that you cant control and also you dont ovulate while you are on the pill becasue your body is faked into being pregnant  Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Birth control Endometriosis Acne Pregnancy EastEnders Puberty Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sleep Psoriasis Caffeine Guinea pig Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hormone Ovulation Human height Neighbours In vitro fertilisation Infertility Sedative Ovarian cyst Nutrition Abortion Apollo 8 Intrauterine device Homosexuality and transgender Folic acid Insulin Biology and sexual orientation Progesterone Days of our Lives Breast Abortion debate Prostate cancer Depo Provera Obstetrics Cancer Hypoglycemia Estrus cycle Charmed Hypertension Childbirth Clinical depression Knots Landing Intersexuality Gender role Stress (medicine) The Venture Bros.

i am having trouble getting wet before sex i am and in my second marriage i never had an orgasm until i met my second husband our sex life is great and i have never had a problem getting wet before sometimes i would get so wet we woud have to change the sheets for the last week or so i havent been able to get wet i am turned on and want to have sex i started dieting about weeks ago and have been exercising and using the atkins diet and have lost lbs already could this be the reason i am unable to get wet it is they only thing i can think of i dont want to go off the diet or stop exercising because i am getting such good results but i also want to be able to enjoy sex without using lubricants please help i'm not an expert by any means but by my understanding estrogen and other female hormones are stored in fat and when you lose fat these hormones are released into your body and wreak havoc for a while it doesn't matter what diet you are on but it tends to show up pretty strongly with a low carb diet because the initial weight loss is so rapid this is also why women frequently notice changes in their monthly cycle when losing a lot of weight if you go to this forum http forums lowcarber org and ask you question i bet you'll find others having the same problem i expect that it will pass when you stop losing weight however it's always best to consult with a doctor if there is a problem  Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Puberty Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Anorexia nervosa Obesity Oral contraceptive Weight training Insulin Sexual orientation Zone diet Domestic rabbit Diabetes mellitus Hyperglycemia Hormone replacement therapy Weight loss Orgasm Exercise Birth control Tocopherol Menstrual cycle Protein-energy malnutrition Oral sex Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Hypertension Little Britain Osteoporosis Binge eating disorder Social rule Cancer Case-control Adjustable gastric band Child sexuality Sexual dysfunction Theory of conduct Bodybuilding Childbirth Chronic fatigue syndrome Hair Sauna Sexual intercourse Protein Homosexuality and transgender Traumatic brain injury Infantilism Extreme Programming Polycystic ovary syndrome Androgen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Religion and sexuality Coeliac disease Dehydroepiandrosterone Masters and Johnson Fertility awareness Human height Legal aspects of transsexualism Guinea pig Turner syndrome Gender identity About a Boy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Castration Fancy rat Carbon dioxide Jam (TV series) Fecal incontinence Folic acid Human Piccolo Junior Saga Sex Pistols Baldness Negima Gallstone Gender-neutral language Veganism Mixed martial arts Masturbation Carburetor Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses History of intersex surgery Bedwetting Strap-on dildo Sex assignment Equine conformation Woman Intersex surgery Motorcycle Signal transduction

questions about the pill when you take the pill you are told that in my case you must start on the first day of your period to make sure you are not pregnant then take it for days and stop for before starting the cycle again if you stop for days for example and only then start the next cycle dop you run the risk of getting pregnant why and not or and why can you get pregnant if you forget for days and not when you stop for a week what's the difference if someone could explain this to me as clearly as possible i'd be very grateful thanks ok first when i started my pills i was not told to start on the first day of my period i was told to start on the first sunday after my period started that way i would always start a new pack on sunday the only exception is if you start your period on sunday then you start your pills on sunday then you are supposed to take the live pills the ones that are actually filled with hormones for days weeks then you take the placebo pills or blank pills for days after that this is so your hormone levels change and allow your body to have a period it flushes everything out so you can start a new cycle your entire cycle the weeks of hormone pills and week of period pills equals days which is the average length of a woman's cycle if you go for more than days on blank pills or if you are like me and you just throw them away and take nothing for those period days then you run the risk of your body being off of those hormones for too long and you can get pregnant your body will ovulate approximately days after your period starts you have to start taking your pills again on time so that you can prevent the egg from entering the uterus and possibly getting fertilized and you becoming pregnant if you forget your pill for days earlier in your pill pack like during the first weeks you probably will not get pregnant you would just need to take two pills a day for two days so you can catch back up and be on track if you forget pills near the end of your pill pack during week then your period will probably start early and you just throw away the rest of the pack and start a new pack on the day that you would normally start taking them like sunday in my case hope that helped feel free to email me if you want  Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Pregnancy Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Birth control Ovulation Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Acne In vitro fertilisation Miscarriage Gregorian calendar Estrus cycle Computus Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Tour de France Prostate cancer Psoriasis Hebrew calendar Ectopic pregnancy Twin Nutrition Folic acid Infertility Ovarian cancer Progesterone Hormone replacement therapy Human chorionic gonadotropin Malaria Obstetrics Turner syndrome Friends Homosexuality and transgender Sexual differentiation Orgasm Sleep Tide Intrauterine device Hormone Abortion Depo Provera Endometrium Antidepressant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma National Football League Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Menstrual cup The Inside Kodocha Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Human height Fasting Tobacco smoking Caffeine Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Gregory Goodwin Pincus Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Atherosclerosis Conker's Bad Fur Day Sexual reproduction Breast cancer Female reproductive system (human) Biology and sexual orientation Neighbours Religion and abortion Glucocorticoid Ovary Maya calendar Pregnancy test Tag Poker jargon Signal transduction Ocean's Twelve Swyer syndrome Volleyball Morning sickness Chemical abortion Fertilisation Diazepam Cryptorchidism Time Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Resident Evil Outbreak Vitamin D Weight training The Dalek Invasion of Earth Social rule Extreme Programming Sumo

broken hymen i am a virgin however i think have managed to break my hymen i own a toy made from glass which i have ahd for sometime but recently i have been m sterb ting much more frequently and have been much rougher with myself now i am quite sore lol but no where inside the actual vagina it is specifically the hymen that hurts me if i touch it no the hymen is not inside the vagina it's not the muscles that hurt me it is only the hymen i was wondering if it is possible that i have broken it or torn it slightly it is fine if i leave it alone but it sort of burns aches if i touch it so have i done damage haha or am i just sore not worried but very curious thank you for answers thoughts please serious answers only for bigeyes some proof that the hymen is not inside the vagina and that you obviously have no idea what you are talking about http www soc ucsb edu sexinfo article teensex refid the hymen is external deal the hymen is external i have no idea why so many people seem to think it's inside or what their problem is anyway it can be quite common for girls to stretch or tear their hymen the way you did it's also possible you just made the entrance sore from jacking off too much with the friction i don't know how big your toy is but you may have gradually stretched your opening if you've been using different objects for a long period or you may have torn it before or maybe still not torn it if your glass toy is very small there probably would have been pain and blood and you would have noticed it incidentally i didn't know they made toys from glass and i think you should be very careful about using that just so it doesn't break or get sharp i would say wait a day or two without masturbating or doing anything and see if it gets better wash it carefully if the pain doesn't go after a couple of days then you might have done some more damage in which case i recommend seeing a doctor and being careful with yourself from now on  Menstrual cup Anal sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Strap-on dildo Masturbation Condom Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Virgin Tampon Deconstruction Vagina Human sexual behavior Domestic violence Child sexuality Traumatic brain injury Female genital cutting Androgen insensitivity syndrome Theory of conduct Childbirth Massage The Inside Babe Ruth Safe sex Oral sex Weight training Piccolo Junior Saga Land mine Pain Jon Secada Casting Milton H.

if a girl dont feel comftarble where she is at during sex is it possible she wont enjoy sex when i mean she dont feel comftarble i mean like lets say she is paranoid or some walkin in or like its just not a safe place or good atmosphere to have sex if she is feelin like that is it possible she wont enjoy it if she feels uncomfortable in any way she may get easily distracted and she may not be able to stay in the mood personally i don't enjoy sex as much when i'm not comfortable some people enjoy the thrill of knowing they may get caught but if it's by parents or something it usually just makes people tense and nervous and that generally kills the passion  Atomic Kitten Transsexuality The Catcher in the Rye Jam (TV series) Friends My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Jennifer Lopez Narcissism Serial killer Strap-on dildo W.I.T.C.H.

does it hurt to loose your virginity and what happens after u'r cherry pops there can be pain when the hymen breaks upon penatration there can also be some blood the hymen is the thin membrane that sometimes covers the opening to the vagina if you're a virgin i say sometimes because even if you haven't had sex the hymen can do a bit of a disappearing act due to an overzealous workout at the gym horseback riding tampons and even passionate heavy petting with your boyfriend it's not an impenetrable barrier anyway as it has holes to allow menstrual blood to escape when you're turned on the uterus and cervix rise lengthening the vaginal tube when his penis penetrates the walls of the vagina stretch to accommodate the difference for some the first few times might make you feel sore as it's been an unused muscle or even hurt if you aren't properly lubericated like the guy is in a hurry doesn't arouse you and your body isn't ready relaxing foreplay being fully aroused or better yet you having an orgasm first or using a lubricant like ky jelly or astro glide can help  Vagina Sexual intercourse Anal sex Hymen Human sexual response cycle Strap-on dildo Orgasm Menstrual cycle Virgin Condom Cervix Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual arousal Safe sex Masturbation Sex toy Puberty Personal lubricant Human sexuality Sex organ Obstetrics Childbirth Massage Erogenous zone Female reproductive system (human) Fertility awareness Sexual dysfunction Uterus Vaginal lubrication Gonorrhoea Diaphragm (contraceptive) Fetal development Sexual reproduction Fecal incontinence Pornographic movie Zoophilia Gliding action First aid Pedophilia Fisting Sexual differentiation Dyspareunia Gynaecology Equine conformation Human penis size Breech birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Premature ejaculation Endometriosis Herbert Garrison Premature birth Oral contraceptive Drawn Together Physical intimacy Rape Deconstruction Anorgasmia Naruto jutsu Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sanitary towel Vibrator Social rule Hysterectomy Herpes simplex virus Pregnancy Bondage (BDSM) Cervical cancer EastEnders Intersexuality Great Teacher Onizuka Domestic violence Male reproductive system (human) Masters and Johnson Old wives' tale Endometrial cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sterilization (surgical procedure) Prostate cancer Anus History of intersex surgery Diving Drill bit Temporal bone Archery Sin City

allrite i need to get this straight allright so i have been seeing all kinds of messages about sex hurting the first time my b f and i have been talking about it and as been said before he is trying to push me towards having sex but i just want to get it straight what would help to make it not hurt why does it hurt and anything else i should be aware of i already know there is a risk of pregnancy std etc but i just want some striaghtfoward answers thank you the reason for the pain discomfort burning sensation is that the hymen is stretched and broken essentially tearing it away from the vaginal wall there isn't really a whole lot that can be done to prevent the discomfort if he has used a finger before this may also create tears in the hymen but there will still be an element of pain discomfort with the initial act don't let the fear of what you may experience the first time make you afraid to do it again your bf needs to let you heal for a few days before trying again as you gain more experience it will become pleasurable just take your time and don't rush things edit about minutes later too a guy will say if you love me you will do it well he is not showing you respect aka love by telling you that most guys have this thing i don't know something to put another notch on their belt or something don't get into a situation where you do this then all of a sudden he stops calling and talking to you because essentially he has used you to place that notch he will give reassurances promises but remember presents aren't promises kisses aren't contracts know yourself and how you think of yourself respect yourself to hold off another day taking your time as above  Anal sex Human sexual behavior Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

my hips are acting weird please suggestions would be nice when i was pregnant i was making too much progesterone it was causing the ligaments around my hips and pevis to soften and they streached so when i slept on my sides my hips would pop and crack and snap horribly it sometimes was very painful like they were almost dislocated the doctor told me it was normal because of the hormonal imbalance now after she is born they were good for about months now they are back to popping and cracking when i move from side to side during sleeping it doesnt do that when i am sitting or walking only when i lay on my side i wonder if a chiropracter can help me i talked again with the doctor and he said he wouldnt worry about it unless they continue or if i actually dislocate one i find that kinda stupid why should i wait till that happens i have had a dislocated shoulder and that was one of the most painful things in my life i dont want to do that to my hips any suggestions or simular stories i'm sorry you're not feeling well i think the best thing is to go to a chiropractor because i think a second opinion would be best if he says it is okay then i wouldn't worry about it too much i don't have any similiar stories sorry i hope this answer helps though  Chiropractic Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story Carpal tunnel syndrome Menstrual cycle Osteopathy Equine conformation Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Halliwell Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Breastfeeding Kodocha The Shining (film) Professional wrestling holds Atomic Kitten Humphrey Bogart Subluxation Avenue Q Le Malade imaginaire Fibromyalgia The Pet Sounds Sessions Endometriosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Father's Day (Doctor Who) Ben Johnson (athlete) Theory of conduct Social rule Friends Aerial (dance move) Swingout Mattress Milton H.

why does bleeding occur while in the female on top position not all the time but most of the time i have two sex partners i only bleed when i'm on top with one of my partners no issues at all with the other partner never sex at the same time with both of them and they have almost the same size penis if your partner is rougher then the other this can cause some bleeding being rough can cause tearing and can rub the skin raw and cause it to bleed you might not notice a difference in size but there may be a difference they both may be average size as far as girth goes but length could be a different story if one is longer then the other it will obviously go in farther and could cause some bleeding just take it easy and maybe try other positions a little more often please be careful with having two partners make sure you are being safe good luck  Anal sex Strap-on dildo Puberty Penis Human penis size Bleeding Oral sex Condom Sexual intercourse Equine conformation Orgasm Intersex surgery Human sexual behavior Safe sex Gender role Penis enlargement Manicure Breastfeeding Callus Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical analysis of circumcision Androgen insensitivity syndrome Violin Shoe size Zoophilia Menstrual cycle Herpes simplex virus Nile crocodile Stroke Sexual differentiation Female genital cutting Group sex Birth control Civil unions in the United Kingdom Drill bit Shaving Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Gonorrhoea Mattress Abortion Platypus John Holmes (actor) Age of consent Stomach cancer Gay slang Bondage (BDSM) Masturbation ECW One Night Stand Upholstery Penis envy Acne Pubic hair Premature ejaculation Malignant melanoma First aid Wound Anal masturbation Swingout Intersexuality Ebola Internal ballistics Lightning Transsexuality Human sexual response cycle Friction Goatse.cx Ric Flair Sin City Sex assignment Traumatic brain injury Hipparchus (astronomer) Aerial (dance move) Quicksort Smallpox Tourniquet Woman on top sex position Double bass Diamond cut Sonar Child sexuality Bleed Like Me (single) Sexual reproduction Small penis humiliation UTF-8 Perfume Domination & submission (BDSM) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sex and the City Blood type Bled Sten Crystal methamphetamine and sex History of intersex surgery Bleed Like Me Bong Cervical cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AIDS

girls only period question i am days late and i know i am not pregnant i feel like i am going to start but haven't as of yet sorry for being graphic but my stomach is really upset which is not pretty i feel nauseaus and have a terrible headaches is this normal and does this mean my period could be bad and heavy i have to work tomorrow and thursday and i don't want them to be days from hell i think stress may be the cause of my period being late other that i eat heathy and exercise regularly if your positive your not pregnant and your period has never done this before then don't fret i promise you have no serious problems but i can't guarantee that it wont be heavy and bad when it does come the stress can be a serious factor though and it could cause you to miss your period for several months the headaches themselves if bad enough can cause your stomach to be upset and make you feel nauseous you can take an over the counter pain pill but also use bengay muscle rub icy hot works the best and rub it on wherever the pain feels like its coming from especially the temples neck shoulders and scalp keep it away from your eyes though this stuff will work wonders also you may wanna try drinking at least a cup of peppermint tea which you can get at any grocer or walmart you may be someone who hates tea but the peppermint will help control menstrual cramping get rid of gas and help with the upset stomach hope this helps  Menstrual cycle Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Milton H.

i just posted a questions but your opinion and experience i just thought of a few more questions so i decided to post another question has anyone asked their doctors about using tampons before they started if so how did you ask and what was their response also was it really uncomfortable and how did you come up with the courage to ask i didn't ask my doctor when i started using in my 's i didn't think i needed to because all that i needed to know was on the back of the box its a little scary because you hear about all these horror stories like forgetting about them untill an infections starts or getting it lost up there etc it's not really scarry if you take the precautions like changing them every hours a must because of the toxic syndrome risk i personally change every time i go to the bathroom some wemen don't do it even if they urinate i think that you should because the urine gets inside the tampon and that must not be good and i'v done the test myself and it does absorb the urine and another thing i don't do is leave it on over night but if it makes you feel more comfortable consulting with your doctor i would give him or her a call and ask if you need to make an appointment to ask a question about tampons or could you ask over the phone another think you could do is when you go for your papsmear check or physical ask about tampons good luck  Menstrual cup Tampon Prostate cancer Toxic shock syndrome Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule The Shining (film) Milton H.

i'm confused about bra sizing i am now but i started wearing bras like a few years ago and i started out wearing a a then as time went on i guess i got bigger in size and then i started wearing a and i was wearing that ever since but the thing is i was always coming out of my shirts and i always showed a lot of cleavage and then people kept making rude comments me and saying that i had a really big chest so i was getting sick of it so today i went to a victoria's secret and they measured me and told me that i was actually a c so i guess i was coming out of my shirts because my bras were too small but i don't know i bought a few bras and i am still coming out of my shirts not that much though it got a lot better and the bras fit well but i don't know if they are still my size for sure my question is how do you know what bras are best you and how can you tell your exact size thanks so much your help i appreciate it oh and i have another question can a woman have two different bra sizes or is there only one that fits you perfectly because some as fit me some bs fit me and some cs fit me i don't know what my specific cup size would be thanks again oh and my shirts aren't the problem they aren't too small or slim on me i have bought bigger sizes and i'm still sticking out well they are pretty good vs about measuring you so you probably are a c but you also need to think about the style of bra you are getting some are meant to enhance cleavage so if you don't wanna show off what you got don't get those also if you wanna take it a step further i know for sure dept stores like dillard's sells minimizer bras that well minimize you so just shop around and remember always check out the style good luck shopping  Brassiere Undergarment Social aspects of clothing Social rule Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Bra (Dragon Ball) Computer numbering formats U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Skinhead The Ashlee Simpson Show Cleavage (breasts) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

our first time together did she have an orgasm or was it just really good well during our forplay session she started turning red as i touched her then after insertion she got even more redder and at the end she was a red as a beet she was almost as red as her hair it was kinda scary at first because i never seen my love turn so red before and her green eyes where so deep and glossy as she stared at me deeply she did get really tight on me and i thought i felt her throbbing on me and she looked like she wanted to scream but she just breathed really hard she won't answer me and she gets really red in the face everytime i talk about last night i asked her did i do anything wrong or anything i should do and she just says no while getting red in the face while staring at the floor i knew her since th grade we are now and she has never told me a lie and it also was our first time having sex period she must have told one of her bff because they keep on telling me not to send her to the moon or something like that only she knows for sure either way you did something right so i wouldn't change it since she didn't complain try not to push the issue i know you are curious but you aren't sure how she is feeling women in our society are sometimes taught that sexuality is shameful and that they shouldn't enjoy sex obviously this is wrong but she may have conflicting feelings if you have sex again i wouldn't worry about whether she had an orgasm on this incident it's more important that she is comfortable with you  Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Child sexuality Orgasm Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Sexual intercourse Milton H.

what kind of ultrasound would they do if they are looking at my fallopian tubes i have really bad cramps and the doctor said she was going to do an ultrasound to see if there is something wrong with my fallopian tube i was just wondering if anybody else had this done and what type of ultrasound did they use as far as ultrasounds go you will most likely have both the external abdominal and transvaginal ones done the external u s is done via the outer belly pelvic area for that you will be drinking a certain amount of water to fill the bladder so that the images are clear the transvaginal u s is done via a probe inserted into the vagina it's not painful at all don't worry it gives a clearer view sometimes and the bladder is empty for it what a relief i'm wondering if you will also be scheduled for an hsg hysterosalpingogram which is a test to actually check the fallopian tubes for blockage a dye is injected via catheter through the cervix while an x ray is done the dye makes it possible for the radiologist and physicians to see the fallopian tubes this is a test that may cause some cramping either during the procedure and or afterwards before this particular test it's a good idea to take some ibuprofen to prevent too much cramping good luck to you i hope that all is well  Urinary incontinence Ectopic pregnancy Prostate cancer Endometriosis Gynaecology Obstetrics Gonorrhoea In vitro fertilisation Cystoscopy Acupuncture Dialysis Pelvic inflammatory disease Gastroparesis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cancer Menstrual cycle Cervix Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Radiology Pregnancy Radiation therapy Intersex surgery Menstrual cup Intact dilation and extraction Medicine X-ray Intravenous therapy Abortion Medical imaging Sexual intercourse Abdomen Urinary system Cervical cancer Interventional radiology Vagina Medical ultrasonography Hepatitis Fertilisation Vaginal bleeding Sexual reproduction Computed tomography Fecal incontinence Aortic dissection Lethal injection Spina bifida Sex organ Syringomyelia Cholecystitis Bowel obstruction Malignant melanoma Cramp Intravascular ultrasound Miscarriage Prenatal diagnosis Stroke Brewery Traditional Chinese medicine Epidural Varicocele Terri Schiavo Erectile dysfunction Philips Osteoarthritis Female reproductive system (human) Kidney Intersexuality Premature birth Renal cell carcinoma Abdominal pain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infertility Oscilloscope Echocardiography Tattoo Lung cancer Sex assignment Cathode ray tube Uterine fibroids Mesothelioma Gynecologic hemorrhage Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Cancer Strap-on dildo Breast cancer Local anesthesia Apollo 8 Ultrasound Cryptorchidism Hemorrhoid Endoscopy Venipuncture Non-invasive (medical) Insulin Atherosclerosis Condom Artificial insemination Guinea pig

i thought ortho tri cyclen lo was supposed to make acne better not worse i'm on my twelfth day using this birth control pill and i have noticeably more pimples than i did before starting it especially on my back they are small so is this just 'cause i just started using this pill how long will i have to wait for the acne to go down before the pill it wasn't even too bad ortho may cause your acne to get better but it's not a guarantee it is a listed side effect that your acne may worsen i wouldn't panic yet though you've only been on birth control for two weeks and your hormones are going through crazy cycles to regulate to the pill it will probably take three months before your body is used to it until that time expect side effects like spotting and breakouts don't stop taking the pill without talking to your doctor  Acne Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Isotretinoin Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Puberty Anabolic steroid Prostate cancer Psoriasis Birth control Alanis Morissette Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Caffeine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diazepam The Pet Sounds Sessions Pregnancy Baldness treatments Antidepressant Ben Johnson (athlete) Tocopherol Scar Operation Market Garden Piccolo Junior Saga Placebo Prohormone Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Old wives' tale Sleep Soap opera Rugby union Hey Jude Taxi Driver Knots Landing Testosterone Chronic fatigue syndrome Smallpox Kodocha Social rule Clinical depression Sleeping Murder Panic attack Theory of conduct Dietary fiber Hangover Spice Girls Hormone Ashton-Tate Neighbours Boom Town (Doctor Who) Abortion debate The Ashlee Simpson Show 1957 World Series Craps Migraine Shaggy dog story Blonde on Blonde The Inside Polycystic ovary syndrome Stomach cancer Apollo 8 Punk ideology Elvis Presley Humphrey Bogart Dexamethasone Milton H.

why is a colonoscopy performed how is it performed is it painful a colonoscopy is performed to detect the early signs of colon cancer polyps and if any polyps are found they are removed then a colonscopy is quick and easy usually and they put you to sleep for it there is no pain because you are knocked out you are asked to prepare the night before by not eating anything after midnight and you have to drink this stuff that makes you go to clean out your colon the preparation is the worse part the colonoscopy itself is nothing the next morning you go in early about two hours before your procedure where they take your information and you are taken to a room to get dressed in a hospital gown your surgeon comes in and explains the procedure to you and sees if you have any questions an anesthesiologist comes in and explains what he she does puts you asleep and monitors your vitals and starts the anesthesia process how it is performed after you're knocked out you're placed on your side on the table and they stick a long tube up your butt the end of the tube has a light camera and pincers at the front of it the surgeon slowly moves the tube up your colon looking for any abnormalities and polyps gas is also pumped into you to make viewing easier if any abnormalities are found polyps the surgeon removes them the polyps are sent to the lab to determine if they are benign or malignant cancerous after you wake up you make feel a little groggy and have to pass gas but otherwise you're feeling good within an hour or so you go home always driven by a family member  Colorectal cancer Cancer Prostate cancer Colonoscopy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Virtual colonoscopy Sigmoidoscopy Stomach cancer Medicine Anesthesia Familial adenomatous polyposis Endometrial cancer Breast cancer Malignant melanoma Hemorrhoid Shaggy dog story Metastasis Barium enema Dialysis Abortion Cancer of the larynx The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Adjustable gastric band Combine (Half-Life 2) The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Thermal power station Conspiracy (TNG episode) Intersex surgery Diabetic retinopathy STS-62 Out-of-body experience Stroke Futurama (TV series - season 5) Lung cancer Crohn's disease Kitchen Breastfeeding Cholecystitis Brain tumor Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Scientology beliefs and practices Vacuum tube Theory of conduct The Inside Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Ark in Space Computer Fecal incontinence The Time Machine Ovarian cancer Fecal occult blood Colposcopy Kingdom Hospital Tumor USS Tunny (SS-282) The Big Sleep Stem cell Fossil fuel power plant Hypoglycemia Euthanasia Apollo 8 Gynaecology Sleep apnea The Empty Child Stereoscopy EastEnders Sleep Endoscopy One (Voyager episode) James Hanratty Textile manufacturing Oscilloscope Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Tank Intravenous therapy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Professional wrestling match types The Night's Dawn Trilogy Bowel obstruction Japanese tea ceremony

i need tips about the pill i'm year old girl and i'm on birth control for the purpose of regualting my periods since i've been on it i haven't noticed any side affects but are there any long term side affects i've been taking it for months now and i'll only be taking it for a couple more months also how does the pill make you skip your period is it safe does taking the pill cause any cancers diseases disorders or osteoporosis or any ohter health alterations there really are no long term side affects but you should talk to your gyn likely you are on a low dosage being that if you stopped taking your pill for days all its affects would leave your system sometimes with a strong pill there can be side affects such as weight gain or lack of sex drive but again this is all based on the pill you are taking at that time and no pills really have long standing affects if you were taking the pill of the next years and honeslty if you're periods were irregular like mine were when i was that age why even stop then i'd say you have something to worry about long term maybe but if only a few months then no nothing to worry about i personally do not see the big deal about pills that make you skip your period other people like it personally anytime my period has gotten close to not showing up it worries me one way or another it's dumping enough in your system to make your body think it's pregnant i'm sure there isn't anything bad about it just a personal preference at your age and just on it for as little a time as you are i would go on a pill where you have your period every month especially if the whole purpose of it is to regulate it  Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Fertility awareness Psoriasis Folic acid Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Apollo 8 Nutrition Abortion debate Binge eating disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep Urinary incontinence Neighbours Puberty Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Oral sex Milk Medical cannabis Equine conformation Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Pharmaceutical company Childbirth The Inside Alcoholism Progesterone only pill Social rule EastEnders Alanis Morissette Caffeine Antiretroviral drug Hypoglycemia Osteoporosis Cerebral palsy Radiation therapy Obesity Doxepin Diabetic neuropathy Depo Provera Acne Creatine AIDS Child sexuality Aerial (dance move) TLC Charles Darwin's illness The Jam Breastfeeding Saved by the Bell Guinea pig Cephalic disorder Mutation Human penis size Human sexual behavior Medicine Condom Atkins Nutritional Approach Volleyball Glossary of partner dance terms Mid-Autumn Festival Insulin Hypertension Senescence Hearing impairment Dieting Sexual orientation Chlorpromazine Alzheimer's disease Sexually-transmitted infection Tobacco smoking Paget's disease of bone Drug abuse BDSM Procrastination Migraine Swingout Polyamory Kodocha Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Turner syndrome Knots Landing The Virgin Suicides Malaria Methamphetamine

girls only pleez plz dont laff no rude jokes either im just curious thx if u have anal sex can u get pregnant or get aids no pregnancy risk with anal sex but the risk of transmission of the hiv virus that causes aids is higher with anal this is because during anal sex the friction and mechanics of the act itself causes small cuts and tears in the anal tissue giving the virus an ideal portal for entry into the body although the risk of transmission is lessened by wearing a condom it is not taken away completely a condom provides safer sex not safest sex a condom is around percent effective in preventing pregnancy believe me the hiv virus is thousands of times smaller than a sperm cell in any case if you are considering anal sex please make sure that you do use condoms just like pregnancy the only way not to get aids is to abstain from sex until you are ready for a lifetime commitment make sure that you are both tested as negative and then stay faithful to your partner  Safe sex Oral sex HIV AIDS Condom Herpes simplex virus Anal sex Pornographic movie Crystal methamphetamine and sex Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Birth control Sexual intercourse Human sexual behavior Sexually-transmitted infection Gonorrhoea Sex education Sexual abstinence Cytomegalovirus AIDS in Africa Methamphetamine Genital wart Medical analysis of circumcision HIV test Barebacking Human papillomavirus Gay bathhouse Unsafe sexual practices Rape HIV vaccine Masturbation Prostate cancer Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Anal masturbation Timeline of AIDS Fertility awareness Sex toy Nonoxynol-9 Strap-on dildo Emergency contraception Harm reduction In vitro fertilisation Turner syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome AIDS reappraisal Transmission (medicine) Duesberg hypothesis Earring Prenatal diagnosis Radiation therapy Common cold Butt plug Tuberculosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Hepatitis B Kaposi's sarcoma Abortion Breastfeeding Circumcision Pornographic actor Antiretroviral drug Multiple sclerosis AIDS in the United States Cancer Oral contraceptive Cephalic disorder Orgy Vaccine Proper Condom Use OPV AIDS hypothesis Antiviral drug Rabies American Red Cross Toxoplasmosis Fecal incontinence Child sexual abuse Old wives' tale Monogamy Coeliac disease Diabetes mellitus Body piercing Puberty HIV structure and genome Abortion debate Gay slang Psoriasis Child sexuality Personal lubricant Folic acid Anus Miscarriage Foodborne illness Human sexuality Prostitution

how to prevent a uti hi all so there is this guy i have been sleeping w every now and then hes the only one ive been w and everytime we have sex i get a uti i always pee afterwards so i dont know y im planning on seeing him sat night i am almost done taking meds for my last uti so i should be done by sat how can i prevent it again we use condoms so health care professionals suggest the following tips to help prevent uti from occurring in women make sure you drink an adequate amount of plain water everyday to help flush out your urinary tract when you feel the need to urinate do so as soon as possible suppressing your need to urinate when you feel the urge may give any bacteria that may be present a chance to develop into a full fledged urinary tract infection you've probably heard that you should wipe from front to back after a bowl movement this is especially important to help prevent bacteria from the anus from entering the vagina or urethra taking showers instead of tub baths helps to prevent bacteria from entering the urethra and causing a uti always wash your genital area both before and after sexual intercourse to help prevent bacteria from transfer to the urethra or vaginal area and creating a breeding ground that can cause an urinary tract infection feminine hygiene sprays and douches particularly scented douches can irritate the urethra and possibly begin a case of uti so be safe and learn to say no to feminine hygiene sprays and douches and you'll be helping yourself prevent not only urinary tract infections but also other infections and irritations that these products may cause in your reproductive system drinking cranberry juice is a fairly well known and natural way to both help prevent urinary tract infections as well as help speed the recovery process when uti develops just drinking two ounce glasses of cranberry juice daily is often enough to both prevent uti and speed recovery when an infection does develop another nutritional route that may help prevent uti is vitamin c supplements taken on a regular basis vitamin c increases the acidity level of urine which in turn helps decrease the number of harmful bacteria that may be present in your urinary tract system always wear panties with a cotton crotch white cotton panties are even better cotton fabric lets moisture escape while other fabrics can trap moisture creating a potential breeding ground for bacteria if you are one of a large number of women who suffers from frequent recurrent urinary tract infections a change in your position during sexual intercourse may help reduce the number of utis that you experience changing sexual positions may reduce friction on your urethra and reduce your risk of recurrent uti women who suffer from extremely frequent urinary tract infections may be prescribed an antibiotic to take immediately after sex to help prevent the likelihood of urinary tract infection occurrence  Menstrual cycle Urinary system Safe sex Urine Condom Nutrition Female genital cutting Common cold Vitamin C Intersex surgery Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Methamphetamine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Sexually-transmitted infection Acne AIDS Folic acid Hypoglycemia Pneumonia Traumatic brain injury Milk Strap-on dildo Body piercing Anal sex Douche Multiple sclerosis Cystoscopy Phimosis Sexual intercourse Orgasm Ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Candidiasis Tocopherol Oral contraceptive Bacteria Legionellosis Cat Fisting Group A streptococcal infection Endometriosis Epilepsy Kidney stone Escherichia coli Hypospadias Clinical depression Cytomegalovirus Fertility awareness Coffee Diarrhea Stroke Dyspareunia Hip fracture Benign prostatic hyperplasia Undergarment Guinea pig Diseases of the honeybee Medicine Tampon Tooth enamel Water Urethra Domestic rabbit Sexual abstinence Malaria Hamster Rape Japanese toilet Veganism Lactobacillus acidophilus Cystic fibrosis Puberty AIDS pandemic Circumcision Mosquito Sento Reiter's syndrome

is it true that u cant get pregnant when on ur period question can you get pregnant during your period answer yes it's possible but highly unlikely you'd have to have a very short menstrual cycle which is the time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period or a tendency to have long periods this would bring the time of ovulation closer to the time when you would start bleeding conception occurs when an egg and sperm meet in a fallopian tube sometime during the middle of your menstrual cycle most likely between the th and th days an egg reaches maturity in one of the two ovaries the ovary releases the egg into the abdomen where it's quickly sucked up by the tulip shaped opening of the nearest fallopian tube an egg can survive in your fallopian tube for about hours after it's released from the ovary so the only way you can get pregnant is if sperm are present in your fallopian tube during this window of opportunity if the egg isn't fertilized it's shed along with your uterine lining during your period typically when you have your period another egg is developing in preparation for release during the current cycle but not every woman's cycle length is the same many women have a cycle that's about days long but some have cycles as short as days long if you have a shorter cycle you could ovulate just a few days after you have your period and considering that sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for up to three days it's theoretically possible for the sperm to hang around until you ovulate again it's also possible to mistake breakthrough bleeding spotting between your periods for a regular period so you may be bleeding right at the time of ovulation when you're most fertile the time that it takes for an egg to develop or mature within the ovary can vary and therefore the actual day of ovulation can vary by several to many days some ovulation kits also base the fertile time on rising estrogen levels rather than the peak of luteinizing hormone or lh which is the actual trigger for egg release in those situations the fertile time may seem to be longer  Oral contraceptive Estrus cycle Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Emergency contraception Infertility Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Female reproductive system (human) Ectopic pregnancy Progesterone Ovarian cancer Endometrium Obstetrics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cyst Pelvic inflammatory disease Birth control Gynecologic hemorrhage Sexual differentiation Intersexuality Flowering plant Fetal development Uterus Sterilization (surgical procedure) Breastfeeding Ovum Gynaecology Amenorrhoea Carpel Testicle Androgen Human chorionic gonadotropin Gonorrhoea Grasshopper Pachypodium brevicaule Endometrial cancer Swyer syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual intercourse Spider Premature birth Twin Niddah Krill Pachypodium bicolor Pachypodium baronii Childbirth Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Embryo transfer Vaginal bleeding Man Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Tsetse fly Cryptorchidism Urinary incontinence Anovulation Dead zone Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Estradiol Morphology of Pachypodium Fruit Prostate cancer Conifer cones Menstrual cup Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Sex organ Xenomorph Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Menopause Octopus Tide Earthworm Human sexuality Testosterone Flower Sex Rabbit Antarctic krill Tampon Hair Sperm Whale Species

whats the big deal with anal sex just curious i mean what is it about it the taboo feeling of it all does it really feel all that wonderful only serious answers please i mean is it for the mans pleasure or does the women feel pleasure with this too i just can't see it i've met some women a hand full not a lot that do enjoy anal sex more than vaginal sex other women like it but as an occasional practice instead of the norm the anus is rich with thousands of nerves i read in a book written by proctologist that said that about half the nerves in the pelvic region end at the anal area if these nerves are stimulated properly they can produce extreme pleasure on the other hand if stimulated wrong they can cause extreme pain generally the pain is caused by anal tension during sex i think that the women who enjoy it are women that knew themselves what they were doing or tried it the first few times with someone that knew what he was doing anal sex is not something that you can just jump into like they make it appear in porn movies at least not at the beginning i've tried it with most of my ex girlfriends and all have liked it a lot but again it takes patience and know how at the beginning once she get used to it this start happening much faster and it s not because she s getting loose back there like some ignorant people think what really happens is that the anal sphincter muscles the muscle at the opening of the anus are part voluntary and part involuntary muscles which means that we have some control over them but not complete control in fact we have very little control over them the sphincter muscles are control but the ans autonomic nervous system the same part of the nervous system that controls breathing and other auto functions of the body if you tried to go too fast and these muscles have not relaxed enough on their own you will experience pain the more the guy forces himself into you the more pain you will experience which only compounds the problem when you experience pain it s only natural that these muscles are going to tense up instead or relaxing causing more pain that s why women who have had failed anal sex attempts have to be even more patient at learning to relax done right the anal sphincter learns to relax making anal sex pleasurable for both involved whether is a man woman or man man combination once those muscles have learned that anal sex is pleasurable they start to relax very fast with a bit of experience you ll have the guy inside you in very little time i ve been with some girls that can insert a penis in themselves in as little as one a minute or less i m estimating here based on experience and these are girls that are not loose from back there girls that unlike the myth says they don t poop in their pants even when they had an upset stomach and diarrhea anal sex can be very pleasurable for the receiver physically it s a fact that there are women who can experience an orgasm during anal sex and they claim to feel different than vaginal orgasms and some even claim that they like it more but there are some psychological factors to consider as well some people find it exciting because they are doing something dirty and taboo some women have told me that they also get pleasure from knowing that they are pleasing their partner men enjoy anal sex because the anus is tighter than the vagina in addition some men enjoy being penetrated themselves by their partner and i'm not talking about gay men i'm talking about straight men the men's g spot the prostate is located within a few inches from the anal opening when the prostate is massaged right by the use of fingers a penis dildo vibrator etc it can feel very good and even induce orgasms this is why men find having their anus stimulated so pleasurable as well many men report that prostrate stimulation during a oral sex can give them the most intense orgasms sometimes leading to further anal experimentation in many cases this experimentation will culminate with full on penetration by their female partner i read the results of a survey that was done about years ago by good vibes of their customers which showed that about to of strap ons are purchased be heterosexual couples to be used by the female on their male partners since then i ve read another two more recent surveys by other researchers that show similar findings for what i understand that type of practice is on the rise at least that's what some experts are saying i think that it's a combination of factors more couples are experimenting with that type of activity but i think that more couples are being open about it as well like a female friend of mine told me many years ago if it feel good for us women why wouldn t it feel f good for guys back there we are pretty much the same the key to anal please is education and an open mind if you don t have an open mind it s not going to happen to you if you into it doing it for someone else rather than for yourself you are not going to enjoy it you need to see anal sex and anal play with a very open mind and have the desire to explore with it forget about anal sex to start with just explore with anal play using lubed fingers and other smaller objects to explore yourself good lubrication is critical none of the k y junk buy some latex gloves some good lub and experiment with your finger s doing it while masturbating may and generally does increase sexual excitement the key word here is exploration don t try anal sex with a partner off the bat chances are that you ll fail one more thing do educate yourself don t listen to most people here who are very ignorant that way you ll be able to make an educated decision for example some people here have said in other similar questions that anal sex is dirty and that there are feces in the rectum and so on the truth is that feces are not stored in the rectum they are stored in the sigmoid colon once you feel the urge to go to the bathroom the feces pass from the sigmoid colon through the rectum and out the anal opening if you experience any feces in the rectum during anal play it may mean that your diet is not high enough in fiber and you have soft stool it can also mean that you developed bad bowel movement habits like straining too much while at the toilet good luck  Human Japanese toilet Out-of-body experience Toilet humour Weight

days after sex is there a sign of pregnancy any pill solution my friend is having this weird feeling on her tummy and back pain she had sex during her period and its about days now to be exact after the intercourse just wonderin if there is any early solution to prevent the pregnancy eventhough shes doesnt know if she is pregnant or not just wanted prevent this early i wanna help my friend but i dont know what to suggest advice please tyou if it happend about days ago you aren't going to find a pill to stop the pregnacy the morning after pill is designed to be taken within hours of intercourse with a second dose taken hours later side effects may include nausea vomiting abdominal pain fatigue and headache according to the food and drug administration the morning after pill is percent effective in preventing pregnancy after a single act of unprotected sex human conception rarely occurs immediately after intercourse instead it occurs as long as several days later after ovulation during the time between intercourse and conception sperm continue to travel through the fallopian tube until the egg appears so taking emergency birth control the morning after isn't too late to prevent pregnancy the active ingredients in morning after pills are similar to those in birth control pills except in higher doses some morning after pills contain only one hormone progestin plan b and others contain two progestin and estrogen progestin prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and keeps a fertilized egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus implantation estrogen stops the ovaries from releasing eggs ovulation that can be fertilized by sperm morning after pills aren't the same thing as the so called abortion pill or mifepristone mifeprex emergency contraceptive pills prevent pregnancy the abortion pill terminates an established pregnancy one that has attached to the uterine wall and has already begun to develop plan b is available to women years and older without a prescription at most pharmacies women must show proof of age to purchase plan b for women years old and younger plan b is available with a doctor's prescription so if she thinks she is pregnant it wouldn't hurt to take a pregnacy test and go to the doctor at this stage termination would require abortion http www plannedparenthood org birth control pregnancy pregnancy how pregnancy happens htm http www plannedparenthood org birth control pregnancy emergency contraception htm http www plannedparenthood org birth control pregnancy abortion htm hope that helps some  Ovary Abortion Sexual reproduction Twin Abortion debate Ovarian cancer Intrauterine device Fertilisation Urinary incontinence Puberty Depo Provera Folic acid Chemical abortion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Female reproductive system (human) Gonorrhoea Psoriasis Breastfeeding Migraine Ovarian cyst Prostate cancer Sex education Hormone replacement therapy Gynecologic hemorrhage Prolactinoma Acne Endometrial cancer Sexual abstinence Intersexuality Medical prescription Condom Paracetamol Stomach cancer Breast cancer Growth hormone treatment Morning sickness Sterilization (surgical procedure) Premature birth Caffeine Cancer Breast Teenage pregnancy Antidepressant Mifepristone Abortion in Canada Diazepam Swyer syndrome Estrus cycle Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Turner syndrome Human sexuality Orgasm Haloperidol Malaria Health issues and the effects of cannabis Uterus Partial-birth abortion Sulfasalazine Spina bifida Vaginal bleeding Propranolol Estrogen History of sex Medicine Embryo transfer Herpes simplex virus Hypertension Baldness treatments EastEnders

my wife is embarrassed about cunnilingus ladies only ladies i have an extreme desire to please my wife orally but she is very hesitant about me doing that for her she is embarrassed by it for some reason what i tell her over and over again is how much i want to do that for her it really does turn me on to please her that way but she doesn't want to relax and enjoy it any suggestions what can i do when you're doing something that scares you it's always nice to take small steps into the unknown and have familiar things around to keep you calm so when she actually lets you do it try to keep things as normal as posible there's two things to deal with one is completely mental she probably thinks it's a gross place to put your face and doesn't understand why you want to do it i don't know how your wife thinks or what kind of logic would work well on her but in the end you probably won't win her over with just words you just need to wear her down enough that she lets you try it so that you'll shut up about it then she'll realize what she's been missing so just keep on asking maybe try telling her not to think about you just herself definitly say that there's no pressure for her to climax like someone else said that's a good suggestion the second thing is physical she might also be nervous just because it's something she's never felt before if she's used to your finger start off with your finger then use a little tounge then go back to your finger it's definitely a new feeling and she won't know at first what works for her and what doesn't and that will make it hard for her to simply lay back and relax since she'll be paying attention to the new sensations and personally since i'm very clingy i didn't like that i didn't have anything to hold onto i mean this all depends on your position but now he puts his arm where i can reach so i can touch him or hold his hand or dig in when it gets good ps guys like you are awesome  Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Oral sex Aerial (dance move) Cyberspace Milton H.

please answer i need to get this off my mind ok i had my last period on june th i have a day cycle so i should've gotten my period on like july rd or something but i didn't get it i know it could have just skipped it cuz i only got my period years ago but on the nd of july i had like really light brown spotting and it went away now in the past weeks i have been getting on and off very mild cramps lately i've been paying alot more attention to my body if you read my other questions you will see why could this have happened before and i just didn't notice it also my boobs are swollen like i'm about to have my period but it hasn't come yet i've heard that if you worry about your period it can be delayed and stuff if that is the case for me would i have cramps until i got it or should they have gone away if my period is late so what was the brown spoting why is my period late and why do i have cramps i do not think i can be pregnant because i've never had sex and i've never done anything sexual with any guys well the immediate thought would be pregnancy but you didn't say whether or not that was possible because everything you listed could be part of that in reality though being young you're going to have all sorts of weird menstral irregularities from being late to skipping to long cycles as you said perhaps skipping and spotting a little and having cramps is just part of being a girl and they can come and go as they please especially in younger girls  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Leo Frank Milton H.

how do i know if i'm having a regular period or spotting from pregnancy i've had sex several times this month and was really nervous because precum had gotten around my ladyparts but we used condoms during sex for the past four months i've been having very consistent periods that would begin on the th of every month for this month there was no bleeding till the th so i'm a bit late which is normal and understandable the strange thing is that the flow was extremely light first it was a little bit of brownish pink then i saw a tiny clot of bright red when i wiped and now it's a darker brown i'm used to having the flood gates burst wide open on the nd day could my flow be light because i was stressing out before i'm just a bit worried can someone enlighten me please well for starters take a home pregnancy test that should clear up some of the concern yes stress can be a factor i'm speaking from experience here i was days late and it was the same way you described yours i took the test and i wasn't pregnant and when i went to see my doctor and she said that it was more likely due to the fact that my husband was being deployed and i was stressing over that you still might wanna get checked out there might be something else wrong good luck  Pregnancy Condom Fertility awareness Endometriosis Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Coagulation Stroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Abortion debate Anxiety Miscarriage Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Abortion Light-emitting diode Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Infantilism Psoriasis Hypertension EastEnders Diabetic retinopathy Cirrhosis Gonorrhoea Days of our Lives Turner syndrome Oral sex Herpes simplex virus Autism Gamma ray burst Cardiac stress test Social rule HIV test Traffic light Von Willebrand disease Jet engine Vitamin C Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Milton H.

for girls which is better to use deodorant or anti perspirant i usually wear deodorant but hate the white stains it leaves and i hate hot wet it makes my armpits feel during school should i change and use antiperspirant i don't think i've ever used it but reading this book for girl health it mentioned on how antperspirant is better for sweat and is leaves it dry which do you use and recommend thank you deodorant products counteract the formation of unpleasant body odour they principally work by controlling the growth of bacteria on the skin surface but also contain perfume which can help overcome body odour and give a pleasing fragrance these products do not affect sweating examples are lynx body spray and impulse fragrances which give quality fragrances with the reassurance of an effective deodorant anti perspirant products reduce the amount of sweat released to keep the armpit dry and comfortable the action of the anti perspirant ingredients also helps to control the growth of bacteria this together with the effect of the perfume means that they work as effective deodorants hence anti perspirants are usually labelled as anti perspirant deodorants as they perform both functions example products are the rexona and dove brand products which give highly efficient protection from wetness and odour so use the one that will help you the most they now have deodorants that come with anti perspirant so you don't have to choose between either it is best to get that i use it it's awesome it goes on clear and i don't sweat just go to your local drugstore or supermarket  Deodorant Sweating Perfume Body odor Hyperhidrosis Odor Psoriasis Diving suit Fecal incontinence Mattress Breastfeeding Diving Puberty Hyperthermia Hair Axe (deodorant) Air conditioning Garlic Sanitary towel Cancer Tooth enamel Common cold Tofu Britney Spears Thermoregulation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pneumonia Soap Smegma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Unilever Car handling Paris Hilton Sauna Nutrition Hypothermia Drowning Microeconomics Japanese toilet Autonomic nervous system Food Skin Fire fighting Bacteria Climbing equipment Sulfuric acid Doxepin 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Acne Carnivorous plant Scar Brassiere Sock Pesticide Carbon dioxide Milk Universal Century Nations and Factions Dandruff Cuisine of Malaysia Dairy Thermal power station Plastic Water purification Homeopathy Shampoo Cinnamon Cigarette Physical attractiveness Dry cleaning Brewery Clothing Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy Patent medicine Tobacco Mosquito Radiation therapy Hamster Cannabis (drug) Chronic fatigue syndrome Water Body piercing Heat index Androgen insensitivity syndrome Upholstery Sunscreen Tattoo Decomposition Cheese Rum

i finnally got it a few days ago i posted a question about wanting to use tampons well i just got my first one in now i'm nervous about taking it out will it hurt how long should i leave it in for advice and tips appreicated great it will be like riding a bike you never forget to take it out just grab the string and pull you might feel a little tug from where the tampon is folding back up but you shouldn't feel any pain a tampon should be changed every hours consistently so carry an extra one with you to school note if it gets to the point that the tampon is uncomfortable after you put it in you may need a smaller size because when you sit down that large one will make you feel like you are sitting on something  Menstrual cup Sanitary towel Professional wrestling holds Shaggy dog story Menstrual cycle Textile manufacturing Tampon Aerial (dance move) Mattress Knife Cello Social rule Skateboarding trick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

questions about hymens girls only please okay i am a virgin and when i went in for my first pap with my obgyn about years ago he started the exam and than asked are you sure that you are a virgin i said yes and than his next question was have you used a tampon i had i asked the nurses assistant after the doctor left what she thought he meant by his question and she said she thought maybe that meant the hymen was broken but he didn't write anything in the chart so my question is does that mean that the hymen was broken the first time i used a tampon it hurt alot this was a about years ago and i know that i was not inserting it in correcty your hymen could have been broken by the tampon the hymen is a thin membrane and it usually is flexible enough to stretch with tampon use but not always some women have a thicker hymen which can tear and cause pain if the doctor asked then there was probably more damage to the hymen than would normally be caused by tampon use there are a number of different causes for this anything from a bike accident to masturbation if you had difficulty using a tampon you probably had a thicker hymen and if you were definitely inserting it incorrectly then you could have done extra damage to your hymen which won't hurt anything in the long run  Virgin Deconstruction Anal sex Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toxic shock syndrome Traumatic brain injury Strap-on dildo Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind H.D.

what do these symptoms mean i recently had a baby weeks ago now i am not sure if any of these symptoms are related to that or not i have been very nauseated for the past weeks now every time i eat i can barely eat half and occasionally will end up with diarrhea now the past week i have had sore joints mainly ankles wrists knees but have done no sort of heavy activity i also get headaches quite often i have a doctor's appointment tomorrow but i was curious if anyone has any ideas or if maybe this could be something that just happens after giving birth also just a note the pregnancy and birth went well no problems except being anemic during the last month of the pregnancy i tested to be fine after the birth though and generally i don't feel tired i had a baby two months ago and i relate to you with the pain in the joints its mainly because pregnancy softens the joints to make it easier for the baby to come out it takes some time for it to be back to normal maybe the nausea is from all the hormones and the headaches from sleep deprivation but its a good idea to see the doctor just to be safe good luck  Pregnancy Breastfeeding Childbirth Obstetrics Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Miscarriage Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Ebola Folic acid Breech birth Hypertension Menstrual cycle Morning sickness Guinea pig Traumatic brain injury Post Polio syndrome Endometriosis Carpal tunnel syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Oral contraceptive Fecal incontinence Paget's disease of bone Diarrhea Spina bifida Stroke Equine conformation Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Charles Darwin's illness Clomipramine Decompression sickness Syphilis Cephalic disorder Insulin Opioid Physical examination Migraine Cancer Diabetes mellitus Polycystic ovary syndrome Anemia Hyperprolactinaemia Tocopherol Sulfasalazine Transsexuality Sexual intercourse Fibromyalgia Postpartum depression Lyme disease Neighbours Emergency contraception Propranolol Weight training Jam (TV series) Multiple chemical sensitivity Acupuncture Pneumonia Medical cannabis Anxiety Premature birth Hepatitis C EastEnders Abortion Multiple sclerosis Aspartame Mattress Sleep Intact dilation and extraction Cannabis (drug) First aid Chiropractic Syringomyelia Osteoporosis Puberty Narcolepsy Paracetamol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Elephant Medicine Growth hormone treatment Chemical abortion Gonorrhoea Food allergy Professional wrestling holds Radiation poisoning Buprenorphine Cytomegalovirus Episodes of Lost (Season 1)

what would you say so i measured err down there the other day and it said i'm like long would any girls notice if i lied said i'm also i read that the average is something like does that mean that in a group of like guys i will actually more often than not be bigger than most most likely if i look at my in the mirror sorry if that visual makes you uncomfortable or turns you on ladies i can see exactly how im a bit larger than average despite me also be somewhat tall but still i can't really picture myself being considered big just well sized i'm thinking a comparison i can make here is like guys' heights average height is ' ish and tall is like over feet tall ' is kind of a grey spot would you agree this is comparable with my size down there i've said it before and i'll say it again it is not what you have down there but whether or not you know what you're doing with it and in bed in general there is more to sex and to turning a woman on than whipping out ol' willie and doing the thrust till you ejaculate women need more physical attention in order to become aroused and about will never have an orgasm through straight vaginal sex in other words foreplay oral sex masturbation of your partner etc are all essential in order to please your partner men are nearly guaranteed an orgasm and a good time with the thrusting of intercourse women don't get a lot out of it unless their partners make it enjoyable otherwise women are just blowup dolls that breathe so my best advice is learn how to perform sex buy some books there are dozens available on sex and sexuality the more educated you are the better you'll be at the final exam crunch time  Sexual intercourse Oral sex Orgasm Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Strap-on dildo Masturbation Premature ejaculation Condom Sexual dysfunction Penis Safe sex Anorgasmia Puberty Masters and Johnson Human sexuality Physical intimacy Human sexual response cycle Bondage (BDSM) Rape Sexual abstinence Group sex Mutual masturbation Prostate cancer Child sexual abuse Erogenous zone Zoophilia Nocturnal emission Proper Condom Use Sexual orientation BDSM Fertility awareness Dildo Ejaculation Human penis size Cybersex Aerial (dance move) History of sex Hentai Menstrual cup Glen Quagmire Missionary position Pornographic movie Pornography Sexual revolution Homophobia Religion and sexuality Female ejaculation The 120 Days of Sodom Inhibited sexual desire Prostitution Sexual attraction Pedophilia Oral contraceptive Vaginismus Equine conformation Vagina Sento Paraphilia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Child pornography Medical analysis of circumcision Human height Bukkake Sex and intelligence Orgy Milton H.

period pains feeling down what to do they are aching and i feel like i don't want to walk or move at all lol what helps aw i really hate period cramps well it may seem strange but one of the best things you can do is light exercise swimming is especially good as the water supports your body so it is a more relaxing way to exercise however you would have to wear a tampon for that so many girls don't feel comfortable doing so walking the dog or taking a light jog around the block can help too if you don't feel like exercising on your period you're not alone i hate it then take a hot bubbly bath the hot water will help to ease the cramps and the bath itself will help relax you and make you feel a lot better every girl has different ways of relieving her period pains and some may work better on some girls than on others everyone is different but some other suggestions are to drink a nice warm cup of milky tea sugary if you like it that way putting a hot water bottle on the place where it hurts like having a bath the heat will help to ease the pain taking some painkillers if your pains persist it's best to ask your mum about this because she will know how you're feeling and will be able to give you the best type of painkiller for the job hope you feel better x  Menstrual cup Social rule Sauna Osteoarthritis Hyperthermia Swimming pool Tea Little Britain Sento Diving Cramp Menstrual cycle Mattress Breastfeeding Japanese tea ceremony Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Customs and etiquette of Japan First aid Urinary incontinence Brassiere Milk Prostate cancer Massage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) LSD Running Pain About a Boy Milton H.

really bad cramps i hate getting my period because every day that i am on it i experience unbearable cramps that cause me to cry i used to go to the doctor about it because i was also kind of irregular and it would worry me anyway she told me to take tylenol or advil every hours each day i have my period but i don't like putting that much medication into my body i also take a centrum vitamin each day because i lose a lot of iron is there anything else i can do so that my cramps who be so bad and so i don't have to take so much medication if i wanted to get on the pill can you give me advice on approaching my mom about it we don't get along and she likes to make assumptions about me i'm sure if i told her it was because of my period she would still turn it around and think i only wanted it to prevent myself from getting pregnant she acts like it's a bad thing i won't lie i have had sex but i don't make a habit out of it so it would probably be a good idea anyway i just don't know how to talk to her i was molested as a child and she never talked to me about it sex drugs alcohol it's hard i do exercise i'm not lazy well you can take hot baths or showers exercise crunches help you can place a heating pad on the area or drink hot fluids coco and tea i'm glad your taking the vitamins but i also had this when i was younger and the doctor actually suggested that i go on the pill it really does help it's not always given just b c you have sex and if you have a hard time talking to your mom about it talk to your doctor first and ask them to suggest it to your mom maybe that will help also check to see if there is a planned parenthood in your area they will see you if you are under and give you the meds free as long as you don't tell them you have insurance and its completely confidential so that may be a way to avoid talking to your mom but i would try to deal with her first it's hard but it's usually not as bad as you anticipate good luck and feel better  Breastfeeding Hyperthermia Menstrual cycle Social rule Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Folic acid Psoriasis The Catcher in the Rye First aid About a Boy Milton H.

menstruation miscarriage i miscarried a baby in mid april this year at and a half months along without complete miscarriage and never had my period or any bleeding for that matter aafter i found out that the baby was not alive anymore i never had a d c yesterday i got my period and some very bad cramping and passed a large clot about and a half inches in diameter is it possible that i passed the baby sorry for the descriptions but it's the only way i could describe it thanks for your help i went and had an ultrasound done which determined the the baby was not alive the doctor told me to wait it out and after a couple weeks he gave me pills to help it along it never did anything so that is how we got here that's entirely possible dear when i miscarried i actually had that happen but it was during the miscarriage it's likely that your regular cycle started up again and your uterus has cleaned itself out to start over again if something like that ever happens again heaven forbid you should consider having a d c done obviously women had miscarriages before doctors and they were fine but you should at least be checked out  Miscarriage Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Obstetrics Intact dilation and extraction Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Vaginal bleeding Abortion Childbirth Breech birth In vitro fertilisation Endometrial cancer Neighbours Niddah Menstrual cup Birth control Gynaecology Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian cyst Stomach cancer Morning sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chemical abortion Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal care Stroke Habitual abortion Urinary incontinence Prenatal diagnosis Miscarriage of justice Premature birth Dialysis Emergency contraception Jam (TV series) Partial-birth abortion Friends Twin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Terri Schiavo Nuclear fallout AFI 100 Years series Gonorrhoea Spina bifida Ectopic pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Triage Mormonism and Judaism Jennifer Lopez Pregnancy test Apollo 8 Uterus Situation comedy Progesterone Gynecologic hemorrhage Cervix Coeliac disease Estrus cycle Anne Boleyn Solar eclipse Salic law Kimberly-Clark Corporation Characters of Lost Dinah Marler Obstetrical hemorrhage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Caesarean section Abortion in the United States Alanis Morissette Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Endometrium Birth weight John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Computus Gender role Prostate cancer Mount St. Helens Traumatic brain injury Guinea pig Astronomy on Mars Hebrew calendar Erythropoietin Jon Secada What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

menstrual suppression and bad pms so i have panic attacks and frequent depression which is of course exaherbated by my menstrual cycle damn being a woman some times well anyways i'm on 'the pill' which helps a lot with making the pms blues a lot easier and shorter lived and wondering about menstrual supression since i get pms before i'm even finished taking my active pills would moving on to the next pack help or make this problem last longer pms goes away after a day or few of bleeding obviously our bodies adjust to 'the pill' and the artificial cycle so maybe my body knows that cylce if i go on a three month cycle would i only get pms once every three months or would i have month of stability and months of my 'pms hell' any sources on this subject would be greatly appreciated and yes of course in addition to 'the pill' i do try improving my lifestyle and thought processes in order and am considering antidepressants to combat my anxiety mood issues this isn't really based on any source but just on my own slight knowledge of how 'the pill' works and the menstrual cycle pms actually occurs before your period although it can extend to the week of your period as well if you're dealing with pmdd and it sounds like you are on top of the other issues you mentioned i have them too then it's obviously a lot worse if the pill regulates the cycle then it's really the pills you take the week before that cause the pmdd hormones to be released and it seems like something like seasonale would be weeks at a time of that hormone of course this is just a guess but it seems like it could exacerbate the problem some women have had success with it and naturally others haven't i would try to talk to a specialist if you can and see what they have to say try looking up anything you can about menstrual suppression and it's side effects and multiply any possible mood disorders caused by it since i'm sure you know it may be just that much worse for you that's actually the main reason i didn't go for seasonale when it came out i'm just not really sure of how my own emotional health would be affected  Menstrual cycle Premenstrual stress syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dysmenorrhea Clinical depression Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Sleep Chronic fatigue syndrome Anorexia nervosa Birth control Borderline personality disorder Antidepressant Polycystic ovary syndrome Psoriasis Menstrual cup Chlorpromazine Diazepam Stuttering Multiple sclerosis Postpartum depression Progesterone Transsexuality Puberty Stroke Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Panic attack Traumatic brain injury Nutrition Estrus cycle Paroxetine Migraine Depo Provera Female genital cutting Glucocorticoid Sexual abstinence Clomipramine Electroconvulsive therapy Ovulation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baldness treatments Emergency contraception Baldness Childbirth Niddah Dog Cannabis (drug) Obesity Endometrium Hypoglycemia Hebrew calendar Alanis Morissette Breast Dieting Venlafaxine Insulin Breast cancer EastEnders Cognitive therapy Babe Ruth The Ashlee Simpson Show Extreme Programming Miscarriage Obsessive-compulsive disorder Divorce Anabolic steroid God Emperor of Dune Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Post-traumatic stress disorder Asthma Procrastination Vitamin D Primidone Menopause Mental illness Bupropion Anxiety Drug addiction Scientology beliefs and practices Chemotherapy Atkins Nutritional Approach Caffeine Orgasm Eczema

women only birth contoll and period problems okay so lets start here im and about a month and weeks ago i skipped a period i had spotting and then days later i had stomach pains so i went to the e r days after it started they said i had an ovarian cyst that ruptured so then i came home on a sunday and went to the gyno on a tuesday they put me on birth controll well told me to start wen i got my period next so then i waited about weeks and i had a little spotting not a lot so i started the pill and my period never came but i couldnt stop the pills so i jsut kept taking them and i just finished my first pack and i got my period like days ago but tis like reall really really heavy and not to sound nasty i just wanna know wut it is but i have like hugh clots in it and i have really bad cramps like never before now for the question is the cramps and clots beacouse i havent gotten my period in about months and because of the cyst or is it because of the birth controll i have been through this very same thing and yes it is probably because you haven't had a period for two months the addition of the hormones from the birth control pills and if you have had an ovarian cyst then that is likely the explanation ovarian cysts are not uncommon and there is a possibility that you had more than one which is also common and birth control is a normal treatment for this it is also common for the cysts to burst during or at the onset of a cycle the birth control pills will stop a period and even prevent it if taken continuously which you should only do if instructed to do so by your doctor also don't forget that clotting is normal as you are expelling the lining of your uterus where the egg implants itself each month the clotting is the lining and blood i would call the dr 's office and confirm all of this and for your own peace of mind and go for a check up if needed it can never hurt to be safe however i don't think that it is anything for you to really worry about  Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Ovarian cyst Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Cancer Miscarriage Stomach cancer Fertility awareness Tocopherol Ben Johnson (athlete) Puberty Ovulation Infertility Breastfeeding Atherosclerosis Psoriasis Folic acid Vitamin D Syringomyelia Dialysis First aid Spina bifida Intrauterine device Obstetrics Traumatic brain injury Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometrial cancer Ocean's Twelve Shaggy dog story Prenatal diagnosis Endometrium Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Deep vein thrombosis Depo Provera Dysmenorrhea Migraine EastEnders Wound healing phases Milton H.

sex health question everytime my husband and i have sex if i do not immediatly get up and use the restroom i always end up with a bladder infection i would like to spend time with my husband afterwards but instead i always have to go to the restroom why is this and what can i do about it also are there any related topics where i can read about this on the internet the exact location of the urethra varies in women for some of us it is very close to the vaginal opening or even a little inside we are the ones who are more prone to uti's because bacteria gets pushed into the opening of the urethra during sex even if you're clean there will always be some bacteria normal the problem is that unlike the vagina the environment in the urethra can't inhibit their growth very well also previous utis can leave behind some scarring which provides an even better environment for the bacteria to grab hold and start multiplying cranberry helps but is no substitute for flushing out by peeing right away bottom line is that you should just snuggle for a minute jump up and pee then come back for more snuggle time just do it without thinking about how much you resent it and it won't interfere with the moment that much make sure hubby knows the whole story and can be supportive  Urinary incontinence Menstrual cup Urinary tract infection Intersex surgery Urethra Urine Medical analysis of circumcision Strap-on dildo Penis Vulvovaginal health Orgasm Gonorrhoea Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urination Vagina Anal sex Sexual intercourse Oral sex Hypospadias Condom Multiple sclerosis Toilet Safe sex Acne Tampon Herpes simplex virus Intersexuality Candidiasis Urinary system AIDS Physical intimacy Fecal incontinence Sexual dysfunction Vulva HIV Human sexual behavior Washroom Cystoscopy Puberty Sex toy Female ejaculation Cancer Human sexuality Pneumonia Childbirth Sexually-transmitted infection Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Cat Diving Lactobacillus acidophilus Anorgasmia Group sex Pornographic movie Sexual orientation Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fisting Vaginal lubrication Wound healing phases Child sexuality Escherichia coli Swingout Sexual differentiation Intravenous therapy Antibiotic B3ta Transmission (medicine) Aerial (dance move) Social rule Cervical cancer Carnivorous plant Caesarean section Lymphogranuloma venereum Domestic rabbit Douche Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Autism Dyspareunia Antiseptic Equine conformation Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Skene's gland Incest Poker jargon Dyslexia Female genital cutting Endometriosis History of intersex surgery Benign prostatic hyperplasia Drill bit Joke Sexual reproduction Tooth enamel Psoriasis Urinal Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans)

help me if you can please i feel a bit embarrased asking this but is it normal to have a white discharge it doent smell like fish it just has a weird smell its not green or brown or nothing its not just for a few days it never stops except for when i come on my period then it stops when i come off my period it starts again is this normal vaginal discharge is normal and varies during your menstrual cycle before ovulation the release of the egg there is a lot of mucous produced up to x more than after ovulation it is also more watery and elastic during that phase of your cycle you may want to wear panty liners during that time the things to be worried about include if the discharge has a yellow or green color is clumpy like cottage cheese or has a bad odor if worried see a doctor different types of discharge is this normal different types of discharge white thick white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching if itching is present thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection clear and stretchy this is fertile mucous and means you are ovulating clear and watery this occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising yellow or green may indicate an infection especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor brown may happen right after periods and is just cleaning out your vagina old blood looks brown spotting blood brown discharge this may occur when you are ovulating mid cycle sometimes early in pregnancy you may have spotting or a brownish discharge at the time your period would normally come if you have spotting at the time of your normal period rather than your usual amount of flow and you have had sex without using birth control you should check a pregnancy test is this normal we receive many questions about vaginal discharge through our ask the expert section below physician assistant steven johnson explains what is normal and when to see a health care provider one of the challenges to answering questions sent into a health care web site is making sure that the person asking the question seeks the advice and care from her doctor when appropriate an important question is sexual activity sometimes it isn't accurate to simply say yes or no symptoms can depend on the number of sexual partners kind of sexual partners birth control birth control failure kind of sex you are having and if abuse is involved i think you can see it can get pretty complicated to get all the information needed to give the best answer possible with that said here is my best answer to the common question of vaginal discharge a normal vaginal discharge consists of about a teaspoon ml a day that is white or transparent thick to thin and odorless this is formed by the normal bacteria and fluids the vaginal cells put off the discharge can be more noticeable at different times of the month depending on ovulation menstrual flow sexual activity and birth control it is not uncommon for the normal discharge to be dark brown or discolored a day or two following the menstrual period if you are having any of the symptoms below see your health care provider pain itching discomfort rash or sores alone or with a vaginal discharge  Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Oral contraceptive Androgen insensitivity syndrome Birth control Childbirth Ovulation AIDS Strap-on dildo Endometriosis Candidiasis Stomach cancer Obstetrics Sexual intercourse Niddah Herpes simplex virus Psoriasis Human sexual behavior Oral sex Group A streptococcal infection Condom HIV Breastfeeding Pneumonia Estrus cycle Infantilism Miscarriage Fecal incontinence Conjunctivitis Ovarian cancer Safe sex Orgasm Anal sex Ovarian cyst Traumatic brain injury In vitro fertilisation Sexually-transmitted infection Vagina Chronic fatigue syndrome Migraine Hypoglycemia Medicine Diabetes mellitus Cephalic disorder Emergency contraception Polycystic ovary syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Allergy Malaria Abortion Vulvovaginal health Coeliac disease Cancer Rocky Mountain spotted fever Insulin Pelvic inflammatory disease Cirrhosis Dialysis Domestic rabbit Autism Trichomoniasis Child sexuality Female genital cutting Premature birth Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medical prescription Intersex surgery Cytomegalovirus Infertility Anorexia nervosa Lupus erythematosus HIV test Social rule Common cold Sanitary towel Hepatitis C Folic acid Abortion debate Turner syndrome Progesterone Rape Guinea pig Hydrogen sulfide Stroke Urine Aortic dissection

how long for hpv to turn into pre cancerous dysplasia i had an abnormal pap test and found out that it was severe dysplasia of the cervix that was so close to cancerous that my doctor removed it immediately after the test results came in my question which i can't find the answer to anywhere so far is how long does it take for hpv to attack the cervix cause dysplasia and then become cancerous can it be a short amount of time under a year or is it a long process i read somewhere that a person could have hpv and dysplasia for more than a couple of years before it shows up on a pap test any thoughts or experiences experiences mild cin stage my prediction it took about years to come up into a dysplasia it depends on ones body type immune system life style sexual preference and habit it depends on the type of the hpv virus if ones have the cancerous strain r types it is more likely growing cancer in another years it is theorizing that way but again it depends on ones immune state life style nutrition life activities etc resume the virus attacking the cervix after a long journey through blood and any other tissues in our body what makes the virus works the cervix is only because the types of the tissues favor their life their dna or genetical code to sustain their life at least ones wait for years period or one year to be sure that the hpv is developed into cin or mild dysplasia and a new generation of pap smear which called thin prep or pap net is bettr to grasp te result quickly and acurrately low risk hpv doesnt make the tissues to be cancerous  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Genital wart Colorectal cancer Stomach cancer Apoptosis Colposcopy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mesothelioma Medical analysis of circumcision Obstetrics Pap smear AIDS reappraisal Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cytomegalovirus Sexually-transmitted infection Lung cancer AIDS Leukemia Herpes simplex virus Hepatitis C Endometriosis Sexual reproduction HIV Nutrition Traumatic brain injury Endometrial cancer Penile cancer Medicine HIV test Kaposi's sarcoma Hepatitis Pneumonia Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Insulin Abortion Duesberg hypothesis Cervix Biology Menstrual cup Cirrhosis Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Soft tissue sarcoma Breastfeeding Antiretroviral drug Breast cancer Vitamin C Coeliac disease Intersex surgery Growth hormone deficiency Oncology Malaria Circumcision Cephalic disorder Multiple sclerosis Bone marrow transplant Tobacco smoking Folic acid Kidney Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Radiation therapy Mutation Autism Carcinogenesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Epilepsy Immune system Histology Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Metastasis Eczema DNA Gene therapy Lupus erythematosus Rabies Vaccine Fertility awareness Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Von Willebrand disease Meme Cryptorchidism Immortality Hip dysplasia Medical laboratory Anemia American Red Cross Coagulation

did the morning after pill work i took it within the hours and i bled days later quite heavy lasting for days do you know whether this means it has worked is this a period my period was meant to be due weeks after i started bleeding i decided to take it to be safe even though my period had only finished three days before i spoke to a doctor and she told me to take it incase basically my period wasnt due for another three weeks it can make you bleed didnt you read the leaflet that cam e with it got this off wiki for you the most common side effect of emergency contraceptive pills is nausea of users of combined pills of progestin only users and a significant number of users vomit estrogen in combined ecps is responsible for the increased incidence of nausea and vomiting antiemetics may be prescribed for both methods to be taken hour before each ecp dose if vomiting occurs within an hour after taking ecp's it may be necessary to repeat the dose other common side effects are abdominal pain fatigue headache dizziness and breast tenderness these side effects normally resolve within hours temporary disruption of the menstrual cycle is also commonly experienced if taken before ovulation the high doses of progestogen in levonorgestrel treatments may induce progestogen withdrawal bleeding a few days after the pills are taken one study found that about half of women who used levonorgestrel ecps experienced bleeding within days of taking the pills if levonorgestrel is taken after ovulation it may increase the length of the luteal phase thus delaying menstruation by a few days mifepristone if taken before ovulation may delay ovulation by days delayed ovulation may result in a delayed menstruation these disruptions only occur in the cycle in which ecps were taken subsequent cycle length is not significantly affected if a woman's menstrual period is delayed by a week or more it is advised that she take a pregnancy test earlier testing may not give accurate results  Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obstetrics Ovarian cyst Endometriosis Migraine Birth control Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Puberty Stomach cancer Breast cancer Estrus cycle Cancer Ovarian cancer Depo Provera Paracetamol Abortion Prolactinoma Haloperidol Acne Clinical depression Radiation poisoning Medical cannabis Acupuncture Endometrial cancer Gonorrhoea Intrauterine device Maprotiline Prostate cancer Miscarriage Hypoglycemia Chemical abortion COX-2 inhibitor Chemotherapy Antidepressant Hormone replacement therapy Urinary incontinence Propranolol Buprenorphine Topiramate Psoriasis Tocopherol Breastfeeding Multiple sclerosis Stroke Childbirth Diazepam Clomipramine Growth hormone treatment Chlorpromazine Cannabis (drug) Sleep Weight training Ebola Traumatic brain injury Progesterone only pill Diabetes mellitus Trazodone Ectopic pregnancy Opioid Pneumonia Paroxetine Mifepristone Baldness treatments Bupropion Premenstrual stress syndrome Gastroparesis Adverse effect (medicine) Vomiting Bipolar disorder Rocky Mountain spotted fever Aspartame Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Extreme Programming Aortic dissection Radiation therapy Sexual abstinence Lamotrigine Antiretroviral drug Sulfasalazine Anabolic steroid Cluster headache Health issues and the effects of cannabis Venlafaxine Toxic shock syndrome Menstrual cup Folic acid Methamphetamine

waxing your pubic hair is very painful what else can be done with it you can shave i wouldn't suggest shaving against the grain of your hair every day this can cause some irritation such as ingrown hairs you can shave with the grain the direction the hair grows everyday but this will grow out and give you stubble much sooner most depilatory creams harsh chemicals that dissolve the hair are not meant to be used in the bikini area and can cause burns or irritation on that thin and sensitive skin be sure to read the directions and warnings on the labels and to do a test area on your forearm to make sure you don't have an adverse reaction there's also laser hair removal which is expensive but more permanent you would likely have to undergo several treatments to get the effect you're looking for with laser hair removal if you think you have an extreme amount of hair don't be afraid to talk to you doctor about it there may be an underlying cause good luck to you  Depilation Pubic hair Waxing Leg shaving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hair Baldness Acne Laser hair removal Eczema Psoriasis Pseudofolliculitis barbae Scar Haircut Aspartame Coffee Stomach cancer Allergy Beard Multiple chemical sensitivity Baldness treatments Razor Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Explosive material Brazilian waxing Prostate cancer Radiation therapy 613 mitzvot Puberty Carbon dioxide Tattoo Corrosion Acupuncture Drug test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Guinea pig Scarification Mosquito Callus Hydrogen peroxide Hay fever Homeopathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Pain Coeliac disease LSD Laser applications Casting Fusion power Hard water Vitiligo Animal testing Tarantula Joker (comics) Smoke-screen Malignant melanoma Medical analysis of circumcision Pneumonia Dental caries Cat Shampoo Wig (hair) Diamond enhancement Urinary incontinence Diabetic retinopathy Herpes simplex virus Ultraviolet Intravenous therapy Carpal tunnel syndrome Leather Three Stooges Endometriosis Crab louse Milk Urticating hair Cosmetics Cancer Barber Dandruff Intense pulsed light Chemical reaction Head shaving Aluminium Sulfuric acid Alcohol fuel Skinhead Methamphetamine Black (people) Refractive surgery Swimsuit Enzyme Motor oil Protein Gilding Clothing Testosterone Spacecraft propulsion

menopause ive started getting hot flushes can someone give me information on what other side affects that comes with it what are menopause perimenopause and postmenopause menopause is the milestone in every woman's life that marks the end of her reproductive years when you have had no menstrual periods for year you have reached menopause while the average age of menopause is around every woman's body has its own unique timeline some women stop menstruating in their mid s and others continue well into their mid s perimenopause means around menopause it refers to the to years of changing hormone levels and the symptoms they cause leading up to menopause the most common sign of perimenopause is longer often irregular menstrual cycles that are caused by hormonal ups and downs most women start perimenopause between ages and some women begin to notice menstrual changes and premenstrual syndrome pms symptoms in their late s when hormone levels begin to change and fertility naturally declines other women don't notice menopause changes until their late s postmenopause begins after year of having no menstrual periods hormone levels continue to decline and menopause symptoms tend to persist or increase into the first year or more of postmenopause estrogen and progesterone levels then stabilize at low levels and symptoms usually subside this is the phase of life when you can enjoy freedom from menstrual bleeding and birth control concerns what causes menopause normal changes in your reproductive and hormone systems cause menopause as your egg supply ages your body begins to ovulate less causing hormone levels to change fluctuate eventually estrogen and progesterone levels drop enough that the menstrual cycle stops surgical removal of the ovaries oophorectomy radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis or chemotherapy can trigger an early menopause what are the symptoms of menopause during the months or years leading up to menopause irregular menstrual cycles can lead to heavy menstrual bleeding dysfunctional uterine bleeding other common symptoms include mild to severe hot flashes insomnia cloudy thinking headaches heart palpitations mood swings irritability depression and anxiety these symptoms can begin well before menopause and can last for a year or more afterward symptoms are different for every woman some notice few or no changes while others have severe symptoms that disrupt their sleep and daily lives estrogen steadily drops for several months before and after menopause as it does it's common for menopause symptoms to get worse over time hormones even out and symptoms usually improve or go away some women have ongoing symptoms such as hot flashes for years after menopause when estrogen levels drop below a certain point many women develop vaginal dryness and irritation which can continue into the postmenopausal years fortunately this symptom can be treated easily how do i know whether i am in perimenopause menopause or postmenopause you don't need to test hormone levels to diagnose perimenopause or menopause you and your health professional will most likely be able to tell when you are in perimenopause based on irregular menstrual periods this most often happens between ages and you may also have various physical and emotional symptoms if you have heavy irregular bleeding your health professional may want to rule out any serious causes of your symptoms in many women in their s heavy menstrual bleeding is a sign of perimenopause however it can be caused by infection disease or a pregnancy complication when you have had no menstrual periods for year you have reached menopause do i need treatment menopause is a natural body change that doesn't require treatment however symptoms can disrupt your life and sense of well being the first approach to reducing menopause symptoms and other long term health risks related to aging is to lead a healthy lifestyle make a special effort to eat well exercise regularly and avoid excess caffeine alcohol and stress you can also use meditative breathing exercise also called paced respiration to reduce hot flashes and emotional symptoms if you need more relief than lifestyle changes can give you you can choose from many treatments for relieving menopause symptoms medicines include hormone therapy ht with low dose birth control pills before menopause or low dose hormone replacement therapy hrt after menopause antidepressants or a certain blood pressure medicine alternative supplements include soy and black cohosh all medicines for menopause symptoms have possible risks or side effects a very small number of women develop serious health problems when taking hormone therapy your personal risk of hrt causing breast cancer cardiovascular problems blood clots or neurological changes may be lower or higher than average depending on your risk factors experts do not yet know whether hormone therapy risks are the same for older and younger postmenopausal women be sure to talk to your health professional about your possible health risks before starting a treatment for menopause symptoms

i ended my pregnancy at weeks with an abortion due to fetal anomoly i barely have any pain and light bleeding is this normal i feel like i should be in alot of pain and lots of bleeding the termination was on friday has anyone else done this at this stage in the pregnancy when will my body realize it is no longer preg and reduce cravings will my breasts leak please call your doctor tomorrow they'll have the best answers to your questions no need to worry needlessly you know my uneducated guess as a woman who's been through pregnancy childbirth and a miscarriage is that it takes a while for the body to stop making those hormones after you're no longer pregnant you'll likely be physically free of them a few weeks if your breasts aren't leaking now i doubt they will in the future since your pregnancy is no more hope you feel better soon  Pregnancy Miscarriage Obstetrics Abortion Abortion debate Breastfeeding Childbirth Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Premature birth Fertility awareness Roe v.

this is really embarrassing but any girls know any treatment for an ongoing yeast infection ive tried diflucan and some o t c meds ive also been tested for any other infeections and came back negative kindof odd and might sound crazy but this works get some plain yogurt and coat the outer portion of a tampon with it the yogurt has active cultures that will balance out the cultures that are acting up i know it sounds gross but the yogurt will be soothing and will be easily inserted with a tampon dont leave the tampon in too long just for minutes at a time repeat with a new tampon as needed you dont need gobs of yogurt just enough to coat it if you would feel better do it at night before you go to bed and wear a pad while you sleep that way you will be laying down and it will be able to work itself out  Tampon Menstrual cup Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Sanitary towel Candidiasis Yoghurt Mattress Toxic shock syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux disease Athlete's foot Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep apnea Traumatic brain injury Clostridium difficile Malaria Prostate cancer Dairy Atomic Kitten Sewage treatment Apollo 8 Vulvovaginal health Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lactose intolerance Lactobacillus acidophilus Undergrads Gramophone record Fecal incontinence Spaceballs Brewery Drowning Flatulence Pet skunk Strap-on dildo Socrates Herpes simplex virus Palindrome Trance music Sexual intercourse Waylon Jennings Shawn Michaels Coeliac disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Manicure Common cold Charles Ives Immunosuppressive drug Anne Boleyn Multiple sclerosis Chagas disease Stuttering Dialysis Dyslexia Gram staining Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AIDS Kit Kat Balance disorder Fancy rat Casting Folic acid RAS syndrome Patrick Star Intravenous therapy Singlish Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Characters in the Smurfs Narcolepsy Oral sex Cliff Richard Family Guy Angioplasty Pneumonia Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Late Night with Conan O'Brien Psoriasis Polymerase chain reaction The Amazing Race Guinea pig Binary numeral system Medicine Comanche Epilepsy Shaggy dog story Rabies Sleep debt Hemp One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Bacteria Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Medical analysis of circumcision Infectious mononucleosis Pedophilia Child sexuality Virgin Crohn's disease Pitaten Hypertension

first off i know this is a kind of a wierd question to ask on yahoo it's about ovcon ok i got on ovcon when i was for irregular cycle and i just went off it completely in january i am now up until last month july i had a period every month and for the last weeks i've been experiencing vaginal spotting out of those weeks maybe i had to use a light pad for of those days b c it was a little more than usual i read that it could be a hormonal problem but i was just wondering has anyone else had this problem when going off ovcon i know for a fact that i am not pregnant so what are some possibilites if you had irregular periods etc before you went on the pill i would expect you to still have irregular periods when you come off it again the pill totally overrides your natural cycle it doesn't fix it also expect three months of screwed up cycles when you come off same as when you first started  Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Hebrew calendar Birth control Tocopherol Apollo 8 Sleep Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Estrus cycle Gregorian calendar Solar eclipse Variable star Emergency contraception Acne Time Year Miscarriage Month Baldness treatments Computus Guinea pig 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Theodicy Calendar Puberty Circadian rhythm Ovarian cyst Alanis Morissette Julian day Infertility Obstetrics Menstrual cup Orgasm Julian calendar Extreme Programming Abortion debate Sphenoid bone Psoriasis Maya calendar 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Ozone depletion Caffeine Hyperprolactinaemia 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Chronic fatigue syndrome Poker jargon Endometriosis Depo Provera Public domain ISO 8601 Sexual intercourse Roman calendar Vitamin D Hubble Space Telescope Isaac Newton's early life and achievements UK Singles Chart Subud Neighbours Electrophysiology Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mercury Atlas 6 Dominical letter STS-114 Game programming Vaginal bleeding Ozone hole Ricci flow CPU cache Keynesian economics Esperanto as an international language Young Earth creationism Hormone replacement therapy USS Chicago (CA-136) Progesterone Toyota Prius USS Albemarle (AV-5) Endometrium Drill bit Sex assignment Homosexuality and transgender Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hyperinflation Full moon cycle In vitro fertilisation USS George Washington (CVN-73) Japanese calendar Heinkel He 112 Black hole Malaria Niddah USS Alamo Prolactinoma Cardiac arrhythmia Abortion William Wakefield Chinese calendar

oh god what can it be i am very very worried pregnant i dont take pills and my period usually comes in the very end of the month or in the beginning of the month it should had come about one week ago the date i thought it would come i was very sleepy and sad then i went to the bathroom and i noticed something like a light pink brownish mucous i even thought it was my period n put a tampom it was very diferent from my usual period st and nd days is very strong i had this for days and my real period didnt come yet it is been week i am concerned coz i feel some pain it feels like it is in the uterus i dont know if can be pregnancy i had not safe sex with my b f once but was not on my fertile days and he didnt cum inside was like in the end of the month days before my period should had come also i took twice the pregnacy test from pharmacy and both times was negative i 've been tryin to find a gyn but all of them i cant make an appointment soon most have only for end of sept and i dont have insurance help hi there i hope my response will shed a bit of light on your situation first off if you are not taking a contraceptive pill patch diaphragm or shot then your period will be somewhat irregular strong emotions such as stress anxiety sadness and even extreme happiness can affect your period so do not think you are pregnant because of your emotions second however i will have to say that if you had unprotected sex whether he ejaculated in your vagina or not there is a chance you can be pregnant if you had sex at all within the last two weeks the blood you are seeing may be implantation spotting implantation occurs when the embryo implants itself on the epimetrium tissue of the uterus this will be a brownish not rich blood that is sometimes clot filled or accompanied by a thick mucosal discharge you will feel faint contractions of the uterine tissue during implantation this may or may not be pregnancy because implantation cramps are easily mistaken with bowel cramping and gas i would have to say that if you still do not get your period within the next week i would consider taking another home pregnancy test if it still reads negative or positive consult your gynecologist i hope this helps kelly mcbride rdms  Birth control Endometriosis Fertility awareness Childbirth Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Ectopic pregnancy Miscarriage Sexual intercourse Endometrium Prostate cancer Twin In vitro fertilisation Infertility Gonorrhoea Uterus Clinical depression Endometrial cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Psoriasis Puberty EastEnders Intrauterine device Acne Cervix Sexual reproduction Premature birth Stomach cancer Stroke Menstrual cup Oral sex Folic acid Anal sex Anxiety Intersex surgery Pelvic inflammatory disease Ovulation Prenatal diagnosis Muscle Neighbours Progesterone Cancer Malaria Chemical abortion Breast Group A streptococcal infection Medicine Gynecologic hemorrhage Multiple sclerosis Condom Herpes simplex virus Safe sex Friends Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy (mammals) Premature ejaculation Fecal incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Infantilism Sexual abstinence Dog Embryo transfer Human sexual response cycle Turner syndrome Knots Landing Traumatic brain injury Sexual dysfunction The Venture Bros.

how long does the depo shot birth control last in the body i have taken the depo shot for several years i have decided to stop taking them now that i am married and just let nature take its course how long does the drug stay in ones body can i get pregnant immediately or will it take several months to be able to become so if you have an answer please cite your source please thanks in advance three months because you get the shot every months but hold on this is what it says on the site if you decide to become pregnant the first step is to stop receiving doses after the effect of the last dose of depo provera had diminished of women got pregnant at some point within a year this number is similar for women who did not use any form of birth control eighty five percent of women who did not use birth control conceived within a year so when you stop using depo provera you will return to your underlying level of fertility but if your goal is to become pregnant within the next year depo provera is not recommended being able to get pregnant after using depo provera has nothing to do with how many shots you've had whether you've had dose or it's the same for some women it takes more time and for other women it happens faster good luck  Depo Provera Birth control Folic acid Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Doxepin Spina bifida Bipolar disorder Emergency contraception Abortion debate Malaria Glucocorticoid Endometriosis Nuclear fallout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Ice hockey Ionizing radiation Chlorpromazine Isotretinoin Infertility Prolactinoma Obstetrics Paroxetine Chemical abortion Growth hormone treatment Drug abuse Amiodarone Herpes simplex virus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Friends Cytomegalovirus Omega-3 fatty acid Premature birth Antiretroviral drug Cancer Water polo LSD Heir Apparent Health issues and the effects of cannabis Sulfasalazine Golf Lucille Ball Acne COX-2 inhibitor Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Baldness treatments Maprotiline Antipsychotic Breastfeeding Cyanide Knots Landing Gonorrhoea Radiation therapy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder One Tree Hill (TV series) Vitamin C Lung cancer Estrogen Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nicotine Abortion Sexual intercourse In vitro fertilisation Four square Sharon Tate Thimerosal Grand Theft Auto (game) Caffeine Coffee Diazepam Mystique (comics) Childbirth Paracetamol Haloperidol Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Incarnations of Immortality Football (soccer) Overpopulation Dioxin Cannabis (drug) DDT Table tennis Reservoir Dogs Kodocha Alternative medicine Dietary fiber Weight training Expert system

menstrual migrains my doctor says that the awful headaches i get every month during my period are called mentrual migrains i cannot find anything to make them go away or even ease up does anyone else have these what are some ways that you treat them i get them i use aleve which takes the edge off but i know what you mean about them not going away i am on birth control and i know that the headaches where not this bad when i wasn't on them so it is obiously a hormonal issue i guess that if you can figure out what is going on with you hormonally during that time you are closer to figuring out what is going to help you avoid tylenol for headaches use it only in a last resort and understand it may not work or may make the headache fade and comeback stronger also if you take aleve or ibuprofin the moment you feel like you are going to have a headache you have a better chance of having it turn into a migraine also i know it is a taboo topic to discuss but monitor your bowel movements and see if your headaches are related to being constipated at some point during that time as strange as that sounds needed to go number two and not going can cause headaches  Migraine Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Cluster headache Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometriosis Fecal incontinence Pregnancy Fertility awareness Tension headache Clinical depression Hal Trosky Emergency contraception Menstrual cup Epilepsy Prolactinoma Multiple chemical sensitivity Traumatic brain injury Headache Growth hormone treatment Chlorpromazine Opioid Obstetrics Psoriasis Ben Johnson (athlete) Hypertension Theory of conduct Constipation Hypoglycemia Medical prescription Stomach cancer Naproxen Growth hormone Acne Lamotrigine Abortion Syringomyelia Sailing Depo Provera Homosexuality and transgender Bad Wolf Propranolol Aspartame Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fibromyalgia Humphrey Bogart Anabolic steroid Aloe Yarrow Clomipramine Birth control Social rule Pitaten Breastfeeding Lou Gehrig Topiramate Valproic acid Folic acid Neurology Tyramine Breast cancer Biofeedback Reflexology Coeliac disease Transsexuality The Battle (TNG episode) Sigmund Freud Endocrinology Citalopram Cannabis (drug) Craps Essential oil Paget's disease of bone G-Man (Half-Life) Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone deficiency Group A streptococcal infection Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Crohn's disease Chronic pain Password Aspirin Acromegaly Classical music era Cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Medical cannabis Pharmacology Carpal tunnel syndrome Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Miscarriage Cryptorchidism Drowning

im but i think youngsters like me have gone to far have we okaii so this is not a question related to me just scared for highschool really dont have to stick my foot down peoples mouthes but anyway i think year olds like me have now gone way to far i read other peoples questions and its true that year old girls and guys are pressured into having sex really if you have a boyfriend you might get pressured into sex i cant believe that you should wait till your ready buit i dont know having sex at is the new styl e which i will never follow i hope i dont have to deal with that when i head on to highschool but what do you think about this sex pressure thing at a young age no i was seeing what people taught id be real stupid to have sex while in high school hello waiting for maybe till im ready you know im i noticed that too my senior year of high school i had a few boys who were about your age who followed me around 'cause they thought i was cool or whatever and two of them told me they had lost their virginity at about i was shocked i didn't have my first boyfriend until i was and i was still a virgin i was stunned until i got to know one of them better he had joined the drama club and we hung out and he began hanging out with all my friends it wasn't because we thought aww cute kid we can play babysitter it was because he acted like he was and not a kid pretending to be a year old either he was mature and he talked about sex he talked about respecting people how he won't do it with girls who don't want it talking about using protection all of that stuff long story short some people your age aren't ready and i don't think that people should put pressure on kids to do that when they're not ready especially because once i got to college i found out alot of people are virgins but there are some kids your age who are mature and responsible they understand the consequences of sex they understand how to use protection and they don't force it on others my opinion is that if people are mature enough and maturity is not necessarily directly linked with age go ahead if you're not wait and there shouldn't be any pressure i am glad you made the choice to wait  One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez Kodocha Little Britain EastEnders Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kylie Minogue Singlish Teen Girl Squad Sex and the City Can't Hardly Wait Jon Secada Too Short a Season (TNG episode) About a Boy St. Elmo's Fire (film) Undergrads The Inside The Fairly OddParents Ed, Edd n Eddy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) God Emperor of Dune The Subtle Knife Dawson's Creek Child French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Megan Griffin Plame affair Sharon Tate Sin City The Lovely Bones Survivor (novel) Theodicy Pitaten Recurring South Park characters Laura Schlessinger The Ashlee Simpson Show Paul Is Dead Great Teacher Onizuka Stewie Griffin AFI 100 Years series Infantilism The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Characters in Bleach series Beetle in an Anthill StarCraft: Uprising Eric Cartman Radiohead Everwood Rich Mullins Timmy Turner Springfield Elementary School Marilyn Monroe She Loves You Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Child pornography Pop punk The League of Gentlemen (comedy) The Marshall Mathers LP Salad Fingers Sydney Riot of 1879 Vegeta America's Next Top Model Big Brother (USA TV series) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Blood on the Tracks Motion picture rating system Sex Pistols Something Positive Okashina Okashi Smallville (Season 4) Hip hop rivalries Sexual abstinence Rod Stewart George Costanza Jumpstart 3rd Grade Coming of Age (TNG episode) Simone Weil Boston Public KaBlam!

should i think im fat im and i think im fat i weigh about lb and dont look fat to others just taller my momo and brother and sister tell me im fat and i laugh because i dont want them to think i am getting hurt by their words what should i do first don't think that how much you weigh has anything to do with how much body fat you have you could just be muscular for your age second thinking negetive thoughts about yourself isn't healthy it can lead to more serious problems later i want you to sit down and write so positive things that you like that make you unique and different from other people you need to focus more on the things you like about yourself i know how hard that is you should talk to your mom or your school counseler about your feelings it may be hard but it will be worth it these thoughts may lead to something more dangerous down the road and you don't want that  The nature of God in Western theology Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

questions in one what is the best kind of birthcontrol while you are nursing i know you can take the combination pill and they say the mini pill has to be taken the same time everyday i know that one would be hard the other question is what other way can you boost your milk supply besides pumping nursing and taking the ferngreek is their any truth to oatmeal thanks you cannot use an estrogen progesterone combo pill as this will cause problems with the baby specifically mammary growth issues you can use the mini pill progesterone only but you are correct in that there is a very narrow hour window in which the pill must be taken daily alternatives could include the mirena iud which i cannot personally endorse or barrier methods such as a diaphragm contraceptive sponge lea's shield condom male or female or cervical cap all of these would have a higher incidence of prevention if they are combined with spermicides and some require spermicide usage you should discuss all of your options with your ob gyn prior to the birth of your baby  Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Condom Diaphragm (contraceptive) Menstrual cycle Cervical cap Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Breast cancer Intrauterine device Progesterone Hormone replacement therapy Progesterone only pill Obstetrics Mammary gland Cancer In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cup Breast Urinary incontinence Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nonoxynol-9 Endometriosis Chemotherapy Abortion debate Depo Provera Scientology beliefs and practices Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Growth hormone treatment Safe sex Herpes simplex virus Pharmacology Roman Catholic Church Prostate cancer Acne Folic acid Ovulation Sex education Prolactinoma Premature birth Psoriasis Gonorrhoea Sexual abstinence Medical prescription Guinea pig Medicine Apollo 8 Prolactin Antiretroviral drug Elephant Miscarriage Carburetor Osteoporosis Hormone Nipple Bullet Stroke Opera (web browser) Surveillance Dialysis Crohn's disease Bayesian inference International Phonetic Alphabet Medical analysis of circumcision Corporate governance Emergency preparedness Timeline of alternative rock Veganism Atherosclerosis Sewage treatment Powder metallurgy Cervical cancer Childbirth IPod Transgender Unemployment Baldness treatments Milk Expert system Clinical depression Hypoglycemia Myocardial infarction Chiropractic Mac mini NX bit DVD Testosterone Intersex surgery Welding Migraine Dairy Nurse Humanae Vitae Vitamin D

how hard is it to become a midwife and what subjects do i need to take also any links would be great i don't know how hard it is to become one but here a few choices of midwifes certified nurse midwife certified nurse midwives cnms are licensed healthcare practitioners educated in the two disciplines of nursing and midwifery they provide primary healthcare to women of childbearing age including prenatal care labor and delivery care care after birth gynecological exams newborn care assistance with family planning decisions preconception care menopausal management and counseling in health maintenance and disease prevention cnms attend over percent of the births in the united states percent of these births are in hospitals certified midwife a certified midwife cm is an individual educated in the discipline of midwifery who also possesses evidence of certification according to the requirements of the american college of nurse midwives acnm like cnms the cm provides primary healthcare to women of childbearing age including prenatal care labor and delivery care care after birth gynecological exams newborn care assistance with family planning decisions preconception care menopausal management and counseling in health maintenance and disease prevention other midwives the overwhelming majority of midwives are either cnms or cms still a variety of titles are used to label midwifery practice so it can be confusing for consumers who want to determine just what qualifications have been met by midwives acnm believes that in the united states all midwives should graduate from an accredited midwifery education program that is affiliated with an institution of higher education all cnms and cms have earned at least a bachelor's degree while over percent hold a master's degree or higher acnm also believes that midwives should be licensed to practice and should provide their clients with a safe mechanism for consultation collaboration and referral if needed because standards for the education and practice of midwifery may vary we urge consumers to carefully evaluate credentials and look for a well educated provider who allows direct access to medical care if needed doula the doula's role is to provide physical and emotional support to women and their partners during labor and birth a doula offers information assistance and advice on topics such as breathing relaxation movement and positioning perhaps the most crucial role of the doula is to provide continuous emotional reassurance and comfort doulas do not perform clinical tasks such as vaginal exams or fetal heart rate monitoring doulas do not diagnose medical conditions or give medical advice doulas and midwives often work together as their philosophy and practice is complementary at times midwives need help because of the complex course of labor or the competing needs of more than one woman which makes the doula midwife team a wonderful option  Paralegal National Health Service Medicare (Canada) Publicly funded medicine Lawyer Folic acid Medical Assistant Abortion Software engineering Prenatal care Clinical depression Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Education in Portugal Education in the United States Cancer Pharmacist Psychiatry Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breech birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alternative medicine Chiropractic Androgen insensitivity syndrome Juris Doctor Abortion in the United States Herpes simplex virus Chinese University of Hong Kong Palliative care Education in Australia Myocardial infarction Prenatal diagnosis Electrical engineering Medical prescription Psychotherapy Graduate school Certified Nursing Assistant Education in the People's Republic of China Transsexuality Hypoglycemia Information Technology Infrastructure Library Homeopathy Public bodies and task forces of the UK government Caesarean section Public health in mainland China Genetic counseling Podiatrist Medical analysis of circumcision American Medical Association Far Eastern University Multiple sclerosis Dentistry National Institutes of Health Health maintenance organization Sex education Health profession Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Partial-birth abortion Columbia University Education in Hong Kong Abortion debate Naturopathic medicine Birth control Osteopathy Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Paramedic Health science Stroke Tai Chi Chuan Health insurance Cytomegalovirus Attorney at Law Anorexia nervosa Migraine Athletic trainer Enterprise content management Pneumonia Terri Schiavo Medical record Master's degree Barbara Boxer

tamponhelp hi i use the lightest s possile i can put them in but it takes along time to put them in im usally in the bathroom for like minutes putting them in cause im always scared to and i shake im only and sometimes they dont feel right so i take it out and put a new in and this happens everytime i think im putting them in right but how could this be maybe this is because you're still a beginner and you're only years old when you get used to them tampons should take only seconds to put in if your tampon doesn't feel right when it's inside then you probably have it in wrong or don't have it on high enough when you put in your tampon make sure you're angling it towards your tailbone the vagina lays flat so pushing back instead of up will help also make sure your applicater is inside of you all the way before you push in the nd tube this will ensure you have the tampon in the right spot good luck  Menstrual cup Strap-on dildo Weight training Kenny McCormick Water polo Sanitary towel Professional wrestling holds Condom Menstrual cycle Toxic shock syndrome Herbert Garrison Vagina Professional wrestling throws The Amazing Race Time Out of Mind Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Campfire Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Shuffle Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon Chess strategy and tactics Professional wrestling match types Avenue Q Glossary of climbing terms Cleveland Browns Homer Simpson Kurt Angle Milton H.

i'm late my period was due day cycle my last period was its now and still af is nowhere to be found i took the obvious pregnancy test and it came back negitive what do you think the deal is i have no stress haven't gain lossed any weight my basal body temp is staying elevated any clues or advise is welcome thank you i would suggest you take the pregnancy test again if your basal body temperature is still elevated it is quite possible that you are pregnant pregnancy tests are not always reliable close to your period and sometimes need to be done several days after your period should have arrived to get a proper answer if your test is still negative then relax if you are trying to get pregnant then it is quite common for the excitment pressure etc of the expectation to slow your period down and for it to come later it is also possible that you are not pregnant at all it is very unusual for a person to have an entirely consistant mentrual cycle with no variation at any time you may just be late if you find that you are not pregnant after retesting and you don't get your period within another few days then you may want to consider going to see a doctor  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Fertility awareness Abortion Urinary incontinence Turner syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypertension Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Oral contraceptive Cytomegalovirus Temperature Prostate cancer Miscarriage Folic acid Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Psoriasis Thermal power station Childbirth Ovulation Child sexuality Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Myocardial infarction Sea level rise Gonorrhoea Stomach cancer Dieting Birth control Autism Anemia Roe v.

periods pads what types of pads should i use ok heres the dealio i just started my periods on july th and i just started my nd cycle on friday on my first period the blood was dark brown my flow was light this time the blood started out brown and started to get redder and redder after the st day my flow got heavier and heavier too this last night i put an always regular maxi with wings on and a carefree pantiliner on b c i thought it would leak through i woke up this morning to find my pantiliner completely soaked with blood both red and brown and some had even leaked through into my maxi today my flow was really heavy and red so i wore a maxi all day and just now changed to a stayfree ultra thin regular for heavy flow every time i went to pee lots and lots of blood would flow into the toliet i dance and i didn't go today cause i was afraid people would see my pad or go through my shorts can they c it my mom is buying some new pads cause im running out what do you suggest based on what i said above first calm down cause stress does funny things to your period oh and be grateful for a great understanding mom i hope my daughter can talk to me too when she comes of age now the stuff you want to know first don't dance all girls have or will go through it accept that and relax second always wear dark colthes shorts pants during your period and denim jeans are really great for even when the pads leak lightly that is it's less likely to show and as far as seeing the pad wear loose bottoms and baggy tops second if i understand you right this is just your second period ever if thats it then for the first year maybe your body will do different things it may not do the same thing every time and the first time or two will be extra heavy oh and certain days will be heavier than others always be prepared third don't double up if you're that paranoid and you think it's that bad set an alarm clock and wake up to change about every four hours ten minutes to change that isn't gonna be that big a deal fourth buy the thin always pads i personally prefer the kotex cause their velco did i spell that right and not plastic sticky stuff i also always wear the long overnight ones regardless of the time of day just cause i feel like they smooth better under my pants and cover better cause it runs sometimes fifth stay clean and change about every four to five hours if not sooner i go through about pads during a period week don't ever buy the scented ones cause they could cause an infection sixth don't stress over the blood in the toliet it happens and only cause proparbly the clots hanging around near where your pee if you have to change a pad constantly then worry about the amount of blood in the toliet and the blood that you're losing cause it could be the sign of something more serious but the regular rule is you should be able to go about four hours i hope this helps i can't stand having my period and good luck oh and calm down again everybody has to deal with it and we're all paranoid about it being noticed  Sanitary towel Urinary incontinence Mattress Menstrual cycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Social rule Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story AFI 100 Years series Time Out of Mind Insomnia Dialysis Sleep Slayers Radiohead Ron and Fez Ice hockey Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paragliding Treehouse of Horror V The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pok__mon Live!

help please information on cervical cancer hey everybody o k so i went for a pap test about two and a half weeks ago then went on vaction i got home today and found a message from my doctor saying to call i told her she could leave the results on the phone so i figure they probally arn't good and am really scared i know i wont know until tomorrow but im scared several members of my family have had cervical cancer and i was wondering is there a genetic link or are we just unlucky lol and also what are the chances of getting rid of the cancer if that is what it is i know it may not be without making me infertily well don't get all worried about something until you know for sure because of doctor patient privacy laws the doctors cannot legally leave medical information regarding test results on an answering machine where just anyone can hear them secondly a lot of cancers are genetic and i would assume this might include cervical cancer as only about of all cc's are caused by hpv the good news is that cc is highly treatable and exceptionally preventable as it is slow growing and it takes years for the abnormalities i e dyplasia to convert to cancer cells if and that's a huge if you do end up needing treatement chances are your fertility will not be effected but this is all putting the cart before the horse you need to know your results first and those will most likely be benign or at worst questionable and need a repeat pap to confirm preliminary findings  Cancer Prostate cancer Cervical cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human papillomavirus Medical analysis of circumcision Stomach cancer Pap smear Abortion Medicine Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Urinary incontinence Metastasis Breast cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen insensitivity syndrome AIDS reappraisal Endometrial cancer Cryptorchidism Colposcopy Cystic fibrosis Privacy Genital wart Apoptosis Medical prescription Chiropractic Huntington's disease Folic acid Ovarian cancer Infertility Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cephalic disorder Coeliac disease Virus Abortion debate Alcoholism AIDS Menstrual cycle Childbirth Stroke Mesothelioma Rabies Cervix Gonorrhoea In vitro fertilisation Circumcision Divorce Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Migraine Tobacco smoking Diabetes mellitus Syringomyelia X-ray Down syndrome Sickle-cell disease Herpes simplex virus Growth hormone treatment Antiretroviral drug Alzheimer's disease Multiple sclerosis Hypertension Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Genetic disorder Radiation therapy Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Scar Ben Johnson (athlete) Hypoglycemia Meiosis Eczema Singlish Fertility awareness Stem cell Myocardial infarction Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Epilepsy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Soft tissue sarcoma Obstetrics Involuntary commitment Lupus erythematosus Psoriasis Familial adenomatous polyposis Terri Schiavo Leukemia Helicobacter pylori Malaria Surveillance Mental Health Act 1983 Y chromosome Milton H.

i need help with the pill so i am finally starting birth control for the first time but my doctor basically gave me the pills and left nice huh so im not to sure on what to do i believe that i am supposed to wait until i start my period i started that today i guess i take the first pill then right and then also i heard you take a week off after each packet why and when do i start again reading the pamphlet that came with the pills will be helpful you can either start on the day of your period or do what i used to do when i was on them the sunday start you take the pill on the sunday after your period starts sometimes it is easier to do the sunday start so you can always count on what day of the week to take your first pill and when your period will come if you are on regular pills you will take them for weeks called on weeks then you will have week off of them however some brands will have the th week with different colored pills that don't truly contain birth control you don't have to take them but many people do just to maintain the good habit during their 'off' week if you had a sunday start start the sunday after your period if you started on the day of your period do the same again also take them at the same time every day that you take them this will greatly impact the effectiveness of the pills i found that setting an alarm reminder on my cell phone was helpful for when to take the pill and writing on a calendar what my on and off weeks were also helped  Oral contraceptive Liturgical year Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Daylight saving time Computus Urinary incontinence Gregorian calendar Psoriasis Hebrew calendar Angels in America Theory of conduct Acne Mid-Autumn Festival Easter ISO 8601 Ben Johnson (athlete) Dominical letter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Tag Surveillance Sunday Apollo 8 Gospel Social rule Guinea pig Ocean's Twelve Lent Placebo Sabbath Fecal incontinence Doomsday rule Calendar Endometriosis Wheel of Fortune Medical prescription Sharon Tate Migraine Fasting Neighbours Rosh Hashanah Alanis Morissette Margaret Sanger Coptic calendar Sleep Major League Baseball television contracts Week Password Depo Provera Monday Night Football French Republican Calendar Julian day Intrauterine device Jewish holiday Holy Week Chronology of Jesus Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dietary fiber Leo Wyatt Stomach cancer Patent medicine Childbirth Calculating the day of the week Maya calendar Code division multiple access CPU cache Rose (Doctor Who) RISC Year of the Spider MTV2 Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar Calvin and Hobbes Caffeine Birthday Crossword Sea-Monkey Blur Canonical hours Cleveland Browns Paul Weller 97.3 Forth One Sexual reproduction The Doctor Dances Shavuot Buffer overflow Penis enlargement Antiretroviral drug Maprotiline Antidepressant Tocopherol Palm Sunday She Loves You Matins Destiny of the Daleks

where can i buy a divacup in england like from a shop instead of online i quite fancy trying one the website is www divacup com they sound so much cleaner than tampons and pads does anyone know where i can get one around the gateshead area near newcastle the divacup is only one type brand of menstrual cup they are a canadian based company so you can only really buy online they have a uk based web site http www dcltd co uk they charge but you are best off going for a mooncup the mooncup is a uk based company who's menstrual cups are made from medical grade silicon like divacup but are slightly softer and with a smaller shape if you go to the all about menstrual cups page http menstrualcups org and have a look around you can find some comparrison photos between mooncup divacup keeper lunette and instead as well as all you ever need to know about menstrual cups mooncup http www mooncup co uk wc php u is sold in boots stores as well as health stores the mooncup only has a three month money back guarentee rather than the month guarentee period given by divacup but that is plenty of time for you to try them out and send back if not for you if you go into the bigger boots store in eldon square they have their menstrual product section in the far left hand side of the store near to the checkouts and back entrence you'll find menstrual cups on the bottom shelf near the tampons you can also get menstrual cups in the boots on northumberland road and in silverlink they cost in boots which is one pound more than on the mooncup web site but it means you don't have to wait for it to get to you in the mail and shows boots that there is a demand for safer menstrual options as far as i am aware boots are the only places that stock them near newcastle at the moment there was a health store in gosforth that sold 'alternative' menstrual options but they along with many other health stores in the newcastle area have closed menstrual cups are a lot cleaner than tampons and pads not to mention far safer unlike tampons they do not cause vaginal infections nor are they linked with tss or cancer as tampons are menstrual cups don't contain nasty chemicals or allow bacteria to multiply in great numbers menstrual cups also allow your vagina to carry on self cleaning this means you only have to empty them every hours and you can wear them to bed without having to worry about health risks a lot more convenient environmentally friendly cost effective nothing shows on the outside perfect for heavy flow body positive ethical manufacturers generally far better than tampons or pads i've been using my menstrual cup for around years now i'd never ever go back to using tampons and pads  Sanitary towel Toxic shock syndrome Strap-on dildo Mattress Brassiere Wal-Mart Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Newcastle upon Tyne Dairy Breastfeeding HyperText Transfer Protocol Energy development Sears Holdings Corporation Fertility awareness Social rule PHP Uniform Resource Locator Endometriosis Toyota Prius Surveillance Electronic commerce Female genital cutting Intravenous therapy Domestic rabbit Tyne and Wear Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Coffee Boots Group Nuclear power Guinea pig Tyne and Wear Metro Newcastle United F.C.

why shouldn't abortion be an option for me i do not plan on getting married i do not wish to be carry a pregnancy to term and i do not wish to be a mother birth control is not why should i be forced in to abstinence i'm and my cousin thinks i should have it i don't and have no plans on spending my life with my bed buddy why does my cousin tell me abortion is not an option when i know this is the best thing for me why should i feel ashamed for doing what's right regarding my body and how i want to live it i only get one why should i spend the rest of it feeding something that will be noisy and rebellious i'm looking for answers especially from women that understand me i'm sorry i'm not religious so please no christians or spiritual reasoning short answer do what you're comfortable doing and ignore people as well as their opinions my grandmother used to say that people's opinions were just like their anuses is that even the proper plural you don't want to see it and you surely don't want to hear it long answer abortion shouldn't be an option for you because your cousin believes she wouldn't do that and she's applying her belief system to you and your situation people do this all the time on many different topics example i am childfree have chosen to have no children and am thrilled about it and i get opinions all the time about why i should have children regardless of my lack of desire or ability to parent it's generally stupid to try to change someone's life in five minutes of lip flapping and it doesn't really apply to my belief system so i've learned to avoid the subject or tune them out at the end of the day do i listen no should you listen no instead listen to yourself and listen to your heart do what you are comfortable doing read a lot a good pro abortion site to visit is i'm not sorry do a google and you'll get a link to the site my story is there and many other's stories are too remember whatever you do you will look yourself in the mirror and live with it the rest of your life i live with my decisions quite well really for the record i had a late term abortion at the age of i can offhand think of seven i finally quit changing the number because it kept going up women i know to have had an abortion and not a single one of them regret it they considered it the best thing to do in light of the cicumstances personally speaking it was the best thing i ever did for me and i'm still married to the father of the baby i aborted i often picture it not as a negative event i have to regret but as an event that i learned from it did and didn't tattoo everything i had to learn what i resented about the situation my husband's attitude what i wouldn't do again wait so long and what was positive i didn't have a baby i'd have probably never really wanted but it all taught me to believe in myself some people will tell you that you are being selfish to heck with being selfish sometimes you have to go that route to preserve your sanity whether you carry the pregnancy to term and get married or become a single mother carry a pregnancy for nine months in the eye of your community with the intent of adopting it out and listen to all the comments you would be sure to get or have an abortion you have to do it for you because at the end of the day you are the person who will live with your decision do the thing that suits you and move on don't allow yourself to be convinced to do something that feels wrong just because someone else feels it is right and that goes for everything not just childbirthing you have to ask yourself if the people who are so into you having this baby you don't want are going to be sending you checks money for childrearing or if they are going to be paying for counseling on issues regarding carrying out the pregnancy and giving it up for adoption they won't you and i both know it the people who want you to blindly have this baby don't care about you once you've had it i'm not saying you'd end up there by default or anything like that that is also not to say you might not be in counseling because you had an abortion and now regret it or became infertile just like the forced birthers wouldn't pay for the stuff i mentioned earlier i wouldn't pay for your medical treatment because you had an abortion that's why i encourage you to follow your heart unfortunately you are on your own at the end of this game i'm not saying women don't regret abortions or become infertile because of it i've seen the regret firsthand i participated on a message board for a few years where some women regretted their abortions to the point of considering suicide to end their pain i've never personally seen or known someone who had an abortion that resulted in infertility unless i count the back alley abortions i've read about that resulted in infertility as a matter of fact my cousin who had an abortion went on to have a beautiful daughter when she was ready i'm not saying it doesn't happen because i don't know i really don't know if i'm infertile or not because i never tried to have children so perhaps you see what i mean my advice get thee to a clinic as soon as possible if you're going to have an abortion had i not been scared and waited so long i'd have saved roughly and quite a bit of discomfort and that was in think of what you'd spend now and with the new abortion laws you might not even be able to attain one in many states if you wait too long if you're not going to have an abortion you need to get into some prenatal care as soon as possible so you'll have a healthy baby that you can make available for adoption or keep to parent yourself regardless of how some decidely odd people feel about it this is a legal and safe option you have right now regardless of the moral implications some people believe go along with it the longer you wait the less time you'll have the option choose for yourself and what you really believe more advice when i was pregnant i told no one other than the father i didn't want everybody to know i had had an abortion because i didn't want to hear their mouths work if you ever find this yourself in this situation again you might think carefully about who you'll tell and what you think their reactions might be you might be able to tell your cousin and make her believe that you had a miscarriage that's all i've got i hope it helps good luck and my heart goes with you in whatever direction you take  Social rule Charmed Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ten Commandments Partial-birth abortion Goodness and value theory Alcoholics Anonymous Religious

this isn't a uti it's different this morning i had to pee every half hour for a while now i don't get the urge to go for about two hours i had a uti recently and back then i would only go a tiny bit each time this time every time i go it's quite a bit and it's not dark like it was during my uti two weeks ago it's really clear and it doesn't hurt to go i was wondering what could cause this i had to do last night really bad but i strained a lot would that have anything to do with it how about eating too much fruit i had some cross breeds of plums and apricots yesterday they're called pluots and that's the only odd thing i had yesterday anything else this definately isn't a uti if you're producing a normal or larger than normal amount of urine with each session it isn't dark cloudy or smell bad and it isn't painful to go then i would say that your body is just eliminating excess fluid perhaps you drank a larger than normal amount of fluids the night before if you have no pain discomfort or other signs of a uti then i wouldn't worry  Urinary incontinence Urine Urinary tract infection Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Penis Time Out of Mind Fecal incontinence Guinea pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Medical analysis of circumcision Poker jargon Cat Dialysis Ron and Fez Dehydration Urinary system The Amber Spyglass Prostate cancer Piccolo Junior Saga The Inside Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Sin City Bread Blood (computer game) House Mouse Menstrual cycle Traumatic incident reduction Scientology beliefs and practices Procrastination Endometriosis Carbon dioxide Decompression sickness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cocaine First aid The Wotch Treehouse of Horror V Hey Jude Hypoglycemia Shark Diabetic retinopathy Fancy rat AFI 100 Years series Steven Wright LSD Shaggy dog story Spider Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.

what's the logic behind a woman wanting breast implants to enlarge them do men prefer this type of woman do big breasted women look better than small breasted women i prefer small as they make a woman a woman i don't think there's any logic to it at all it's not because they're slutty i would say it's because they are either vain or have incredibly low self esteem and think bigger boobs will fix it there are some women that have uneven breasts and implants can even those out and i'm sure there are some older women that just want everything up where it was years before  Breast fetishism Breast Sexual attraction Tom Coburn Plastic surgery Tyra Banks Human penis size Brassiere Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society Penis envy Breast cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Recurring South Park characters Sexual fetishism Breast expansion fetish Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersex surgery Fat fetishism Progesterone Prostate cancer Caprice Bourret Japanese tea ceremony Tawny Peaks Penis enlargement Breast reconstruction Cancer Puberty Breast reduction Body modification Equine conformation Obesity Ovarian cancer Germaine Greer Gender role Wendy Testaburger Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Dolly Parton Large Marge Giantess Obstetrics Cochlear implant Lesbian feminism Little Britain Bryan Adams Tara Reid Mamie Van Doren Breastfeeding Programmable logic device Pornographic movie Cleavage (breasts) Cytomegalovirus Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Charles Maurice de Talleyrand Milk Abortion Emergency contraception Hearing impairment Britney Spears Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Egyptian chronology Silicone Humphrey Bogart Orgasm Computer Baldness treatments Katie Holmes Transsexuality AmigaOS Jennifer Lyon Page Three girl Arthur Schopenhauer Aromatase inhibitor Hyperplasia Karen McDougal Yoko Ono Swimsuit Kart racing Switch Mai Shiranui Wardrobe malfunction Tom Leykis Bon Jovi Tissue expansion Metastasis Stem cell Fertility awareness Integrated circuit The Six Million Dollar Man Polychlorinated biphenyl Swyer syndrome Katelyn Faber Light pollution Sweden at the 2004 Summer Olympics Atrial septal defect Pregnancy

women girls only please read and answer your help is needed i have a few questions that i have been wondering about lately i was wondering if anyone here has asked their doctors about using tampons before they started using them i was also wondering how you asked if you did and what their response was also did the doctor try to make it as comfortable as they could and how embarrassing was it after you said it also how did you bring yourself to ask if you haven't asked what are some ways that i could ask my pediatrician i have a female doctor i trust her and all but i am just to nervous to ask about tampons but i want to hear what she has to say i have no one else to talk to about this and i do not want to just try them before i talk to my doctor i have tried several time to ask but i chicken out i know that every girl has to deal with period but i still find it so embarrassing what can i do i play a lot of sports and am very active so i really wanna switch think about what specific questions you have and write them down having the questions written out will make it easier for you to remember if you feel embarrased about the subject you could also show the questions to your doctor instead of asking them what you're asking about is a normal and natural subject rest assured that your doctor won't find it embarrasing i will bet she will try to put you at ease and you will feel better for asking  Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tampon Avenue Q Theory of conduct Milton H.

what does this mean i asked this a couple days ago but i didnt get enough information i get my period very irregularly once every month and a half to two months about two weeks after i end my period i get what i call period leftovers its not mucus that usually comes later its just brown gunk i want to know if this means im ovulating or what what do you think its all about oh i've had my period for a while now i'm i have a very intense dance education that most likely keeps my period from being normal i'm curious because i want to know about my ovarian cycle hi menstrual cycles vary in length from one woman to another they may occur at the same time each month or be irregular typically a cycle occurs about once a month but can be as short as days or as long as days and still be considered normal menstrual flow lasts about to days a menstrual period is considered late if it is or more days overdue according to the usual pattern of periods a period is considered missed if there is no menstrual flow for or more weeks the causes a late or missed period could be because of any of the following pregnancy this is the most common cause of missed periods if you have had unprotected sex even once in the past several months see your doctor for a pregnancy test before you consider any of the other possible causes stress stress is the second most common cause of late or missed periods in teenagers it may be emotional stress or depression or it may be physical stress such as a severe illness a sexually transmitted infection rapid weight loss or gain or strenuous exercise dieting or binging and purging may interrupt menstrual cycles changes in your usual routine for example going on a vacation may also cause your period to be late or missed normal development during the first couple of years of menstruation many teenagers have irregular periods during this time the body's hormones are not yet finely tuned so the ovaries may not release an egg once every month as a result your cycles may be irregular occurring as close together as weeks or as far apart as months hormone imbalance hormone imbalance is rarely the cause of missed periods in teenagers polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common type of hormone imbalance that affects the menstrual cycle polycystic ovaries may cause irregular cycles increased body hair acne and weight gain sometimes when you stop taking birth control pills you may have a temporary hormone imbalance and loss of periods if you are having sex be sure to use another reliable method of birth control because you could still become pregnant problems of the thyroid gland pituitary gland adrenal glands or ovaries can be rare causes of irregular periods methods to know the cause pregnancy a positive pregnancy test is the only way to be certain of pregnancy it is best to see your doctor for a pregnancy test stress some stress is a normal part of daily life only you can know if you are under too much stress normal development if your doctor finds nothing abnormal during your physical examination and you've been having periods for years or less your irregular periods may be part of your normal development if you have had sexual intercourse go to your doctor's office for a pregnancy test when your period is late for you even if you normally have irregular cycles hormone imbalance if you have missed several periods without an explanation your doctor can check your ovaries and look for any signs of hormone imbalance blood tests can be done to measure hormone levels it is important to identify pregnancy early so that you can discuss the options available to you and start prenatal care early prenatal care helps ensure a healthy baby if the irregularity is due to stress then your periods should return when the activities or situations that are stressing you are eliminated or changed as part of normal development most girls' menstrual cycles become fairly regular as their hormone levels become mature and synchronized a few women will continue to have irregular cycles as their normal pattern most often the doctor can treat a hormone imbalance once the cause is discovered  Traumatic brain injury Growth

why do you have to start birth control the sunday after your period would it really make a difference if it was like the tuesday after do you still have to be on your period or what help please i'm not using it for contraceptive just to help with my period so i'm not looking for its effectiveness in the pregnancy department but if i start the pills tonight then i have my period the first week of school so i was just wondering if i could start it next week or so starting on the first sunday after the start of your period means that you aren't likely to be pregnant when you start taking it and it means that your next period will start at about the same time of the month that it would have started normally the pills are timed so that your period will always fall during the week keeping your weekends period free my pills actually start on a saturday and my period will start on monday afternoon and is gone by thursday or friday you could delay starting it for a week if you aren't sexually active it just means that you would have a slightly longer wait for your next period you'd get it when you have the sugar pills  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Birth control Week Fertility awareness Sunday Hebrew calendar Easter Monday Gregorian calendar National Football League Fasting Monday Night Football Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Depo Provera Thursday Holy Week Saturday Weekend MTV2 Daylight saving time Friday Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Acne Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Tocopherol Folic acid Tuesday Abortion debate Sexual abstinence Doomsday rule Days of the week Good Friday Major League Baseball television contracts CBC Radio One Endometriosis Sex education Intrauterine device Sunday shopping Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Psoriasis EastEnders UK Singles Chart Carnival Saturday Night Live Irish calendar WQHT (FM) Velvet Revolution Bob Harris (radio) Wednesday Lent Northern Ireland peace process Friday the 13th Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Teenage pregnancy Back to the Future timeline Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Paschal cycle Day STS-59 Johnnie Walker (DJ) Hurricane Katrina timeline Urinary incontinence ISO 8601 Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Jewish holiday Apollo 8 New Orleans Mardi Gras Operation Market Garden Ocean's Twelve Astrology Ron and Fez Priesthood Correlation Program August 2005 in Britain and Ireland BBC Radio 2 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Breastfeeding Miscarriage September 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore Computus Holiday Fathers' rights movement in the UK Formula One racing KCMP Hypertension Coronation Street Channel 4 Harrow School Sexual intercourse September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September The Disney Afternoon Shavuot History of sex BBC television drama

is future pregnancy possible i am not currently trying to get pregnant but i do want kids some time in the future i have never had normal menstruation since i could remember when i was i was put on birth control this made me spontaneously lose a dangerous amount of weight i didn't know it at the time but this was discovered as the reason for weight loss and i was able to return to a normal weight once i got off the birth control months later after many analyses it was discovered that i should never have been put on any type of female hormonal medication i have an underdeveloped uterus and while my ovaries used to be able to irregularly produce their follicles they no longer can now years after the birth control disaster i am taking per doctor's orders herbal supplements to try to regain my cycle has anyone had similar experience or known of somebody or at least known somebody with an underdeveloped womb i really want to have a child someday is it possible it is possible but you may need a little help from fertility meds this really should be a question for your doctor because i'm not a doctor i had irregular periods and still got pregnant although i miscarried it was due to a softball size cyst on my right ovary with an irregular period the only trouble with trying is knowing when your ovulating i was put on herbal supplements to regulate my period as well and so far they are working definitely ask your doctor though he may have some good ideas that would help you in a future pregnancy good luck and best wishes  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Puberty In vitro fertilisation Ovary Fertility awareness Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Breastfeeding Endometriosis Spina bifida Abortion Ovulation Childbirth Emergency contraception Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infertility Urinary incontinence Sexual reproduction Female reproductive system (human) Obstetrics Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Intersexuality Abortion debate Sexual differentiation Guinea pig Ovarian cancer Diabetes mellitus Progesterone Tocopherol Intact dilation and extraction Acne Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Premature birth Dieting Thyroid Folic acid Prolactinoma Ectopic pregnancy Turner syndrome Human chorionic gonadotropin Bipolar disorder Cephalic disorder Insulin Anorexia nervosa Fertilisation Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Gynaecology Estradiol Hyperprolactinaemia Sex assignment Baldness treatments Alternative medicine History of intersex surgery Migraine Biology and sexual orientation Roe v.

is spanking harmful i have been chatting to this really nice guy on the net and we are close to meeting up for the first time soon but he has just said he is really into spanking i was spanked often as a child and have a bit of an issue with it it still sort of scares me is there any medical problems with being spanked i mean can it do any lasting harm i don't really want to give up on him but his last message made it quite clear that if i didn't let him he would have a problem with fulfilling himself in the bedroom help he seemed so nice and i don't want to lose out will it do me any harm should i take a chance is there anything i can do to make it easier to take he is so very nice otherwise and this seems like a little sacrafice on my part what does anyone think hi catherine i don't suppose there are any 'medical' issues unless the spanking is overly aggressive many people find spanking bondage highly erotic but i'm sure that there are also people that don't share the same view imho sex between two people improves the more you get to know your partner i e what they like and what they don't like if somebody wants you to indulge in bondage spanking please don't do it until you trust the person and you feel completely secure in their company my only concern here is that this guy has told you his desire before you've even met if you are going to meet this guy make sure your first meeting is in a very public place pub club etc and keep an eye on your drink not trying to scare you google 'date rape' and you'll see lots of unpleasant stories just proceed with caution and don't feel you have to make sacrifices if you don't like it don't do it boris  BDSM Human sexual behavior Social rule Bondage (BDSM) Theory of conduct Human sexuality Spanking Serial killer Infantilism Extreme Programming Erotic spanking Divorce Sexual orientation Plame affair Liam Gallagher Rape Masturbation Avenue Q Abortion debate Corporal punishment The Apprentice 2 Polyamory Birthday Stewie Griffin Paraphilia Breastfeeding Current teachings of Prem Rawat Censorship in Australia Jam (TV series) Single Transferable Vote Prisoner's dilemma Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Privacy Sin City Shaggy dog story The Smoking Room Zoophilia Cybersex Child sexuality Childlove movement About a Boy Slash fiction Surveillance Religious Society of Friends James Dobson Alcoholics Anonymous Pretty Good Privacy Humphrey Bogart Domination & submission (BDSM) Transactional analysis Motivation Jon Secada Homophobia Anarchism and society Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Friends W.I.T.C.H.

why do women's periods i've heard that if you're living with a woman that your periods begin to sync with each others like you have them at the same time or maybe just around the same time is this true does it have to be a non relative like could a mother and daughter sync up and why does the body do this actually it's very true and there have been studies that have proven that it does happen some of the theories are that women put off pheromones at different times of their cycle other women pick up these pheromones and it changes their hormonal levels to sync up with the other woman the hormone levels are what control how your menstrual cycle occurs and when  Ovulation Pregnancy Fertility awareness Biology and sexual orientation Sexual attraction Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Puberty Urinary incontinence Oral contraceptive Progesterone Androgen insensitivity syndrome Acne Sleep Breast cancer Hormone Niddah God Emperor of Dune Menstrual cup Hormone replacement therapy Orgasm Nutrition Anabolic steroid Estrus cycle Ovarian cyst Human height Menopause Gender role Hebrew calendar Endometrium Swingout Domestic violence Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Emergency contraception Sexual differentiation Birth control Tide Delayed puberty Honeybee Miscarriage Amenorrhoea Chinese calendar Testosterone Left-handed Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Growth hormone Solar variation Dysmenorrhea Hysterectomy Cancer Intersexuality Endocrinology Transsexuality Sadism and masochism House Mouse Prostate cancer Daylight saving time IS-95 Obstetrics Estrogen Anovulation Turner syndrome Baldness treatments Baldness Theory Homosexuality and transgender Obesity Garter snake Gender identity Glucocorticoid Heart Falsifiability Morning sickness Sexual abstinence Osteoporosis Milankovitch cycles Aerial (dance move) Human chorionic gonadotropin In vitro fertilisation Communication Hair Hyperprolactinaemia Growth hormone treatment Original Amiga chipset Brain Growth hormone deficiency Frame of reference Traumatic brain injury Time Human penis size Wallflower (comics) Meiosis Cell growth Bipolar disorder Breastfeeding Postpartum depression

will local or general anesthesia harm a fetus i'm pretty sure that local anesthesia wouldn't harm a fetus but would general anesthesia im suppose to have surgery on my carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel within the next months we have been ttc therefore i really need to know if i am currently pregnant i would be about weeks im late with period with negative tests but we are still trying to conceive in the meantime this would be a really bad time to have surgery first of all the symptoms you are having will likely get worse with pregnancy because everything swells unless you have nerve compression that is causing severe symptoms i'd suggest you wait until you are no longer pregnant why the next months deadline you'll still be in the first trimester which is the riskiest time for any pregnancy it's your call but if it were me i'd do everything possible to struggle through without any surgery whilst pregnant if you insist on going through with it the anesthesia itself will not harm the baby but the mere stress of having surgery will make it more likely that you will miscarry that early in a pregnancy there is little that can be done to prevent it you just have to take your chances you can also have the procedures done under straight local no sedation no general just numbing medicine that won't get to the baby in appreciable amounts and is perfectly safe the stress of surgery thing still applies though think long and hard about this before going through with it the chance of losing the pregnancy is small but why take any chance at all  Pregnancy Obstetrics Carpal tunnel syndrome Abortion Abortion debate Miscarriage Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Childbirth Cephalic disorder Diabetic retinopathy Local anesthesia Cancer Stomach cancer Intact dilation and extraction Spina bifida Anesthesia Stroke Medicine Prostate cancer Premature birth Menstrual cycle Clinical depression Electroconvulsive therapy Repetitive strain injury Brachial plexus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breech birth Twin Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Epidural Prenatal diagnosis Roe v.

help i just got my period this morning and of my mates are coming to use my pool today i dont know how to use a tampon i've never needed to use one what can i do hey i can understand how nervous you must be tampons seem scary at first but after you try them they are nothing to fear first relax then by a package of playtex gentle glide unscented regular size tampons with the plastic applicators the smaller the tampon the better so use regular rather than super i think the plastic applicators are easier to insert and the unscented kind are better for your body next go into the bathroom and carefully read the directions before you give it a go the directions in the box will give you step by step instructions on what to do and will also have illustrations to let you know how to do it now the key is to relax if you are nervous you will have a hard time getting it inserted if it helps you can take deep breaths and on the last exhalation insert the tampon as you breath out if you follow the directions the tampon should feel comfortable while inside if you feel any discomfort the tampon is not inserted far enough and you should pull it out and try again with a new tampon i hope this helps i was terrified the first time i used one if you get really scared ask your mom or someone who has experience to talk you through it  Menstrual cup Tampon Menstrual cycle Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Strap-on dildo Anxiety Floppy disk Urinary incontinence Condom Sewage treatment Kenny McCormick Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amazing Race Hamster RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story Drill bit Ron and Fez Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Aikido Sleep apnea Trumpet Milton H.

question for women over i had regular periods until my doctor put me on cytotec to prevent an ulcer and ms contin for horrible nerve pain when i was he told me it would screw up my period well i haven't had a period since then yay i used to get horrible cramps i quit the cytotec after about a year because my new doctor didn't think i needed it my period never came back last year i had a pap smear and they checked to see if i was peri menopausle and i'm not i'm now with no period still and no signs of menopause could i have gone through menopause and not known it i've never had a hot flash and i haven't felt weird different thoughts dear ladylynn our bodies react to drugs in many different ways the drugs you took may have stopped your periods but the bigger question is why your cycle is all based on hormones so if the tests say your not pre menopausal why no periods i think i would go to another doctor a specialist and have some hormonal work ups done something is just not adding up here it could be ovarian cysts caused by meds but i would have some more tests done if you were menopausal honey you'd know it lol i have been going through it for five year and it's a bitch god bless  Endometriosis Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Menopause Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Fertility awareness Endometrial cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Acne Ovarian cyst Breast cancer In vitro fertilisation Cervical cancer Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Breastfeeding Medicine The Two Doctors It's All Gone Pete Tong Osteoporosis Lupus erythematosus Post Polio syndrome Traumatic brain injury Transsexuality Germaine Greer Amenorrhoea Anxiety Malaria Migraine B3ta Dysmenorrhea Publicly funded medicine Diabetes mellitus Rabies Orgasm Infertility Gonorrhoea Puberty Obstetrics Growth hormone treatment Ovary Oral contraceptive Folic acid Pap smear Ovulation Hip hop rivalries Ulcerative colitis Bipolar disorder Hormone replacement therapy Rei Ayanami Clinical depression Stroke Tuberculosis Identity Crisis (comics) Hypoglycemia Drug test First aid Pregnancy Aspirin Gynaecology Hysterectomy Hyperprolactinaemia Alcoholism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

how long does it take the depo shot to take away your period i had depo shots and i still kinda had a period while i was on the shot but a couple days after i was scheduled to get my rd injection in which i missed my periods just went away does this mean im preg or my periods just went away bcuz of the shot periods can be delayed by taking the shot as well because you have had two shots already your period should be gone by now but breakthrough bleeding or spotting can occur because of being late with the shot i would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say  John F.

painful urination okay about a week and a half ago i got a bladder infection i was out of state but the people i stayed with were pharmacists so they gave me three days worth of antibiotics along with some over the counter and prescription pain meds it cleared up but came back not as strong a couple days later i was back home so i found some antibiotics two days worth and took them that was like days ago i went to my docter and she said my urine looked perfect meaning the infection had cleared however i still have pain when urinating i am allergic to some families of antibiotics they give me yeast infections and i'm not sure if the antibiotic the people i stayed with was in those families or not is it possible that i have a yeast infection from the antibiotics and that's why the pain hasn't gone away also it's not an std i've been checked i have protected sex a long term monogamous relationship i'm not sure if the antibiotic the people i stayed with gave me was in those families sorry i forgot half that sentence it is probably a yeast infection this could cause pain while urinating if it has gotten to your urethra it is not wise to take antibiotics when they are not prescribed because not all antibiotics work on all bacteria this is why they say that many diseases are now harder to cure because they gain resistance to the antibiotics it could be bad if this happens because then the doctor would have to give you stronger doses of antibiotics go and have your doctor check for a yeast infection i have a feeling that is what it is from your description  Gonorrhoea Psoriasis Common cold Cystoscopy Cephalexin Antibiotic Sexually-transmitted infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Candidiasis Medical analysis of circumcision Penicillin Medical prescription Group A streptococcal infection Urinary tract infection Endocarditis Helicobacter pylori Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acne Hepatitis Urine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tuberculosis Antibiotic resistance Medicine Legionellosis Herpes simplex virus Prostatitis Conjunctivitis Lymphogranuloma venereum Folic acid Clostridium difficile Pelvic inflammatory disease Schistosomiasis Aspergillosis Guinea pig Reiter's syndrome Infectious disease Eczema Vulvovaginal health Iatrogenic Anthrax Cellulitis Stomach cancer Ciprofloxacin Oral sex Methamphetamine Urethra Leptospirosis AIDS Dialysis HIV vaccine Allergy Traumatic brain injury Bubonic plague Streptococcus pneumoniae Urinary system Syphilis Mouth ulcer Rabies Upper respiratory tract infection Vancomycin Menstrual cycle Athlete's foot Chlorpromazine Miscarriage Lupus erythematosus Chlamydia Epididymitis IgA nephropathy Phage Oral contraceptive Homeopathy Pharmacist History of cancer chemotherapy Hepatitis C Paracetamol Fecal incontinence Peptic ulcer First aid Isotretinoin Otitis media Traditional Chinese medicine Clomipramine Cystic fibrosis

girls only i'm trying to see if i can get a lot of answers please help i have a few questions that i have been wondering about lately i was wondering if anyone here has asked their doctors about using tampons before they started using them i was also wondering how you asked if you did and what their response was also did the doctor try to make it as comfortable as they could and how embarrassing was it after you said it also how did you bring yourself to ask if you haven't asked what are some ways that i could ask my pediatrician i have a female doctor i trust her and all but i am just to nervous to ask about tampons but i want to hear what she has to say i have no one else to talk to about this and i do not want to just try them before i talk to my doctor i have tried several time to ask but i chicken out i know that every girl has to deal with period but i still find it so embarrassing what can i do i play a lot of sports and am very active so i really wanna switch i didn't have anyone to ask either i'm now everything i learned about anything came from reading the pamphlet lol even to this day my mom tunes out any sort of talk i have an yr old sister that got a yeast infection and my mom called me at work i told her there was medicine in the cabinet so my mom sent my little sister up to my older sister house so she could explain it to her hun don't be ashamed or scared you're doctor knows you and how to talk to you if you can get to the doctors office then just tell her what you said here i would like to try to use tampons but i would like for you to explain how they work any risks and how to use them or what you can do is make the appointment and when they nurse asks what for tell her you want your doc to explain tampons you know what might be easier if you have a girlfriend that can make that call for ya that way you don't have to feel embarrassed by talking to the nurse and when you get to the doctors office she will already be prepared and you won't have to initiate anything good luck  The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

another question for the ladies ok so yesterday i asked how many times a day women think about sex i got the answer to that but lots of the answers said that you think about it more when you are having your periods so is there a reason for that i have always had the impression that sex was one of the last things that would be on your mind during that time so i'm wrong couple of things first the wow factor goes to calyxt and second of course im a virgin i'm not desperate enough for a hooker and if i had a girlfriend i would just ask her thanks for quick responses too for myself the urge is so intense one day before my period that there are nail marks in the ceiling and yes it's all about hormones having sex during your period is an extremely bad idea girls especially if you have endometriosis or have a strong family hx of it there have been multiple studies that have shown that blood and menstruum can get pushed out of your uterus and back up and out the fallopian tubes and into the abdominal cavity that blood and tissue is hormonally highly active and can form masses and adhesions all over your abdominal organs not a good idea at all ladies menstruation is a time when things are coming out nothing should be going in but a tampon or a sea sponge i don't know many women who want to get f ked when they're in their moons but i know plenty of them who are as randy as goats just before and right after i will say also from personal experience that having an orgasm or really helps w both menstrual cramps and massively shortening the duration of my moon makes it get over much faster  Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Puberty Orgasm Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Tampon Dysmenorrhea Sexual intercourse Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Intersexuality Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Abortion Gynaecology Miscarriage Infertility Sexual orientation Endometrial cancer Sexual differentiation Sexual reproduction Anal sex Human sexuality In vitro fertilisation Endometrium Time Out of Mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Gynecologic hemorrhage Cancer Peritoneum Endocrinology Weight training Cramp Religion and sexuality Sanitary towel Borderline personality disorder Breast Gender role Sterilization (surgical procedure) Traumatic brain injury Emergency contraception Estrus cycle Little Britain Childbirth Uterus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human Oral sex Hormone Hypoglycemia Growth hormone treatment Polycystic ovary syndrome Twin Theory of conduct Equine conformation Breastfeeding Sleep Feminism Hysterectomy Hormone replacement therapy Signal transduction Abortion debate Homosexuality and transgender Human sexual response cycle Serial killer Cervix Mesothelioma Swyer syndrome Insulin Anorexia nervosa Human height Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Bondage (BDSM) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Glucocorticoid Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Acne Human sexual behavior Antidiuretic hormone Sadism and masochism Babe Ruth Sexual dysfunction Marriage Gender identity Avenue Q

preggers or no ok i need help i had sex weeks ago took the plan b pill and i got my period nine days later i should have had it again a week ago is it possible that i can be pregnant or can the pill just screw up youy cycle if you have sex you can get pregnant if you have not had sex since your last period than you can't be pregnant but if you have of course you may be pregnant the plan b pill may or may not have affected your cycle my advice would be to get a pregnancy test at the store better yet get a pack of three if it is negative meaning you aren't pregnant and you still don't get your period within a few days take another test because pregnancies don't always show up the day you miss your period also pregnancy tests are most accurate if you pee on them first thing in the morning when any potential pregnancy related hormones are most concentrated in your urine if you are pregnant set up an appointment with a doctor if you aren't maybe it is time to approach sex responsibly use birth control or don't have sex babies cost more than birth control  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Birth control Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Emergency contraception Gonorrhoea Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Neighbours Breastfeeding Pregnancy test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Morning sickness Abortion Prostate cancer Teenage pregnancy Turner syndrome Sex education Folic acid Friends Sexual intercourse Human chorionic gonadotropin Depo Provera Sex assignment Guinea pig Progesterone Roe v.

how to predict ovulation my cycle is days with a day luteal phase i heard that ovulation takes place mid cycle so does that mean i should expect ovulation to occur days after my last period i noticed cervical mucus around the begining of this month which ended on august th also is it even possible to get pregnant a day after ovulation ends thank you my bf and i were fooling around no intercourse on the th after my fertile days so there is no possibility that if by a slim chance sperm did get in i cant get pregnant right i also as of today felt a little wetness in my underwear and there was some white material near the opening so does that mean the egg wasnt fertilized here is what you do from the first day of your period count to the th day if you are trying to get pregnant have sex on the th day and the th day and that will increase your chances since it is never really accurate when you will ovulate unless you use a thermometer remember if you have sex every day that will actually decrease your chances of getting pregnant you should always skip a day or two also as a side note a few days after i ovulate i also get a mucus discharge for me but not sure for you it is an indication that my egg was not fertilized it all depends on the consistency of your mucus but you will definitely get a mucus discharge after you ovulate don't listen to the midwife who said to have sex on and th day she is wrong look here where it says take control this is one of many websites that tell you not to have sex daily because the sperm need time to regenerate http www whattoexpect com pregnancy ask heidi week conception chances aspx  Oral contraceptive Birth control Infertility In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Progesterone Abortion debate Twin Niddah Estrus cycle Sexual abstinence Sexual reproduction Cystic fibrosis Ovarian cyst Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gonorrhoea Fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Flowering plant Orgasm Maya calendar Obstetrics Abortion Pelvic inflammatory disease Ovary Childbirth Pregnancy test Sexual intercourse Endometriosis Ovum History of sex Stomach cancer Meiosis Female reproductive system (human) Cervix Prostate cancer Action potential Social rule Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Mucus Parthenogenesis Ectopic pregnancy Condom Oral sex Tsetse fly Human chorionic gonadotropin Child sexuality Health issues and the effects of cannabis Temperature Semen Heart sounds Multiple birth Month Spider Stem cell Human sexual behavior Full moon cycle Teenage pregnancy Estradiol Mount Pinatubo Methotrexate Spina bifida Moss Psoriasis Old wives' tale Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Herpes simplex virus Chimera (genetics) Year Strap-on dildo Ovarian cancer Premature birth Folic acid Sex assignment 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Julian day HIV Carpel Urinary incontinence Turner syndrome Solar variation Ploidy Conifer cones Isotretinoin Endometrial cancer Blackjack Safe sex Cryptorchidism Sea level rise Jam (TV series)

new birth control or anti depressent okay i've been taking ortho tri cyclen for years now and just recently within the last months i've been really depressed it's almost an empty feeling like i have no feeling not really happy or sad just nothing feelings come and go i do have some feelings i can cry at just about anything a majority of the time i'm just empty everything in my life is great should i think about trying a different kind of bc ortho tri cyclen is the only kind i've been on or should i go talk to the doctor about anti depressents i think that if you have been on ortho tri cyclen for years and you're just now experiencing symptoms of depression it's probably from something totally unrelated however i am on ortho tri cyclen lo which is the low dose version that is still just as effective but contains less progesterone and it seems to ease my mild pms symptoms like mood swings and rage that i used to experience more when i was on the regular ortho tri cyclen i have heard that birth control pills can suddenly just cause side effects they never caused before like i once started to experience a noticeably lower sex drive with a pill i'd been taking for about years nowadays i just switch them up every or years it seems to work try switching your pill first and if that doesn't help you might need some anti depressants  Oral contraceptive Bipolar disorder Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antidepressant Borderline personality disorder Birth control Endometriosis Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Maprotiline Hypoglycemia Methamphetamine Seasonal affective disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Migraine Premenstrual stress syndrome Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fluoxetine Psoriasis Haloperidol Bupropion Chlorpromazine Breastfeeding Psychosis Childbirth Diazepam Transsexuality Postpartum depression Isotretinoin Coffee Depo Provera Tocopherol Tris Speaker Antiretroviral drug Caffeine Sedative Ty Cobb Opioid Antipsychotic Taxi Driver Adult attention-deficit disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Post-traumatic stress disorder Anxiety Obstetrics Cannabis (drug) Hypertension Narcolepsy Progesterone Abortion debate Anorexia nervosa Addiction Placebo Homeopathy St John's wort Traumatic brain injury Spina bifida Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Babe Ruth Schizophrenia Malaria Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Atherosclerosis Asthma Progesterone only pill Kender Empathy Herpes simplex virus Withdrawal Radiation poisoning Osteoarthritis Happiness Narcissism Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Hyperthermia Inflation Buprenorphine Sleep Traumatic incident reduction Fibromyalgia Doxepin Alzheimer's disease Pitaten LSD Breast cancer Kodocha Human adaptation to space Propranolol Psychopharmacology Puberty Electroconvulsive therapy

period days late not pregnant i've asked a similar question before but i'm concerned since all my preg tests have come back negative that i may have a problem such as polycystic ovarian syndrome or something like that has anyone had anything similar that could give me some light on this i'm scheduled to see the dr next week but need to ease my mind until then your period can be late without you being pregnant i was days late and took at home tests that came up negative then i went to a doctor and that test came up negative too and even after all that i still didn't get my period that month then one day bam the little bugger showed up seriously see your doctor just to ease your mind but if you're not pregnant i doubt there's anything to worry about stress and changes can cause it to be late too  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Infertility Breastfeeding Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyperprolactinaemia Coeliac disease Abortion Drug test Amenorrhoea Clinical depression Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Chronic fatigue syndrome Endometrial cancer Stomach cancer Prostate cancer EastEnders The Contender (television series) HIV test Ovarian cancer Soap opera Autism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral contraceptive Insomnia Obstetrics Social rule Jam (TV series) Leon White Ben Johnson (athlete) Anovulation Migraine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cult Game programming Ovary Boom Town (Doctor Who) Stress (medicine) Slow Train Coming Endometriosis Sharon Tate Singlish Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Prenatal diagnosis Welding Childbirth God Emperor of Dune Super Size Me Obesity Urinary incontinence Bipolar disorder Sleep Days of our Lives Diabetes mellitus Gender role Apollo 8 Jeopardy!

embarrassing question i've been wanting to ask for years now with the anonmity of the internet i can ladies does your rectum hurt right around the time of menstration when you have a bm does it feel like it's swollen or something hurts when pushing this is how i know my period is coming when i get that pain any body else thanks i haven't had any children i don't think it's hemoroids doesn't burn or anything just sore been happening as long as i can remember and it's not just when i go it's off and on all day for a couple days i'm not worried about it like i said it's always happened i was just curious if other women had it too hey fizzygirl i've been told i have a tilted uterus too i wonder if that's it see i'm glad i asked wow me yikes i'll definatley mention it to my doctor thank for taking the time to answer dear kazy not only am i a doctor but a woman as well and i am was in the same position you are in let me briefly explain as you know the inner layer of our uterus called endometrium swells up every month in preparation of receiving a baby wether it comes or not this swelling is primarily made of a huge bunch of tiny blood vessels that permeate the area in the hope of nurturing the baby with the oxygen nutrients it may need when a baby doesn't come this lining is not needed anymore and is discarded as menstruation in some cases this lining is not completely pushed out through the vagina where does it go then as the uterus pushes or contracts to get it all out some of it may flow back and out through the fallopian tubes that's out of the uterus and into the abdominal cavity where our intestines lie the problem is that these tiny parts of endometrium are left floating around in our abdomen and may end up planting themselves to the sides of intestines ovaries and as you've been suspecting the rectum when menstruation approaches every month these tiny endometrium plantations are induced by hormones into sweeling up in the same way as the normal endometrium cells inside the uterus do this swelling may compress the rectum and cause a pain similar to the one you're feeling now some patients complain of not being able to sit comfortably or of needing to sit crossing a leg and supporting themselves on a side others nearly scream with pain during bowel movements in the bathroom i hope this is not your case and so forth the condition i am referring to is called endometriosis endo for short it is not clear why some women get this nor is it clear why some who are clearly covered with endometrium implants suffer no pain while some who have very few ones can't stand to get out of bed a definitive diagnosis is reached through direct visualization of the implants and treatment involves several factors wether you stand the pain or not and wether you wish to remain fertile or not both getting pregnant and reaching menopause stops your menses so that diminishes the swelling and stops the pain this is why some doctors treat the condition with hormones that resemble either of these states another more definitive option is surgery to get rid of the little implantations i truly recommend you talk to your doctor about this since in the long run endo may be a cause of infertility if ovaries or fallopian tubes are involved and or unbearable pain  Endometrium Ectopic pregnancy Intersex surgery Radiation therapy Fecal incontinence Ovulation Sexual reproduction Cancer Intersexuality Menstrual cup Childbirth Uterus Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Gonorrhoea Coeliac disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Miscarriage Ovary Traumatic brain injury Colorectal cancer Gynaecology Mesothelioma Sexual intercourse Breech birth Abortion Fertilisation Autoimmune diseases Professional wrestling holds Cryptorchidism Birth control Medicine Diarrhea Acne Polycystic ovary syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Amenorrhoea Folic acid Stroke Peritoneum Multiple sclerosis Oral contraceptive Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Jam (TV series) Pneumonia Carpal tunnel syndrome Spina bifida Breast cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Equine conformation Hemorrhoid Pelvic inflammatory disease Female reproductive system (human) Aortic dissection Gastroparesis Prolactinoma Kidney The Shining (film) Hip fracture Drowning Diabetes mellitus The Inside Anal sex Dialysis Sex assignment Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Hirschsprung's disease Turner syndrome Adjustable gastric band Group A streptococcal infection Obesity Fistula Fetal development Atherosclerosis Syringomyelia Growth hormone treatment

in english without copying and pasting a bunch of crap can someone explain thanks i want to know risks causes symptoms etc oops polycystic ovarian disease thats what i want explained to me alternative names polycystic ovaries polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos stein leventhal syndrome polyfollicular ovarian disease definition return to top polycystic ovary disease is characterized by enlarged ovaries with multiple small cysts an abnormally high number of follicles at various states of maturation and a thick scarred capsule surrounding each ovary the syndrome was originally reported by stein and leventhal in when they described a group of women with amenorrhea absence of menstrual period infertility hirsutism unwanted hair growth in women and enlarged polycystic ovaries today it is known that those with polycystic ovaries may have some but not necessarily all of the classic symptoms included in stein leventhal syndrome causes incidence and risk factors polycystic ovary disease is an endocrine disorder which means normal hormone cycles are interrupted hormones direct many functions throughout the body for example hormones regulate reproductive functions including the normal development of eggs in the ovaries it is not completely understood why or how hormone cycles are interrupted although there are several working theories in polycystic ovary disease under developed follicles accumulate in the ovaries follicles are sacs within the ovaries that contain eggs the eggs in these follicles do not mature and therefore cannot be released from the ovaries instead they accumulate as cysts in the ovary this can contribute to infertility the lack of follicle maturation and the inability to ovulate are likely caused by low levels of follicle stimulating hormone fsh and higher than normal levels of androgens male hormones produced in the ovary insulin resistance also seems to be a key feature in polycystic ovarian syndrome in addition to other hormones insulin helps regulate ovarian function when someone is insulin resistant this means that cells throughout the body do not readily respond to the insulin circulating in the blood for this reason the amount of insulin remains high in the blood hyperinsulinemia high levels of insulin can contribute to lack of ovulation high androgen levels infertility and early pregnancy loss polycystic ovaries are two to five times larger than normal ovaries and they have a white thick tough outer covering women are usually diagnosed when in their s or s many women with polycystic ovary disease have irregular periods and may have very little menstruation oligomenorrhea or no period at all amenorrhea women diagnosed with this disorder frequently have a mother or sister with similar symptoms commonly associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos conception is often possible with proper surgical or medical treatments following conception pregnancy is usually uneventful symptoms if you have polycystic ovary disease you are likely to experience some of the following symptoms abnormal irregular or scanty very light or infrequent menstrual periods absent periods usually but not always after having one or more normal menstrual periods during puberty secondary amenorrhea weight gain even obesity insulin resistance and diabetes infertility increased hair growth distribution of body hair may be in a male pattern virilization development of male sex characteristics in a female this may include an increase in body hair facial hair a deepening of the voice male pattern baldness and clitoral enlargement decreased breast size aggravation of acne  Anovulation Anemia Renal cell carcinoma Multiple sclerosis Milk Estradiol Prolactinoma Autism Adrenarche Birth weight Pneumonia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Swyer syndrome Breast cancer Chlorpromazine Glucokinase

question about pamprin i took some pamprin this morning around am for period cramps well at around am my stomach starts to hurt and i have had several bowel movements not diarhhea but softer than normal since then i was wondering if the diuretics in pamprin could make you loose water through bowel movements as well as through urinating i know that diuretics can make you pee a lot but can it do the same thing with bowel movements as well a diuretic will not soften your stools it acts specifically upon your urinary system i am not sure about pamprin having a diuretic though if you have your period you may have starting to release some of the water held during the hours before your period started causing increased urination also sometimes during your periods there is a bit of over stimulation of your large intestine that may result in stool softening i do not know exactly how that occurs but it may be related to tiny uterine contractions normal with a regular period that cause the cramps on the other hand there is also the possibility that the medication was a bit harsh on your stomach and you are feeling the effects of that  Fecal incontinence Laxative Irritable bowel syndrome Endometriosis Diarrhea Urinary system Diuretic Ulcerative colitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urine Vomiting Endometrial cancer Urination Constipation Colorectal cancer Menstrual cycle Coeliac disease Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome First aid Hemorrhoid Dietary fiber Escherichia coli O157:H7 Penis Diverticulosis Breastfeeding Cancer Schistosomiasis Hypoglycemia Dehydration Gastroparesis Muscle Ovarian cancer Yarrow Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux disease Diabetes insipidus Mattress Vitamin C Paracetamol Puberty Reflexology 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Premature birth Glucocorticoid Autoimmune diseases Loop diuretic Hypomagnesemia Indomethacin Shock Cramp Gastrointestinal tract Short bowel syndrome Flatulence Ben Johnson (athlete) Pregnancy Lactose intolerance Drill bit Atherosclerosis Hirschsprung's disease Enema LSD Stomach Pharmacology Kidney Hernia Acupuncture Erection Ginger Bowel obstruction Childbirth Opioid Pneumonia Gout Caffeine Clostridium difficile Rabies Cirrhosis Althaea (genus) Acromegaly Hypertension Intersex surgery Drowning Motility Allergy Human feces Insulin Crohn's disease Dialysis Glucokinase Adderall Infantilism Acute renal failure Chlorpromazine Wood Cystic fibrosis

im going to be my mom wont let me use tampons im going to be sixteen and i play ice hockey so pads are the most uncomfortable thing to play with as if i didnt have enough pads on already my mom thinks that only women that lose there virginty should use them and because she doesnt like em she thinks i wont how do i get her to let me use them well sweetie this could be a really tough situation not tough as far as actually using tampons that part is pretty easy what may be tough is doing something that seems so clearly against your mother's wishes i don't know you or your mom or your religion beliefs so i'm kind of flying blind here it is clear that she cares for you and she may be concerned about how losing your virginity can change you emotionally and mentally as well as physically for every woman i have ever spoken to about this losing her virginity to a partner was painful and scary and was not at all what they had pictured their first time would be like tampon use on the other hand was generally not painful and scary for them and they had an instruction sheet to read beforehand some women consider losing your virginity to mean the first time they have intercourse penetration with a sexual partner human or vibrator therefore this would not mean that using tampons equals losing virginity but as i said before i don't know your family's religion or beliefs religion and beliefs are important foundations but can sometimes also be the shackles that bind us to obsolete ways please know that i am not judging you or your mom or your family's beliefs i do want to give you as much information as possible then you get to think for and choose for yourself also don't take my word for anything do your own research ask friends that you trust look up the facts be informed so with all that said here's what i want to share with you from the physical physiological standpoint some young women have a hymen the hymen is a thin membrane that covers the vaginal opening however not all women have or ever had a hymen it has been mistakenly thought for many many years that if the hymen is intact the woman is a virgin however very often as a young woman gets older the hymen recedes on its own it can also be torn by physical activity so having a hymen or not having one is truly not a reliable indicator of virginity in centuries past young women were inspected before marriage by female family members and often the groom's mother too can you imagine to make sure the hymen was intact thereby ensuring that the family's investment in the young woman was a good idea imagine if that young woman happened to never have had a hymen what a scene keep in mind that in that age women were usually married before the age of because people often did not live past the age of and women had to bear families quickly it's unfortunate that many people religions etc today still place so high a value on a woman's virginity when it is an ancient standard for the business arrangement marriages were that no longer applies there is also a practical side to your question that is undeniable pads are bulky sticky i hate when the adhesive gets stuck to my hair ouch and sometimes messy i discovered tampons when i was i was miserable because i badly wanted to go swimming but was on my period my girlfriend suggested tampons and i truthfully didn't ask my mom i just tried it because there was a box in the cupboard mom and i never really talked about such things there were instructions in the box and i felt desperate i clearly made the choice on my own to try them and i've used tampons ever since and never regretted it for you though i recommend a different approach here's what i suggest but please trust your instincts and do what you think is right do online research about tampons and the consequences of using them read all the warnings do not be offhand about inserting something into your body if you are religious look for sites that include information and opinions from a trusted source in your religion e g a reputable church community leader or discussion group maybe do your research at a friend's house so your mom doesn't catch you trying to inform yourself and get all twisted up about it your call on that armed with information sit down with your mom and tell her what you want to do and why let her know that you are thinking of it strictly in terms of hygiene and practicality be gentle with her imagine if you had a daughter talking to you about this she may be afraid that you'll suddenly be wanting and or having indiscriminate sex because you want to use tampons by the way tampons are nowhere near the size of an erect penis unless that penis is very very small also be mature about it don't throw a fit if she doesn't agree to your wishes just say that you need time to think about what she said and go do something else you can then choose whether to talk to her again or make a different choice perhaps you then talk with a trusted adult friend instead ultimately what you do with your body and the choices you make are solely up to you but for now the rules are hers since you are a minor and you are living under her roof you also owe her respect for years of providing for you and raising you the best she knows how if you do make the leap to using tampons give yourself plenty of time to practice you may need to try more than once before the tampon feels comfortable you will need to be patient with yourself especially if this is the first kind of exploration you've done 'down there' i highly recommend you read the instructions that are usually included in the box i'm totally serious the instructions are quite helpful and also very informative also for a beginning tampon user i'd recommend regular or slender sizes do not try supers to start you may also need to wear a panty liner very thin pad as backup especially since you'll be playing a very active sport so there may be some leakage tampons should never ever plug the vagina that can be very uncomfortable and may also increase the risk of toxic shock syndrome again read the instruction sheet to learn more i hope this was helpful on as many levels as possible best wishes let me know how you do kickboxgrrl yahoo com  Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sanitary towel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual abstinence Sexual orientation

girls only pleasee this is personal ok i'm and i have a menstral problem everytime i get it it always over flows it's like no pad is thick enough for me it's embarassing especially at school because everytime i get it i stain myself at least times and the worst of it is that it lasts for days which isn't normal i went to the docters but my dr only said that periods are always abnormal in the st years so what i wanna know is if anyone knows of any kind of pill or medication that could help me i never know when my period will come it comes once a month but it's different each time the normal cycle runs from days which can explain why it doesn't come on exactly the same day every month as for the issue of pads try getting the kind of pads that are for overnight to see if that helps always is a good brand to use not only because they have product lines for each kind of period but they are comfortable to use one of their product lines is for overnight as far as medications to ease periods there's the birth control pill but you would need to have your mom's permission to do it because you are concerned about your periods talk to your mom about getting another opinion if it's been more than years since you have had your period start this should be evaluated by another doctor such as a gynecologist to see if they can help you to figure out what's going on in the mean time you can also try upping your iron levels during this time by eating things like spinach raisins and peanut butter if not allergic to peanuts of course but please for sure definitely discuss this issue with your mom  Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Folic acid Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Peanut butter Emergency contraception Abortion debate Veganism Crohn's disease Apollo 8 Life insurance Stomach cancer Bipolar disorder Ben Johnson (athlete) Obstetrics Physician Fertility awareness Pregnancy Endometriosis Infantilism Kodocha Sanitary towel Microeconomics Garfield Childbirth Acne Hypokalemia Milton H.

mini pill question no period perfect use i have been using the mini pill for months i take it at the exact same time everyday i had a little bleeding the first pack but i haven't bled since i've taken a few pregnancy test but i'm not pregnant every month i feel as if i'm going to start but i never do i read this a fairly normal to miss periods but after how long without a period should i see a doctor normally if you hadn't just started a new hormonal birth control it would be recommended to call your doctor after two missed periods however three months is the time it takes for your body to fully adjust to a new hormonal birth control method so i think you've waited the appropriate time to start asking questions since it's been a full three months you should probably talk to your doctor about this side effect and whether you should switch birth control methods  Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Endometriosis Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Birth control Miscarriage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Depo Provera Childbirth Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Psoriasis Obstetrics Coeliac disease Guinea pig Folic acid Hypertension Sulfasalazine In vitro fertilisation Acne Cancer Abortion debate Spina bifida Prolactinoma Abortion Puberty Carpal tunnel syndrome Turner syndrome Breech birth EastEnders Progesterone Hypoglycemia Transsexuality Baldness treatments Ben Johnson (athlete) Gonorrhoea Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetes mellitus Maprotiline Growth hormone deficiency Insulin Intrauterine device Friends Chronic fatigue syndrome Glycogen storage disease type I CPU cache Carburetor Anemia Ectopic pregnancy Postpartum depression Growth hormone treatment Breast cancer Spacecraft propulsion Ovarian cyst Pregnancy test Chemical abortion Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sharon Tate Homosexuality and transgender Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Malaria Sleeping Murder Clinical depression Neighbours Fecal incontinence Migraine Vitamin D Vaginal bleeding Diabetic retinopathy Legal aspects of transsexualism Twin Phoebe Halliwell Intact dilation and extraction Sexual abstinence Milton H.

understanding abortion how does one wrap their mind around this concept i have looked at pictures of aborted babies seen what is done to them i can see it going on before the baby is actually fully formed but how can this go on when the baby is fully formed how can the doctor do this and feel nothing how can they do it day after day for that matter what about the nurses who witness these abortions how do they live with it the pics i have seen broght me to tears instantly yet they do this daily i'm really not trying to judge i just simply don't understand anyone out there work in these clinics how do you live with yourself seeing this go on daily how do you get past it i have judges others then i have tried to be compassionate and give helpful info but it is so difficult to do when you have seen such horrific pictures and i do realize that it has to be done to save a mothers life rape incest it's still tough not to judge i find myslf getting more and more upset so i will no longer read or answer questions about abortion form this point on i need to keep my sanity how do you live with yourself seeing this go on daily ok it sounds like i am judging but this isn't how i meant it let me word it differently how do you deal with this line of work on a daily basis sometimes people have to make hard decisions it is important to try to have compassion i could never abort but then again i have never been pregnant as a result of rape or incest i have never been and pregnant either it's tough but it's important to try not to judge although it's hard for me not to judge with doctors they do what they have to do if the mother is going to die as a result of carrying to full term who do you sacrifice the mother or a baby who probably won't make it anyway with a teenager they might so something rash like overdose on pills to try to make them abort or try to injure themselves i had a friend commit suicide in high school because she got pregnant and was too afraid to tell her parents that's two lives wasted she shot herself in the stomach by the way it took her hours to die and she died alone with no help until it was way too late i know it's awful it's hard to see it's a terrible choice to make but there are times in our lives where we come up against very difficult choices sometimes the only option is the most difficult of all  Abortion debate Abortion EastEnders Pregnancy Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Days of our Lives Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Kodocha Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Religion and abortion Stomach cancer Boston Public Miscarriage Pro-choice Abortion in Canada Jam (TV series) Mother Teresa Charmed Emergency contraception Humphrey Bogart A Course In Miracles Oral contraceptive Coming of Age (TNG episode) Marilyn Monroe History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Partial-birth abortion One Tree Hill (TV series) Polyamory Traumatic incident reduction Friends Alignment (role-playing games) Jon Secada Incarnations of Immortality The nature of God in Western theology Serial killer Drawn Together Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist YuYu Hakusho Ten Commandments Mid-Autumn Festival Terri Schiavo Fathers' rights Psychiatric hospital Neighbours Past teachings of Prem Rawat Prostate cancer Prenatal diagnosis Controversies in autism The O.C.

period is longer than usual after endoscopy i had an endoscopy done about a week ago i found out i have an ulcer i got my period tuesday and its now friday and i still have it i always get my period on a wednesday and its over by thursday night thanks to my birth control im going on vacation next week and i dont want to have my period then is this normal i think it might just be that you were stressed by the findings of the endoscopy also if the doctors have given you medicines for your ulcer this might be interacting with your bcps and causing your period to be a bit longer than you're used to either way i would venture to guess that your period will most likely stop within the first or days of your active pills so just bring some protection with you just in case and have fun on your trip there are worse things in the world than a period on your vacation believe me  Coeliac disease Helicobacter pylori Peptic ulcer Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ulcerative colitis Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Tuesday Urinary incontinence Wednesday Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Liturgical year Good Friday Thursday Hurricane Katrina timeline Lent Stomach cancer Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Holiday Holy Week Menstrual cycle EastEnders Lynbrook High School Gregorian calendar Calculating the day of the week WWE Friday Night SmackDown!

can you have your period and still be pregnant i know its possible because two of my friends have been pregnant while taking birth control they took the entire pack one month period and all and then the next month when they started taking the inactive pills they started having morning sickness anyway the reason why im asking is cuz i was seeing a guy who would ejaculate inside of me whenever we had sex because i was on birth control we've had sex like times probably now im back with my boyfriend and im kind of scared cuz we've had sex too and now i've been thinking im pergnant im taking loestrin and there's only inactive pills instead of the ususal so my period only lasts days but it wasnt heavy at all i've looked up online that you can have periods while pregnant sometimes for up to months i want to know if birth control has a factor in this or i just want to hear stories about others having periods while pregnant or getting pregnant on birth control sorry its so long its detailed stop sleeping around i have a boyfriend and no so stop answering questions if you're not gonna give insightful information which i doubt you even could and wasting your time my wife had her period two times after she got pregnant my advise is go to your doctor to see if you are pregnant my wife was on yasmin before we tried for a baby and is back on it now that we had one it's a very good birth control  Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness Friends Jon Secada Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Birth control Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Kodocha Avenue Q Sex and the City Urinary incontinence Trainspotting (novel) Oral sex Emergency contraception Apollo 8 Charmed Masturbation Alois Hitler Childbirth Jam (TV series) The Inside Sin City Puberty Sleeping Murder Psoriasis History of sex Boston Public Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Folic acid Phoebe Halliwell Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind One Life to Live StarCraft: Uprising Kurt Cobain Ocean's Twelve Obstetrics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Days of our Lives Melanie Wilkes Premature ejaculation Mary, the mother of Jesus The League of Gentlemen (comedy) The Time Machine Tocopherol The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Lauren Bacall Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sharon Tate Strap-on dildo Miscarriage Endometriosis Prostate cancer Soap opera Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule In vitro fertilisation History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Katelyn Faber Sexual intercourse Blood on the Tracks Isotretinoin Anne Boleyn Menstrual cup Ginger Lynn Breastfeeding The Long Game Mid-Autumn Festival Characters of Lost Elvis Presley Guinea pig Blonde on Blonde Aliens of London Everwood Brave New World Pornographic movie The Parting of the Ways Eddie Guerrero Infantilism Babe Ruth's Called Shot Depo Provera Series finale Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pink (musician) Rei Ayanami Trouble (comic) Autism

i had unprotected sex the same day that i started antibiotic treatment before i started am i still protected i have heard many reports that antibiotics interfere with birth control pills so i'm looking for some advice on my situation this past wednesday i went to the doctor and was told that i had a uti and that i would need to use backup protection for the rest of this pill pack the thing is we came home around pm had sex around that afternoon then i took my birth control pill at my normal time pm then at that night i took my first dose of the antibiotics so i'm wondering am i at risk for pregnancy because we didn't use a condom on wednesday even though i took the antibiotics hours after my birth control pill the effectiveness of your birth control may have been lowered slightly by the antibiotics but it shouldn't have lowered it that much yes you should use a back up method of birth control when you're on a hormonal birth control and antibiotics but honestly i've been on antibiotics before and had sex without a back up method and been fine my advice to you is to just be sure to use a condom for the duration of the rest of your prescription of antibiotics and not to stress too much about that one time  Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Psoriasis Herpes simplex virus Urinary incontinence Medical analysis of circumcision Sex education Folic acid Childbirth Condom Antibiotic Isotretinoin Acne Gonorrhoea Common cold Tocopherol Endometriosis Atherosclerosis Safe sex AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Sexual abstinence Harm reduction Chemotherapy Hypoglycemia Pharmacology In vitro fertilisation Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Cancer Sexual intercourse Neighbours Turner syndrome Elvis and Me Cellulitis Pneumonia Dialysis Medical prescription Organic farming Clinical depression Coffee Clostridium difficile Diabetes mellitus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mercury Atlas 6 Veganism Diazepam Growth hormone treatment Hormone replacement therapy Anal sex Multiple sclerosis Abortion Intrauterine device Guinea pig Crystal methamphetamine and sex Allergy Pregnancy Vitamin C Lorazepam Paracetamol Insomnia Hearing impairment Medical cannabis Caffeine Cephalexin Rocky Mountain spotted fever Sedative Gastroparesis Nutrition Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Diaphragm (contraceptive) Premature birth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alzheimer's disease Apollo 8 Elvis Presley Insulin Avenue Q Syphilis Methamphetamine Sildenafil Chlorpromazine Spina bifida Abortion debate Sexual revolution Homosexuality and transgender Osteoarthritis Iatrogenic Migraine Diarrhea

why do women crave chocolate sweet food just before their periods i'm being serious when i ask this it's like having a choccie monster screaming at me until i eat some then i feel fine again until the next time does anyone else suffer from this why does it happen i know that chocolate has a feel good factor in it i'm not asking about that i would like to know why it happens every month why chocolate there are two schools of thought on why women crave chocolate at certain times of the month behavioral scientists believe that food cravings are the product of psychological processes and are basically a learned behavior biochemists on the other hand believe that some food cravings are caused by an imbalance in hormonal and chemical substances in the brain and nervous system with particular emphasis on serotonin in particular with chocolate acute monthly cravings among pre menstrual women may be partly explained by its rich magnesium content magnesium deficiency exacerbates pmt also before menstruation levels of the hormone progesterone are high progesterone promotes fat storage preventing its use as fuel elevated pre menstrual levels of progesterone may cause a periodic craving for fatty foods one study reported that of chocolate cravings associated with the menstrual cycle occurred between ovulation and the start of menstruation from personal experience i can tell you that i had intense chocolate cravings before my period five years ago i had to have a total hysterectomy including my ovaries after the hysterectomy i went on hormone replacement and have never had a chocolate craving since so while i can believe there is a psychological aspect to such cravings i have to believe there is a physiologic reason too  Puberty Endometriosis Nutrition Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Anorexia nervosa Ovulation Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Chocolate Addiction Polycystic ovary syndrome Bipolar disorder Estrus cycle Clinical depression Fertility awareness Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diabetes mellitus Birth control Pregnancy Chronic fatigue syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Insulin Hormone replacement therapy Endocrinology Brain Traumatic brain injury Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Glucocorticoid Post-traumatic stress disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Obesity Premenstrual stress syndrome Ovarian cyst Sexual abstinence Gender role Ovarian cancer Menstrual cup Hormone Migraine Psychology Biochemistry Edible salt Delayed puberty Vitamin C Sleep Veganism Breast cancer Ovary Orgasm Niddah Biology and sexual orientation Atkins Nutritional Approach In vitro fertilisation Growth hormone Dysmenorrhea Hysterectomy Dieting Amenorrhoea Human physiology Growth hormone treatment Aspartame Social psychology Medicine Sex Organic farming Serotonin Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Magnesium Glucokinase Food Transsexuality Anovulation Atherosclerosis Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Estradiol Caffeine Gynaecology Milk Human chorionic gonadotropin Stuttering Glycogen storage disease type I Borderline personality disorder Endometrial cancer Folic acid

girls only does sex hurt your first time please no joke answers or answers from guys who obviously don't know the answer does it hurt to have sex your first time or any time for that matter there can be pain when the hymen breaks upon penatration there can also be some blood for me there was no blood but a lot of pain so much so that we didn't even really get started the first time the hymen is the thin membrane that sometimes covers the opening to the vagina if you're a virgin i say sometimes because even if you haven't had sex the hymen can do a bit of a disappearing act due to an overzealous workout at the gym horseback riding tampons and even passionate heavy petting with your boyfriend it's not an impenetrable barrier anyway as it has holes to allow menstrual blood to escape when you're turned on the uterus and cervix rise lengthening the vaginal tube when his penis penetrates the walls of the vagina stretch to accommodate the difference for some the first few times might make you feel sore as it's been an unused muscle or even hurt if you aren't properly lubericated like the guy is in a hurry doesn't arouse you and your body isn't ready relaxing foreplay being fully aroused or better yet you having an orgasm first or using a lubricant like ky jelly or astro glide can help  Vagina Sexual intercourse Anal sex Strap-on dildo Human sexual response cycle Orgasm Oral sex Menstrual cycle Human sexual behavior Condom Virgin Masturbation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Birth control Cervix Puberty Safe sex Sexual arousal Sex toy Tampon Intersex surgery Human sexuality Sex organ Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Childbirth Massage Erogenous zone Child sexuality Social rule Female reproductive system (human) Sexual dysfunction Fertility awareness Pornographic movie Weight training Sexual differentiation Zoophilia Herbert Garrison Gonorrhoea Uterus Pedophilia Vaginal lubrication Fisting Sexual reproduction Penis EastEnders Fetal development Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends Diaphragm (contraceptive) Fecal incontinence Human penis size Drawn Together Deconstruction Dyspareunia Oral contraceptive Futurama (TV series - season 5) Miscarriage First aid Sex and the City Gynaecology Premature ejaculation Cramp Diving Endometriosis Humphrey Bogart Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breech birth Niddah Shaggy dog story Physical intimacy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Premature birth Rape Bondage (BDSM) Sin City Anorgasmia Anus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vibrator History of intersex surgery Joke Herpes simplex virus Kenny McCormick Female genital cutting Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

this is a pretty disgusting question for females why do us females have our periods where all that freaking blood stores where does it comes from i know the blood turns into placenta when pregnant but how da hell we are crazy creatures lol first of all the only solorose if you are real rn you would have the magic answer to this question dumb like i said serious answers only i'm not trying to be funny i did take a health class but it's been so many freaken' years that i forgot i'm not asking this question to be stupid or smart so if you don't have anything good to say in trying to help me out then skip this damn question ain't nobody telling you to answer it leave this question for the ones that would like to help the actual amount of blood in menstrual flow isn't as much as you might think about tablespoons mixed in with other things such as mucus uterine lining etc although some women are prone to anemia from unusually heavy flows generally the body can easily handle that amount of blood loss the blood that is in menstrual flow merely seeps into the uterine lining from the blood vessels that feed it it's purpose is to create a fertile bed for the implanted embryo when implantation does not occur the lining sloughs off we used to call it the tears of a disappointed uterus in nurses' training lol btw the blood does not turn into the placenta that is a process of cell development from the implanted embryo however the placenta is very vascular has a lot of vessels the female reproductive system is actually a very amazing thing  Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Obstetrics Childbirth Endometrium Pregnancy (mammals) Twin Endometriosis Emergency contraception Progesterone Sexual reproduction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stem cell Miscarriage Ovulation Birth control In vitro fertilisation Uterus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human cloning Oral contraceptive Circulatory system Puberty Abortion Flowering plant Endometrial cancer Mammalian embryogenesis Stroke Ectopic pregnancy Embryo transfer Infertility Fertilisation Humphrey Bogart Diabetes mellitus Breast Traumatic brain injury Xenomorph Urinary incontinence Human development Female reproductive system (human) Medicine Stomach cancer Turner syndrome Meiosis Placenta Vaginal bleeding Intersex surgery Ovarian cancer Fetus Menstrual cup Polycystic ovary syndrome Malaria Friends Blood vessel Brave New World Jennifer Lopez Fertility awareness EastEnders Habitual abortion Niddah Sexual intercourse Intrauterine device Atrial septal defect Fetal development Species Shaggy dog story Social rule Premature birth Folic acid Cancer Blood Caesarean section Hysterectomy Theory of conduct The Inside Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scientology beliefs and practices Placental abruption The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Red blood cell Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Vagina Russian joke Snake Penis enlargement Cephalic disorder Swyer syndrome Anemia Intersexuality Milton H.

thinking about having a mirena coil fitted i have been having problems with my current form of contaception depo vera injection due to continuous break through bleeding and my gp has suggested this type of coil what are the advantages disadvantages of it thanks well i ve done some reasearch because i want to got it too and the webpage says it is very similar to esterilization in terms of effectivity it has a very low dose of hormones so you have practically no side effects but the great side effect i saw testimonies of women with n period foe two years or very low discharge of blood qhen period i think it has no disadvantages forget about pills patches shots it looks like a great iud but i also found out the insertion is painful s it couldn t be perfect but women seem to be happy because it lasts for years the only uncomfortable thing is the insertion it seems the gyn measures your cervix in order to see if the iud will fit and that hurts some women say other thing is that till your body gets used to it you may have like days of cramps but you can use some analgesic for that i also found they recommend it for women that have had a child before because they re cervix is more open but if you have no child you can have it too but i guess the insertion must be more painful anyway i have a bad history in my family of brain stroke from my mom i have some spider vains and bad circulation so i found out it has no precaution on women like me with bad history so i guess it is the one for me as i cannot take hormones and it won t damage my body i think it is good as you know hormones are not good for your body unless you need them this is what i researched hope i helped and good luck d  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Intrauterine device Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tocopherol Insulin Emergency contraception Miscarriage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Migraine Childbirth Growth hormone deficiency Stroke Endometriosis Growth hormone treatment Obstetrics Breastfeeding Birth control Psoriasis Puberty Abortion Intravenous therapy Traumatic brain injury Menstrual cup Aspirin Multiple sclerosis Premature birth Gonorrhoea Ectopic pregnancy First aid Strap-on dildo Nutrition Chlorpromazine Chronic fatigue syndrome Breast cancer Acupuncture Transformer Stomach cancer Folic acid Cervix Malaria Blood pressure Paracetamol Polycystic ovary syndrome Dialysis Methamphetamine Tesla coil Pain Spider Drug abuse Analgesic Radiation therapy Herpes simplex virus Clinical depression Condom Tobacco smoking Atherosclerosis Electrophysiology Intact dilation and extraction Depo Provera Autoimmune diseases Ketamine Swimming Acne Mattress Local anesthesia Haloperidol Blood (computer game) Myocardial infarction Orgasm Medicine Gynaecology Turner syndrome Buprenorphine Diazepam Doxepin Brain Chemotherapy Animal testing Pregnancy Cervical cancer Intersex surgery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryptorchidism

why would woman get breast implants if over a year period women who got cosmetic breast implants were three times as likely to commit suicide as women who didn't according to a swedish study they were also three times as likely to die from alcohol or drug addiction this echoes other studies caveats some studies suggest women felt better about themselves after implants in this study there was no higher risk in the first years afterward but the risk was times higher after to years and six times higher after years http www slate com id besides guys aren't champaign glass size just perfect sometimes women who get breast implants are very depressed people and are trying to make themselves or others happy by improving their appearance they think that the reason they are unhappy is because their body is flawed and that nobody could possible love them the way they are when they find out that it isn't what is going to make them feel better they turn elsewhere like to alcohol and drugs or to suicide of course there are many women who get implants who do it just for vanity or for careers or for medical reasons not all do it because of depression or to make someone else happy depression is a disease and implants are just a temporary fix lots of plastic surgeons now do psych evaluations to make sure that the patient is doing it for the right reasons  Breast implant Clinical depression Bipolar disorder Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Plastic surgery Breast Divorce Obesity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Ovarian cancer Stroke Hearing impairment Menstrual cycle Antidepressant Addiction Breastfeeding Friends Folic acid Drug addiction Duesberg hypothesis Transsexuality Hypoglycemia Colorectal cancer Schizophrenia Mental illness Multiple sclerosis Intravenous therapy Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Clomipramine Radiation therapy Tocopherol Acne Adverse effect (medicine) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Stomach cancer Suicide Psoriasis Doxepin Intersex surgery Thimerosal Diazepam Haloperidol YuYu Hakusho Milk Psychosis Cannabis (drug) Medical analysis of circumcision Anorexia nervosa Alzheimer's disease Cytomegalovirus Arguments for and against drug prohibition Crohn's disease Body modification Post-traumatic stress disorder Parkinson's disease Mobile phone radiation and health Stem cell Chlorpromazine Domestic violence Endometriosis Drug abuse Breast reconstruction Oral contraceptive Hypnosis Dentistry Methamphetamine Kurt Cobain Ex-gay Chronic fatigue syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Hip fracture About a Boy Acupuncture Isotretinoin Maprotiline Human sexual behavior Alcoholics Anonymous Emergency contraception Computed tomography Pregnancy Cochlear implant Migraine Traumatic brain injury Homeopathy Trazodone Soul Bupropion

is it wise to exercise while on your period is working out beneficial especially if you're cramping i always exercise during my period mainly because when you exercise you release endorphins the body's natural painkiller this not only eases any cramping but can also relieve any mood swings depressions anxiety you may get during your monthlies secondly exercising takes my mind off the pain so i tend to forget its there as well as getting the bonus of an aerobic workout its best to try it to see how you find it but it certainly beats being doubled up on the sofa with a hot water bottle  Clinical depression Weight training Exercise Bipolar disorder Anxiety Premenstrual stress syndrome Cannabis (drug) Opioid Creatine Chronic fatigue syndrome Menstrual cycle Endorphin Cramp Self-harm Meditation Osteoarthritis Parkinson's disease First aid Withdrawal Drug addiction Obsessive-compulsive disorder Swimming Dysmenorrhea Analgesic Heart rate Running Thermoregulation Antidepressant Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Addiction Psychosis Atherosclerosis Stuttering Menstrual cup Aerobic exercise Urinary incontinence Bates Method Carpal tunnel syndrome Fibromyalgia Multiple sclerosis Bodybuilding Coffee Acupuncture Methamphetamine Cannabinoids The Emancipation of Mimi Polycystic ovary syndrome Stoicism LSD Hypnosis Sadism and masochism Aikido Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Massage Alcoholic beverage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neon Genesis Evangelion Dehydroepiandrosterone Energy development Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Karen Horney The Catcher in the Rye Anger management Insomnia Ty Cobb Dance Dance Revolution KONAMIX Cellular respiration Anorexia nervosa The Cure Satchel Paige Ben Johnson (athlete) Stretching Angina Stress (medicine) Combat stress reaction Aspirin Atkins Nutritional Approach Chile pepper Rat Park Diazepam Benign fasciculation syndrome 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Scientology beliefs and practices Alzheimer's disease Blackjack Fitz Hugh Ludlow Traumatic brain injury Venlafaxine Sedative Gymnastics Joke Oddworld Hatha yoga Cocaine Fluoxetine Sauna Physical fitness Cat Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus USS Tracy (DD-214)

why does it hurt when we menstruate why why does it hurt when women are on their periods where do the cramps come from just prior to the cycle starting the body releases prostaglandins that should cause small muscular contractions of the uterus and stimulate it to shed the lining unfortunately sometimes the contractions get too strong and you feel cramps this is the usual cause for cramps in young women there are other causes like fibroids and cystic ovaries but those are more common in older women there are medications you can take anti inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants that can help calm things down and eliminate the pain cramps are not something you simply have to suffer at any rate if you have severe cramps the kind that make you ill or such sometimes a course of low dose birth control pill is in order normally cramps ease off after you have a baby probably because the muscles have been stretched to capacity and are a bit laxer and the contractions are not as strong until then just try over the counter things like motrin ibuprofen naproxen sodium naprosyn aleve or the traditional things like pamprin or midol for less severe cramps a heating pad or one of those stick on heating patches will work as well ease up on the caffeine prior to the start drink more liquids and avoid foods that cause gase as well all will help some too women do not have to suffer and cramps do not have to be tolerated menstruation does not have to mean pain  Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Cramp Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding Diazepam Caffeine Migraine Oral contraceptive Menstrual cup Birth control Ibuprofen Chronic fatigue syndrome Muscle Childbirth Obstetrics Diarrhea COX-2 inhibitor Aspirin Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Orgasm First aid Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Polycystic ovary syndrome Acne Drug addiction Coffee Hyperthermia Allergy Sleep Androgen insensitivity syndrome Paracetamol In vitro fertilisation Clinical depression Common cold Asthma Anorexia nervosa Emergency contraception Multiple sclerosis Pregnancy Myocardial infarction Premenstrual stress syndrome Cancer Atherosclerosis Miscarriage Insulin Malaria Premature birth Insomnia Creatine Weight training Bipolar disorder Addiction Massage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dieting Cannabis (drug) Methamphetamine Intersex surgery Psoriasis Chlorpromazine Hypoglycemia Chemical abortion Acupuncture Puberty LSD Baldness treatments Narcolepsy Abortion debate Gastroparesis Nutrition Heart Herpes simplex virus Pharmacology Endometrial cancer Infertility Medical cannabis Estrus cycle Gout Cervix Antidepressant Cluster headache Stomach cancer Ovarian cancer Caesarean section Autoimmune diseases

is one actually more prone to getting pregnant while on birth control pills cause they make one have their period right so i think that would mean that they somehow make you ovulate would that be right or what what do you think no because the birth control pill inhibits ovulation the period you have when on the pill is not a true period it is withdrawl bleeding the progesterone in the pill tricks your body into thinking that you are pregnant thereby inhibiting ovulation and causing the uterine lining to build up during the week of non active pills the level of progesterone in the body drops when the body senses this it thinks you have had a miscarriage and sheds the uterine lining  Menstrual cycle Progesterone Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Birth control Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertility awareness Puberty Obstetrics Estrus cycle Pregnancy Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Gynaecology Ectopic pregnancy Gynecologic hemorrhage Intrauterine device Abortion Acne Uterine fibroids Ovary Human chorionic gonadotropin Oxytocin Premature birth Depo Provera Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Ovarian cancer Endometrial cancer EastEnders Ovarian cyst Baldness treatments Hormone Morning sickness Childbirth Habitual abortion Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy Abortion debate Twin Pregnancy test Mammary gland Urinary incontinence Endometrium Progesterone only pill Caffeine Folic acid Tocopherol Vaginal bleeding Uterus Religion and abortion Aspirin Gregory Goodwin Pincus Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Neighbours Insulin Chemical abortion Infertility Sexual abstinence Fertilisation Health issues and the effects of cannabis Partial-birth abortion Breech birth Indomethacin Herpes simplex virus Adrenal gland Antiretroviral drug Premenstrual stress syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sulfasalazine Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Placental abruption Knots Landing Corticosteroid Methamphetamine Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Obstetrical hemorrhage Gallstone Intersexuality Niddah Guinea pig Cytomegalovirus Cancer Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Syphilis Prostaglandin Resident Evil Outbreak Anovulation Luteinizing hormone Caesarean section Adverse effect (medicine) Chemotherapy Antidepressant Diazepam Spina bifida Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency

i shave my pubic area now but heard waxing is better is this true and what wax product should i get thats not pricey thank you waxing or sugaring is better because when the hair grows back in it is soft and no nubs and can last weeks and for some longer i recommend getting it done professionally first so you can see how they do it and you can also feel what it is like and decide if you want to go that route if you do it by yourself at home i guarantee that you will not do it right and make it hurt so much more than it needs to there is a technique to it and you don't need to get everything removed either just shaping it up is enough for a first time then when you do it yourself you can be more daring like another poster said waxing hurts the most the first time and that is partly because you don't know what to expect it only hurts for a few seconds and is worth it also if you do it for years yes you will have less hair that will grow  Pubic hair Waxing Depilation Casting Brazilian waxing Haircut Phonograph cylinder Menstrual cup Hair Kurt Angle Leg shaving Cross-country skiing Guinea pig Puberty Dice Social rule Leather Breastfeeding Hypertrichosis Wax play Crab louse Professional wrestling match types Androgen insensitivity syndrome Motor oil Shaving Jon Secada Manicure Trish Stratus Wig (hair) Diseases of the honeybee Bee Moustache Wax Ben Johnson (athlete) Vulva Honey Carnivorous plant Baldness Tofu Milk First aid Emotions (album) Beekeeping Tooth Ruby Wax Upholstery Double Dare One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Biochemistry Body piercing Tai Chi Chuan Delayed puberty Baldness treatments Repouss__ and chasing Acomoclitism Internal ballistics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Earwax Carpal tunnel syndrome Violin Marilyn Monroe Mummy Champagne (beverage) Stuttering Fame Academy Law of value Pitaten Playboy (magazine) Windows XP Cheese Shaggy dog story Blood Syndicate Double Dragon Razor Cotton Coca-Cola Tarantula Beeswax Radiation therapy Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ron and Fez Major League Baseball television contracts Massage Madonna (entertainer) Joker (comics) Swimsuit Mississippi John Hurt Customs and etiquette of Japan Figure drawing Gramophone record Steganography Mattress Fancy rat Billboard (advertising) Hash table Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Norah Jones Hyuga Hinata Social role of hair

could i get pregnant with no periods i missed my period months ago due to weight loss maybe however itis slow weight loss i am trying to have a baby with my husband all my tests were negative i have nothing wrong with my hormones can i still get pregnant if my period is lost i am and used to have regular periods i think the answer is yes i know that when you are breastfeeding you are still ovulating even tho' you might go without getting your period i don't know how it works but i do know that just because you don't get your period doesn't mean you aren't ovulating the key is trying to figure out when you are ovulating to have the best chances of conceiving i used to think that you ovulated in the middle of your cycle but then i read that you ovulate days from the end of your cycle so if you have a long cycle it can be quite a few days off from the middle since you aren't getting periods try to get in touch with your body and try to see if you can feel middleschmertz yes it really is called that pain the pain that comes with ovaulation then you might have a better idea of the best time to conceive good luck  Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Breastfeeding In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Pregnancy test Miscarriage Infertility Prostate cancer Puberty Childbirth Ovarian cyst Human chorionic gonadotropin Birth control Estrus cycle EastEnders Ovarian cancer Emergency contraception Hebrew calendar Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Anne Rice Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Fecal incontinence Breast cancer Weight training Equine conformation Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Death Gate Cycle Friends Niddah Theory of conduct Coeliac disease Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Quicksort Kender Mountain Gorilla Haloperidol Ontological argument Transactional analysis Human adaptation to space Brassiere Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dieting Mary, the mother of Jesus Humphrey Bogart Maya calendar Stomach cancer Prolactinoma Ravi Shastri Endometriosis Neighbours Sharon Tate Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fertilisation Weight loss Folic acid Ovary Philosophical skepticism Traumatic incident reduction Goodness and value theory Hair Carpel Conifer cones Cleveland Browns The Cursed Videotape Singlish Cancer Butterfly stroke Chronic fatigue syndrome Bene Gesserit Kurt Cobain Clinical depression Simone Weil Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 CPU cache Ra (board game) Eternal return Eclipse cycle Baldness treatments Premature birth Rosa Parks Sleep Craps Tocopherol Prolactin Hypothyroidism Addison's disease Flowering plant Traumatic brain injury New York Knicks Friedrich Schleiermacher

embarassing please help a confused girl has anyone asked their doctors about using tampons before they started trying to use them if so how did you ask and what was their response also was it really uncomfortable and how did you come up with the courage to ask i'm nervous to ask my pediatrician and trying to come up with idea on how to ask the easiest way to ask is just by saying i wasn't sure if i could start using tampons yet if you have a good doctor then that will lead to a conversation that is comfrtable for you the doctor should be asking you the questions at that point all you will have to do is answer them it can be a little uncomfortable in the begining but once you get the hang of it you wont even feel them if there is any pain then you it is not in correctly also be careful in taking it out to early because that hurts not a dramatic hurt but it is really uncomfortable good luck sweetie  Menstrual cup Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Social rule Milton H.

if i go to the doctor to check if i have uti will the doctor definitely examine my vagina i'm not uncomfortable with a doctor examining my private parts i just don't want it to be done for other reasons so is it definite that if i go in to check if i have uti urinary tract infection that my vagina will be examined hi your dr should not check your vagina for a uti that only requires a urine test you simply urinate in a cup and they stick a little 'dip stick' in it and test for particular levels of substances that may or may not be present to identify a uti the only time the dr should have to check your vagina is if you had pain or unusual dishcharge etc down there or were having your yearly papsmear women's exam or where pregnant not for uti in fact you can buy a test over the counter now at most drug stores to test at home for a uti much like a pregnancy test but if it's positive definately go see your dr for an antibiotic they can get serious if left untreated also if in the meantime if you are having bad burning or the feeling of 'urgency' still after empying your bladder like you still have to go but don't then there are products over the counter like azo or uristat that help with numbing the pain until you get to the dr but still go to the dr for antibiotics also don't be alarmed if you do get the azo or uristat pills they will turn your urine bright orange but they do help so much for the pain until the antibiotics kick in i hope this helps  Urinary incontinence Urinary tract infection Prostate cancer Cystoscopy Urinary system Pregnancy Medical analysis of circumcision Endometriosis Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Pneumonia Menstrual cup Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urine Birth control Vulvovaginal health Psoriasis Fertility awareness Cancer Acne Tobacco smoking HIV test Hepatitis Oral contraceptive Prostatitis Medicine Breastfeeding Pharmacology Stomach cancer Female genital cutting Hip fracture Group A streptococcal infection Guinea pig Folic acid Human sexual behavior Urination Medical prescription Drug test Masturbation Rape Diabetic neuropathy Acute renal failure Hypoglycemia Vagina Pelvic inflammatory disease Lyme disease Gynaecology Kidney Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease Ovarian cancer Bearberry In vitro fertilisation Benign prostatic hyperplasia Clinical depression Epididymitis Penicillin Sexual intercourse Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Cephalexin Lactobacillus acidophilus Diabetes mellitus Pyelonephritis Cirrhosis Traumatic brain injury Colorectal cancer Antibiotic Crohn's disease Schistosomiasis Colposcopy First aid Chlamydia Urethra Lupus erythematosus Miscarriage Abortion debate Vitamin C Intersex surgery Nephrology Cocaine IgA nephropathy Trichomoniasis Intravenous therapy Herpes simplex virus Diabetic ketoacidosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1)

after you lose your virginity will you bleed if you have sex again not right after like a week or two later it's very possible a females' hymen doesn't actually break contrary to popular belief it stretches having sex one time will usually not fully stretch the hymen but that also depends on the size of the penis during intercourse and the vigor of the sexual activity itself given the time after first intercourse that you specified i do think that it is very possible for the female to bleed again because by that time the muscles in the vagina have adjusted back to their original positions but if no bleeding occurs that is not a problem either everyone is different xd  Anal sex Virgin Hymen Menstrual cup Penis Strap-on dildo Sex organ Vagina Condom Human sexual response cycle Human sexual behavior Penis envy Oral sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human sexuality Fertility awareness Birth control Sexual differentiation Vulva Safe sex Masturbation Personal lubricant Sex toy Anus Puberty Child sexuality Menstrual cycle Weight training Female genital cutting Pornography in Japan Human penis size Premature ejaculation Sex assignment Dyspareunia Intersexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intersex surgery Sexual reproduction Sexual dysfunction Female ejaculation Gonorrhoea Gliding action Penis enlargement Pornographic movie Age of consent Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Urinary incontinence Breast Childbirth Rape Sexual arousal Erectile dysfunction Oral contraceptive Foreskin restoration Sexism Sex Group sex Katelyn Faber History of sex AIDS Gr__fenberg spot Transmission (medicine) History of intersex surgery Foreskin Pedophilia Cancer First aid Sexuality in Christian demonology Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Fisting Tantra Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Erection Andrea Dworkin Vaginal lubrication Homosexuality and Christianity Medical analysis of circumcision Bleeding Zoophilia Vagina dentata Sex and the City Professional wrestling holds Sexual abstinence American Pie (film) Statutory rape Teenage pregnancy Cybersex Physical intimacy Woman on top sex position Child sexual abuse Fecal incontinence Human Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Exercise Testosterone AIDS in Africa

i ate an apple and nectarine late at night but i'm trying to regain weight to have a period i should be gaining weight right now but i may have already reached my target weight since i haven't checked in a while but i always have snacks in the day and then a dessert at night today i didn't eat as much as i usually do so i ate a nectarine and an apple with my dessert a cookie and milk and i feel really full is it okay to feel this full since i need those calories the main reason i need to gain weight is to get my period started again which i lost for a year due to mild anorexia well it probably depends on how long you have been eating regularly plus i know milk tends to make me feel really full have you been to the doctor or nutritionist if you are at your target weight is this your target or the general target weight for your age height your period should start since your body is just sooooooo anxious to get the natural cycle going again also maybe it could take a couple months of healthy normal eating as your body is probably in a sort of shock from the transition from deprivation to nutrition just keep eating good calories and i wouldn't worry so much about trying to pack them all in at once you need to build a tolerance for food again and as long as you know you're not depriving yourself nature will take care of itself good luck  Dieting Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Atkins Nutritional Approach Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Apple Healthy eating Fasting Stomach cancer Chocolate Hypoglycemia Nutrition Adjustable gastric band Insulin Sleep Bodybuilding Human height Peach Obesity Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Food Protein-energy malnutrition Fancy rat Omega-3 fatty acid Eating disorder Calorie Veganism McDonald's Puberty Folic acid Guinea pig Chinese cuisine Breakfast Tofu Prostate cancer Snack food Cuisine of Denmark Infantilism Dietary fiber Insomnia Sugar substitute MRE Theory of conduct Cheese Meal Tomato Egg (food) Target Corporation Pig (zodiac) Social rule Gastroparesis Coffee Coeliac disease Fertility awareness Fecal incontinence Eating Clinical depression Tooth enamel The Contender (television series) Domestic rabbit Tide Anxiety Cat Hamburger Tocopherol Fruit tree propagation Apple pie Childbirth Kodocha Low-carbohydrate diet Binge eating disorder Terri Schiavo Taiwanese cuisine Food guide pyramid One Piece minor characters Alcoholic beverage Vegetarianism Urinary incontinence Dream Menstrual cup Chlorpromazine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Diarrhea A Series of Unfortunate Events Ice cream Peanut Dairy Human adaptation to space Pancake German cuisine Protein Abortion debate Bulimia nervosa Original sin South Beach diet Hamster

ovarian cyst i am yrs old i was recently told that i have a ruptured cyst on my right ovary i am not on birth control my gyno suggested i start a progesterin only birth control to reduce ovulation b c apparently i could risk getting a cyst each month in any event i have yet to start the birth control b c i was not told much about it and it could have many side effects i was told to 'rest and take it easy' to reduce the risk of the cyst bursting in my abdomen i guess i am just looking for more information about this 'ruptured cyst' business i am still getting cramping now and then what can i expect and any advice guidance thanks hi i have polycystic ovary syndrome at one stage i had cysts in my right ovary and in my left i was in a lot of pain very sharp burning pain when they became infected the best solution was to go on the pill you mentioned and skip as many periods as possible everytime i had a period the cysts became more inflammed skipping them gave them the chance to settle down i had my appendix out last year and the doctor checked out my right ovary while i was under and it was clear of cysts my doctors instructions have helped me alot and i have settled down the problem it is genetic so it is not something you can get rid of but just learn to deal with the danger is that if you allow them to become more and more irritated and they burst then it can cause burning and scarring and possibly endometriosis this can cause difficulties in getting pregnant down the track however if you stick with the pill and skipping periods i have one for days every four months then you can manage the problem and should not have great difficulty with getting pregnant down the track good exercise and diet will help too because those tendant to get cysts are also tendant towards insulan resistance and eventual diebetes so just look after yourself i hope this has been helpful  Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian cyst Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Acne Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Psoriasis Ovary Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Ovarian cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Folic acid Puberty Infertility Guinea pig Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Appendicitis Apollo 8 Ectopic pregnancy Diabetes mellitus Ovulation Bipolar disorder Premature birth Dysmenorrhea Turner syndrome Miscarriage Coeliac disease Toxoplasmosis Crohn's disease Obesity Obstetrics Birth control Cephalic disorder Malaria Abortion Stroke Gonorrhoea Bloating Tocopherol Intersex surgery Multiple sclerosis Pregnancy Polycystic kidney disease Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Migraine Colorectal cancer Depo Provera Cat Amenorrhoea Syringomyelia Abdominal pain Diving Pneumonia Nutrition Emergency contraception Tobacco smoking Fecal incontinence Cirrhosis Coronary heart disease Traumatic brain injury Hypertension Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryptorchidism Herpes simplex virus Asthma Equine conformation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Parkinson's disease Medical analysis of circumcision Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breast cancer History of intersex surgery Condom Alternative medicine Cannabis (drug) Sexual reproduction Insulin resistance Fibromyalgia Clinical depression Extreme Programming Autism Prenatal diagnosis Abortion debate Penis enlargement Entamoeba histolytica

please women how can i make my woman like sex does she want to have sex with you that's the most important questiuon because if she doesn't she probably isn't going to like sex with you no matter what you do but if she does then one thing to remember is that for most women pleasure in sex is linked to intimacy women like to feel close to their partner valued and cared about lots of guys concentrate on the mechanics of sex g spots penis length etc etc it's way simpler than that it's about getting intimate getting to know one another from the skin in being close mentally as well as physically instead try laying naked together just touching sensual massage bathing together without going 'all the way' get really intimate build a scene focus only on her if you haven't got the time or interest to do that then you don't really want her to enjoy sex you just want her to tell you she does so you can enjoy it more take your time focus on her and good luck  Physical intimacy Human sexual behavior Social rule Strap-on dildo Oral sex Nudity Child sexuality Theory of conduct Erogenous zone Orgasm Inhibited sexual desire Anal sex Zoophilia Penis Massage Gender role Bondage (BDSM) Sex toy Condom Sexual abstinence Polyamory BDSM Love Sexual intercourse Happiness Infantilism Domination & submission (BDSM) Meaning of life Friendship Gay slang Friends Human sexuality Ex-gay Human penis size Jam (TV series) Little Britain Philosophical skepticism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Domestic violence History of sex Masturbation Goodness and value theory Phone sex Lawrence v.

girls only please okay this is pretty dang embarrassing but people at school are often talking about sex and 'popping cherries' what exactly does that mean popping the cherry is just a crude way of saying tearing the hymen for many women when they have sex for the first time they tear their hymen a small band of tissue in the vaginal area the tearing of this can cause some bleeding not all women will experience this after they have sex for the first time as it is now known that a female can tear her hymen by playing sports or wearing tampons so many have already torn their hymen before they become sexually active hope this helps  Hymen Virgin Menstrual cup Anal sex Tampon Condom Sex Menstrual cycle Vagina Orgasm Human sexual behavior Sex organ Oral sex Group sex Sexual intercourse Vulva Fisting Puberty Female genital cutting Strap-on dildo Sexual dysfunction AIDS Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pedophilia Child sexuality Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexually-transmitted infection Sex toy Pornographic movie Sex and the City Human sexual response cycle Child sexual abuse Safe sex Vaginal lubrication Intersex surgery Transsexuality Masters and Johnson Pop music Sauna Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Pornography in Japan Fertility awareness Toxic shock syndrome History of intersex surgery Human sexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clitoris Gender role Cervical cancer Sex assignment Gay Dildo Transgender Traumatic brain injury Body piercing Hentai Vulvovaginal health Hymenaios Prostitution Jamie Gillis Herbert Garrison Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Tears for Fears Scenes from a Memory Sex Pistols The 120 Days of Sodom Sexual differentiation Gender identity Miscarriage Phone sex Punk rock R.

man with question i'm lbs overweight due to meds all in my stomach how can i dress to look less heavy i wear my shirts pullovers out and try to wear ones with stripes going down but still look all poofed out especially in profile my doc says giving up the meds is not an option at this time i'm ' and used to weigh about and was decent looking but now i'm a blimp i would really appreciate some female input thanks small vertical stripes actually slim the figure instead of widen it the only other thing you can be certain to do is to be sure your shirts do not hit you or pull in particular at the area that is largest on you this draws more attention to the area i can commiserate with a medication causing sudden and extreme weight gain i am still struggling to lose weight from a particular birth control i was on three years ago women don't mind an overweight man we're not all shallow edit i did a quick web search for you and found these tips that i thought may be helpful to you dress thinner tip wear the right size no outfit is going to take pounds off your hips but choosing the right clothing that fits properly can go a long way to slimming your look if clothes are too tight all the bulges rolls dimples or any other flaw you may have will show through if clothes are too big they add bulk and can make you look heavier than you actually are dress thinner tip patterns fool the eye optical illusion patterns diagonal stripes zig zags and the like can fool the eye and detract from problem areas however avoid horizontal and vertical stripes because these both can cause you to appear heavier tips to dress slimmer choose darker solid colors such as black navy blue and gray black rules dress monochromatic all in one color top to bottom no patterns if you want to wear patterns go for smaller ones that overlap avoid horizontal stripes look for thin vertical and and diagonal lines for a fluid look select accessories to draw attention from trouble spots wear clothes that fit not too baggy but not tight and clingy tips for the portly man clothes must fit perfectly loose clothing makes you look even bigger while tight clothes give away curves that you don't want exposed avoid any sweater blazer or shirt with naturally sloped shoulders because these tend to attract the eye right down to your mid section jackets should be well adjusted around you waist area and should fall right below your buttocks vertical lines help elongate your look optically that in turn will make you appear thinner trousers should be worn on your hips preferably with a low rise which is a shorter distance between the top of the waistband and the crotch of your pants avoid letting your belly stick out over your pants this lengthens your torso and shortens your legs resulting in a very unattractive combination consider wearing suspenders instead of a belt to minimize attention to your waistline empty unnecessary items from your pockets overstuffed pockets also call attention to your mid section v necks are a great way to camouflage double chins as they draw the attention away from your neck and more towards your chest area whatever your body type make sure your best features stand out while your less perfect ones remain for the most part unnoticed remember do not try to overtly camouflage your weaker points because it only brings them out even more the best way to prove this point is when a balding man uses a comb over hairdo in an attempt to hide his bald spots it only emphasizes the problem more  Billiards Kilt Shirt Professional wrestling holds Weight training Camouflage Horse Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Suit (clothes) Canadian Armed Forces Internal ballistics Mouse (computing) Diving suit Suplex Social aspects of clothing Tightlacing Welding Black tie Mattress Diving Kimono Japanese tea ceremony Dog Hair Drill bit Double bass Knife Hamster Archery Dragon Booster Glossary of climbing terms Garfield Marching band Violin Volleyball Buttocks Physical attractiveness Bicycle Heavy metal fashion Snooker Gramophone record Terminal ballistics Hakama Casualty lifting Swingout View camera Cat Sari Pantyhose Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Gas metal arc welding Sailing Sniper Tank Car handling Tire Death rock fashion Poker jargon Figure skating Bicycle lighting Comanche Wing Chun Glossary of American football Colours, standards and guidons Color Textile manufacturing Menstrual cup Softball Overall Drawing Gray Wolf Piccolo Junior Saga Wind turbine Clothing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cheetah Barbie Wallpaper group Geology of the Appalachians Aikido Nudity Cello Breastfeeding

whats wrong with this picture ok i'm years old i had my period over months ago that was the same time that i started my period i've gain wieght during that time any doctors out there it's normal when your first start to get your period that it comes irregularly so don't worry it is perfectly normal if you feel like something is wrong you should mention it to your mother and ask questions it will take your body some time to get regulated i could be that you have been stressed gained or lost a lot of weight traveled alot many things tie into late periods but i'm thinking it's mostly because you just started if you have a family doctor you can call them and ask questions you don't have to tell them your name if you don't want to just explain to them the same thing you just told us and they will be happy to help you in the mean time don't worry everything is going to be alright  Social rule Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Shaggy dog story The Long Game Kodocha Yoko Ono Milton H.

should a girl see the gyn at i was having an argument with my mother in law about my yr old step daughter and of course anything i say about our daughter is stupid according to my mother in law because i have only been around for yrs but anyway my stepdaughter started her period yrs ago and her mother never told her anything about it she taught herself everything now she will be living with us and i think she should start seeing the gyn but my mother in law claims she should wait until she is now that sounds very wrong to me i started seeing a gyn after i started my periods at am i wrong or right i think it would be very stupid to wait since she is already having monthly mensrtal i think that from an educational standpoint its a good idea the doctor can teach her how to perform breast self exams teach her about proper sexual protection because like it or not teens do become sexually active answer any questions she might have that she's too embarrassed to ask you or someone else and it will also allow her to become accustomed to the medical environment and not feel threatened by it please stress the fact that her visit will be a physical and faq chat session not a pelvic exam which would freak any girl out at and let her know that if she's having any sort of gynecological problems this is how things work your mil is a prude and grossly under educated oh and you can tell her that a recent report in the journal of gynecology and obstetrics encourages pubescent visits to the gynecologist for just the reasons i outlined  Medicine Gynaecology Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Emergency contraception Puberty Transsexuality Prostate cancer Infantilism Hikikomori Science Chiropractic Teach the Controversy Reparative therapy Ethics Criticism of libertarianism Socrates Sigmund Freud Rape Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Pedophilia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Laura Schlessinger Childlove movement Franz Boas Physician Sexual orientation Social rule Sexual abstinence Creationism Pitaten French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Fecal incontinence Cooperative education Medical record Hormone replacement therapy (trans) History of intersex surgery Bernard Williams Extreme Programming Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Patent Orgasm Cancer Law school Sex education Religion Premature ejaculation Pelvic inflammatory disease Incest Negima Female genital cutting Human sexual behavior 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Intelligent design Boston Public Juris Doctor Status of religious freedom in France Gender role Partial-birth abortion About a Boy The Mother Condom Domestic violence Scientific method Abortion Pregnancy Divorce Intelligent design movement SAT Fathers' rights Alexander Technique Androgen insensitivity syndrome Homophobia EastEnders Niddah Circumcision advocacy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma F.

just had the depo since having it for the first time for a long while just had a baby ive been on here and the ratings for the depo have been very scary lawsuits massive weight gain huge side affects is this all true in all women or is it very few women in thousands as when i went to my docs today they had a rush on these injections so surely it cant be all that bad im really worried ive just gone and done the wrong thing please help depot injection is indeed quite popular at the moment it is reliable convenient and only needs one injection every weeks its main side effect is that it may cause erratic and persistent bleeding for the first weeks and occasionally longer once it settles down it often stops the period all together which many women find desirable weight gain can occur with any hormone contraception and i don't think the depot is worse than the others i dislike the implants which can be difficult to remove the other method of contraception that is increasing in popularity is the mirena progesterone coil  Oral contraceptive Depo Provera Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breast cancer Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Sexual abstinence Abortion debate Intrauterine device Growth hormone treatment Prostate cancer Radiation therapy Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy Fuel injection Acne Gynaecology Stomach cancer Progesterone only pill Fertility awareness Insulin Chlorpromazine Social rule Miscarriage Ovulation Haloperidol Ovarian cyst Intravenous therapy Puberty Spark plug Carburetor Adverse effect (medicine) Childbirth Premature birth Condom Diazepam Diabetes mellitus Stuttering Hormone Goodness and value theory Prolactinoma Microeconomics Cancer Explosive material Casting Transsexuality Ovarian cancer Sterilization (surgical procedure) Internal ballistics Sewage treatment Human height Charles Ives Dieting Hypoglycemia Biology and sexual orientation Castration Theodicy Polycystic ovary syndrome Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Spice Girls Fast bowling Testosterone Growth hormone deficiency MMORPG Floppy disk Central processing unit Psoriasis AIDS pandemic Theory of conduct Equine conformation Generation X Clinical depression Loudspeaker Twin Spacecraft propulsion Nutrition Nuclear weapon design Chu-Han contention Ives Manufacturing Company Inflation Cryptorchidism Abortion in the United States Normal distribution Password Naval mine Cross site scripting Penis enlargement Malignant melanoma

embarrassing question my boyfriend and i have been together for like years i dread having sex with him because it's horrible it hasn't always been like this it is sometimes very hard to talk about anything with him i feel like i will hurt his feelings he just pounds me he won't let me on top even though i try he puts all his weight on me and moves his whole body not just his torso part it's just like he's laying there shaking or somthing he also stares at my face the whole time like he is dead and never blinks it kind of creaps me out what can i do to make things better when i try to talk to him he doesn't listen he just keeps on doing the same thing we have done different positions and i've told him to just go slow but it always ends up feeling like i'm being jack hammered or something no i don't fake having orgasms i just lay there and wait until he's done we don't have sex often but when we do it doesn't take long so i just get it over with to make him happy you need to sit him down in a non sexual setting and speak candidly with him about this tell him that you are not enjoying your sex life because of what he is doing explain that you want him to be more gentle and that you would like to be on top every once in a while if he doesn't change despite your conversation you may need to start withholding sex from him so he understands that you are serious also if you are faking orgasms when you have sex with him stop if he thinks you are having orgasms he thinks he is doing something right and will continue to do the same things if he notices that you are not having orgasms he may realize that he needs to make some changes  Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexual intercourse Shaggy dog story Orgasm Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga Child sexuality Sin City Professional wrestling holds Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Pitaten Anal sex Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Catcher in the Rye Strap-on dildo Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Human sexual behavior Humphrey Bogart The Amber Spyglass Conspiracy (TNG episode) Transactional analysis Prostate cancer Miss Saigon Jiddu Krishnamurti Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sex and the City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 5) It's All Gone Pete Tong The Ashlee Simpson Show The nature of God in Western theology Swingout God Emperor of Dune Fight Club Bondage (BDSM) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jam (TV series) Ocean's Twelve Rich Mullins Smallville (Season 4) Blood Simple Friends EastEnders Tenshinhan Oral sex Survivor (novel) BDSM The Inside Haven (TNG episode) Poker jargon The Emancipation of Mimi Happiness Anne Rice Shit Vernon Schillinger Puberty The Death Gate Cycle About a Boy Fiddler on the Roof Laura Schlessinger Ben Johnson (athlete) Le Malade imaginaire The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Lovely Bones Kender Blood (computer game) Masturbation The Smoking Room Woman on top sex position Little Britain One Tree Hill (TV series) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Dog training Wilhelm Reich The Empty Child The Curse of Fenric Philosophy of language Beetle in an Anthill Goodness and value theory Night (book) The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Extras (sitcom) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Incarnations of Immortality Rent (musical) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada Phoebe Halliwell Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Scenes from a Memory

girl question i would like to start using tampons and i need some advice i've done a lot of research and i think i know what to do im just confused how you know when the tampon is all the way in i would try the lightest tamp possible i find that inserting is easier if i elevate my leg by placing my foot on the toilet and you must place it so that it points toward your back not up if you hold the ribbed end with your thumb and middle or ring finger you push it in until these fingers are at the opening of your vagina then push the tampon in with your index finger keep trying 'cause i have be honest they are a whole lot nicer to use than a pad that feels like a diaper plus you don't smell as bad either just remember to change them about every four hours or more as needed also i had a problem once with the tamp getting caught on my hymen and i couldn't get it out i had to call my mom for assistance which was way embarrassing but should this happen to you just stay calm push it back in with your finger and try again the tamp must come out the way it went it right nothing to worry about i hope that i have answered your question and please feel free to e mail me if you have any other questions that i may help with  Tampon Sanitary towel Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

excercise for menstrual cramps i always have horrible cramps at the beginning of my period and usually taking an ibuprofin or two or midol helps but recently it hasn't been is there any excercise anyone recommends that can help with cramps any kind of exercises will help right now even talking a walk would help to make you feel better if you are in alot of pain try to focus on stretching more than actually exercising sit on the floor with your legs forming a triangle and lay in the floor this stretches out all of your pelvic muscles yoga also will help foods to avoid would be anything fried or high in fat you may crave something salty but that isn't any good because of the sodium and water retention try to eat viggies they are packed full of vitamins that will help also chocolate actually helps in releasing endorphins so it is allowed  Cramp Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Weight training Menstrual cup Paget's disease of bone Atkins Nutritional Approach Running Bodybuilding Massage Anorexia nervosa Hamster Menstrual cycle Dieting Professional wrestling holds Egg (food) Exercise Tocopherol Addiction Prostate cancer Endometriosis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Milk Hiking Swimming First aid Tetrapod Vitamin Carpal tunnel syndrome Drug addiction Endorphin Cheese Fancy rat Stomach cancer Nutrition Orgasm Milton H.

i had sex the two days in a row before detecting my lh surge can what are my odds of getting pregnant days in my cycle the lh surge usually means the egg will be released in hours while sperm can't live for very long in the vagina any sperm that has made it into your uterus can live there for days the most fertile time is the day of ovulation and the day before it so yes you did have sex at a very fertile time that's still no guarantee that you will actually get pregnant though not sure if you're trying to get pregnant or trying to avoid it the way natural family planning is supposed to work is that you learn your cycle predict when the lh surge will occur each month and abstain from sex days prior to that and about days after good luck  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Puberty Sexual intercourse Infertility Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometrium Female reproductive system (human) Miscarriage Emergency contraception Estrus cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Twin Ovary Ovum Orgasm Moss Obstetrics Spermatozoon Intersexuality Anal sex Sex assignment Niddah Endometriosis Human Vagina Old wives' tale Menstrual cup Pregnancy test Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Spider Abortion debate Chimera (genetics) Human chorionic gonadotropin Tsetse fly Oral sex Gonorrhoea Parthenogenesis Sexual abstinence Maya calendar Sexual differentiation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Abortion Swyer syndrome Natural family planning Human sexual response cycle Flowering plant Ploidy Man Sex Intersex surgery Conifer cones Hurricane Rita Storm surge Ectopic pregnancy Meiosis Housefly Nuclear fallout Male reproductive system (human) Adoption Cryptorchidism Genital wart History of intersex surgery Embryo transfer Sperm Whale Safe sex Urinary incontinence Pornographic movie Polycystic ovary syndrome Malaria CPU cache Alternation of generations Marchantiophyta Sterilization (surgical procedure) Gamete American lobster Shark Spina bifida Chinese New Year Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina X chromosome Cervical cancer Fetal development Marsupial Friends Pelvic inflammatory disease Gregorian calendar Great White Shark 2003 North America blackout Extreme Programming Hermaphrodite

hi i have a femine question for my friend um she says that she's only gotten her period twice in months she's a virgin so it's odd she just became a vegeterian months ago so is this normal if you know anything please answer i don't want her getting ill thank you i'm so worried she's most likely fine but might want to consult a doctor just to confirm a vegetarian diet exposes one to far fewer of the hormones than a diet that includes meat and dairy products that may be the reason for her lack of periods another possibility is very low body fat the body requires a certain level of fat to menstruate also if she is young her periods might not have stabilized into a regular pattern yet  Dieting Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Veganism Menstrual cycle Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Milk Anorexia nervosa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Trans fat Obesity Puberty Hypoglycemia Crohn's disease Coronary heart disease Growth hormone treatment Tocopherol Chronic fatigue syndrome Protein Food Hypertension Vegetarian nutrition Dog Vitamin C Polycystic ovary syndrome Vitamin D Tofu Urinary incontinence Ferret Stone Age Animal rights Low-carbohydrate diet Cheese Androgen insensitivity syndrome Omega-3 fatty acid Acne Domestic goat Transsexuality Weight training South Beach diet Kashrut Coeliac disease Dairy Breast cancer Epilepsy Insulin Insomnia Progesterone Phenylketonuria Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glycogen storage disease type I Fasting Vegetarian cuisine Food guide pyramid Environmental vegetarianism Clinical depression Ham Guinea pig Nutrient Cyanocobalamin Feminism Prolactinoma Raw food diet Brain Anemia Autism Soy milk Multiple chemical sensitivity Gelatin Gender role Famine Growth hormone Vegetarianism and religion Macular degeneration Folic acid Livestock Super Size Me Meat analogue Cholesterol Chocolate Healthy eating Endometriosis Agriculture Bodybuilding Post-traumatic stress disorder Gallstone Diabetes mellitus Zone diet Decompression sickness Organic food Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Growth hormone deficiency Protein-energy malnutrition Pregnancy Thyroid Osteoporosis McDonald's

ovarian cysts i was just wondering whether you can still get ovarian cysts even if you're on using the birth control pill as far as i'm aware you don't ovulate while taking the pill but if you missed pills due to sickness it could possibly make you ovulate again and can cysts then form cysts can sometimes still form when on the pill i had asked a doctor friend about this and they said that the pill doesn't always help keep cysts from becoming a problem i found this to be the case for myself in when i had to have surgery for one of my other medical problems my doctor found a cm functional cyst these kind of cysts are pretty common i've been on the pill for years if you miss your pills because of sickness it can cause breakthrough bleeding to occur for some women making them think it's a period i would recommend getting in touch with your doctor as well to see what they say  Ovarian cyst Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Spina bifida Ovarian cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Syringomyelia Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Puberty Acne Cephalic disorder Psoriasis Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gynecologic hemorrhage Ovulation Breast Infertility Ectopic pregnancy Birth control Cysticercosis Toxoplasmosis Pregnancy Vitamin D Pilonidal cyst Miscarriage Tuberous sclerosis Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Progesterone Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Endometrial cancer Fecal incontinence Tocopherol Medical cannabis Breastfeeding Folic acid Childbirth Intersexuality Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Renal cell carcinoma Depo Provera Surgery Polycystic kidney disease Osteoarthritis Sedative Entamoeba histolytica Caffeine Gregory Goodwin Pincus Stomach cancer Intersex surgery Migraine Ebola Flowering plant Abortion Resident Evil Outbreak Sulfasalazine Ben Johnson (athlete) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Bloating Jam (TV series) Lung cancer Apollo 8 Physician Milton H.

grown up but still look like a child i m yrs old the problem with me is that nobody believes that i m older than or infact when i go to park or elsewhere the children aged approach me considering me of their age the boys of my age dont even look at me even i have recieved face of the year award in my school last year is it bcoz of my height i m but on heels i look like even in the phone by my voice ppl think as if a kid is talking n ask me give phone to some elderly person hmmmm my parents dont mind at all but i feel really very irritated when classfellows ask me when'll u grow up i dont have ne boyfrnd while all my cousins have n what will happen when i will go to college next week omg plz tell me nething that i can do i am and most people who don' t know me or go to school to me are surprised to find out my age i'm gonna be in two weeks actually i'm ' but i've always been thin i'm pounds but look thinner i guess i feel your pain it is definitely annoying to look younger than you are people don't take you seriously but it will definitely be a good thing when you reach an age where you actually want to look younger also my roommate last year was also about your height and had a childish voice although she had womanly curves i think the media just screws up people's conceptions of what a year old looks like these actors who play high school kids on tv are usually in their early to late s it sounds like you are just short and there's nothing wrong with that and as far as going to college i've been in college for yrs and i have seen lots of girls that are even skinner and have more child like bodies than me people in college generally have the sense not to make rude comments about it don't worry and lots of guys like petite girls  Social rule Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Shawn Michaels Theory of conduct Avenue Q Jon Secada Friends Rush Limbaugh Treehouse of Horror V Time Out of Mind Diving Garfield Humphrey Bogart About a Boy AFI 100 Years series Kender Equine conformation Milton H.

is my vagina normal my vagina sometimes dry out when i'm having sex is it normal or i'm not ready yet how to make my vagina wet coz my husband always complain about the dry vagina plz i need help yes your vagina is perfectly normal some women's vagina's produce more natural lubricant than other women's and you are one of the women who simply has a less wet vagina no worries though that's how i am as for making your vagina wetter there are really two options make sure that your husband is giving you enough foreplay before the intercourse begins otherwise sex is likely to be uncomfortable for both of you or if your husband is giving you foreplay and taking things slowly before the intercourse begins and he still complains that you are too dry then it is probably time to buy a lubricant from the store some people feel ashamed of this but you don't need to be embarrassed because the sex will be a whole lot more pleasurable for both of you if you are wet whether or not it is natural i hope this helps best of luck  Sexual intercourse Condom Oral sex Human sexual behavior Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Vagina Urinary incontinence Anal sex Rape Sex toy Fertility awareness Personal lubricant Dyspareunia Masturbation Vaginal lubrication Social rule Sexual arousal Jam (TV series) Human sexual response cycle Diaphragm (contraceptive) Child sexuality Sexual dysfunction Vulvovaginal health Vulva Niddah Menstrual cycle Intersex surgery Human sexuality Katelyn Faber Fecal incontinence Fisting Orgasm Gliding action Sauna Infantilism Anorgasmia Safe sex Sento Mutual masturbation Mucus Masters and Johnson Anus Yoko Ono Hemp Puberty Prostate cancer Homosexuality and transgender Sexual reproduction Old wives' tale History of sex Sexuality in Christian demonology Douche Female genital cutting Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Physical intimacy Gay slang Orgy Anal masturbation Group sex Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina Sexual abstinence Euphemism Dildo Marriage Mojave people Vaginismus Bondage (BDSM) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Herbert Garrison History of intersex surgery Breastfeeding Vagina dentata Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pornography in Japan Marie Antoinette Sanitary towel Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Proper Condom Use Penis Alanis Morissette Phone sex Binge eating disorder Richard Feynman Childbirth Religion and sexuality Zoophilia Pregnancy Sexual differentiation Hymen Coitus interruptus Domestic violence Theory of conduct Erogenous zone Sex doll Virgin Gramophone record

diagnosis hirsutism or just plain hairy i'm wondering if i may have hirsutism or an excess of andorgens some kind of hormonal problem i've always been hairy but lately i'm noticing that it's getting a little bit worse in certain areas and peach fuzz on my face is getting darker however i have always had very regular periods once a month and i'm not obese i have started to get acne lately at years old am i just going through some weird late growth spurt but nothing else is really growing haha i never had acne earlier in life so i think i'm just getting it now i don't necessarily think the two are linked but i thought it was worth mentioning and i'm of middle eastern descent i guess my basic question is what's the difference between having hirsutism and being just plain hairy i think i'm the latter because i don't have any other medical symptoms of hirustism and i know middle eastern women tend to be more hairy it's something i can deal with but i'm just curious about the diagnosis of hirsutism hi i think middle eastern girls have the best hair not to forget skin but about your question hirsutism is the masculine distribution of hair but associated are also male characteristics if you havent grown a beard and a deep voice i think you have nothing to worry about girl theres a physiological change in your body since your all your hormones are outta wack it will take some time for em to stablize dont worry about the facial peach fuzz usually it will receed and its normal to have a lil fuzz for the acne you could consult your doctor for a cream with tretonin it has excellent results also makes your skin tighter i prescribe that most of the time and its awesome it may make your skin photosenstive so stay outta the sun but since your brown its a white kids problem haha basically dont stress much luv take care  Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Acne Prostate cancer Testosterone Transsexuality Baldness Growth hormone deficiency Endometriosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinary incontinence Hypertrichosis Growth hormone treatment Cancer Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

why do women feel like they have to shave their pubic area i mean what happend to the natural look i think the natural look is much more a turn on any comments i think it's a social thing personally i am natural and prefer natural but i definitely think women at least in our society are socialized to believe that their pubic hair is gross unsightly gets in the way and generally needs to be trimmed or removed also hair poking out of your swimsuit just isn't an acceptable look these days so even natural women like me have to do something if we wear small suits or risk being completely shunned  Pubic hair Depilation Acomoclitism Swimsuit Haircut Shaving Beard Hair Wig (hair) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Vulva Social role of hair Sento Leg shaving Menstrual cup Crab louse Social rule Puberty Gender role Baldness Human sexual behavior Clothing Phoebe Buffay's songs Yin Shun Man Rastafari movement Swimming pool Bathing Global Gillette Economic inequality Hypertrichosis Sauna Castration Undergarment Five Ks Hazing Transgender Speedo (suit style) Skinhead Friends 613 mitzvot Playboy (magazine) Nudity Dilbert Breast implant Utilitarianism Gay Female genital cutting Drug test Philosophy of science Ethics Pornography Sexual orientation Sexual attraction Law of value Nudism Urbanization Social constructionism Bikini Surveillance Moustache Kimi Finster Effeminacy Black (people) Phoebe Buffay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Funeral The Sims 2 Customs and etiquette of Japan Human Stonewall riots Heteronormativity Niddah Physical attractiveness The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Paraphilia Monasticism Pornography in Japan Property (ownership right) Poker jargon Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Barber Miss America Autopsy Scar Delayed puberty Objectivist philosophy Pedophilia Barbie Stoicism Condom Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Theory of conduct Asperger syndrome Domination & submission (BDSM) Birth control Razor Professional wrestling match types Fur History of subcultures in the 20th century

help could i be pregnant i am on the nuvaring birth control i have been on it about a year it is a ring that you leave in for three weeks then take it out for a week to have your period then you put a new ring in i always take my ring out on a sunday and i use to start my period by that tuesday after a while my period didn't start coming until wed now it is not coming until thursday is this normal i have to put my new ring in the following sunday and now that my period is not coming until thursday i am still on my period a little when i put my new ring in also is it ok to have sex with my husband while my ring is out is their a chance of pregnancy between the time when my ring is out and my period starts sunday to thursday we normally always use a condom during this time but last month we didnt wear a condom between the time i took my ring out and my period started this month i am waiting on my period and the last three days i have been very nauseated could i be pregnant note we had sex last month before my period started while my ring was out but i did have a period and we have not had any unprotected sex since then well technically you did mix the recipe for a baby so you could be the chances of it are not all that high though the failure rate is up there with the regular bcp if you use it as directed what you are likely seeing is the accumulated effect of the hormones one effect of the hormones is a lighter flow each month and not building up quite as heavy a lining in the uterus so over the months it's not unusual to see the monthly period get lighter you are not likely to get pregnant during the time the ring is out because it's been supressing ovulation for the previous three weeks the drop in hormone level is what triggers the period to begin not ovulation to happen you really don't need to be using a condom during that time unless you are not sure of your partner or need to have protection against some type of std the quickest way to ease your mind is just to go buy a pregnancy test and use it it will more than likely be negative but then you will have an answer in hand if you are really concerned just make an appointment to see your gynecologist for a professional opinion it may be the hormones are a bit much for your system which would cause the delay in cycle and possibly the nausea and it could be the nausea is just you reacting in fear to the possibility of motherhood minds and fears can have a strong influence on the stomach and it wouldn't be the first time it happened that way  Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Condom Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Puberty Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Breastfeeding Sexual abstinence In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Safe sex Endometriosis Abortion EastEnders Pelvic inflammatory disease Childbirth Abortion debate Sex education Oral sex Infertility Intrauterine device Ovarian cancer Ovulation Miscarriage Knots Landing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Twin Estrus cycle AIDS Gregorian calendar Progesterone Morning sickness Prenatal diagnosis Prolactinoma Human chorionic gonadotropin Herpes simplex virus Pregnancy test Liturgical year Turner syndrome Anal sex National Football League Tocopherol Psoriasis Sexual intercourse Human penis size Sex assignment Diabetes mellitus Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Pornographic movie Stuttering Sexual reproduction Chemotherapy Stomach cancer Hebrew calendar Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Chemical abortion Acne Social rule Growth hormone treatment Monday Night Football Niddah Traumatic brain injury Gynaecology Postpartum depression Ocean's Twelve 2005 NBA Finals Estradiol Insulin Biology and sexual orientation Hypoglycemia Marilyn Monroe Computus Human sexual behavior Cryptorchidism Endocrinology Teenage pregnancy Traffic light Growth hormone deficiency Slow Train Coming Paracetamol Elephant Transsexuality Hypertension Autism Big Brother UK series 6

women only what's your fav way to masterbate what works for you serious answers only please i'm not really 'into it but i have religious guilt i need to hear that it's ok it's like i know it but i just can't shake it but i also feel that it's selfish when your in a relationship i wouldn't feel comfortable doing it in front my guy what do you think the first thing you have to do is get over you guilt i know this can be difficult because it has been planted for years i don't know for sure but i think the catholic is about the only religion that tells you it is a sin so i assume you are a catholic i was also at one time so i can relate to what you are going through the first time i masturbated i could not quit shaking for about an hour i was so scared of what i had done after that i began to question everything about it like how can something so good be so bad then i found that virtually everyone masturbates although many will not admit to it now research has shown that not only is it natural and normal but it also has numerous health benefits so yes it is ok you can put the guilt behind you it may take a little while but you have already started when you say you know it is ok believe it or not masturbation in a relationship is not selfish i think it is an important part of any relationship partners can enjoy it as part of their sex play you can show your partner how to better satisfy and your partner can do the same you can use it as a change in your everyday love making routines i think it is also important for most women as very few of us orgasm from penetration alone so a little manual stimulation will get you over that last hump it is also useful at times when your partner is not in the mood for whatever reason so clear your mind put your fingers to work or get some kind of toy and enjoy yourself along with all the rest of us  Human sexual behavior Strap-on dildo Anal sex Oral sex Child sexuality Sexual orientation Sexual abstinence Bondage (BDSM) Zoophilia Orgasm Sex toy Mutual masturbation Sexual intercourse Infantilism Birth control Religion Sant Thakar Singh Prostate cancer Sin Time Out of Mind History of sex Milton H.
