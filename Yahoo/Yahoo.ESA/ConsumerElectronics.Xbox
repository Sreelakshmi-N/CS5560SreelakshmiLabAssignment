xbox new heatsink models i'm about to buy an xbox and am wondering if i should wait till the end of august or september i hear rumors of new xbox models coming out with the new nm falcon chip to help on overheating when are they coming out would the new models cost more than the normal ones do now or the same microsoft is still not completely sure of the ring of death problem as last i heard so adding the heatsinks may only be a bandaid to a quality control problem meaning the ring of death issue could be related to a manufacturing problem and not an overheating problem so getting a unit with a heatsink may or may not reduce your chances for the ring of death later that is until microsoft can nail down the issue with the hardware  PlayStation 2 PowerPC Xbox Commodore 64 ATI Technologies PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Computer cooling NVIDIA RISC MOSFET Radeon Ethernet X86 Atari ST IBM PC compatible Nintendo GameCube Game programming CPU design Amiga Sega Saturn CPU cooling NX bit Computer and video games Nintendo Console wars Nintendo Revolution Nintendo Entertainment System Halo 2 Ford Falcon Video game console Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Hard disk Modchip Laserdisc Armored Core Overclocking Rambus Kenwood Electronics Game controller Apple II family Counter-Strike ZX Spectrum Sound Blaster Halo: Combat Evolved Heat sink F-16 Fighting Falcon Super Nintendo Entertainment System MIPS architecture MP3 Pinball Microsoft GeForce FX Mach kernel History of Microsoft Windows Car handling Inflation Universal Serial Bus TurboGrafx 16 Video game crash of 1983 Apple Macintosh Amstrad CPC Information Technology Infrastructure Library TRS-80 3dfx Thermal power station E85 Sega Blue screen of death Just In Time Northbridge (computing) RuneScape weapons Microprogram Mouse (computing) IMac Sinclair ZX81 Device driver Windows Vista CPU cache TRS-80 Color Computer Video game music Electronic Arts Xbox Live SoundStorm Intel History of operating systems Floppy disk Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas SCO-Linux controversies AmigaOS IPod History of computer and video games VIA C3 Database management system Timeline of computing 1990-forward Sega Dreamcast Turbocharger Microsoft Windows

can somebody tell me why my xbox the old one is freezing up and makes a humming sound when i play a game i was playing one of my old games nba live and it kept freezing up and making a humming sound and i would have to turn off my whole system off everytime and i gets on my nerves first check to see if it freezes on the same game at the same point etc if that is happening then most likely it is the cd itself or the reader on the dvd drive second it might be the fan you are hearing and the xbox could be overheating if you are leaving the xbox on a rug where most of the heat is absorbed that could be a problem try putting it up on a hard surface those rubber feet definitely help too keep it up to air out finally if it is still freezing i would send it in if you still have the warranty replace the fan or get a larger one if you feel up to voiding your warranty and placing it yourself or clean replace the dvd reader if after all that it still isn't working i would upgrade to a or replace the xbox but that seems like a lot of money so good luck  Xbox Xbox 360 Modchip DVD PlayStation 2 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Counter-Strike New York Knicks Playoff Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Video game music Computer and video games Xbox Live PlayStation 3 Heinkel He 100 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Table tennis Futurama (TV series - season 5) Grand Theft Auto III Warranty Hyperthermia Halo 2 Engine cooling Motorcycle Nintendo GameCube Vacuum tube Game controller Rare (video game company) Mattress Items in the Metroid series Ice hockey Los Angeles Clippers Sonic the Hedgehog Tire Solar power GoldenEye 007 Hard disk Monopoly (game) Overclocking Poker jargon Tag Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Equine conformation Paintball The Price Is Right ZX Spectrum NBA Finals Van Halen Sega Dreamcast The Joker's Wild New York Giants DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Commodore Plus/4 Star Wars: Galaxies Bass guitar DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Ecco the Dolphin Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks IBM PC compatible Thermal power station New Jersey Nets DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Nintendo Entertainment System Mars Exploration Rover Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Yao Ming 1957 World Series Blood on the Tracks Deus Ex: Invisible War Fable (video game) Video game console Movie projector Betting (poker) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Baseball Stars Console wars National Basketball Association Punisher Dance Dance Revolution Yu-Gi-Oh!

found a website that pepole sell for cheap theres this website call craigs list com and pplz sell there items and stuff that they dont want for like example this guy was selling his xbox like with conrollers and games included should i trust that webiste everybody on there is selling there stuff that they they want answer my question when u go visit the web site craigslists have been around for a long time and im going to say they are safer to buy from then say ebay the reason is because these people listing products are local you take them the cash they had you the merchandise if you are smart about it theres a very slim chance the people can sell you a defected item if you are going to buy the wii go over to the guys house and plug it in to make sure that everything works now craigslist on non local items unless you know someone in the area that can make a trip out there for you i wouldnt bother buying anything because its probably far less secure then ebay  Craigslist Neopets Amazon.com Web traffic Live 8 Internet fraud Arbitrage Electronic commerce MAME RuneScape cheats Bulk vending ROM image GunBound Google Maps Retailer Wheel of Fortune Homestar Runner Matrix scheme Monopoly (game) $ale of the Century Xbox 360 PE ratio The Long Tail Phishing Fry's Electronics Online auction business model Mutual fund MapleStory Network effect Attack of the Show!

what is your opinion of lost planet for xbox excellent graphics good mix of on foot shooting and mechs but it's somewhat short it's meant to be replayed a lot i just find the game somewhat cheap on later difficulties since your energy bar thing decreases rapidly that you constantly have to keep at a good pace collecting every single chunk of energy that you can spoilers maybe also as a heads up the last level is a pain to do even on normal difficulty since you've been playing the whole game being accustomed to the many mechs in the game and out of nowhere you're thrown into this gundam type mech you have no clue how to use and you soon have to fight this cheap boss  Fast bowling Pump It Up GoldenEye 007 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Halo: Combat Evolved Ecco the Dolphin Pikmin MechAssault Advance Wars: Dual Strike Halo 2 MechWarrior Metroid Prime BattleTech technology Computer and video game genres Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner Blood (computer game) Gradius Doom enemies Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising Mecha Lightsaber Dance Dance Revolution Bubble Bobble Stars!

why has my xbox got the error code i am another sufferer of the red ring of death the last thing i did was upload another audio cd into the hard drive then i turned the system off i turned on my system minutes later and bang red lights i leave my xbox off for a while turn it back on and sometimes it works if im lucky i did the error code procedure when you press and hold the eject button with the search button on the console i got the error i have been doing a bit of research and people have been saying that kind of error code is a dvd drive error maybe the dvd drive doesn't like audio cd's or something but i know it probably isn't the gpu because when im lucky and the xbox turns on i boot call of duty and plays fine doesnt crash at all i just dont understand how my xbox can break from months of usage and i bearly touch the thing anyway the manufacture date is if nothing works out i am hoping to get a replacement from the place i bought it from got any ideas about that error you know it's funny people tell you oh this is how to find out what the error code is but then they don't tell you what to do with that information maybe that is why microsoft didn't set it up so you could just find out online or something because the average user can't do anything knowing that code on the other hand microsoft can fix some problems simply by seeing what the error code is hence why it is easy to find out if you know how my point is why did someone waste the time to say oh this is how you find the error code as if it matters in the end you call them up have them send you the coffin and they will then send you a replacement system  Xbox Xbox 360 Computer virus PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 DVD Modem Nintendo Revolution Mouse (computing) Blue screen of death Modchip Windows Vista System/36 Debugging Nintendo Entertainment System Game programming Nintendo GameCube Compact disc Microsoft Pump It Up AmigaOS Computer and video games System/34 Floppy disk NVIDIA Mozilla Firefox Sega Dreamcast Windows 2000 Nintendo Morse Code Error correction and detection Pinball Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Embedded system Linux Halo: Combat Evolved Booting Objective-C Domain Name System Copy protection ZX Spectrum Mortal Kombat Musical Instrument Digital Interface Timeline of computing 1990-forward Opera (web browser) Commodore 64 E-mail Knoppix Console wars Bubble Bobble Expert system MS-DOS GameFAQs Computer numbering formats Poker jargon MDAC Sega IPod Mach kernel Atari 8-bit family ATI Technologies Apollo Guidance Computer Intellivision Oscilloscope Software bug History of operating systems The Sims 2 X86 SCO-Linux controversies Ajax (programming) 1957 World Series Grand Theft Auto III Visual Basic Lisp programming language Fischer Random Chess Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Phantasy Star Online 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Alien (film) SCART NX bit Drag racing Toyota Prius Disk image Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Laserdisc Apple II family

hi is it worth buying the darkness has anyone play it played it for the it has really good graphics and there is nothing better then sending out your creeping darkness to rip the heart out of someone who decided to attack you it's set up like a fps but has alot of elements from rpgs you level up your darkness powers by as mentioned above eating the hearts of people that cross your path you can summon little creatures called darklings and set them loose on people the only thing i didn't like is that there is alot of backtracking you can go anywhere at anytime by using the subway station so its a big world to explore and also to go the wrong way in but all that aside it is a really good game i really liked it but i always recommend renting before buying  Computer role-playing game Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories First-person shooter Game engine Summon magic (Final Fantasy) Role-playing game Samus Aran Poker jargon Golden Sun Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Yu-Gi-Oh!

what is a realistic time i can expect my xbox back from repair just recently sent my console in for repairs last week and the call center told me to expect my system back in weeks is this realistic considering the number of repairs that must be coming in since they announced the warranty extension month from the date of sending it oh yeah if you have been affected by the ring of death or sumthing they will change the console but i feel that they will give a console which has been sent to them by another customer and yours might go to his so both of you get defective ones again this seems quite possible cos there no way u will find out and the serial number changes too  Nintendo Revolution Xbox 360 Xbox Computer role-playing game Warranty Video game console Game programming Nintendo Entertainment System PowerPC Doom 3 Sega Dreamcast First-person shooter Dead or Alive (video game) PlayStation 3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Xbox Live Colony in Space The Five Doctors The Daleks' Master Plan StarCraft: Ghost Counter-Strike EastEnders PlayStation 2 Leasehold estate Console wars Nintendo Star Wars: Galaxies Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Modchip Microsoft Advance Wars: Dual Strike Trigonometric function History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Nintendo DS Universal Serial Bus Game programmer Hurricane Katrina timeline NVIDIA BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Sega Hurricane Rita Console game John Sheridan (Babylon 5) TARDIS Trish Stratus ATI Technologies Kurt Angle History of video games (Seventh generation era) Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Doctor Who (Enemy Within) The Sims 2 Need for Speed Halo 2 Rare (video game company) Bond Particle in a box DragonFly BSD Stone Cold Steve Austin The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Ron Weasley Sega Saturn Airbus A380 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) She Loves You Complex number Game controller Sonic the Hedgehog Console emulator Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 game) King of Fighters Lonely Among Us (TNG episode) Manitoba Hydro Usher (entertainer) Game Boy Advance Digital circuit The Empty Child Nintendo GameCube Sony Computer Entertainment Final Fantasy Electronic Arts Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Rampart (arcade game) Home computer Pyramids of Mars 3D projection Inferno (Doctor Who) Billboard Hot 100 Loss leader Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hall & Oates Light gun Product liability Hurricane Katrina effects by region Pregnancy Computer and video games The Masque of Mandragora Mercury Atlas 6

xbox elite what the heck is hdmi what difference does it make is it really good or just same hdmi stands for high definition multimedia interface and its main advantage is combining your video and audio signal into one cord instead of the usual three i e the red yellow white or red green blue cords high definition signals are digital you xbox will output a digital signal and if you have component or composite cables it will be converted to an analog signal and then when your hdtv recieves it it will convert it back to digital all this converting can cause a drop in visual and or audio quality hdmi on the other hand transfers a digital signal so there's no converting back and forth between digital and audio and therefore no drop in quality and the ability to transfer a full p signal a sidenote hdmi does allow digital surround sound output but the xbox elite was made with a a hdmi port which doesn't support just if you have an hdtv that can do full p it'll make a noticeable difference if you have an p hdtv and a slightly trained eye it'll make some difference if you don't have an hdtv you can't use hdmi so don't bother unless you want the bigger hard drive  DVD Xbox Laserdisc Television High-definition television High-Definition Multimedia Interface SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital Visual Interface Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Sound Blaster RGB color model Nintendo GameCube Compact disc Digital television Analog-to-digital converter Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo Revolution YUV Digital video recorder Audiophile Digital-to-analog converter High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Atari 8-bit family Electronic amplifier PlayStation Portable Sound recording Musical Instrument Digital Interface Synthesizer RCA connector Home cinema Dolby Digital 8 mm video format Enterprise content management Electronic filter Sound card Digital cinematography NTSC ITU-T MP3 Digital signal processing Oscilloscope ATI Technologies Video Sega Dreamcast ATSC Digital cable Digital video Digital cinema FireWire IPod Windows Vista Audio data compression Electrophysiology Original Amiga chipset Gramophone record Amstrad CPC Speech synthesis TiVo MPEG-2 Video codec Betacam VHS Timeline of computing 1990-forward Game controller Composite video Game programmer Decibel DVB Satellite television Modem Voice over IP Video game music 1080p S__CAM MOS Technology SID Transistor Vacuum tube Stereoscopy Gamut Warez Digital audio workstation MiniDisc Nintendo Entertainment System DV Digital recording SoundStorm Widescreen Trusted computing Bluetooth DVD recorder

best place to snipe in call of duy in multiplayer what is the best place to be a scout i love sniping people down but can you tell me some good places there is a path somewhere in the forest its along the side so go towards the right and the path will lead to a trail going up the side of a mountain you can snipe people from there but you will probably be shot back at so make sure you keep going higher and higher until you see a cave once you get to the place you can jump on top of the big rocks jump onto the cave and there will be another trail that leads you to a ramp way up in the sky which is like a loop just stand on top of it and noone can shoot you from there it's also smart to throw time bombs down at people but make sure they are set for longer then seconds or they will blow up in the air  Dog agility Volleyball Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling throws Long Path Mario Kart 64 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Aerial (dance move) Syphon Filter Quake III Arena Descent (computer game) GoldenEye 007 Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Super Mario Bros.

can i ensure that the new xbox i buy is the improved model i know there are newer 's with a different chipset and improved heatsink so it doesn't crap out how can i tell the one i want to buy is of the newest stock and not an older one that's been on the shelves for a long time thank you i want to play halo and grand theft auto when they come out can't do that with a ps i don't know of a surefire way to do this without opening the which would violate your warranty i'm sure eventually someone will figure out how to tell by looking at the manufacturing stickers or the id that's visible on the package i'm sure places like joystiq or other gaming sites will post this once they know according to this article from joystiq the has been shipping with the newer nm cpu and improved heatsink part of the hw revision codenamed 'falcon' for about months now so this should mean that the s on the shelf now are using the new hardware this is also supported by the ever inrcreasing possibility of a xbox price cut in a few weeks since the new processor is much cheaper to produce in addition to being much cooler if you don't have a yet wait a few weeks according to an advance copy of circuit city's flyer the premium will be dropping the core will drop and the elite will drop there are also plans for an even smaller cooler cheaper processor but that won't start manufacturing until mid or so meaning we probably won't see it on shelves until late at the earliest microsoft is confident that the new hardware has fixed the rrod problem that plagued the earlier models and will still give you a year warranty so i think the nm model is safe to buy  PlayStation 2 Xbox Radeon Overclocking History of Microsoft Windows Central processing unit Commodore 64 IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 NVIDIA PowerPC Xbox 360 Atari ST CPU design Amiga Windows Vista AMD Windows XP Apple Macintosh RISC Pentium 4 Mac OS X 3dfx Timeline of computing 1990-forward History of computer and video games GeForce 6 Series Apple Computer NX bit Hot Coffee mod Celeron Sound Blaster Apple II family Wintel Jack Thompson Digital Equipment Corporation Console wars Electronic Arts Sega Dreamcast Laserdisc Microprocessor CPU cache Neo-Geo IPod Computer cooling Warranty Hard disk Pentium M Microsoft Windows Grand Theft Auto III TurboGrafx 16 Modchip Video game crash of 1983 X86 Counter-Strike DragonFly BSD Sega Saturn GeForce FX Cyrix Halo 2 Pentium D Apple IIGS Creative Zen Game programming VIA C3 Linux kernel Ashton-Tate Wal-Mart ZX Spectrum Floppy disk Nintendo DS PC motherboard DR-DOS Microsoft Computer PDP-11 Formula One Sega 32X History of video games (Sixth generation era) Athlon TRS-80 Color Computer Original Amiga chipset Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Advance Microprogram Mouse (computing) AmigaOS Windows 3.x 64-bit Game Boy E85 Mach kernel

questions about the xbox do you really use the hard drive for anything if you don't plan on playing games over xbox live if you don't have high speed internet is it just there for game saves or does it have another purpose how long is the cord on the wired controller i very rarely play games on xbox live but i think my would be useless without it's hard drive you need it for saves and to play original xbox games btw no you don't need a high speed connection to play original games you can download the update from xbox com and burn it to a cd the cord on the controller is about feet but if you get the premium or elite which is what i suggest they come with a wireless controller  Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Xbox Live Modchip Computer and video games Halo: Combat Evolved Halo (video game series) Game controller Universal Serial Bus Halo 2 Mouse (computing) Rare (video game company) Console wars IGN PlayStation 2 Nintendo The Sims 2 Nintendo GameCube LAN party Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pump It Up Game programmer Counter-Strike Need for Speed Damn Small Linux Action Replay Verizon Wireless ITunes PlayStation Portable Project Gotham Racing 2 Steam (content delivery) Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Super Nintendo Entertainment System Bluetooth Toe Jam & Earl Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Sega Dreamcast Electronic Arts Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Bungie Studios Windows XP Arcade cabinet Volleyball The Sims IPod Sega Video game music Broadband Internet access Shadowrun Microsoft Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Revolution Software MAME Microsoft Game Studios Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Game Boy Advance Floppy disk Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Karaoke Ninja Gaiden Sega Saturn Resident Evil (video game) GoldenEye Redundant array of independent disks Softball Beatmania IIDX America's Army Domestic AC power plugs and sockets GoldenEye 007 Internet Star Wars: Battlefront II Shadow the Hedgehog WiMAX Violin OutRun 2 Sonic Mega Collection Plus Neverwinter Nights Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Dance Dance Revolution Tony Hawk's American Wasteland Internet service provider Nintendo Entertainment System Warez Table tennis Internet slang PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Machinima Operation Flashpoint True Crime: Streets of LA Spy Hunter Pinball Star Wars: Galaxies Sonic Adventure Video game console Modem Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven Intellivision

is there anyway to move your memory for an xbox to a xbox can i move all my saved games from my xbox to an xbox elite since it can do backwards compatibility ok this is ironic yesterday i was trying to do the same thing generally at ebgames and gamestop they sell transfer kits that have a usb output cord on one end and a place for your xbox memory card generally you'll be able to put your xbox data onto that then with the computer they give the software you can plug the usb part into your computer and transfer the data into a folder then you use another usb device with a place for your xbox memory unit and you simply drag and drop the folder into your memory unit all on the computer like i said earlier they sell them for like bucks at gamestop one word of warning generally the xbox memory card only has blocks many game saves are way more then that so you'll never be able to transfer them anyway i suggest checking the size of your saves before purchasing it  PlayStation 3 Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 IPod Xbox USB flash drive Modchip Computer bus Nintendo Revolution Secure Digital card N-Gage Floppy disk Bluetooth FireWire PlayStation Portable Nintendo GameCube Commodore 64 Personal computer Action Replay Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mouse (computing) Atari 8-bit family History of Microsoft Windows Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Dreamcast CompactFlash File Allocation Table Computer and video games Computer hardware Windows XP PowerPC USB mass storage device class Hard disk Windows 2000 Intellivision Apple II family Flash memory Game Boy Advance Desktop computer Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Saturn Sinclair ZX81 Dongle Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Game Boy PIC microcontroller Apple Macintosh Sound card Computer Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Atari ST SCSI Console wars Macintosh Finder X86 Sony Computer Entertainment Computer forensics CPU design Booting Memory Stick Sega CPU cache Nintendo ATI Technologies Sound Blaster IBM PC compatible Console game System/36 IMac Digital audio player X86 assembly language Digital circuit PC card PC Engine IBM PC Java programming language Digital photography Commodore International Digital camera RISC Windows Vista Atari 2600 ZX Spectrum ITunes Emulator Laptop C programming language Acorn Electron Knoppix Word (computer science)

i want to but the xbox but i want to know if it is worth my money i want to know that if i were to buy one that i would have fun with it the main reason i want it is because of halo but i want to know if that is enough reason to invest in it i use this for all questions like this so it may not suit your question perfectly but this is all my opinion so the doens't have too many games that appeal to me that are exclusives dead rising i didn't really care for halo never a big fan seemed like an average shooter game to me mass effect seems kinda cool but it's not a game that makes me wanna run out and buy for my brothers gears of war is the only game i really liked but it was kinda short and to me doesn't really have much replay value and the hardest mode was pretty cool all the multiplatform games are really the only games that i look forward to on that system ps has the exclusives that appeal to me such as lair killzone ffxiii and versus mgs white knight story warhawk kingdom hearts iii gow iii and heavenly sword are a couple the multiplatfrom games are cool assassins creed call to duty army of two kane lynch dmc the last remnants and a few others are cool and i will get those for my ps plus it can play all my other ps games so i can finish playing those as those games come out all this is completely my opinion so this only appeals to people with similiar taste in games and genres so to answer your question the is better right now since it has a good sized amount of available games while the ps only a has a few but the future games to come out will be much better for sony since the games that are coming soon are the big dogs for that console as for graphics most multiplatform games tend to look better on the and it's kinda obvious since the has been out longer than the ps so companies are familiar with that system so for sony to get games that look better lair than the majority of other games now is pretty good plus it's a more advanced system with blu ray discs that hold more data the online community i don't really care for so xbox live and home don't really matter to me if you do like that then you get free internet with sony the ps remote will be getting the rumble feature back also  Halo: Combat Evolved PlayStation 3 Xbox Computer and video games First-person shooter PlayStation 2 Halo 2 Counter-Strike Xbox 360 Computer role-playing game Sega Halo (video game series) Nintendo GameCube Sega Dreamcast Poker jargon Video game music Killzone Video game controversy Machinima Final Fantasy XI Microsoft Rare (video game company) Dead or Alive (video game) Xbox Live Gradius Computer and video game genres History of computer and video games The Sims TurboGrafx 16 Game controller Grand Theft Auto III Guilty Gear Console wars Action Replay History of video games (Sixth generation era) Team Fortress Classic Theory of conduct Sega Saturn Quake III Arena Legacy of Kain MAME Console game Resident Evil Modchip Game programming Massively multiplayer online game Resident Evil (video game) Floppy disk Metal Gear Solid: Integral Double Dragon Sony Computer Entertainment Karaoke Baldur's Gate series Bungie Studios Max Payne Platform game Game engine Jack Thompson Game Critics Awards GoldenEye 007 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Super Robot Wars Square Enix Need for Speed Pinball Wipeout (game) America's Army The Legend of Zelda series Thunder Force Golden Age of Arcade Games Grand Theft Auto: Vice City The Sims 2 Metal Gear Final Fantasy IX Super Nintendo Entertainment System Ninja Gaiden Chrono Trigger Bish__jo game Nintendo 64 Nine Inch Nails Timeline of computing 1990-forward Copy protection Ren and Stimpy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Amstrad CPC

xbox multiplayer games i know that there are plenty of xbox games that offer multiplayer gaming whether it be multiplayer on a single console or multiplayer over xbox live but i was wondering if there are any good multiplayer games that allow both console and xbox live multiplayer simultaneously for example my little bro i are playing on my console but my fiancee who lives in brasil is playing on hers all of us want to play together but my bro doesn't have his own console so he has to play on mine with me so my question is are there any good games which allow multiple players on one console and allow those multiple players to connect to xbox live and play in the same game with people over xbox live thank you ahh yes that's one thing i meant to mention it can be an xbox game as well so long as it is one of the games that is compatible with the thank you for your answer ny my girlfriend and i play on one console while we play with friends over xbox live so split screen multiplayer support is an important feature for us i'm sure there are many games that would appeal to you but the following is a list of games we enjoy ghost recon advanced warfighter and its sequel for the xbox includes split screen and guest accounts can play there are many different game types to choose from you and your friends can play in co op mode against enemy ai or play against each other halo classic xbox game compatible with the xbox includes split screen and supports up to four players per console including guest accounts you can team up against other players over xbox live or play private matches amongst yourselves bomberman live you'll find this game in the xbox live arcade it's a cute and addictive game split screen is not necessary and up to eight players can play at once you can turn on off the ai and there are many different game types to choose from you can download a trial version rainbow six vegas allows you to play co op games in split screen for local play but not over xbox live please note the enemy ai uses harsh adult language they cuss a lot gears of war features a two player co op campaign on both local and online while the versus mode allows up to eight players on in matchmaking you can save a few dollars buying used games but you can also rent or download the demo trial versions of the games first good luck  Xbox Live Halo 2 Multiplayer Xbox 360 First-person shooter Xbox Computer and video games Nintendo Halo: Combat Evolved Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Counter-Strike Need for Speed America's Army Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Computer role-playing game PlayStation 3 Nintendo DS Pump It Up Dead or Alive (video game) Nintendo GameCube Game Boy PlayStation Portable Bubble Bobble Super Mario Bros.
