spirit of eden from talk talk what's your take first i have to admit i haven't heard the whole thing my friend makes cds for me and sometimes he doesn't even label the tracks i knew some of the songs i was hearing on that particular cd were mark hollis so i asked if it was talk talk or another project and he told me that three of the tracks on that particular disc are talk talk taken from an album called spirit of eden i only know the name of one of the tracks and it's called i think the rainbow so just remember that my comments are limited in scope there are several bands that come to mind right now that do the same thing for me which is basically paint pictures and textures with sound a few of them paint a very specific place for me midnight oil always paints a picture of the australian outback to me the the always paints a picture of a fairly dingy room somewhere in a four story walk up in london the kind where you only get hot water once in a while big country paints pictures of scotland for me with big wide open spaces or tiny cottages in small towns depending on the music old music by the cure is similarly atmospheric to me but it doesn't put me in an extremely specific place well songs like a forest do but they're supposed to aren't they and the cocteau twins paint pictures too but those are mainly done with voices not with musical instruments anyway that's what the songs from spirit of eden do for me the first one i heard and i don't know the name made me think of all sorts of things different images went through my head as i was listening a smoky bar with what my mother would call a rinky tinky piano an old upright with a twinkly sound being outside at dusk under a tree lying in a field smelling flowers at night you can smell the flowers better after the sun goes down did you know that all sorts of things really the thing that was interesting to me is that i don't get the same images every time peter gabriel did the music for the film the last temptation of christ and he used a lot of middle eastern source music so it has a definite feel but it is a consistent feel for me it always feels like heat and dust and the smell of olive trees the tracks i have heard from spirit of eden seem to have more to do with how i am feeling at a given time the pictures and textures are very strong but i never know what i am going to get it's also a bit surprising to me because while i get different moods from most music it usually has to do with the voices hence the bands i listed above where with the exception of the cocteau twins the mood comes from the music only if you removed the vocal tracks i would still get those pictures i don't know how much of it comes from knowing intellectually where the music came from and how much comes from the way the music sounds but i am digressing so my take is that they have turned into an interesting band and have learned to paint with sound also one of the tracks always makes me feel like it's raining somewhere but i am not sure if that's a sound on the track that i am not hearing clearly or if it's really there but it does always make me think here comes the rain and that's the only thing that i always get from it i am sorry i can't offer more or a better opinion but i am working with a limited palette  Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Music Social rule Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Boards of Canada Sampling (music) The Emancipation of Mimi A Day in the Life Mixtape The Church The Chemical Brothers The Band Music genre Blonde on Blonde Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Tori Amos Cocteau Twins John Cage Rod Stewart Infidels Sly & the Family Stone Faye Wong The Cure Roxette John Frusciante Pink Floyd trivia Garth Brooks Compact disc Gramophone record The Shining (film) Sheryl Crow Karaoke Highway 61 Revisited The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Gothic rock The Isley Brothers Charly Garc__a "Weird Al" Yankovic The Joshua Tree Joy Division (band) Spice Girls Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Roy Orbison Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.

how do you think spoon's new album 'ga ga ga ga ga' compare to their album 'gimme fiction' i think their new album is actually just as good if not better than 'gimme fiction' seems less commercial more substantial but thats probably because all their old music ended up in commercials lol i still think kill the moonlight and gimme fiction are better albums but ga ga ga ga has really impressed me since i heard in live a couple times the album is a real grower and as always a very fine album from a very talented band the new album is sparse in musical style but some of the lyrics are incredible in don t you evah and black like me  The Cure ABBA Me First & the Gimme Gimmes Lynyrd Skynyrd Spoon (band) The Ashlee Simpson Show The Marshall Mathers LP The Blues Brothers The Basement Tapes Cover version E-Rotic Tina Turner Quarashi Trance music Herbie Hancock Jefferson Airplane The Waterboys Tony Bennett 10cc The Rutles Black Eyed Peas Blur Jennifer Lopez Van Halen The Isley Brothers Stairway to Heaven Pet Sounds Ozzy Osbourne Kraftwerk Metallica Red Hot Chili Peppers Elton John Frank Zappa Roxette Guns N' Roses Jethro Tull (band) Iggy Pop Van Morrison Prince (artist) Concept album The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle Kylie Minogue R.E.M.
