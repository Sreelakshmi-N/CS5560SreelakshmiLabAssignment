how can i get the school to give my yr old diabetes his lunchtime blood sugar test the principle of the school verbally refuses ontario canada could i legally get the school to accept this of giving a simple blood sugar test they will not get aids or infected of anything and it's only one time a day that they would have to do it also it will be a bit hard for me to go to his school everyday as i will be busy and there would be no one to get my yr old daughter from her school bus stop half day kindergarten she will be having morning kindergarten everyday mon fri thanku in advance for your help on this the school doesn't have a school nurse and thank you those are very helpful informative answers i'll try with of teaching him to eventually learn to do a test on his own and get active with the diabetes association here and hopefully get the school educated of it it's kind of nuts as well bcause i live in the capital city of canada but i'm not meaning to dis my country it's a great country lol you can train your son to self test but you would still need school permission to do so you wouldn't want them to think he is doing something against school policy then confiscate his equipment the downside risk is too great get active with your local diabetes association get to know their patient advocacy officer and work toward changing school attitudes or the law in the us there are still problems with this even with a federal law prohibiting discrimination against americans with disabilities often the issue is lack of education about diabetes your local diabetes association can help with this as well  Education in the United States Separation of church and state Stroke Diabetes mellitus Vegetarianism Prostate cancer Kindergarten Diabetic retinopathy Breastfeeding First aid Nurse Education in the People's Republic of China Medicine Lawyer Education in Hong Kong Hyperglycemia Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Extreme Programming HIV test Pet skunk Charter school Israeli Arab Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina GED Public education Myocardial infarction Dyslexia Civil rights Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Insulin Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Abortion NAACP Insulin resistance Divorce Surveillance Psychology Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Brown v.

if a non diabetic is injected with insulin can they counter the effects by eating sweets i saw it in a movie the guy injected the girl and went out in the balconey she ate chocolates and jumped off the balconey and ran i meant balcony well it depends i wouldn't put too much faith on hollywood depictions of medicine as it's much more likely to be shaped by what the director feels is dramatically correct rather than factually correct however to an extent taking more sugar can reduce the effect that insulin would have on a person the function of insulin and i'm oversimplifying here it has other effects as well is to direct the body to take sugar out of the bloodstream and put it into tissues mostly muscle and fat tissue this is a normal response to eating sugar and healthy the complete lack of insulin will without treatment cause a fairly quick death due to a condition called ketoacidosis now if there is too much insulin say caused by injecting a large amount into someone then they body will take too much sugar out of the bloodstream which can cause hypoglycemia which can lead to unconsciousness seizures coma and death so if someone was injected with a large amount of insulin and then immediately put more sugar in the bloodstream although a lot would be removed the remainder might be enough to allow the person to stay in the normal range and escape the worst effects now this is the part that depends what will happen will be determined be the amount of insulin and the amount of sugar as well as how fast the sugar gets into the bloodstream if you get injected with hundreds of units of insulin taking a chocolate bar isn't going to do anything you need iv sugar in sterile saline and in large quantities immediately so would a scene like you're describing play out the way it did in the movie probably not but in principal it's not completely wrong just mostly  Diabetic ketoacidosis Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stroke Insulin resistance Diabetic coma Glucokinase Glycogen storage disease type I Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Diabetic hypoglycemia Hyperglycemia First aid Stomach cancer Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Endocrinology Traumatic brain injury Growth hormone Obesity Memento (film) Growth hormone deficiency Prostate cancer Insulinoma Growth hormone treatment Low-carbohydrate diet Intravenous therapy Fuel injection Clinical depression Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glycogen Urinary incontinence Intensive insulinotherapy Protein LSD Carbon dioxide Polycystic ovary syndrome Milk Gastroparesis Glucocorticoid Aspartame Epilepsy Dialysis Acromegaly Cocaine Dieting Lethal injection Chlorpromazine Puberty Coma Hormone Soft drink Anorexia nervosa Ketosis Psoriasis Route of administration Terri Schiavo Diabetes mellitus type 2 Panic attack Cystic fibrosis Acne Group A streptococcal infection Tooth Ketoacidosis Scar Anti-diabetic drug Maprotiline Decompression sickness Enzyme Pneumonia Weight training Ferret Protein-energy malnutrition Cholesterol Kidney Tooth enamel Paracetamol Allergy Carpal tunnel syndrome Hyperthermia Vitamin C Congenital hyperinsulinism Hamster Adjustable gastric band Homeostasis

trypsin and insulin are the same thing please give me the detail i am a medical school student thanks trypsin is a serine protease found in the digestive system where it breaks down proteins it is used for numerous biotechnological processes trypsin is secreted into the intestine where it acts to hydrolyse proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids this is necessary for the uptake of protein in the food trypsin catalyses the hydrolysis of peptide bonds the enzymatic mechanism is like all other serine proteases a catalytic triad serves to make the active site serine nucleophilic this is achieved by modifying the electrostatic environment of the serine the enzymatic reaction that trypsins catalyze is thermodynamically favorable but requires significant activation energy it is kinetically unfavorable trypsins have an optimal operating ph of about and optimal operating temperature of about c insulin from latin insula island as it is produced in the islets of langerhans in the pancreas is an anabolic polypeptide hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism apart from being the primary agent in carbohydrate homeostasis it has effects on fat metabolism and it changes the liver's activity in storing or releasing glucose and in processing blood lipids and in other tissues such as fat and muscle the amount of insulin in circulation has extremely widespread effects throughout the body please note that i am not a medical professional please see the web pages for more details on trypsin and insulin  Protease Glucose Signal transduction Whole proteome analysis Glucocorticoid Fat Coagulation Dieting Cell (biology) Puberty Diabetic ketoacidosis Liver Protein sequencing Hormone Gastric acid Glycogen storage disease type I Origin of life Bodybuilding Lipase Mass spectrometry Aspartame Glycogen Chymotrypsin Atkins Nutritional Approach Endocrinology Protein-energy malnutrition Amino acid Peptide Serine Citric acid cycle Neurotransmitter Cholesterol Metabolism Growth hormone treatment Glycemic index Glycosylation Cancer Photosynthesis Brewery Digestion Cholecystokinin Cysteine Cirrhosis Vitamin C Carbohydrate Apoptosis Blood sugar Adrenal gland Anabolism Blood Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Atherosclerosis Cellular respiration Anabolic steroid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Epinephrine Hydrolysis Glucagon Low-carbohydrate diet Gelatin Sugar DNA repair Antibody Alcohol Hemoglobin Peptide mass fingerprinting Thyroid hormone Francis Crick Insulin resistance Milk Folic acid Sleep Ketoacidosis RNA world hypothesis

can too much table sugar cause electrolyte unbalance normally no sugar is not an electrolyte examples of electrolytes are calcium magnesium potassium and sodium there are many causes for an electrolyte imbalance such as loss of body fluids from prolonged vomiting diarrhea sweating or high fever inadequate diet and lack of vitamins from food malabsorption hormonal or endocrine disorders or kidney disease however if you have abnormally high blood sugar levels a metabolic shift can occur where cells throughout the body empty their electrolytes sodium potassium and phosphate into the bloodstream electrolytes control the fluid balance of the body and are important in muscle contraction energy generation and almost all major biochemical reactions in the body as a result of electrolyte imbalance many functions can become impaired to my knowledge this is only happens with hyperglycemia also known as diabetic ketoacidosis is a condition that develops over a period of a few days as the blood glucose levels of a type or type diabetic gradually rise ketoacidosis occurs when increasing glucose levels are met by a lack of sufficient or effective insulin production your doctor can check for abnormal blood sugar levels by taking your fasting bloodwork that is taking blood when you haven't eaten for hours  Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypomagnesemia Folic acid Glucokinase Diabetes insipidus Diabetic coma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Glucocorticoid Metabolic acidosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Hypertension Hyperglycemia Blood sugar Gastroparesis Stroke Dehydration Diarrhea Cancer Glycogen Diabetic neuropathy Prostate cancer Biochemistry Atherosclerosis Glucose Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Osteoporosis Pneumonia Kidney Blood Anemia Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Coeliac disease Obstetrics Action potential Renal physiology Growth hormone Edible salt Bodybuilding Obesity Haemochromatosis Protein Milk Ketoacidosis Clinical depression Aspartame Endocrinology Glycemic index Rhabdomyolysis Dietary fiber Vitamin C Weight training Chlorpromazine Ketosis Potassium Growth hormone treatment Alzheimer's disease Sleep Growth hormone deficiency Thyroid Medicine Tocopherol Signal transduction Gout Hyperkalemia Sugar Rickets Vitamin D Red blood cell Puberty Hormone Clozapine Senescence Tooth Sulfonylurea Diabetic nephropathy Blood test Multiple sclerosis Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Acromegaly Glycemia

gestational diabetes ok so today i got a phone call from the nurse at the doctors office telling me that i failed my hour test she said that of the came back elevated and that the worse out of all was the one that was up to my sugar level i did everything i was suppose to and still i failed i am really nervous about the health of our baby now i have read and heard from many people that this pregnancy related complication can cause you to have an extremely large baby and that it can cause other health issue if it isnt well watched for the remainder of the pregnancy i have a home health nurse coming out to get me all set up with my equipment to start testing my self i have to test times a day atleast and watch what i eat does anyone know what i can eat if anything i was to no high carbs and no sugar but what else do i need to watch out for please anyone that has had this tell me what you did i want to get a start on things now before the nurse shows up diabetes and the gastrointestinal tract james d wolosin md facp and steven v edelman md gastrointestinal gi disorders are common among all people including those affected by diabetes at some point in any patient's life the chances that he or she will develop a gi tract problem be it peptic ulcer disease gallstones irritable bowel syndrome food poisoning or some other malady are extremely high as many as of patients visiting diabetes clinics will report significant gi symptoms the entire gi tract can be affected by diabetes from the oral cavity and esophagus to the large bowel and anorectal region thus the symptom complex that may be experienced can vary widely common complaints may include dysphagia early satiety reflux constipation abdominal pain nausea vomiting and diarrhea many patients go undiagnosed and under treated because the gi tract has not been traditionally associated with diabetes and its complications both acute and chronic hyperglycemia can lead to specific gi complications diabetes is a systemic disease that may affect many organ systems and the gi tract is no exception as with other complications of diabetes the duration of the disorder and poor glycemic control seem to be associated with more severe gi problems patients with a history of retinopathy nephropathy or neuropathy should be presumed to have gi abnormalities until proven otherwise and this is best determined by asking a few simple questions see patient information many gi complications of diabetes seem to be related to dysfunction of the neurons supplying the enteric nervous system just as the nerves in the feet may be affected in peripheral neuropathy involvement of the intestinal nerves may lead to enteric neuropathy this is a type of autonomic or involuntary neuropathy and may lead to abnormalities in intestinal motility sensation secretion and absorption different nerve fibers can either stimulate or inhibit intestinal motility and function and damage to these nerves can lead to a slowing or acceleration of intestinal function giving rise to a variable symptom complex this article will highlight the most common gi disorders seen in people with diabetes the esophagus and stomach in diabetes gastroparesis diabetic gastroparesis is a condition in which emptying of food from the stomach is delayed leading to retention of stomach contents this may cause bloating early satiety distention abdominal pain nausea or vomiting gastric stasis may lead to worsening gastroesophageal reflux along with symptoms of heartburn and mechanical regurgitation of gastric contents in addition fatty foods and very fibrous foods normally exit the stomach slowly and may be poorly tolerated the diagnosis of gastroparesis is often suspected on the basis of symptoms alone upper gi endoscopy is helpful to rule out anatomic obstruction of the stomach or duodenum but does not provide an accurate physiological assessment of gastric emptying upper gi barium studies may confirm delayed gastric emptying with a dilated atonic aperistaltic stomach with retained gastric contents however the upper gi series is more commonly nondiagnostic because liquids may empty normally from the stomach in spite of severe abnormalities in the ability to empty solid materials from the stomach into the duodenum the nuclear medicine gastric emptying test is the best confirmatory test for evaluation of gastroparesis a test solid food meal containing a technetium isotopic tracer is ingested and scintography is used to quantitatively measure the rate of gastric emptying this test is highly sensitive and specific although false positives and negatives may occur in response to medications that accelerate or slow the rate of gastric emptying when performing initial diagnostic testing it is best to measure gastric emptying rates when patients are off of medications that may affect the rate of gastric emptying several different treatments may provide benefit in the management of diabetic gastroparesis consumption of frequent small meals may provide some symptomatic relief avoidance of high fat and high fiber foods may be beneficial as well it is common to recommend a liquid diet during an exacerbation of gastroparesis as symptoms worsen parenteral hydration and alimentation may be required nasogastric tube suction may also be used during severe episodes numerous medications have been shown to provide some benefit in the treatment of gastroparesis metclopropamide reglan is a dopaminergic antagonist that enhances gastric emptying and has primary antiemetic properties unfortunately it crosses the blood brain barrier and causes frequent neurological side effects such as sedation tremor confusion dystonia and at times tardive dyskinesia which may or may not reverse after the drug is stopped cisapride propulsid is a prokinetic agent that is very effective at facilitating gastric emptying pharmacological tolerance a problem common with metclopropamide does not seem to occur with cisapride and patient acceptability is excellent the food and drug administration fda has recently placed severe restrictions on the use of cisapride because of the potential for cardiac dysrhythmias due to prolongation of the qt interval this is of particular concern when the medication is taken with agents that delay the metabolism of cisapride such as erythromycin clarithromycin fluconazole idinavir and other agents that inhibit the cytochrome p a system the medication is contraindicated in any individual with a prolonged qt interval and an electrocardiogram should be checked in all individuals in whom therapy with cisapride is being considered concomitant administration of agents that can prolong the qt interval are to be avoided clinically this problem occurs infrequently especially when the prescribing guidelines are followed at this time cisapride is available only through the fda directly and only for patients who have failed other therapies and meet strict criteria for use of the drug domperidone motilium is another dopaminergic antagonist similar to metclopropamide that accelerates gastric emptying but does not cross the blood brain barrier and has very few side effects it is not yet available in the united states but is available in mexico and elsewhere erythromycin has unique properties that stimulate gastric motility and may be beneficial in selected individuals it functions as an agonist of motilin and enhances gastric emptying unfortunately erythromycin has many potential side effects including nausea and may not be well tolerated nonspecific antiemetic agents including prochlorperazine compazine and promethazine phenergan often can provide symptomatic relief of nausea and vomiting there appears to be no substantial benefit for the preferential use of the more expensive ht receptor antagonists such as ondansetron zofran or dolastetron anzemet recently a novel approach to refractory gastroparesis has been to use an implantable gastric pacemaker it has long been recognized that many patients with gastroparesis have abnormal electrical gastric rhythms that may or may not correlate with delayed gastric emptying surgical placement of a gastric pacemaker has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying and provide symptomatic relief in a small number of patients in preliminary uncontrolled clinical trials smoking cessation light postprandial exercise such as walking and dietary manipulation such as eating multiple smaller meals and avoiding high fiber and fatty foods can also improve gastric emptying most importantly careful attention to blood glucose control is essential and can have a tremendous impact on gastroparesis ulcer disease ulcer disease is a common problem in patients with or without diabetes and affects up to of the population at some time during their lives acid irritation of the stomach or esophagus leads to heartburn indigestion and a burning sensation in the upper abdomen or dyspepsia helicobacter pylori the bacteria responsible for most duodenal ulcers and many gastric ulcers is no more common in patients with diabetes than in the general population in fact diabetes itself does not increase one's risk of developing ulcers individuals with ulcers and ulcer like symptoms are treated in the same fashion regardless of whether or not they have diabetes treatment is geared toward suppression of gastric acid secretion with antisecretory medications i e h receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors if h pylori is present it will usually be treated with a specific antibiotic regimen along with anti secretory agents common antibiotic regimens include a week course of amoxacillin amoxil clarithromycin biaxin metronidazole flagyl clarithromycin metronidazole tetracycline or metronidazole amoxacillin in individuals with gastro esophageal reflux eradication of h pylori may result in worsening symptoms because acid secretion increases after this bacteria related gastritis resolves many individuals with reflux will require therapy with proton pump inhibitors to control symptoms these provide effective relief of symptoms in of affected individuals as opposed to the h receptor antagonists which provide symptomatic relief in of individuals with reflux disease candida infections patients with diabetes may develop yeast infections in the gi tract especially when glycemic control has been poor yeast infection in the mouth thrush is characterized by a thick white coating of the tongue and throat along with pain and burning if the infection extends further candida esophagitis results which may cause intestinal bleeding heartburn and difficulty swallowing oral candida can readily be diagnosed by physical examination but candida esophagitis will usually require endoscopy for accurate diagnosis treatment is highly effective and is focused on the eradication of the yeast infection with antifungal medications such as nystatin mycostatin ketocanazole nizoral or flucanazole diflucan the small intestine in diabetes in some cases of longstanding diabetes the enteric nerves supplying the small intestine may be affected leading to abnormal motility secretion or absorption this leads to symptoms such as central abdominal pain bloating and diarrhea delayed emptying and stagnation of fluids in the small intestine may lead to bacterial overgrowth syndromes resulting in diarrhea and abdominal pain metclopropamide and cisapride may help to accelerate the passage of fluids through the small intestine whereas broad spectrum antibiotics will decrease bacterial levels diagnosis can be quite difficult and may require small bowel intubation for quantitative small bowel bacterial cultures breath hydrogen testing and the c d xylose test may be helpful in diagnosing bacterial overgrowth as well all of these tests are somewhat cumbersome and an empiric trial of antibiotics is often the most efficient means of diagnosing and treating this condition numerous antibiotic regimens have been shown to be effective including to day courses of tetracycline ciprofloxin amoxacillin or tetracycline a short course may provide prolonged relief but typically additional courses of antibiotics are required when symptoms recur in several weeks or months at times enteric neuropathy may lead to a chronic abdominal pain syndrome similar to the pain of peripheral neuropathy in the feet this condition may be very difficult to treat but will sometimes respond to pain medications and tricyclic antidepressant medications such as amitryptilline elavil unfortunately narcotic addiction may be common in patients with chronic painful enteric neuropathy individuals with diabetes also have an increased risk of celiac sprue in this condition an allergy to wheat gluten develops leading to inflammation and thinning of the mucosa of the small intestine why this association occurs is not clear however sprue may lead to diarrhea weight loss and malabsorption of food this condition responds well to a gluten free diet but patients may have difficulty adhering to such a diet diagnosis can be made with endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine or with serological evaluation for anti endomysial and anti gliadin antibodies the colon in diabetes limited information is available regarding the effects of diabetes on the large intestine we do know that enteric neuropathy may affect the nerves innervating the colon leading to a decrease in colon motility and constipation anatomic abnormalities of the colon such as structure tumor or diverticulitis should be excluded with a barium enema or colonoscopy fiber supplementation with bran or psyllium products as well as a high fiber diet increases the water content of the bowel movement and may relieve constipation mild laxatives and stool softeners will often help as well in addition cisapride accelerates colonic movement and may increase the frequency of bowel movements diabetic diarrhea patients with a longstanding history of diabetes may experience frequent diarrhea and this has been reported to occur in up to of patients this may be related to problems in the small bowel or colon abnormally rapid transit of fluids may occur in the colon leading to increased stool frequency and urgency in addition abnormalities in the absorption and secretion of colonic fluid may develop leading to increased stool volume frequency and water content diabetic diarrhea is a syndrome of unexplained persistent diarrhea in individuals with a longstanding history of diabetes this may be due to autonomic neuropathy leading to abnormal motility and secretion of fluid in the colon there are also a multitude of intestinal problems that are not unique to people with diabetes but that can cause diarrhea the most common is the irritable bowel syndrome the workup and treatment of diarrhea is similar in patients with or without diabetes if the basic medical evaluation of diarrhea is nondiagnostic which it frequently is then treatment is tailored toward providing symptomatic care with antidiarrheal agents such as diphenoxylate lomotil or loperamide immodium fiber supplementation with bran citrucel metamucil or high fiber foods may also thicken the consistency of the bowel movement and decrease watery diarrhea in addition antispasmodic medicines such as hyosymine levsin dicyclomine bentyl and chordiazepoxide librax clindinium clindex may decrease stool frequency sometimes an empiric trial of antibiotics and or pancreatic enzymes is warranted because pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and bacterial overgrowth may be the etiology more recently the ht receptor antagonist alosetron lotronex has been used effectively for the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome tincture of opium and paregoric have also been used to improve the quality of daily life in some cases finally in severe cases injections of octreotide sandostatin a somatostatin like hormone have been shown to significantly decrease the frequency of diabetic diarrhea obviously in these severe cases referral to a gastroenterologist is indicated the pancreas in diabetes pancreatic exocrine dysfunction occurs in up to of individuals with type diabetes but is rarely significant enough to lead to any clinical problems with digestion the pancreas has a tremendous reserve and a modest reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion rarely leads to difficulty in digesting or absorbing carbohydrate fat or protein the exocrine pancreas may also be affected in some patients with type diabetes but to a lesser extent individuals who have secondary diabetes because of severe pancreatitis or surgical removal of the pancreas usually have more severe symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency treatment with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is usually effective a trial of oral enzyme replacement therapy can be done safely for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes the liver in diabetes although liver function tests are commonly abnormal in patients with diabetes it is unclear whether this is a reflection of the underlying obesity that is so common in patients with type diabetes or whether it is an effect of poorly controlled diabetes fatty infiltration of the liver nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is common in obese individuals up to as well as in type diabetic individuals up to people with type diabetes in very poor control may also develop this syndrome although it is much less common fatty infiltration of the liver may lead to tender hepatomegally elevated liver enzyme tests and abdominal pain syndromes occasionally this may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver the diagnosis is usually suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation but can be confirmed with abdominal ultrasonography and if needed percutaneous liver biopsy metabolic abnormalities such as hemochromatosis and infectious etiologies such as viral hepatitis need to be excluded as part of the evaluation therapy is geared toward improving glycemic control and instituting a low calorie low fat diet caloric restriction will lead to weight loss better glycemic control lower serum triglycerides and cholesterol and improvement in the fatty infiltration of the liver ursodiol actigal may provide some benefit in the treatment of hepatic steatosis diabetic patients seem to have an increased incidence of gallstones and gall bladder problems but these much like fatty infiltration of the liver are primarily related to the obesity associated with type diabetes and not to the diabetes itself obesity leads to secretion of bile by the liver that is supersaturated with cholesterol leading to crystallization and stone formation typical symptoms of biliary colic include intermittent right upper abdominal pain jaundice or pancreatitis in the past patients with diabetes have been instructed to have surgery for asymptotic gallstones because of a concern for an increased risk of complications from gallstones such as infection pancreatitis or rupture of the gall bladder however more recent experience with modern medical and surgical care indicates that this is no longer the case thus patients with diabetes and gallstones should be managed in a fashion similar to nondiabetic patients surgery is generally recommended only for those individuals whose gallstones are causing symptoms conclusions gi problems in diabetes are common but not commonly recognized in clinical practice the duration of diabetes and the degree of glycemic control are major determinants in the incidence and severity of gi problems the entire gi tract can be affected including the mouth esophagus stomach small intestine colon liver and pancreas leading to a variable symptom complex the workup starts with a thorough patient history and appropriate laboratory radiographic and gi testing in addition to pharmacological therapy glycemic control and dietary manipulation play an important role in managing gi disorders in people with diabetes

i heard that if you have diabetes you cannot eat grapes is that true and why it used to be that diabetics were told to avoid sugary foods this is why advice like this persists it's true that grapes have a relatively high sugar content and alone will have more of an impact on blood glucose than many other foods however even foods with strong glycemic impact can be enjoyed by diabetics the key is to eat them in amounts and in ways that reduce the glycemic impact the amount they affect your blood sugar eating sugary foods in the context of a meal that also contains fat and protein reduces their impact on blood sugar so eating a reasonable portion of grapes after a dinner for which you had meat veggies and a salad with dressing for example would be better in terms of maintaining steady blood sugar than eating the same serving alone basic questions about the impact of foods on blood sugar can be addressed by a good diabetes educator your primary care provider can give you a referral many hospitals also offer free seminars for this type of patient education and a quick phone call to your health insurance provider will often yield an abundance of written patient education material that can be very very helpful edited to add it's important to note that your body does not distinguish between natural sugars such as those found in fruit and refined sugar you need to educate yourself about the impact all foods have on blood glucose  Diabetes mellitus Nutrition Insulin Glycemic index Dieting Stomach cancer Tooth Crohn's disease Glucokinase Stroke Veganism Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarianism Insulin resistance Obesity Food Hyperglycemia Glucose meter Hamster Diabetic ketoacidosis Glucose Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight training Breakfast Blood sugar Low-carbohydrate diet Healthy eating Glycogen storage disease type I Growth hormone treatment Sulfonylurea South Beach diet Food preservation Milk Vitamin C Dietary fiber Fasting Ecology Cuisine of the Southern United States Folic acid Binge eating disorder Alcoholic beverage Prostate cancer Protein Fecal incontinence Medicine Anorexia nervosa Kosher foods Hypertension Trans fat Diabetic neuropathy Tofu Adjustable gastric band Kidney 613 mitzvot Corn syrup Glycogen Tocopherol Gastroparesis Anti-diabetic drug Biochemistry Sugar substitute Livestock Atherosclerosis Tooth enamel Cuisine of Denmark Coronary heart disease Calorie restriction Diabetic retinopathy Glucocorticoid Chocolate Jewish cuisine Sewage treatment Senescence Soy protein Brewery Chlorpromazine Raw food diet Japanese tea ceremony Dialysis Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Wine Colorectal cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Hamburger German cuisine Kashrut Soft drink Diabetic hypoglycemia Medical prescription

is it right for a doctor to treat me for gestational diabetes just because i couldnt keep the drink down i took my one hour gb test and failed i threw up shortly after i left the doc's office i went back for my hour gb test but couldnt hold the drink down long enough for them to take my next blood sample i know that this still doesnt mean that i have gb my doctor claimed that there is no other method for them to find out if i have gb so she'll have to treat me like i do by putting me on a diet and having me test my blood sugar i dont mind all of the dieting and testing but is this right for her just to say that i must be treated for it since i couldnt hold the drink down i did an internship with a midwife who used jelly beans for the ogtt i found a research article in my medical library which backs it up maybe you could print this and show it to your doctor american journal of obstetrics gynecology pt nov abstract objective this study tested the hypothesis that a standardized dose of jelly beans could be used as an alternative sugar source to the g glucose beverage to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus study design one hundred sixty pregnant women at to weeks' gestation were recruited for a prospective study to compare sugar sources for serum glucose response side effects preference and ability to detect gestational diabetes mellitus patients were randomly assigned to consume g glucose beverage or jelly beans g simple carbohydrate serum glucose values were determined hour later the test was later repeated with the other sugar source finally a g hour oral glucose tolerance test was performed participants completed a questionnaire recording subjective outcome variables american diabetes association criteria were used to interpret all test results results among participants completing the study no significant differences were found between hour serum glucose values mg dl with g glucose beverage mg dl with jelly beans p frequency of discrepant results p sensitivity specificity or predictive value jelly beans yielded fewer side effects with g glucose beverage with jelly beans p and were preferred by of participants p five cases incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus were diagnosed with g glucose beverage alone with jelly beans alone and with both sugar sources conclusions jelly beans may be used as an alternative to the g glucose beverage as a sugar source for gestational diabetes mellitus screening the sources provoke similar serum glucose responses patients report fewer side effects after a jelly bean challenge than after a g glucose beverage challenge  Glucose tolerance test Glycemic index Polycystic ovary syndrome Hypertension Cancer Hyperglycemia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Caffeine Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vitamin C Migraine Schizophrenia Medical analysis of circumcision Androgen insensitivity syndrome HIV test Medicine Tocopherol Glycogen storage disease type I Homeopathy Dieting Alcoholism Coeliac disease Glucose meter Diabetic retinopathy Coffee Anti-diabetic drug Quantitative marketing research Abortion Hypercholesterolemia Physician Biochemistry Turner syndrome Diabetic nephropathy Chlorpromazine Experiment Gastroparesis Breast cancer Breastfeeding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Allergy Blood type Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone treatment Acne Obesity Sugar Aspartame Glycemia Clozapine Sleep Diabetes mellitus type 2 Diabetic coma Atherosclerosis Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Haemochromatosis Glucose Psychology Controversies in autism Vegetarianism Diabetes insipidus Pharmaceutical company Dietary fiber Psoriasis Insulinoma Hypnosis Pregnancy Lumbar puncture Antidepressant Glucocorticoid Stomach cancer Prolactinoma Childbirth Diabetic neuropathy Normal distribution Asthma Acupuncture Congenital hyperinsulinism Microeconomics Soft drink Anemia

what are the causes of d dimer being high screening and diagnosis pulmonary embolism can be difficult to diagnose especially in people who have underlying heart or lung disease for that reason your doctor will perform one or more tests to help find the cause of your symptoms these tests may include the following chest x ray this noninvasive test shows images of your heart and lungs on film although x rays can't diagnose pulmonary embolism and may even appear normal when pulmonary embolism exists they can rule out conditions that mimic the disease lung scan this test also called a ventilation perfusion scan v q scan uses small amounts of radioactive tracers radioisotopes to study airflow ventilation and blood flow perfusion in your lungs the radioisotopes are attached to substances known as radiopharmaceuticals in the first part of the test you inhale a small amount of radiopharmaceutical while a camera that's able to detect radioactive substances takes pictures of the movement of air in your lungs a small amount of a different radiopharmaceutical is then injected into a vein in your arm and pictures are taken of blood flow in the blood vessels of your lungs comparing the results of the two studies helps provide a more accurate diagnosis of pulmonary embolism than does either study alone the entire procedure usually takes less than an hour although you're exposed to radioactive material the amount of radioactivity is small still the findings of about half of all lung scans are indeterminate requiring other tests to confirm a diagnosis of vte furthermore although a normal lung scan can rule out the possibility of pulmonary embolism it doesn't rule out deep vein thrombosis dvt the cause of pulmonary embolism for these reasons lung scans are being replaced by more sensitive and rapid tests such as spiral computerized tomography ct scans pulmonary angiogram this test provides a clear picture of the blood flow in the arteries of your lungs it's an accurate way to diagnose pulmonary embolism but because it requires a high degree of skill to administer and carries potentially serious risks it's usually performed when other tests fail to provide a definitive diagnosis in a pulmonary angiogram a flexible tube catheter is inserted into a large vein usually in your groin and threaded through your heart into the pulmonary arteries a special dye is then injected into the catheter and x rays are taken as the dye travels along the arteries in your lungs a risk of this procedure is a temporary change in your heart rhythm in addition the dye may cause kidney damage in people with decreased kidney function renal insufficiency although the damage is usually temporary it occasionally may become permanent there is also the risk of developing a hematoma a bruise that occurs when blood collects under the skin at the puncture site in your groin spiral helical computerized tomography ct scan a ct scan allows your doctor to see your organs in two dimensional slices split second computer processing creates these images as a series of very thin x ray beams pass through your body a dye contrast medium is commonly used to help visualize the area now a newer type of ct scan called a spiral or helical ct is fast becoming the first line test for diagnosing suspected pulmonary embolism a spiral ct differs from conventional computerized tomography in several ways the scanner rotates continuously around your body following a spiral path to create three dimensional images it can detect abnormalities with a greater degree of accuracy and it's faster scanning your pulmonary arteries in less than seconds as opposed to minutes or more for a standard ct speed is important because it allows the dye to be captured while still in your arteries spiral ct is nearly as sensitive in detecting most cases of pulmonary embolism as a pulmonary angiogram and much more sensitive than a lung scan a spiral ct exposes you to more radiation than a standard x ray does as well as to the risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast medium tests to detect blood clots in addition to tests that check for pulmonary embolism you may also have tests that help detect blood clots in your veins such as d dimer blood test having high levels of the clot dissolving substance d dimer in your blood may indicate an increased likelihood of blood clots although d dimer levels may be elevated by other factors including recent surgery drawing the blood takes just a few minutes and the risks which include slight bleeding or a small accumulation of blood at the puncture site are minor the results are available in less than an hour normal test results are actually much more meaningful than abnormal ones that's because many conditions other than blood clots can cause elevated d dimer levels while a normal result usually rules out the possibility of vte ultrasound a noninvasive sonar test known as duplex venous ultrasonography sometimes called duplex scan or compression ultrasonography uses high frequency sound waves to check for blood clots in your thigh veins in this test your doctor uses a wand shaped device called a transducer to direct the sound waves to the veins being tested these waves are then reflected back to the transducer and translated into a moving image by a computer the test is quick and painless but it's not very useful for detecting clots below the knee if your doctor suspects that you have deep vein thrombosis below the knee but you have no signs or symptoms and your d dimer test is normal you may have another ultrasound of the upper thigh in two or three days if the repeat test reveals a clot your doctor will start therapy right away venography a more complex and invasive procedure called venography can help reveal blockages caused by blood clots at any point in your arms or legs during the test a catheter is inserted into a vein in your foot or ankle because blood vessels aren't normally seen on x rays a contrast dye is injected into the vein to make it visible just before the x rays are taken although venography generally takes less than an hour you'll need to keep your leg straight for six hours after the procedure there are some risks including an allergic reaction to the dye and a chance that the catheter may damage blood vessels or dislodge part of a clot although venography can accurately detect dvt it's been replaced in large part by duplex ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging mri this test uses no x rays instead a computer creates tissue slices from data generated by a powerful magnetic field and radio waves because mri is expensive it's usually reserved for pregnant women and people whose kidneys may be harmed by dyes used in other tests blood tests if you have a family history of blood clots have had more than one episode of blood clots or have experienced clots for no known reason your doctor may order a series of blood tests to look for inherited defects in your clotting system if genetic abnormalities are found and you have a history of blood clots your doctor may recommend lifelong therapy with anticoagulants to prevent future clotting problems

i am diabetic with a sweet tooth so to satisfy my dessert cravings after dinner i bought a bunch of hard candy to eat i am doing about or after dinner instead of say chocolate but someone said today that hard candy is used to spike sugar levels if low in some cases so i am thinking hard candy bad choice as alternative correct hi if you want to end up like me with amputations because of uncontrolled diabetes just keep right on eating those candies seriously get off the candy trick for you it should be an absolute 'no no' it is possible to get sugar free candies ice cream and the like but you need really need to avoid extra carbohydrates as these will raise your blood sugar level and eventually cause you all the problems that beset diabetics in later life i fooled myself into thinking i was controlling my diabetes well for more than forty years but fell victim to an infection which wouldn't clear and which led eventually to gangrene and amputations not nice not necessary and relatively easy to have avoided i didn't have a sweet tooth just a large appetite for high carbohydrate foods in when i was diagnosed i was advised to drink coffee without sugar and was offered saccarine instead i used to have several spoonfuls of sugar in coffee i didn't like the taste of the sweetener so tried it without anything ugh but only for a couple of days then i began to realise i could actually taste the coffee and not just the sugar same with tea after a few weeks i could identify one cup out of a dozen which had the sugar in and still can the coffee tasted better and the cups were easier to wash my 'sweet tooth' had vanished for ever i vastly prefer to eat savoury items now and though they can still be fattening and high in carbohydrates which can raise blood sugar levels they are far less addictive than high sugar desserts etc please try to curb your 'sweet tooth' i would not recommend you follow my path it is filled with pain disfigurement and loss of ability don't do it you will get all the help you need if you actually follow their advice from your health care professionals who will be very pleased to have someone who actually listens and obeys rather than merely paying lip service guilty to what they say good luck anyway it can be hard but it will be worth it believe me cheers bobspain  Diabetes mellitus Atkins Nutritional Approach Coffee Sugar Soft drink Hypoglycemia Tooth Sugar substitute Dieting Breakfast Breastfeeding Tea Hyperglycemia Sucrose Food Cuisine of the Philippines Insulin Nutrition Obesity Hamster Japanese cuisine Chinese cuisine Fancy rat Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aspartame Cuisine of Denmark Happy Tree Friends Folic acid Cocaine Pancake Microeconomics Coeliac disease Cinnamon Ice cream MRE Addiction Penis Tooth enamel Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Shit Rice pudding Chronic fatigue syndrome Cotton candy Cancer Veganism Crohn's disease Neighbours Domestic rabbit Caffeine Soy milk Guinea pig Maple syrup Alcoholic beverage Polyols Bulk vending Jewish cuisine Cha chaan teng Glycemic index Diabetic neuropathy Hong Kong-style milk tea Wine German cuisine Coca-Cola French cuisine Kit Kat Rocky Mountain spotted fever Ron and Fez Word of Wisdom Oral sex Champagne (beverage) Cheese Cuisine of Singapore Adjustable gastric band Methamphetamine First aid South Beach diet Tofu Hypertension Alcoholics Anonymous Codename: Kids Next Door Diabetic retinopathy Pneumonia Terri Schiavo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters of Naruto

can a person receive medicade and medicare at the same time yes as long as that person meets the qualifications for both plans medicaid is always the last payor if the person has other insurance whether that other insurance is medicare or some other private insurance etc so your other insurance carriers pay before medicaid medicaid only comes into play if there is a balance or noncovered item remaining etc yes believe it or not its also possible to qualify for a private health insurance plan and medicaid for example my year old sister in law has severe mental retardation and is fully dependent upon my in laws she still qualifies as a dependant on my father in law's insurance due to her disability however she also has medicaid the only time medicaid gets billed for something is if its a medically necessary service that isn't covered through my father in law's policy the medicaid is a safety net since she's permanently and totally disabled  Medicaid Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Medicare (United States) Health care in the United States Economy of the United States Medicare (Canada) Social Security (United States) Life insurance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Nursing home Barbara Boxer Insurance HIPAA US health reform under FDR Social Security Administration Taxation in the United States Canadian and American health care systems compared Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare (Australia) Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health maintenance organization Mental Health Act 1983 Variable universal life insurance Health care in Canada Pharmaceutical company Social issues in the United States Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act United States Department of Health and Human Services US health reform under Nixon Economic history of the United States US health reform under Carter Home care Flat tax 401(k) Canada Health Act Bill Frist Food Stamp Program Emergency Medical Services Actuary American Medical Association Social Security debate (United States) Managed care National Health Service Social security Mental retardation Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Payroll Nursing Healthcare system Amish Contract Mutual fund Compensation of employees Involuntary commitment Workers' compensation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Mental illness Special education Trust (Law) USA Medical malpractice Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Professor Henry Waxman Personal finance Cooperative Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Government debt Democratic Party (United States) Traumatic brain injury Affirmative action United States Postal Service Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Unemployment benefit Americans with disabilities Public bodies and task forces of the UK government Divorce Centrelink Abortion US health reform under Truman Economy of India Paternalism Legal aspects of transsexualism Hillary Rodham Clinton Nurse Social work Psychiatric hospital Government agencies in Sweden No Child Left Behind Act Henry A.

i have recently been experiencing concerns as it relates to elevated blood sugar reading my morning blood sugar reading range from are these ranges normal for a person that have yet to be dx with diabetes my most recent reading after eating watermelon was should i be concern and see a dr oh by the way i am on a diet jenny craig for appx year hi if your morning blood test is fasting it is slightly too high for a non diabetic person in a non diabetic it shouldn't rise above ideally after eating is certainly far too high for a non diabetic that indicates that your body is definitely struggling with the simple sugars such as those found in fruits etc my guess would be that you are certainly borderline or pre diabetic if not diabetic the best thing that you can do is see your gp for a glucose tolerance test which will tell the doctor immediately if you are diabetic or not also you mention you are on a weight loss diet it sounds as if your sugars are definitely too high for a calorie controlled program definitely see your doctor and he or she can also advise you on the most suitable diet both to help your sugar control and to assist weight loss good luck i hope everything goes well for you  Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Dieting Hyperglycemia Hypertension Insulin Atkins Nutritional Approach Low-carbohydrate diet Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vegetarianism Obesity Nutrition Coeliac disease Folic acid Aspartame Calorie restriction Diabetic retinopathy Veganism Prostate cancer Glycemic index Diabetic ketoacidosis Sugar substitute Stroke Obstetrics Weight training Dietary fiber Diabetic neuropathy Crohn's disease Adjustable gastric band Glucokinase Dialysis Blood sugar Omega-3 fatty acid Raw food diet Glycogen storage disease type I Diabetic nephropathy Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Binge eating disorder Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Intensive insulinotherapy Super Size Me Diabetes mellitus type 2 Glucose Senescence Glycemia Gastroparesis South Beach diet Glucose meter Tocopherol Weight loss Sucralose Milk Alzheimer's disease Haemochromatosis Glycogen Food Anorexia nervosa Urinary incontinence Healthy eating Vitamin C Alcoholic beverage Diabetes insipidus Glucocorticoid Bodybuilding Little Britain Alcoholism Life extension Colorectal cancer Coronary heart disease Glaucoma Turner syndrome Soft drink Breastfeeding Sucrose Sugar Guinea pig Hypercholesterolemia Congenital hyperinsulinism Childbirth Blood test Myocardial infarction Ketoacidosis Macular degeneration Chlorpromazine Penis Clozapine Jet engine Metabolic syndrome Hamster Diabetic coma Biochemistry Diabetic hypoglycemia Fasting

question for insulin dependent diabetics i take my insulin in my stomach exclusively as my thigh seems to be more painful and less effective i've got so much bruising over both sides of my stomach i try to rotate the injection sites and it often gets painful to inject i inject from times a day depending on results and food intake is there anything i can do to help the bruising and make it less painful thanks my son is an insulin dependent diabetic and often said the same thing we found syringes that have finer needles which is less painful and he was using the same syringe over and over again which dulled the point so i would recommend seeing if you can get a syringe with a finer needle and using a different one every time if that is possible for you he liked to conserve his when he was a teenager he was taking up to shots a day due to so much food intake best of wishes to you i know how difficult this illness it take care  Insulin Diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Nutrition Breastfeeding Syringe Gastroparesis Intensive insulinotherapy Diabetic hypoglycemia Hypodermic needle Osteoarthritis Group A streptococcal infection Diving Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Polycystic ovary syndrome Intravenous therapy Lethal injection Tocopherol Anti-diabetic drug Myocardial infarction Dietary fiber Obesity Crohn's disease Carpal tunnel syndrome Prostate cancer Low-carbohydrate diet Atkins Nutritional Approach Glycemic index Harm reduction Obstetrics Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Insulin pump Protein Diabetic coma Pneumonia Glucokinase Paracetamol Hypertension Paget's disease of bone Glycogen storage disease type I Venipuncture Glucose meter Diesel engine Acupuncture Needle aspiration biopsy Carburetor Alzheimer's disease Colorectal cancer Bodybuilding Equine conformation Abortion Diabetic neuropathy Memento (film) Dexamethasone Acute pancreatitis Hepatitis C Antidepressant Novo Nordisk Route of administration Kurt Cobain Adjustable gastric band Folic acid Needle-exchange programme Stroke Angina Air embolism Ebola Chlorpromazine Breast cancer VHF omnidirectional range Marathon (sport) Cirrhosis First aid Aspartame Alcoholism Drug abuse Milk Vitamin C Growth hormone deficiency Migraine Multiple sclerosis Fasting Arguments for and against drug prohibition Dieting Spina bifida Raw food diet Caffeine Kidney stone Soft drink AIDS Mosquito Diclofenac Bruise Epidural Textile manufacturing

how much sugar causes diabetes let's say that a person has a really fast metabolism and doesn't need to worry much about gaining weight is it acceptable to have desserts that aren't loaded with cholesterol like or times a week will that cause diabetes i mentioned a low amount of cholesterol to emphasize the fact that the desserts aren't entirely unhealthy you wont get diabetes from eating sugar you get it from being excessively overweight especially if it's in your family the risk factors for type diabetes include obesity usually pounds overweight a family history of diabetes having a prior history of gestational diabetes diabetes while pregnant physical inactivity and race ethnicity blacks hispanic latino americans american indians and some asians pacific islanders are at particularly high risk for type diabetes but whites are also gaining in cases of detected diabetes due to very poor diets and lack of exercise movement people dont walk any more than they have to or move like they did years ago one example when i grew up tvs did not have remote controls you had to get up off your fanny go change the channel there are dozens of other ways in which we dont move anymore so move move move aunt barbie  Diabetes mellitus Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Dieting Binge eating disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Insulin Milk Atherosclerosis Oral contraceptive Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Low-carbohydrate diet Anorexia nervosa Stroke Hyperglycemia Super Size Me Polycystic ovary syndrome Insulin resistance Sugar substitute Sugar Race (U.S. Census) Growth hormone treatment Vegetarianism Diabetes mellitus type 2 Metabolic syndrome Obstetrics Hamster Weight training Glycemic index Race in biomedicine Birth weight Exercise Gallstone Coronary heart disease Diabetic retinopathy Dietary fiber Omega-3 fatty acid Alzheimer's disease Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Cholesterol Diabetic nephropathy Angina Coeliac disease Glucokinase Folic acid Urinary incontinence Veganism Diabetes insipidus Food Tocopherol Diabetic neuropathy Equine conformation Colorectal cancer Tooth Race Chocolate Glycogen storage disease type I Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Nephrotic syndrome Calorie restriction Adjustable gastric band Growth hormone deficiency Alcoholism Trans fat Life insurance Soft drink Low density lipoprotein Cephalic disorder Tobacco smoking Tofu Androgen insensitivity syndrome White (people) Miscarriage Domestic rabbit Cystic fibrosis Osteoporosis Caffeine Asian American Body mass index Turner syndrome Cinnamon Endometrial cancer Diabetic coma Clozapine Ramadan Healthy eating Pneumonia Diabetic hypoglycemia Haemochromatosis Puberty Crohn's disease

your are supposed to test hours after you eat am i supposed to give my self insulin w high numbers i assume you have diabetes you haven't given us any information such as what type of insulin s do you take and in what amounts also what were the instructions your doctor gave you you need to call or go see your endocrinologist or diabetes educator no one here knows your personal situation and since we're not your doctors we are not qualified to tell you what to do the most we can do is share our own experiences and hope we are being helpful in some way i have diabetes type and i do tight control which is where i keep my numbers between this requires frequent testing of my glucose levels i test about times a day i take types of insulin at bedtime i take lantus glargine units lantus is a slow acting insulin that lasts hours during the day before each meal i take novolog asparte units this is a fast acting insulin that lasts about hours long enough to process my meal at this point in my life since my numbers are stable my doctor allows me to adjust my own insulin i do not adjust the bedtime lantus that is my baseline insulin that basically keeps my numbers in the range but during the day i can adjust the amount of novolog i give myself for example if i know i am going to eat a larger than usual meal or the meal will have a very high amount of carbs i increase my insulin to about units conversely if i'm only going to eat a yogurt i lower my insulin to about units it also depends on what my glucose level is before my meal in addition i generally inject times during the day for meals but if i check my numbers at other times and they have crept up i will inject a few units to get back in balance it is a form of tightrope walking to keep my levels from getting too high or too low but i am used to it i don't have to give it much thought now because it has become second nature i didn't start out this way and i didn't have permission to take control of adjusting my insulin for a long time i had to have my levels in a good range for a long time before my doctor let me be in control ultimately we all need to take control of our health it's our bodies we need to take care of them that means working with our doctors doing what they say or discussing any changes we might want to make so again i say to call your doctor maybe you could read one or two books about diabetes at some point you may want to use an insulin pen or even go on a pump who knows best of luck  Intensive insulinotherapy Gastroparesis Nutrition Glucokinase Insulin resistance Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyperglycemia Glucose meter Growth hormone treatment Blood sugar Atkins Nutritional Approach Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Fecal incontinence Fasting Growth hormone deficiency Weight training Glycemic index Supply and demand Low-carbohydrate diet Polycystic ovary syndrome Dieting Diabetic nephropathy Glycogen storage disease type I Glycogen Insulin pump Sleep Stroke Endocrinology Obesity Hypertension Diabetes mellitus type 2 Inflation Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Dialysis Glucocorticoid Diabetes mellitus type 1 Anorexia nervosa Dog agility Diabetic hypoglycemia Sulfonylurea Clinical depression Glycemia Dietary fiber Atherosclerosis Growth hormone Extreme Programming Diabetic retinopathy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chlorpromazine Japanese tea ceremony Diabetic coma Transformer Insulinoma Fuel injection Urinary incontinence Medical prescription Labour economics Electrophysiology Stomach cancer Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Homeostasis Physician Acromegaly CPU cache Compiler optimization Gastroesophageal reflux disease Graduate school Milton H.

is it true that exercising helps lower your blood sugar helps prevent diabetes if you are diabetic is it true that if you exercise after you eat then your sugar goes down if you're pre diabetic or a non diabetic then exercise alone will not prevent you getting it there are many lifestyle and genetic factors but it's definitely a huge benefit if you're diabetic yes exercise can drop your blood sugars dramatically which is great for lowering them 'naturally' but if you're on insulin you need to make sure that you don't let them fall too low  Diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemia Insulin Nutrition Atherosclerosis Insulin resistance Hyperglycemia Alzheimer's disease Blood sugar Atkins Nutritional Approach Diabetes mellitus type 2 Dieting Polycystic ovary syndrome Low-carbohydrate diet Glucokinase Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stroke Diabetic ketoacidosis Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Diabetic coma Cardiovascular disease Glycemic index Glucose meter Folic acid Exercise Growth hormone treatment Colorectal cancer Soft drink Vegetarianism Senescence Weight training Diabetic hypoglycemia Coronary heart disease Crohn's disease Intensive insulinotherapy Milk Biotin Urinary incontinence Myocardial infarction Chronic fatigue syndrome Obstetrics Hamster Fructose Metabolic syndrome Sugar substitute Diabetes mellitus type 1 Anti-diabetic drug Glycogen Tooth Veganism Calorie restriction Acromegaly Binge eating disorder Prostate cancer Hypercholesterolemia Diabetic neuropathy Osteoporosis Asthma Chocolate Angina Insulinoma Cinnamon Sulfonylurea Glycogen storage disease type I Genetic engineering Diabetes insipidus Garlic Glucose tolerance test Cystic fibrosis Glycemia Anorexia nervosa Glaucoma Growth hormone deficiency Dialysis ACE inhibitor Genetically modified food Health insurance Growth hormone Cancer Oral contraceptive Race in biomedicine Insulin pump National Institutes of Health Xylitol Clozapine Diabetic nephropathy Ischaemic heart disease Sugar Ray Robinson Tocopherol Bodybuilding Vitamin C First aid Cephalic disorder Genetic disorder Artery Callus

my freind tested his blood sugar the results was how concerned shuold he be your friend should be pretty concerned about this if he has not been diagnosed with diabetes then he should get to the doctor as soon as possible and get tested for diabetes i am not sure what the norms are but i am thinking it is somewhere like give or take a few numbers i work in a hospital and the nurses get real worried with a blood suger of in some cases it means a call to the doctor out of control diabetes for an extended amount of time can lead to some other bad conditions my childhood friend never did what the doctors told him and by the time he was he had both legs amputed and was starting to go blind he died months after his th birthday because even after loosing both legs he still didn't do what the doctors said your friend should for sure go see a doctor and get this under control my friends story is pretty drastic but still it could and did happen  Diabetes mellitus Childbirth Insulin Medicine Myocardial infarction Penis Coeliac disease Diabetic retinopathy Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Diabetic ketoacidosis Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Tourniquet Cephalic disorder Pneumonia Marilyn Monroe Diabetic neuropathy Turner syndrome Glucose meter Gastroparesis Hypertension Hyperglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Neighbours Triage Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Terri Schiavo Ebola Insulin resistance Mental Health Act 1983 The Five Doctors Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Lupus erythematosus Genetic disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Shaggy dog story Health insurance Obstetrics EastEnders Polycystic ovary syndrome Tocopherol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cornelia Rau Jessica Lynch Glucose tolerance test Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Soft drink Nurse Chlorpromazine Spina bifida Randomized controlled trial Tuberculosis Blood pressure Traditional Chinese medicine Growth hormone treatment Diabetic nephropathy Rei Ayanami Death Comes to Time Roald Dahl Marburg virus Cancer Father's Day (Doctor Who) Graham Kennedy Callus David Lange Hubert Selby Jr. Medical prescription Breastfeeding Tuskegee Syphilis Study Ernest Hemingway Podiatrist Asthma Erectile dysfunction Haemochromatosis Anxiety Pitaten Milton H.

diabetes and lantus i was diagnosed with diabetes two weeks ago and i'm taking units of lantus every night at pm last night an hour after taking my lantus i checked my blood sugar and it was which is way too low i think they have me on too high of a dose i'm afraid that at night my blood sugar is going to drop to dangerous levels i'm not overweight my next appointment with the doctor isn't until the th any advice is appreciated hi i think you need to call your doctor right away don't risk waiting for your next appointment i take units of lantus at bedtime during the day i take novolog asparte units before each meal that is a fast acting insulin that lasts about hours long enough for me to process my meals these amounts types of insulin work fine for me but i've had diabetes for years type in the beginning it was a bit of a roller coaster ride with doses and or types of insulin changing every few days weeks finally we got my glucose levels settled down just fine of course there is the occasional time i will become hypoglycemic by now i usually know before checking that i'm too low hands start shaking heart races back of neck gets sweaty feel nauseated or feel unusually hungry or i get spaced out you've been diagnosed only weeks ago you'll have to expect a certain amount of changes until the doctor you find a good balance with your insulin for me at this point i make my own adjustments with my insulin not my lantus since that is a hour baseline insulin but the novolog that i take before meals i can change if i know i am about to eat a much larger meal than usual or a meal that is heavy on the carbs i will raise my insulin to or units conversely if all i'm going to eat is a yogurt then i drop my insulin to about or don't just wait for appointments if you see your insulin is not lowering your levels enough or if you are in the situation you are now medically you technically become hypoglycemic when you go under which you did but in reality you are likely to experience hypo symptoms anywhere from down you should have on hand near your bed some glucose tablets or gel which can be bought in any pharmacy or store that sells diabetes products this way if you see your levels are too low you have fast treatment if you see you are hypoglycemic take mgs of glucose gel one tube or tablets wait minutes check your levels again if you are out of the woods you want to stay that way so you then need protein eat one half of a sandwich peanut butter does it for me the protein from the pb combined with the carbs of the one slice of bread keep my numbers from falling down again it's very likely that your level of lantus is too high for you let me just throw out a question for you did you eat dinner that night if you didn't then it may not be that the lantus is too high if you did eat well also you didn't mention if you take a fast acting insulin during the day before meals i don't know anyone who only takes lantus but if that's all you need at this point well that's great how often do you check your glucose levels i check mine times a day that's because i do tight control where you keep your levels between and that's not for beginners though you should check as soon as you wake up before each meal hours after you eat hrs from when you start eating and at bedtime also you need to check before you exercise do sports and after you finish excuse me if i'm repeating stuff your doctor already told you don't worry about calling the doctor every day if you have to at this point the doctor won't mind diabetes is serious and it will be up to you to control it i would suggest keeping a diabetes journal between now your next appointment and the next few after that in it you want to put your glucose levels the time of day the situation dawn before breakfast hours after breakfast and the other meals before lantus and whenever else you check it many doctors ask you to do this it gives her him and you a picture of how your numbers are doing maybe the levels will show you need less lantus but something before meals for example who knows yet since you are newly diagnosed i would strongly suggest you buy one or two books about diabetes i learned far more from the books than i did from the doctors it's sad to say but if i did learn something that i felt applied to me would be better for me i brought the information to my doctors they always went along with what i learned you can call the ada american diabetes association and they will send you a catalogue of books or any good bookstore should have some just a thought if you were just diagnosed weeks ago i hope you have an endocrinologist because they are the experts on diabetes all the types of insulins dosages equipment insulin pens and insulin pumps etc also they will be connected to a diabetes educator who can help you with any lifestyle changes i e food exercise best of luck to you  Hyperglycemia Glycogen storage disease type I Non-Hodgkin's

i just found out i'm hypoglycemic what do i do i'm too young don't panic this isn't that bad hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar falls too low this doesn't necessarily have a connection with diabetes which is where you can't keep your blood sugar low enough all it means is that you need to be sure to eat small meals very often eat lots of whole grains complex carbohydrates fruit and veggies lean protein etc to keep your blood sugars at an even level avoid processed and refined foods as a general rule if it's 'white' don't eat it as these cause a very quick rise in blood sugar but then drops it just as quickly you need to have a diet very high in fibre with a moderate amount of the right kinds of carbs i would definitely recommend going back to see your doctor and a visit to the dietitian and nutritionist would be really helpful for you good luck and don't panic this is totally treatable and won't cause you any permanent harm  Hypoglycemia Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegetarianism Nutrition Diabetes mellitus Dieting Insulin Veganism South Beach diet Hyperglycemia Food Dietary fiber Glycogen storage disease type I Stomach cancer Glucokinase Glycemic index Hamster Tooth Bread Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Raw food diet Carbohydrate Blood sugar Aspartame Omega-3 fatty acid Healthy eating Milk Coronary heart disease Binge eating disorder Crohn's disease Sugar substitute Breastfeeding Diabetic hypoglycemia Weight training Sugar Alcoholic beverage Gastroparesis Alzheimer's disease Insulin resistance Colorectal cancer Adjustable gastric band Hypertension Biotin Nutrient Domestic rabbit Obesity Egg (food) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sulfonylurea Soft drink Hypercholesterolemia Glucose meter Food guide pyramid Tocopherol Fecal incontinence Ramen Anorexia nervosa Carburetor Chocolate Protein Calorie restriction Famine Ferret Corn syrup Glucose Shit Urinary incontinence Sleep Coffee Dietitian Fruitarianism Biochemistry Carbon dioxide Kit Kat Stroke Calorie Food preservation Genetically modified food Brain Kashrut Chinese cuisine MyPyramid Alcohol fuel Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Soy protein Hamburger Glycemia

why do some diabetics have to wear special shoes what do feet have to do with blood sugar diabetic neuropathy is common with diabetics who have poorly controlled diabetes it causes damage to nerves and inhibits circulation which causes loss of feeling the major problem with this is that poor circualtion occurs in the legs and feet along with the inability to feel ones feet or legs very well there is an issue with sores if a diabetic person gets a cut on their foot they may not feel it and because of poor circulation where it would heal normally with us a diabetic person is a slow healer so they must be very careful as this usually affects their lower body that is why when you see a diabetic amputee they usually start from amputation from the bottom up and it most likely occured from a sore that progressed to infection so some diabetics wear special shoes and must be very careful with foot care cutting toenails prevent dry cracked feet etc  Diabetes mellitus Diabetic neuropathy Urinary incontinence Penis Hyperglycemia Gangrene Insulin Traumatic brain injury Callus Stroke Diabetic retinopathy Stomach cancer Cephalic disorder Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Alzheimer's disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glaucoma Chlorpromazine Atherosclerosis Hip fracture Folic acid Autoimmune diseases Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine Myocardial infarction Pain Dialysis First aid Spina bifida Alcoholism Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acromegaly Immune system Tourniquet Massage Erectile dysfunction Herpes simplex virus Eczema Coeliac disease Atkins Nutritional Approach Peripheral neuropathy Psoriasis Pneumonia Turner syndrome Childbirth Neuropathy Breastfeeding Wound Hearing impairment Group A streptococcal infection Ulcer Weight training Hypertension Pedicure Optic nerve Clinical depression Methamphetamine Exercise Cardiovascular disease Cellulitis Domestic rabbit Tuberculosis Local anesthesia Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Fancy rat Hepatitis C Aspartame Puberty Biotin Insulin resistance High-heeled shoe Cytomegalovirus Sexual dysfunction Diving Diabetes insipidus AIDS Dieting Adverse effect (medicine) Blood sugar Diabetic coma Reflexology Bell's palsy Anal sex Diarrhea Carpal tunnel syndrome Glucocorticoid Shock Amputation Anemia Muscle

months pregnant and gestational diabetes where can i find a good meal plan i'm allergic to dairy also i'm years old allergic to dairy products and have had a nasty case of morning sickness wondering what in god's name i will be able to keep down crackers and breads have been about all i can stomach i can't solely eat those any suggestions been there been that done that too you can and you will get through this can you drink soy milk i think it's delicious there are also almond and oatmilks available at healthfood stores and many many grocery stores now too let me see if i remember what i did as my daughter's now i kept crackers by my bed so that before i moved around very much in the morning or if i got hungry at night i could eat something little i found the nausea and morning sickness was much much worse if i let my stomach get too empty in another month or so many many women but not all begin to feel much better some even find the morning sickness nausea completely disappears in the second trimester i found the nausea was far far worse than the actual throwing up so sometimes rather than feel ill all day or all morning i'd make myself throw up get it over with and then go about my business that seemed to work well for me water and cups of tea were my best friends and helped to settle my stummy too especially chamomile i found foods anything that had garlic in it made me violently ill for a long time so avoid that if it's getting to you i ate bananas turkey sandwiches w lettuce and tomato on ww bread no cheese since you're allergic i also found that nut butters like cashew and almond helped to settle my stomach and combined w the crackers made a small meal that held my blood sugar much better than the crackers alone have you consulted w a diabetic nutritionist most insurances will cover this and most ob gyns automatically send their patients w gestational diabetes to a diabetic educator as a matter of course i ate a lot of grains beans salads fruits and veggies when i was pregnant and seaweed and sushi too i also ate chicken and fish i found i absolutely needed to eat some animal food to keep from bottoming out while on insulin had some really really low blood sugars and that was immensely painful and scary for me as it made me feel desperately ill make sure whatever else you do that you eat enough for dinner and don't skip meals this will wreak havoc w your blood sugars i also want to say these last things to you something like of women who have gestational diabetes go on to become type ii's yes the stats are that bad so get used to taking blood sugars exercising eating really really well and taking care of yourself b c that will go a long way towards making sure you're here to see your children's children diabetes is actually a very powerful gift b c it makes us do exactly what we should have been doing in the first place eating well and exercising and taking the immensely good care of ourselves that we take of the other members of our family don't worry about missed treats you will find you lose your taste for sugar and things sweet as you go further down this road i let myself have one small cookie or piece of chocolate a day so that i don't feel deprived i don't even want them every day now doctors can be terrorists they tell you every bloody thing that can go wrong might go wrong went wrong three hundred years ago they're actually required to do this but it is extremely difficult and abusive in my opinion to subject a pregnant woman to scare tactics and full disclosure if you find they're trying to terrorize you into submission and into being medically compliant call them on it insist that they stop it at once make friends w the pa or the nurse write a pregnancy plan not just a delivery plan insist upon a midwife tell them that you will deal w any and all complications as they arise and if they arise and not until i found the obsession w what could go wrong extremely misplaced get your husband or lover to act as your cheerleader mentor not as your enforcer or further terrifier being newly diagnosed a diabetic is extremely difficult and rather terrifying for most women to say nothing about just hard going they don't need it to be made worse the most important thing you could possibly do is exercise and talk to your baby and tell him or her that you are doing everything in your power to take care of yourself and her him think positively everything will be alright and if it's not you'll deal with it as soon as you know i took shots a month that's three a day of insulin and three a day of heparin plus five twelve finger sticks plus blood tests to have my daughter i have a genetic blood clotting disorder that has almost killed me twice now i am happy to say that i the most needle phobic of all humans can now give myself shots and it doesn't faze me a bit you'll get used to it and you need to b c unless you lose lots of weight and it works for you to do so you'll be diabetic w all subsequent pregnancies as well i wish you the absolute best don't hesitate to e mail me if you need a cheering squad blessings upon you woman eat lots of little meals rather than large ones and try to put protein and fats into each meal like soy cheese nuts and nut butters seeds gorp and trail mix hard boiled eggs tofu tempeh and seitan tunafish salmon sardines mackeral etc turkey jerky etc i even ate hamburgers if i craved one which is completely out of character for me i loved peanutbutter sandwiches and tuna sandwiches for example my current favorite sam is fresh mozzarella and it's from buffaloes not cows so you might be able to eat this fresh tomato w a bit of freshly ground black pepper and some seasalt fresh lettuce from my garden pesto from my garden a bit of mayo and mustard and some cucumber and roasted red peppers i've been known to add a grilled chicken breast to this too the less cooking inside the better in this heat romano and feta are from sheeps and or goat's milks too can you eat other cheeses that are not from cows' milk this post is already too long just know there's folks out here sending you tons of love and light you can do this  Peanut Sushi Dieting Obesity Medicine D__ner kebab Cha chaan teng Abortion Fasting Peanut butter Soybean Theory of conduct Cuisine of Africa Kashrut Chicken soup Anxiety Tea Characters of

drinking alcohol i've been diabetic since i was in elementary school and have now been at a large university for two years my friends don't really drink and i have only a couple times but have never been drunk i was wondering if it is true that when you are drunk it is similar to feeling low any thoughts thanks i've never been drunk and i never plan to be i am just curious thanks for the info so far and yes anyone who i will go drink with in the future knows that i am diabetic i guess in a way it is you feel kind of disoriented and can't concentrate on anything but drinking doesn't make me shake or get hot and sweaty like low blood sugar usually does alcohol does make your blood sugar harder to control though and you could end up with actual low glucose levels so my thoughts be careful if you decide to get drunk make sure you are with people that under stand your condition and take your blood sugar  Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Hyperglycemia Blood sugar Glucose Insulin Atkins Nutritional Approach Cider Hypertension Alcoholic beverage Insulin resistance Dieting Blood alcohol content Alcoholism First aid Diabetic coma Glucokinase Pitaten Diabetic neuropathy Sugar beet Diabetes insipidus Diabetic ketoacidosis Dialysis Coffee Stroke Cannabis (drug) Glucose tolerance test Glycemia Rum Brewery Soft drink Urinary incontinence Sake Fecal incontinence Intensive insulinotherapy Tooth Senescence Atherosclerosis Urine Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Glycogen Inulin Breathalyzer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Yerba mate Obstetrics Rei Ayanami Hemoglobin Alcohol Sugarcane Caffeine Ethanol Drunk driving (United States) Diabetic hypoglycemia Pneumonia Gout The nature of God in Western theology Aspartame Panic attack Taxi Driver Sugar substitute Lac operon Fructose Social rule Chocolate The Emancipation of Mimi Biochemistry Birth weight Customs and etiquette of Japan Pisco Breastfeeding Crohn's disease Chlorpromazine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Electrolyte Sulfonylurea Sugar Post-traumatic stress disorder Columbine High School massacre Corn syrup Hiccup Angina Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Beer Veganism Energy drink Vegetarianism Dehydration Cocaine Alcoholics Anonymous Michael Garibaldi Sauna Medicine Diabetic retinopathy Anne Rice

what causes diabetes it's not from consuming too much sugar so how do you get it that is for type but what about type to what causes type and type diabetes some of the above answers are incorrect type i genetic usually triggered by an outside virus your own white blood cells attack healthy insulin producing beta cells thinking they are not your cells like they are part of the intruding virus so the pancreas' beta cells no longer produce any or maybe a tiny bit insulin because they have been attacked type ii generally a lack of exercise and a poor diet make it difficult for insulin to enter cells so the pancreas produces insulin at a normal or perhaps slower rate and then medicine is helpful for letting the insulin interact with cells to let sugar in so type i is not caused by too much sugar but type ii may be  Diabetes mellitus Insulin Glucokinase Hypoglycemia Nutrition Insulin resistance Cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Diabetes mellitus type 1 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Alzheimer's disease Atherosclerosis Atkins Nutritional Approach Pancreas Blood sugar Diabetic ketoacidosis Stroke Leukemia Crohn's disease Insulinoma Apoptosis Haemochromatosis Anti-diabetic drug Cystic fibrosis Diabetes mellitus type 2 Growth hormone treatment Low-carbohydrate diet First aid Acromegaly Acute pancreatitis Pneumonia Signal transduction Panic attack Glycogen storage disease type I Prostate cancer Milk Alcoholism Obesity Congenital hyperinsulinism Protein Chronic fatigue syndrome Coeliac disease Intensive insulinotherapy Glycemic index Psoriasis Immune system Endocrinology Ferret Red blood cell Vitamin C Cirrhosis Ketoacidosis Gene therapy Sugar Urinary incontinence Weight training Diabetic hypoglycemia Diabetic nephropathy Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Chlorpromazine Folic acid Myocardial infarction Asthma Breastfeeding Calorie restriction Organ transplant Biotin Gastroparesis Frederick Banting Carcinogenesis Blood Novo Nordisk Glycemia Influenza Glycation Autoimmune diseases Pulmonary alveolus Tocopherol Coronary heart disease Biology Herpes simplex virus Soft drink Virus Dieting Experimental cancer treatment White blood cell Omega-3 fatty acid Growth hormone deficiency

what is the lowest blood sugar you have ever had i don't understand why doctors and nurses think they can tell a diabetic person who has delt with this condition all their life how to all of the sudden make some kind of miracle change most diabetics know what they can and can't eat but they eat it anyway and who cares my doctor who is a fkin idiot claims that no one can be conscious with a glucose level below to prove him wrong at my last visit i checked my glucose in front of him and a nurse on my glucometer and the doctor's office glucometer and got a reading of from my middle finger on my machine and off my middle finger on the opposite hand and i was sitting there smiling feeling a little pissed off and contemplating killing both of them but i ate and everyone ended up living but i was awake i have an extremely high tolerance to low blood sugar what was yer lowest sugar first of all deanna you're a know it all bitch if you know so much you'd know first hand that you aren't going to teach an old diabetic new tricks there's nothing he hasn't already heard or tried i'm sure you are probably fat and are very inactive after many a days with bon bons and soap operas your diabetes sneaked up on you maybe you lost some weight due to your diabetes and now you think you are expected to share your knowledge and story with the rest of the world the truth is no one gives a shit there's a big difference between those type of diabetics and diabetics who just have it due to other reasons you could have not been diabetic if only you chose a healthier lifestyle earlier i don't think gozerrocks is gloating about low blood sugar this is y answers after all we should all be taken seriousely righ if you knew so much i bet you'd realize that having low blood sugar is just as much a pain in the ass as high blood sugar hypoglycemic unawareness is an actual medical condition you probably knew that already too right it comes with being a diabetic for a long time how could you not tolerate something after dealing with it for so long i personally don't know what my lowest sugar has been i have been taken to the hospital for a hypoglycemic episode in the past however it does not compare to the worry that diabetics have concerning their blood sugar  Diabetes mellitus Insulin Glucose meter Dieting Hyperglycemia Stroke Insulin resistance Vegetarianism Prostate cancer Milton H.
