second serve american twist serve kick serve hello i play tennis pretty well but my second serve is just not satisfying me i would like to know how to hit an american twist serve or kick serve because i have heard that they are pretty effective second serves thanks people don't need twist serves as second serves but if one practices topspin serves enough they might eventually get a twist serve first know that this probably won't be a comfortable serve to use at first second learn to hit a consistent slice serve first so you understand how to spin a serve well next know this the farther to your dominant side right for righties you throw it the more slice you get the farther to your non dominant side left for righties you throw it the more topspin you get i heard there is supposed to be a magic spot somewhere in there more towards the non dominant side that generates a perfect twist spin every time this is relative to the perfect flat serve toss which can vary from person to person it turned out to be true but it might have just been me hitting multiple serves from the same toss requires wrist manipulation just to clarify that wrist manipulation also affects the direction of the serve since it can change the racket angle without modifying pretty much anything else which is ideal for serving since the opponent can't read your serve from the movement if the toss is the same you shouldn't change the position of your feet or your motion when you intend to serve to a different direction just the wrist and the direction and how you hit through the ball all right now that is clarified time to teach you about kick serves bend your knees and look up generally if you had a line that went straight up from your feet your head would be on the opposite side of the line from the knees whereas most first serves end up with the head on that line this is the position you want to be in after you toss the ball trophy position with the head looking up instead of forward and to the side which will allow you to hit the ball on your non dominant side for the toss normally righties toss for a slice serve at around or o'clock well on their right for a kick serve you toss around o'clock for a topspin or sometimes flat serve o'clock for more topspin and height giving more kick or o'clock which is an extreme some people can hit slices from all of these tosses but they are just either experienced or one of the best servers in the area generally try starting with something around if you are right handed then try if those don't work try remember the more to the non dominant side the more topspin will generally be created now imagine your body is a point on a line parallel to the baseline if you toss behind that line you will be able to get more hight on the ball and will generally be more forced to spin it in making it a little safer to get in since it has a higher margin of error if you toss in front of that you will get one closer to what the pros hit if you can get good kick on it since it allows you to put much more pace on it but the height at which it clears the net is severely reduced pros don't actually have a lot of clearance on their second serve but they are so consistent with it it doesn't matter and because of the spin they can generate the ball will still kick as high if not higher than an amateur tossing behind the line to generate a very high kicker i use the toss in front so even though my second serve clears the net by maybe a foot on rare occasions it can clear it by as much as feet and lands short it kicks over the shoulders and has pace on it making it a more agressive second serve if i warm up my serves this is just as consistent as one with a toss behind that line now for the motion i've read that if you've mastered a slice serve all you do is use a kick serve toss and try to slice it with that toss it is a hard thing to do at first but it does make sense i haven't tried it but it's common knowledge that hitting a kick serve is just like hitting a slice serve if you had your body floating in the air sideways instead of standing upright because you change the direction of the spin by degrees turning slice to topspin if you do this you want to focus on that brushing noise now i admit i do it like that but i have a different mindset i think about brushing straight up on the ball obviously it isn't exactly straight up or else it wouldn't be twisting with as much racket head speed as possible this makes sure i get the ball over the net but the topspin brings it down earlier than a normal serve so it drops down and ends up barely clearing the net if you go to official grand slam sites and look at the point tracker feature to look at second serves you notice the clearance over the net is the exact same as a first serve but it has much more arc on it which is why the clearance is the same you also want to use your legs and reach up for the serve while also brushing up and past the ball or else you will dunk it into the net because you would end up trying to spin it in reducing net clearance you want to swing straight up because the topspin will bring it down into the court and get it to kick higher your first time doing this you don't want to make a lot of contact with the ball brush up on it don't forget to use your wrist to help brush up the ball you also want to let yourself go forward into the court instead of holding your body back behind the baseline because this will make the serve even better and more natural i actually go maybe a foot or inside the court maybe more on all of my serves when i land also make sure you aren't falling backwards if you are you have to move the toss closer to your body i don't think i can hit a kick serve with a toss but i can comfortably hit it with a or toss but some people might be the opposite patrick rafter had a toss very far behind the head and had a great kick serve easily in the top in my opinion also if you keep your body sideways at contact instead of facing the net at contact which is normal for a first serve you generally will be able to create a twist spin if the body opens up it turns into a heavy topspin slice it's still very useful since it still hops high and can be used to go to the forehand side but the regular kicker is better overall since it can be used to go out wide to the backhand which would generate more free points and easy balls if you are generating a lot of topspin but without much twist swing more like a slice while still hitting up on the ball that will generally fix it i don't need to do that though the finish if you did this right will have your racket hand on the dominant side of your body so me being a right hander will have my racket hand finish on the right of my body sometimes the racket as well a good consistent toss is very important you want to find out where the toss works best for you and get the toss there everytime you hit a kick serve also not everybody hits a kick serve with the toss on the left richard gasquet actually has more of a slice serve toss for his kick serve but it changes directions just as well but i don't know how high it kicks but it's probably good or else it would get killed all day long i've hit twist serves off a first serve toss as well but it wasn't very comfortable and my wrist was doing most of the work it was a nice twist with some good kick but i didn't feel like it would suit me or work for me in the long run now some clarification on why i keep refering twist serves and kick serves differently all twist serves are kick serves but not all kick serves are twist serves kick serves refer to topspin serves and twist serves kick serve used to originally only refer to twist serves but they changed it if i had my way on this i would call all topspin serves kick serves and all twist serves would only be called twist serves because every serve has a cool second name except for the topspin serve cannonball serve slider serve kick serve twist serve why should one serve own two of those names and leave the topspin serve out of it and kick serves are effective second serves if you are really confident in them they will be really consistent and visa versa which creates a never ending chain of perfect second serves if you get nervous and let up on a kick serve it will go into the net because you tried to keep it down and away from the service line or long because you didn't put much spin on it the best ways to use this serve obviously other than as a second serve is as a change up to mess with the returner but don't do this too unless your kick serve is that good keep it on the backhand side or the side that can't handle high balls well which is usually the backhand if you can hit a twist then it get's even better because it causes more problems for the returner's backhand and can be sent out wide on the ad court to drag the returner wide of the doubles line and open up the court serving and volleying with kickers works well because it is hard to consistently get a very agressive return unless you are a pro at a very high level assuming the kicker is really good if it isn't then it will be attacked so you can close into the net tighter than normal because the serve is usually slower than first serves and as another bonus most people who aren't at very high levels will send back a floating return waiting to be killed a twist serve can also be used to jam the reciever very nicely when the returner starts guarding his backhand side you now have easy access to more of the service box opening up the forehand side however you still want to keep the amount of kick serves to the forehand to a minimum unless you can get it to slide well like a slice serve without twisting because that loss in pace with a high bounce to the forehand can get killed or hurt you but this depends on the opposing player and how good your kick serve is in terms of kick and pace for me i get a lot of floating returns even on the forehand when some people try to kill my kick serve with a forehand and they get a strong return i can still get to the ball and bring the rally back to my favor but they miss more forehand long than they hit them in and some go into the net the reason is that the height makes it hard to come over the ball and put topspin on it and the pace makes it harder to time the shot and gives them less time to react and the reverse bounce jams their forehand half of the time which is why some returns go into the net regardless be careful about when you send a kick serve to the returner's forehand a great kick serve is the in my opinion the best serve in the game also check this out http www tennis com messageboard forums thread view asp tid posts mid oh yeah and use either a continental grip or an eastern backhand grip or you won't get good results i use a continental grip on all serves but i used to use an eastern backhand on kick serves which i would reccomend you trying to start out with for the kick serve

how is the scoring done for tennis i'm new at this i need real answers please basically there are two sets in a tennis match each set is made up of a certain amount of games each game is made up of certain amounts of points the first point is called love all the second is the point is the fourth point is and if you win a fifth point then you win a game so for example say you win two points and your opponent wins one point then the score would be if both you and your opponent have four points it's called deuce not at deuce you have to win two consecutive points to win the game now you keep doing that for each game and to win a set you need to win six games but you have to win by two so if you have six games and your opponent has five games then you have to play another game to win seven five if the score is six games to six games then you play a tiebreaker which is first to seven points win by two points so just like before if the score in the tiebreaker was then you would have to win another point to win that tiebreaker usually you have to win two out of the three sets to win  Table tennis Andre Agassi Card Sharks Sudden death Tournament Bj__rn Borg Volleyball Pete Sampras Match Game Bundesliga (football) Maria Sharapova Badminton $ale of the Century Poker jargon Dominoes Canasta The Football League Contract bridge Piquet UEFA Champions League 2005-06 Martina Navratilova Mahjong Snooker Spades ELO rating system SmartAsk NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Family Feud Real tennis Cleveland Browns Pyramid (game show) Backgammon Monica Seles Quizbowl 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Mary Pierce Ra (board game) Cribbage Australian rules football World Chess Championship Gustavo Kuerten Pete Sampras Tennis Jeopardy!

do all tennis pros use a midsize racket i just wonder why most of the pros like federer and roddick use or inch heads on their racket some people says it has more control or power do any pros use oversize rackets smaller heads more control smaller sweet spot less power generated by the racquet larger heads less control strings move around more larger sweet spot more power generated by the racquet most male pros use a smaller head because they are good enough to hit the ball in the center most of the time when you hit it in the center sweet spot with a smaller head you still get power but the ball will go more where you want it to go because the strings don't move as much  Squash (sport) Badminton Roger Federer Racquetball Pete Sampras Tennis Racquets (sport) Real tennis Andy Roddick Andre Agassi Mid-size car Squash tennis Bj__rn Borg Grip (tennis) Forehand Eight ball Buffalo Bills Bill Tilden Los Angeles Clippers Cleveland Browns Slazenger Tennis shots Mario Power Tennis Baseball bat Seishun Academy Middle School Billiards GunBound Cricket ball Maria Sharapova Mark Philippoussis Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Devil sticks San Francisco 49ers Fast bowling Tetherball Association of Tennis Professionals George Jay Gould II American handball Pete Sampras Tennis The Prince of Tennis Magnus effect Hard disk Providence, Rhode Island Softball Organized crime Laws of cricket Floyd Rose Game Boy Four square Comparison of Canadian and American football Paintball Professional wrestling Lleyton Hewitt Batting (cricket) Professional wrestling attacks Snooker Rugby union positions Transactional analysis Basketball Carolina Panthers Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Tennis strategy National Football League Lore Kim Clijsters Bobby Riggs Marat Safin Billboard Hot 100 Drag racing Stage lighting Hamster John McEnroe Miami Dolphins U.S. Open (tennis) Cincinnati Bengals New York Giants Glossary of partner dance terms Pittsburgh Steelers Cliff Richard CPU cache Golf club (equipment) 1957 World Series Electric Light Orchestra Parachuting Racquet and Tennis Club Suture Tennis ball Hybrid vehicle Over (cricket) Rounders Volleyball Leon White Carbine Batting average PONG Steffi Graf University of San Francisco

if i have an oversized racquet should i go to mid plus i cant decide and am not sure if i should switch over when i started playing tennis i used an oversize i went to a midplus in college years after i started i'm going back to the oversize way more forgiving than the midplus fewer mishits easier on my arm shoulder back and everywhere else the oversize i've got is a head flexpoint radical which is considered a player's control oriented frame they are kind of rare but oversize frames that offer control not power are out there i just ordered a pair of os donnay pro one's from tw and i can't wait for those if you want more control i would advise you to find a control oriented os racquet especially if you've gotten your strokes pretty much dialed in already if you go from os to mid you will have some pretty miserable matches and practices as you adjust to the smaller hitting area speaking from my own experience it seems like alot of ppl have an anti os bias i don't know if i buy that cause while there are the super stiff os ballcrusher beginning sticks out there there are a handful or so os control racquets for more advanced players  Badminton Tennis Table tennis Squash (sport) Squash tennis Roger Federer Real tennis Pete Sampras Grip (tennis) Cricket Racquets (sport) Golf Tennis shots Bill Tilden Laws of cricket Fast bowling M16 (rifle) Poker jargon Heinkel He 112 Floppy disk ELO rating system Batting (cricket) Snooker Guilty Gear Timpani Motorcycle Violin Volleyball Suplex Seishun Academy Middle School National Football League Umpire (cricket) Golf club (equipment) Golf glossary Mark Philippoussis Swingout Professional wrestling slang Forehand University of Bristol Fielding (cricket) Playoff format Gustavo Kuerten Craps Striker Pack Baseball Radio controlled airplane Spidey Super Stories Softball Cheating in Counter-Strike Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Knots Landing Archery Nintendo GameCube Butterfly stroke Aerial (dance move) Diving Over (cricket) Goofy Tank Bicycle frame Paintball Tournament Gameplay of StarCraft Professional wrestling throws Mach kernel Drawing Monica Seles Tag Equine conformation Movie projector Indian Oil Cup 2005 Sports timeline RuneScape quests Cleveland Browns Transactional analysis Goran Ivani__evi__ Quake III Arena Peter Shilton Mario Perl Chinese character Knife American football 2000 Australian Grand Prix Glossary of American football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Short form cricket Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Super Mario 64 DS Car handling GunBound Super Bowl XXVII The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Harmonica

i cant decide between the head microgel extreme or extreme team right now i am using a head flexpoint oversize racquet i dont know what the transition from oversized to midplus would be like head microgel extreme team racquet light and very forgiving the microgel extreme is a great choice for players seeking a mobile and comfortable hit the large sq inch headsize offers a generous sweetspot and plenty of pop to help you get the job done from all areas of the court spin comes easily when hitting this one thanks to easy access to fast swing speeds and plenty of bite from the stringbed at net this racquet is very maneuverable and offers enough power to keep volleys deep and offensive without compromising the control and feel of placement shots this racquet features head microgel technology and as with other microgel racquets we found a dampened yet solid feel from this one players looking for a racquet that will continue to suit their improving game should definitely give this one a try best suited to to level players head microgel extreme racquet very maneuverable and spin friendly the extreme from head brings lots of performance to a variety of player styles and levels stronger players will love the spin and power offered from all areas of the court while improving players will enjoy the maneuverable feel and comfortable response from all areas of the stringbed our tw playtesters found some useful power from this one especially when looking for some added juice to finish off a short ball or when ripping a passing shot at net the racquet offers a very clean feeling response with excellent comfort at impact and a solid feel featuring head's new microgel technology the microgel material is placed throughout the hoop and is designed to react at contact and distribute shock around the frame our on court testing has revealed that the microgel extreme plays with a great deal more softness and comfort than one would expect from a stiff and light frame design head have also designed the hoop of the extreme racquets to be wider at the sweetspot allowing the ball to slide further across the stringbed for improved spin production as well as offering improved racquet stability this impressive racquet is well worth a demo if you're a level player seeking maneuverability spin and some useful pop from your racquet i would choose the head microgel extreme the transition won't be that much of a problem you'll get used to it easily  Volleyball Tennis Squash (sport) Table tennis Fast bowling Golf club (equipment) Fielding (cricket) Car handling Real tennis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Serve (tennis) Billiards Seishun Academy Middle School Snooker GunBound Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 English cricket team Squash tennis Mattress Poker jargon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tank Timpani Softball Metroid Prime Combine (Half-Life 2) Motorcycle Baseball Heinkel He 112 Basketball Tennis shots Bicycle Team Fortress Classic Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Batting (cricket) Ice hockey Terminal ballistics Pete Sampras Strap-on dildo Violin Cricket Golf Items in the Metroid series Pinball Bicycle frame Hard disk Mobile weapons Gramophone record Paintball Racquets (sport) Floppy disk Artillery Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Quake III Arena Apple Macintosh Laws of cricket Mountain bike Drill bit Jet engine Blood (computer game) Professional wrestling slang Skateboarding trick Super Mario 64 Universal Century Technology American football Winning Streak Glossary of American football Shotgun Satchel Paige Professional wrestling throws Wheel of Fortune Textile manufacturing Bubble Bobble Toronto Raptors USS Tunny (SS-282) Drifting (motorsport) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Grip (tennis) Mouse (computing) Digital photography SubSpace (computer game) Star Wars: Battlefront 1957 World Series Game Boy Lawn mower Ultimate (sport)

tennis now and years ago all of as know what's going on in tennis these days no need to mention anything but if we look back a few year let's say years everything was so diferent passion combat determination etc those are the words that ruled back than that's what i think i enjoyed watching tennis now i really don't know anymore what do you think on this subject am i the only one who feels this way the problem today is that there are not that many rivalries federer and nadal have been stepping it up in the rivalry department but that is a relatively new thing heating up last year other than that there is nobody that is really challenging them day in day out certanly not federer back in the day you had sampras agassi courier chang becker and edberg any of them on any given day could win a major and many of them challenged each other each time they faced each other those create some exiting rivalries today you just dont have that dynamic so there is less excitement you've got some really good players out there near the top djokovic roddick gasquet murray and some older guys that still can go deep in tournaments hewitt safin blake haas but there are just no good rivalries you know with almost complete certainty that federer against any of these other players will result in a federer win on clay you know that nadal will beat anyone so there is nothing to get excited about there is no mystery involved when you can predict the winner every time same thing in the women's game you had graff seles sanchez viccario novatna and navritilova and some interesting rivalries today with henin sharapova venus serena jankovic and mauresmo you don't really have the week in week out matchups because so few of them ever compete in the same tournaments yes any of those girls can win major tournaments but will they be facing each other in the quarters semis or finals or will they take on some no name like bartoli in the wimbledon final henin serena is an interesting rivalary but how often does it happen not nearly enough serena has been dominating sharapova and venus can beat anyone at any given time or loose to someone ranked th in the world in the second round the williams sisters never play good matches when they play each other and martina hingis is no longer in the same class with the others capriati hasen't played for years clijsters is retired lindsay davenport left but might come back maybe there is just no good ingredients for a solid rivalry in women's tennis which sucks now  The Championships, Wimbledon Andy Roddick Rafael Nadal Association of Tennis Professionals June 2004 in sports Bj__rn Borg Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics 2005 US Open Jennifer Capriati Lleyton Hewitt Mary Pierce Gustavo Kuerten Stefan Edberg Boris Becker Tennis strategy Goran Ivani__evi__ Virginia Ruano Pascual June 2005 in sports Playoff Martina Navratilova Tennis Open Era Marat Safin Andrew Murray (tennis player) John McEnroe Am__lie Mauresmo Ai Sugiyama Chris Evert U.S. Open (tennis) Tennis Masters Cup French Open Davis Cup James Blake Ivan Lendl Sania Mirza Billie Jean King Forehand Mats Wilander June 2005 in Britain and Ireland Lottie Dod Tim Henman FA Cup Mark Philippoussis Suzanne Lenglen Norway national football team July 2004 in sports Jimmy Connors Tournament Greg Rusedski Jim Courier World Chess Championship Richard Krajicek Jana Novotn__ ELO rating system Poker jargon Oakland Athletics Gabriela Sabatini Table tennis Ice hockey July 2005 in sports Thomas Muster Garry Kasparov Playoff format Single-elimination tournament Anna Kournikova Sports timeline The Ashes Yevgeny Kafelnikov Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Carlos Moy__ Richard Gasquet Sumo The Contender (television series) One-day cricket Brazil national football team Fernando Gonz__lez Rod Laver Football (soccer) Paul Levesque

what should i be able to do before i try out for the tennis team at my high school most of the players on the team have years of experience i picked up a racket two months ago right now i can hit ups and downs for two minutes before i lose the ball what else should i be able to do to increase my chances of making the team this is a question that i once had to face it depends to some extent on how well everyone else plays around the area and how your gameplay shows that you are superior it seems from the description that you have moderate concentration but lack good control on the ball i will suggest some techniques to shape up your game and make you look more confident work on conditioning if you're already a top athlete who can make lateral movements the you're all set on the other hand a typical recreational tennis player nowadays should be able to do suicides in five minutes on the tennis court before stopping begin to use topspin most tennis novices just whack the ball as hard as they can don't be one of them instead get into the ready position have your racket face open at the beginning of the swing keep the racket face firm at the contact points near your dominant foot and brush up all the while bringing the racket to a finish over your shoulder on the other side learn to volley in order to be an effective player you have to have the ability to come up to the net and put away an easy shot it's impressive to a coach if you can do this and is essential for doubles play what to do hit a solid approach shot this shot precedes the volley and should be deep and penetrating keep it to one side of the court as soon as the ball leaves your racket rush up and position yourself to hit the volley usually at waist height volleying requires good footwork ask a friend to hit a few balls to you try to hit the ball with an abrupt motion preferably not too close to the body if volleying with one hand is too hard at first use the other arm for support hit away from your opponent if possible have a special power shot many coaches are busy and will need some sort of memory mechanism to remember you the best way to create an impression is a special shot for me it was a one handed backhand but it doesn't have to be that stroke anything will do as long as you can control it well and end the point go for every ball the coach tryout official wants to see some spunk and determination your gameplay will tell him her if you are willing to go the distance in a real game keep the ball in play simply put this is the main objective in tennis the more balls you put in play the more consistent you will seem that's about as much as you will need for the tryout good luck ace 'em  Fast bowling Baseball Squash (sport) Glossary of American football Seishun Academy Middle School American football Snooker Aerial (dance move) Golf Batting (cricket) Laws of cricket Tennis shots Real tennis Beer Pong Equine conformation Softball Blackjack Rugby union American football strategy Four square Cricket Steffi Graf Bubble Bobble Basketball Billiards Swingout Football (soccer) Pete Sampras Tennis Professional wrestling attacks Poker jargon Archery Roger Federer Glossary of partner dance terms Boxing Professional wrestling throws GunBound Strap-on dildo Team Fortress Classic Bj__rn Borg Ultimate (sport) Pinball Yao Ming Eight ball Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Norway national football team Aikido Paintball Gustavo Kuerten Ice hockey Mouse (computing) Breaststroke Sport Computer and video game genres Items in the Metroid series Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Quake III Arena Fencing John McEnroe Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mixed martial arts Diving Volley Lacrosse New York Giants Bill Tilden Contract bridge The Championships, Wimbledon Golf club (equipment) Mattress Mario Power Tennis Tag Swimming Butterfly stroke Natural Selection (computer game) Gameplay of StarCraft Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Backgammon Los Angeles Clippers English cricket team RuneScape Baseball Stars Field hockey Serve and volley Dog agility Canadian football

head racquets i was thinking about buyinog a liquidmetal prestige and i was wondering if anyone here has played with one i was interested in the in head size and i'm a player who is currently using head liquidmetal with luxilon big banger string strung at i'm a high school player i haven t played with the liquidmetal so i can t comment on its playability but if you are using big banger string you obviously must hit the ball hard probably with a lot of spin the liquidmetal prestige is a pretty heavy racquet so you might not be able to generate as much racquet head speed i have several liquidmetal prestige midplus racquets on the shelf as reminders of my days this racquet is ideal for a baseliner with a big swing who can generate their own power what i love most about the racquet is the solid feel on ball contact there is little vibration on impact now a days i play with an oversize lightweight racquet so if you are interested i will let my liquidmetal prestige midplus racquets go for a decent price hope this helps robert  Badminton Squash (sport) Tennis Real tennis Table tennis Racquetball Racquets (sport) Seishun Academy Middle School Serve (tennis) Billiards Fast bowling Double bass Volleyball Equine conformation Grip (tennis) Roger Federer Golf club (equipment) Baseball Stars Golf Pete Sampras Batting (cricket) Cricket ball Eight ball Bass guitar Andre Agassi Snooker Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cricket Bill Tilden Softball Baseball Fielding (cricket) Satchel Paige Pinball 2000 Australian Grand Prix A-ha Forehand Tris Speaker Field hockey Bowling strategy (cricket) Paintball Ravi Shastri Four square American handball String instrument English cricket team Tetherball Time Out of Mind Wind turbine Plastic New York Giants Textile manufacturing Saxophone Clarinet Viola David Bowie Collision Seventh Sea (collectible card game) RuneScape weapons Piano Gaelic handball I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Sonic Advance 3 Unreal History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Bullet Hard disk Marching band Helicopter Violin Types of bowlers in cricket Mario Kart 64 Vacuum Laws of cricket Stick__ Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

second serve my first serve is very powerful but when it comes to my second serve it's really bad when serving a second serve i tend not to put that much power on it becuase thats what make me double fualt but if i don't put enough power it will cuase serious pressure on me against a good returner do u have any tips on how to make your second serve almost as good as your first i don't doubt that you have a good first serve but try this every once in a while instead of really going for it on the first one hit it at power you will find that you get more first serves in and develop a more consistant serve a really good kick serve even for a first serve is also a great way to get better a percentage of serves that actually go in  Baseball Craps Table tennis 1957 World Series Cookware and bakeware Volleyball Serve (tennis) USS Vancouver (LPD-2) Satchel Paige No Doubt Rugby union positions Electrophysiology Tennis M16 (rifle) Professional wrestling holds Social rule Equine conformation Chess terminology Internal ballistics Champagne (beverage) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cleveland Browns Andr__s Galarraga Batting average Sydney Riot of 1879 French Defence Stuttering Super Bowl XI Species in Bionicle Snooker Board of directors Theory of conduct Wind turbine In The Groove (game) Health insurance Kasparov versus The World Tip Drill bit Craig Biggio Poker jargon Badminton Amiga Power Fast bowling Chess strategy and tactics Hamburger Bon Jovi Chicago Cubs Knife Billboard Hot 100 Homer's Enemy Billiards Sheepshead Corporate governance Open cluster Swingout Hash table FairTax Pantera Unemployment Gas metal arc welding Don Budge Phoebe Halliwell Teen Girl Squad Limit Break Anchor DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Professional wrestling slang Originalism Hiberno-English Diamond Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Gospel of Thomas Procrastination Left-handed Megadeth Sweatshop Welding Bulgarian language Double Dragon Tenshinhan George Michael Darts Blackjack Strap-on dildo Tire Inspector Gadget GunBound Circuit breaker Slot machine Cincinnati Bengals Climate of Salt Lake City Goodness and value theory Mixed martial arts Oasis (band) Bobby Richardson Good Morning, Vietnam Aikido

what is the correct grip for a two hander on both wings my little sister uses both hands because she is too weak for one hand on the forehand side should the left hand be on top or the right hand i agree with the idea of having her dominant hand on the bottom of the handle if she is very little she'll eventually grow and acquire the needed strength for a one handed forehand if she prefers playing with both hands then just let her experiment until she feels comfortable i am a right handed player and play a two handed backhand with a semiwestern grip on my left hand and a continental on my right hand but hitting this way on my forehand side sounds just like overkill i guess the best grip may be an eastern on both hands but the access to putting spin on the ball may diminish greatly because the stringbed will meet the ball almost squarely unless she cocks her wrists depending on whether she swings by her left or right side my best bet let her experiment what's comfortable for her good luck on the quest  Tennis Grip (tennis) Fast bowling Tennis shots Equine conformation Forehand Serve (tennis) Table tennis Disc golf Professional wrestling attacks Baseball Volleyball Golf Seishun Academy Middle School Aerial (dance move) Contredanse Pete Sampras Steffi Graf Badminton Batting (cricket) Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Cricket Swingout History of Test cricket (to 1883) Rugby union positions Cello Beer Pong Professional wrestling holds Billiards Golf club (equipment) Snooker Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles English cricket team Three card monte Softball Laws of cricket Squash (sport) Items in the Metroid series Craps Betting (poker) Revolver History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Punt (boat) Bill Tilden Football (soccer) Textile manufacturing Fielding (cricket) Cheating in poker Cricket ball Strap-on dildo Anchor Car handling Baseball Stars Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Left-handed Dog agility Weight training Helicopter Tris Speaker Brian Close Tenshinhan Violin Double bass 2005 English cricket season Lightsaber Mattress Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Babe Ruth Croquet Lightsaber combat Football (soccer) positions Card game Glossary of American football History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Heckler & Koch G3 West Indian cricket team Spin bowling EastEnders Heckler & Koch MP5 Rugby union Wheel of Fortune Bowls Circle (dance move) Water polo Basketball The Ashes Fable (video game) Diving Field hockey Mouse (computing) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Knife Curveball Floppy disk Baccarat French Defence M16 (rifle)

tennis serve american twist vs kick serve hello i was wondering if any of you have ever preformed an american twist serve or a kick serve my tennis teacher tells me that the american twist serve is a flat serve and is used as a first serve also he has told me that i have used a kick serve during practice is there a difference between the two and also on another note what kind of spin serve is best for your second serve i have performed a kick serve many times and is partly my nd serve the american twist is very hard to get used to but can be effective if the person doesn't know it's coming the american twist serve is not a flat serve it has spin on the ball that is the opposite of slice like a seam fastball in baseball the big difference between the kick serve and the american twist serve is that the kick serve bounces up whereas the american twist serve bounces like the opposite of slice but not that much my nd serve is more like a serve half slice and half kick and it varies depending on my ball toss hope this helps and good luck in your tennis game  Tennis Table tennis Serve (tennis) Fast bowling Volleyball Grip (tennis) Aerial (dance move) Badminton Beer Pong Glossary of American football Baseball Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Seishun Academy Middle School Tennis shots Swingout Professional wrestling attacks Skateboarding trick Real tennis Cricket ball Slower ball Textile manufacturing Types of bowlers in cricket Cross-country skiing Knuckleball Suplex Four square Craps Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 American football Electrophysiology Koopa Troopa Canadian football Mario Comparison of Canadian and American football Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Rugby union New York Giants Sandy Koufax Racquetball GunBound Football (soccer) Rifle Limit Break Professional wrestling holds Coin flipping Laws of cricket Rugby union positions Spin bowling Manifold Basketball Super Bowl XXI The Prince of Tennis Ty Cobb Pitcher Australian rules football Football Cricket Leg spin Pete Sampras Tennis Bill Tilden Rugby league Onside kick Field hockey Laws of the Game Dropkick Super Bowl XXV Satchel Paige Magnus effect Super Bowl XXVII Piccolo Junior Saga Marching band Bowling strategy (cricket) American football strategy National Football League Lore St. Louis Cardinals Glossary of partner dance terms Major League Baseball television contracts Professional wrestling slang Tris Speaker Social rule Steffi Graf Water polo Tenshinhan ELO rating system Ball Kung Lao Sudden death Violin Drop kick Paintball Obi-Wan Kenobi Capoeira Winning Streak Football (soccer) positions Vin Scully E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

what string tension do most pro tennis players prefer to play with do most of them prefer low sting tension for more power and less control or high for more control but less power what do u think most of the top atp and wta players use well i know that venus williams uses to pounds of string tension because she hits the ball so hard and i could probably say the same about serena but aside from that string tension changes with the style of play and where they are playing for instance if you were playing in a high altitude venue then they would go for the higher tension string because the ball can fly and they need more control a player like martina hingis would probably use to pounds of string tension because she just uses the other players power most of the time  Martina Hingis Tennis Roger Federer Serena Williams Grand Slam (tennis) Maria Sharapova Mary Pierce Kim Clijsters Justine Henin-Hardenne Volleyball Jana Novotn__ Badminton Double bass Squash (sport) The Championships, Wimbledon Elena Dementieva Bass guitar Steffi Graf Table tennis Pete Sampras Serve (tennis) Four square Violin Jennifer Capriati Beer Pong Ai Sugiyama Anna Kournikova Sania Mirza Monica Seles Andre Agassi Cricket ball Am__lie Mauresmo Miami Masters Racquetball Venus Williams Virginia Ruano Pascual Association of Tennis Professionals Harp Lindsay Davenport Conchita Mart__nez Chris Evert Cello American football Guitar Martina Navratilova Pete Sampras Tennis Kimiko Date Helicopter Tennis Masters Cup Billie Jean King Mark Philippoussis Snooker Clarinet Jimmy Connors Twelve string guitar Svetlana Kuznetsova Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Meghann Shaughnessy Pam Shriver Billiards Tennis court Gustavo Kuerten Viola Golf glossary Sergio Garc__a Mandolin Eight ball Pinball Golf Tablature Manuela Maleeva Seishun Academy Middle School Bj__rn Borg String instrument Tennis the Menace Adolescence Super Bowl XXIII Acoustic guitar Dodgeball Gliding Poker jargon Guilty Gear Fast bowling Anastasia Myskina Bill Tilden Lottie Dod Tag Baseball Stars Paintball Mario Power Tennis ELO rating system Turbocharger Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Forehand Batting (cricket) John McEnroe Super Bowl XXI Textile manufacturing

roger federer really the best ever i read lots of answers on this subject a few really goods too but still i don't see why numbers and statistics could make someone the best ever for example nobody mentioned agassi one of the best players that ever was with a fantastic career so is federer considered the best ever only because he keep breaking tennis records or because he play the best tennis ever was this are really my favorite question why because give me the opportunity to say what i really think federer the best ever no no no statistically maybe he'll going to break other tennis records number of grand slams won weeks as number one etc but he'll never going to win roland garros and even if his challengers for the 'best ever' title don't have all the slams in their record he still need that title as for his game nothing to say he is a complete player he knows every tennis shots but his main weapon is his mental strength break that and federer is gone to justify that he can't win roland garros 'cause nadal is not scared at all of mighty federer on clay and the wimbledon final after contesting the ball that nadal challenged and won ugly reaction coming from that always calm and modest federer at the and you mentioned here agassi yes i agree with you he was a great player one of the best but no one thinks of him because he don't have so many wins as federer does and that's the thing that make a player great numbers or so seams to think lots of people these days  Rafael Nadal Roger Federer Association of Tennis Professionals Tennis Pete Sampras Andy Roddick Bj__rn Borg Marat Safin Justine Henin-Hardenne French Open Grand Slam (tennis) Virginia Ruano Pascual Steffi Graf Andrew Murray (tennis player) Mark Philippoussis Lleyton Hewitt Tennis Open Era Monica Seles Lindsay Davenport Ai Sugiyama Table tennis Chris Evert Serena Williams Elena Dementieva Martina Navratilova Billie Jean King Thomas Muster Tennis Masters Cup Jim Courier Sports timeline Kim Clijsters Tennis strategy Boris Becker Jimmy Connors Michael Chang James Blake Ivan Lendl Goran Ivani__evi__ Mats Wilander Women's Tennis Association Igor Andreev 2005 US Open Rod Laver Jennifer Capriati Pete Sampras Tennis Yevgeny Kafelnikov Stefan Edberg Don Budge Nikolay Davydenko Roy Emerson John Newcombe Michael Stich ELO rating system Jana Novotn__ Ivan Ljubi__i__ Forehand Badminton Tiger Woods Mary Pierce Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Pam Shriver Kimiko Date Lottie Dod Fernando Gonz__lez John Lloyd (tennis player) Jarkko Nieminen Marcelo R__os Guillermo Coria Richard Gasquet Roland Garros Juan Carlos Ferrero Home run Bill Tilden Sergi Bruguera Fred Perry Agust__n Calleri Maria Sharapova Venus Williams Dream Job (Season 2) Grand Slam title Rugby union Sania Mirza Patrick Rafter June 2005 in sports Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005

is there a mathematical chance of rafel nadal ever being the world number one barring any injuries to roger there appears a little chance that rafa will ever surpass federer who leads him now with over points nadal is playing so much better than many previous world number ones did at the time they enjoyed that status yet number one continues to elude him why because he is so unfortunate to have federer on the scene the tragedy is that nadal appears even likely in time to burn out and perhaps retire b federer who plays a less physical tennis mathematically speaking anyone have as good a chance of being as federer one year from now don't forget that he must defend his points because only the last weeks count even though federer has amazing points now and an overwhelming points lead over nadal if he say gets injured and doesn't play at all for an entire year his points then would be exactly zero in fact if you look at the points from jan rafa is leading slightly at the moment so if rafa betters or even equals federer from now to year's end dec rafa would now i don't really doubt federer would successfully defend most of his points and fend off rafa from but if you're asking mathematical chance sure there is federer will be on top most of the time but it's very hard to sustain excellence so i can see a year where federer slips just a notch and nadal can grab the for a brief moment but nadal's grinding game is not good for a long career exceptions apply agassi so by the time federer retires nadal himself may not have as much left in the tank rafa is unlucky to be in an era where the greatest player of all time is playing and will be labeled even though he's probably better than some other s marcelo rios for instance  Andre Agassi Rafael Nadal Roger Federer Pete Sampras Association of Tennis Professionals Gustavo Kuerten Tennis Tennis Open Era Norway national football team Volleyball 1957 World Series ELO rating system Babe Ruth Boxing Tennis Masters Cup Bj__rn Borg Andy Roddick NBA Finals Cleveland Browns Marcelo R__os San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Miami Dolphins Table tennis Toronto Blue Jays Team Fortress Classic Steffi Graf Ultimate (sport) New York Knicks Tennis strategy 2005 US Open Tag English cricket team World Chess Championship Indianapolis 500 Ivan Ljubi__i__ Robin Ventura Alex Ferguson Barry Bonds Indiana Pacers Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Wroc__aw Billboard Hot 100 Andrew Murray (tennis player) Los Angeles Kings Contract bridge Football (soccer) The Price Is Right Luck Newcastle United F.C.

why does roger feder stay at points in rankings roger has stayed at points while nadal and others keep on gaining points answers plz the reason behind your query lies in how the ranking system works the system is a month rollling system each player has to defend the number of points in the current weak which he won the correspoding week in the previous year if the player gets number of points equal to what he she earned the same week previous year then no change to his points he neither gains nor loses anything but if the player gets number of points less than what he she earned the same week previous year then he loses the difference of points and if the player gets number of points more than what he she earned the same week previous year then and only then he gains some points eg if marion bartoli reached rd round of wimbledon and last year and this year she reached the final she obviously pocketed a large number of points apart from some really hard core money so you understand my friend roger has not won more points in any week this year than he won last year however he last year lost to andy murray in cinncinati masters so we must see an increase in his number of points if he crosses the round he reached last year at the same venue and same week especially when the possibilities of andy playing that event this year are very thin i hope i helped you clarify your doubt you talk about other players they have obviously gained more number of points in at least some weeks this year than last year  Roger Federer Andre Agassi Rafael Nadal Association of Tennis Professionals Pete Sampras The Championships, Wimbledon Andy Roddick Andrew Murray (tennis player) Bj__rn Borg Poker jargon Wheel of Fortune ELO rating system Tennis Open Era Steffi Graf Gustavo Kuerten Family Feud Lleyton Hewitt Tim Henman Serena Williams Go ranks and ratings Martina Hingis Ra (board game) Boris Becker Alex Ferguson Martina Navratilova Crystal Palace F.C.

tennis training workout currently i am trying to find good tips from experience tennis player in building every aspect of my body to provide maximum performance in tennis such as jump roping and sprinting furthermore if you happen to coach tennis or have been coached can you tell me what you tell or learn from your coach for example i heard some coaches make you do constant move over and over again while some coachs does other things what activities do you find most productive in tennis and best for your game p s sorry for the long question im a tennis player i started doing this for your ball toss stand next to a high fence most likely the one around your court toss the ball up can be lower times and each time it hits the fence start over must be ft high toss when you can do this you will never miss throw take one of their racquets and position the butt end against their front shoe and then toss and allow the ball to drop it should bounce off the strings if this is unclear or not sure where to set the racquet down on court without a diagram then next best thing is toss ball up feet from end of tossing hand since racquet length leg arm extension upon point of impact should be around feet above tossing hand at completion of toss and allow ball to drop into hand this gets them to learn to toss the ball and not flick it using the wrist ground strokes hit the ball at a wall slow and close times then back up a little and do it times more and get back more and more and repeat volleys full and half have a friend hit balls to you while you stand at the t of the court and have the friend move the shots overheads have a friend lob the ball to you and you must hit the overhead before the shot hits a ground then put a cone somewhere on a court and aim for it using an overhead move cone around and work on getting more power lobs lob to a friend who will overhead to you and you lob the ball back and they overheads and so on special shots drops approach hit an approach shot to a friend who weakly returns it and then you drop shot him and start over serve put a cone in the serve box and aim for it move the cone then add power footwork run from side to side up and down maybe times then take a rest and have your team or a friend hit balls to you that you have to run to and get back into a place were they tell you to work outs jump rope times or for hours run suicides on a tennis courts run up and down the lines times may want to start out less but try and do this every day i do it every day maybe twice when im board read my profile for info on me  Racquetball Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Real tennis Baseball Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Seishun Academy Middle School Professional wrestling attacks Glossary of American football Laws of cricket Squash tennis Cricket Four square Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rugby union Golf Softball Serve (tennis) Professional wrestling holds Suplex Professional wrestling aerial techniques Basketball Snooker Batting (cricket) Billiards Fencing American football Archery Pete Sampras Ravi Shastri Craps Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Marching band Football (soccer) 1957 World Series Tag Wrigley Field Grip (tennis) Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 New York Giants Field hockey Fielding (cricket) Weight training Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Pete Sampras Tennis Diving Eight ball History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Roger Federer Water polo English cricket team Bill Tilden Dodgeball Quake III Arena Horse gait Worms weapons and tools Canadian football Mixed martial arts Rugby union positions History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Side pass (dance move) Skateboarding trick Internal ballistics Super Bowl XXVII GunBound Breaststroke Sport Collision detection USS Tunny (SS-282) Boxing GunZ The Duel Team Fortress Classic Terminal ballistics Andre Agassi Glossary of climbing terms Lindy Basic Mario Golf club (equipment) National Football League Lore Escape from New York West Indian cricket team Australian rules football Contredanse Glossary of partner dance terms

wat do you think when maria sharapova won the acura classic the wta tour put up this question which player possesses the best hardcourt game on the sony ericsson wta tour henin sharapova jankovic kuznetsova ivanovic chakvetadze serena williams venus williams other the results came up with sharapova winning now i like sharapova's hard court game but i dont think she has the best hard court game one reason is that she never really played against someone of her caliber at the acura classic another reason is that she got thoroughly beat at the austrailian open and when she won the us open mauresmo and henin were going through issuses and jankovic didnt get a chance to play her this is my list of the best hard court players serena williams jelena jankovic maria sharapova venus williams justine henin so what do you think as far as the best har courts game is the question u can hardly make a guess coz women's tennis is so competitive you don't know who might turn around whose game i personally think that maria has not only a great game but that reall attitude needed to win on hardcourts i mean she plays fast she can cool down herself at times she can play smart against players who are known to be notorious for their talent look at shara pova's victories over my favourite sania mirza and anna chakvetadze sania has been through a really hot form but chakvetadze was leading the us open series before the semis of acura classic and anna even beat venus williams after saving a match point in q f other contenders could be both the williams sisters if venus is one of the best grass court players we've ever had the same can be sid for serena on hard courts another biggie would be justine henin she has everything to become a champion an immmense pool of strokes lies in her raquet but i seriously doubt jelena jankovic's game on hard courts i have noticed some weaknesses of hers recently i think her forehand is not actually hit as an attack shot it is simply hit it coz it has come to you also her serve has nothing great on it it's not too fast anyone gets millions of milliseconds to think about the return before even the ball lands  Lindsay Davenport Women's Tennis Association Anastasia Myskina Venus Williams Monica Seles Roger Federer Table tennis Martina Hingis Pete Sampras Steffi Graf Andre Agassi Squash (sport) 2005 US Open The Championships, Wimbledon Volleyball Svetlana Kuznetsova Golf Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Badminton June 2004 in sports Am__lie Mauresmo June 2005 in sports Conchita Mart__nez Bj__rn Borg Mary Pierce Virginia Ruano Pascual Australian cricket team Meghann Shaughnessy July 2004 in sports Tennis strategy Nicole Vaidi__ov__ Billie Jean King Tennis court The Ashes Serve (tennis) Snooker June 2005 in Britain and Ireland Anna Kournikova Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Rugby union 2005 English cricket season West Indian cricket team History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Chris Evert Ai Sugiyama ESPN25 Norway national football team Suzanne Lenglen Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mats Wilander Pete Sampras Tennis Ravi Shastri International cricket in 2005 Australian Open Game show New York Knicks History of Test cricket (to 1883) John McEnroe Ultimate (sport) Gustavo Kuerten Racquetball Seishun Academy Middle School Real tennis Gordon Banks World Series Sports timeline Football (soccer) Thomas Muster May 2005 in sports 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand ELO rating system Michelle Wie The Notorious B.I.G.

sports wildcards what is a wild card in sports does the definition vary with the sport if so then i specify tennis usually a wild card is used in sports with a playoff bracket i'm not sure this is used in tennis except maybe in wimbledon but i think they would simply say 'unseeded player' in tennis in team sports that have playoffs to determine the champion there are sometimes 'wild card' routes to get into the playoff tournament some teams like the division champions would automatically get in the remaining spots in the tournament would go to the top teams who failed to win their division and are called 'wild cards'  Table tennis Finger Volleyball Manicure Scabies Hand Harp Flute The finger Tefillin Tennis Violin Clarinet Massage Salad Fingers Umpire (cricket) University of Houston Sunburn Ring finger Sitar Double bass Wedding ring Pizzicato Bass guitar Freddy Got Fingered Roger Federer The Championships, Wimbledon Duane Allman Seishun Academy Middle School MTV2 Bj__rn Borg 12 (number) Osteoarthritis Bagpipes Fire eater Zil Delta Goodrem Gesture Wire wrap Viola Fingerpicking Softball Hey Jude Chopsticks Fast bowling Cali Badminton Sticky Fingers Good Morning, Vietnam Chiromancy Milton H.

who is a better tennis player roger federer or rafael nadal anyone who says nadal is impressed with how physical and exciting a tennis match can be because nadal just runs down every ball and just strikes nadal's sttrength in tennis is his physical determination and his being a loose canon in that you never know what he will do having said that the better of the two is federer who has a very boring game specially to players on the club level but if you have played anything close to tour you'd realize the genius of the the federer game come on people do you wonder why his dominated consecutively for so long breaking the records time will tell whether he will break the longest non consecutive record as no also but by year end which because of his grand slam wins unless nadal takes the u s open a victory by anyone else assures federer of the no spot for year end which means he will just be weeks short of the all time non consecutive record for no spot is it a wonder why on other surfaces nadal is very beatable by tough players everyone loves to use the roland garros wimbledon back to back as an example in favor of nadal well guess what folks federer has made the finals of roland garros for consecutive years too so roland garros and wimbledon even things out for both of them but what about the hard court tourneys where does nadal figure out in all this yes his young and his learning and his got a long way to go guess again people this is whre the genius of the federer game is self preservation look at people who play like nadal and tell me why there careers are short lived michael chang guga kuerten goran ivasomething get my drift but at the club level nadal is definitely the better choice as he is more exciting to watch figure it out federer's non fluke loses are by nadal and canas only who have one common strategy run every ball to test federer's patience and frustration come on doreen before nadal even threatens the no spot there is already a djokovich threatening his standing let's face it some good players do not make no like all those i named above do nadal fans realize that the past greats are betting on djokovich to be the next federer did you watch montreal semi final  Rafael Nadal Roger Federer Andre Agassi Gustavo Kuerten Pete Sampras Tennis Masters Cup Tennis Tennis Open Era Table tennis Association of Tennis Professionals Andy Roddick John McEnroe Bj__rn Borg Mark Philippoussis Chris Evert French Open Davis Cup Badminton The Championships, Wimbledon Suzanne Lenglen National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) Tennis court Jimmy Connors Big East Conference Tennis strategy Stefan Edberg ELO rating system Grand Slam (tennis) NBA Finals Ivan Ljubi__i__ U.S. Open (tennis) Squash (sport) Serve (tennis) James Blake Ice hockey Kevin Curren HyperText Transfer Protocol __lbert Costa Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Monica Seles 2005 NBA Finals Women's Tennis Association National Basketball Association Playoff Steffi Graf Paintball Anatoly Karpov New York Knicks 2005 US Open Martina Hingis Volleyball Star Trek Customizable Card Game Boris Becker Counter-Strike National Hockey League rivalries Atlantic Coast Conference Four square Justine Henin-Hardenne Billie Jean King Real tennis Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Guillermo Coria June 2005 in sports Pete Sampras Tennis Rod Laver Lleyton Hewitt NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Sudden death Web server Mariano Puerta Sport in Ireland Syracuse University Orange Star Trek: First Contact Betting (poker) Playoff format Roy Emerson Larry Bird Lottie Dod Double Dragon Battle of Rafa Sopot World Chess Championship Texas Longhorn Athletics DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX IFK G__teborg Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Uniform Resource Locator Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey League R.S.C.

when the national anthem is sung while you are playing your game do you stop play this may not belong in the tennis section but it happened to me on the tennis courts this weekend so i can t be to far off while playing in a fun mixer on saturday the national anthem started to be sung at a swimming event less than feet away i could see the flag waving in the light breeze and felt like i should stop play and face the flag what is the proper flag etiquette in this situation well that is just bad timing isn't it anyway i'm not sure what the etiquette is for civilians but on a military installation everything stops when the national anthem is played but then again everyone there knows that the national anthem is played everyday at the close of the duty day since you were kinda caught by surprise my recommendation would be that you continue your game until there is a safe time to stop the game and render the proper courtesy not all americans would even consider the situation and i'm sure you wouldn't want to take a decent backhand to the head again this is just my advice i don't even know if there is a protocol for that type of situation but it is nice to know that some people still respect the flag  Badminton Volleyball Table tennis Seishun Academy Middle School Extreme Championship Wrestling Page Falkenberg Paul Levesque Sport Piccolo Junior Saga Xiaolin Showdown Tennis Glen Jacobs Eddie Guerrero Equine conformation Andre Agassi Trish Stratus Atlantic Coast Conference Mark Calaway Sports in Puerto Rico The Prince of Tennis Shen Gong Wu Commonwealth Games The Contender (television series) Kurt Angle Association of Tennis Professionals Boston University Real tennis Aikido Professional wrestling throws Bj__rn Borg Rugby union Playoff Leon White China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Weight training Water polo Professional wrestling slang Single-elimination tournament Recumbent bicycle Professional wrestling Shawn Michaels World Championship Wrestling University of Texas at Arlington Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Jack Charlton John McEnroe 1896 Summer Olympics Tag Second Battle of the Atlantic Pete Sampras Hulk Hogan Yao Ming John Layfield Insulin United States Air Force Academy Physical education Illinois Fighting Illini ELO rating system Chinese Basketball Association National pastime Playoff format Paintball Mike Bucci Gottfried von Cramm Tournament Tenshinhan Jim Ross Ravi Shastri Bundesliga (football) New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics Roger Federer Jimmy Connors May 2005 in sports University of Indianapolis Rod Stewart United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Eugene and William Regal Don Budge Women's National Basketball Association Glencoe High School New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Humerus Baseball Beer Pong Computer and video game genres Sandy Koufax August 2004 in sports Minnesota Golden Gophers Rocky Marciano I, the Jury Bill Goldberg Meat Loaf Sports timeline West Virginia University James E.

what do you think is a more affective serve a kick serve up the middle kicking away from the opponents backhand or a flat serve up the middle to their backhand it depends on many circumstances the efficacy of a flat serve is guaranteed to work if it has some heat on the serve however if the kick serve is performed to perfection it can be much more effective this is for more of advanced play also if the server is a lefty a kick serve takes a tremendous lift in the difficulty and it takes much practice to return this serve this really depends on what level of tennis you are playing virtually any serve to the opponents backhand is a successful serve that you should be able to put the point away i'm sure you have a great flat serve but its always great to work a kick serve to have variety to surprise ur opponent i hope this helped good luck with your tennis bro  Tennis The Championships, Wimbledon Roger Federer Gustavo Kuerten Andre Agassi Suzanne Lenglen French Open Pete Sampras Grand Slam (tennis) Virginia Ruano Pascual Bj__rn Borg Justine Henin-Hardenne Volleyball Table tennis Chris Evert Monica Seles Billie Jean King Steffi Graf Stefan Edberg Andrew Murray (tennis player) Conchita Mart__nez Elena Dementieva Roy Emerson Andy Roddick Marat Safin John McEnroe Mats Wilander Boris Becker Baseball Rafael Nadal Tennis court John Newcombe Women's Tennis Association Kim Clijsters Martina Navratilova Serena Williams Lindsay Davenport Rod Laver Mark Philippoussis Tennis Open Era Bill Tilden Pete Sampras Tennis Goran Ivani__evi__ Michael Chang Kimiko Date Don Budge Lleyton Hewitt Thomas Muster Ai Sugiyama Sports timeline Venus Williams Lottie Dod Satchel Paige St. Louis Cardinals Mattress Home run Mary Pierce Tag Piccolo Junior Saga Badminton Ivan Lendl Time Out of Mind Four square History of Test cricket (to 1883) Ty Cobb Kevin Curren Real tennis Sania Mirza World Series 2004 World Series Racquetball Margaret Smith Court Jon Secada Norway national football team Wendy Turnbull Jana Novotn__ Zina Garrison Tim Henman Laws of cricket Anastasia Myskina Nikolay Davydenko American football Snooker Gottfried von Cramm NBA Finals Shawn Michaels Golf Blonde on Blonde Pat Cash Roland Garros The Cure

do tennis pros's restring their racquet's every time after a match or use the same one the next day their tennis raqeuts always seem to be brand new and if they do restring them how come they still have the logo sing in them simple answer is some do and some don't pete sampras had a stringer that usually travelled with him and he would have all his rackets restrung for every match including the ones he never used you do that if you have the and he did but not until he was most restring for each tournament where there is a change in conditions and have the racket they played with that day restrung the logo is just a stencil and there is a large 'magic marker' they color the strings with some stringers in your area probably can do yours for about if they have your brand stencil like the wilson 'w' or prince 'p' etc you can buy the stencils also and do it yourself i think the tenniswarehouse has them and probably all the big tennis shops they used to sell a kit that had the entire alphabet so you could put your own initial on the racket if you want your own custom logo done google search custom tennis stencils and there is atleast one company who will make a custom stencil for you  Volleyball Pete Sampras Tennis Professional wrestling aerial techniques 1957 World Series Kim Clijsters Bj__rn Borg Fielding (cricket) New York Giants Four square Pinball Roger Federer Badminton Association of Tennis Professionals Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Grand Slam (tennis) Andre Agassi Vin Scully Professional wrestling throws Snooker Lindsay Davenport The Championships, Wimbledon Toronto Raptors Women's Tennis Association Bill Tilden Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Martina Hingis Steffi Graf Kurt Angle Batting (cricket) Mark Philippoussis National Football League Lore Seishun Academy Middle School 2004 American League Championship Series Beer Pong Chris Evert Whitney Houston World Series Los Angeles Kings Golf Tag Pete Sampras Tennis Serena Williams John McEnroe Racquetball Sports timeline American football strategy Paintball Water polo Cleveland Browns Tenshinhan Laws of cricket Eddie Guerrero Andrew Murray (tennis player) Super Bowl XXVII The Ashes Martina Navratilova The Isley Brothers Real tennis San Francisco 49ers Justine Henin-Hardenne Ultimate (sport) Squash (sport) Gustavo Kuerten Sania Mirza English cricket team Rugby union positions 2005 World Series Rugby union Jimmy Connors Mary Pierce Super Bowl XIX Suzanne Lenglen Blood (computer game) Squash tennis Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Extreme Dodgeball Britney Spears Serve (tennis) Cliff Richard Slam Dunk Contest History of Test cricket (to 1883) Robin Ventura Jennifer Capriati Indian Oil Cup 2005 Michael Chang Parachuting Stefan Edberg Michael Jordan Tennis shots Basketball Tennis Masters Cup Ken Rosewall Lleyton Hewitt Suplex ESPN25

why is roger federer so good obviously because he wins but what skills make him able to win so much he put in all the effort when he was younger i watched a tennis channel hour long show on him if i remember correctly he left home on his own accord to train at the best academy in switzerland at age your question is backwards he is not good because he wins he wins because he is good he is able to beat almost anybody from any position on the court it does not matter whether he has to hit winners to win a match or allow his opponent to make errors he is so mentally tough at every style of play that is it ridiculously hard for anyone to beat him he is probably one of the most mentally tough players on tour hewitt has to be tops in that category federer has amazing hands when he comes to net and can hit any angle known to man yet at the same time he has an extremely consistent and deadly forehand and one of the best one handed backhands in the game his serve is also no laughing matter he can hit almost mph and put the ball in the corner of the service box he can put any range of spins on the ball off the ground or on serve he as john mcenroe says will become the greatest player of all time if he wins the french open  Tennis Roger Federer Pete Sampras Table tennis Bj__rn Borg Badminton Pete Sampras Tennis John McEnroe Association of Tennis Professionals Squash (sport) Gustavo Kuerten Racquets (sport) Serve (tennis) Bill Tilden Marat Safin Goran Ivani__evi__ The Championships, Wimbledon Sears Holdings Corporation Michael Chang The Prince of Tennis Real tennis Maria Sharapova Mark Philippoussis Slazenger World Championship Wrestling Racquetball Stefan Edberg Squash tennis Tennis the Menace Yu-Gi-Oh!

what type of tennis ball machine do you recommend i used to play a lot in college and now years later i need to get back in the game it would just be me using it i do have electricity at the local court but am willing to look at the battery operated ones out there too thanks for the input a few months ago i spent quite a lot of time researching the available ball machines decided on a battery operated two rotating wheel as opposed to pneumatic with verticle wheels not side by side side by side can't generate topspin then bought the silent partner sport on sale now at sptennis com for shipping didn't want to spend the extra for the pro it's excellent best purchase i have made in years i use it everyday my game has improved dramatically adjustable speed angle pitch speed topspin backspin oscillation etc it can pitch at mph with incredible topspin just like venus has two batteries is easily interchangeable so if you want to pick up an additional one off the net for you can swap them out i get about to hours out of one overnight charge of the two built in batteries some drawbacks although it does have wheels and a pull handle it's a bit awkward to lug around weighs about lbs you'll see what i mean but then all machines are and of course all machines have this problem the tennis balls the machine holds balls you must have a pickup hopper gamma makes one for about that holds balls not bad and the balls themselves i spent about buying heavy duty pressurized penn tennis balls they lasted about weeks then the ball placement on the court became inconsistent i then spent another buying pressureless balls they lasted about weeks hitting hours per day they are now bald they land consistently the court but they bounce odd my message to you is this silent partner sport or pro if you want the remote and be prepared to buy a whole lot of tennis balls i have spent about k total on machine and balls this year and expect to spend another before the snow sets in oh one other thing for the entrepreneur in you almost daily someone asks me if they can rent my machine  Am__lie Mauresmo Elena Dementieva Kim Clijsters Serena Williams Steffi Graf Andre Agassi Martina Navratilova Pete Sampras John McEnroe Grand Slam (tennis) Chris Evert Bj__rn Borg Martina Hingis Nicole Vaidi__ov__ Mary Pierce The Championships, Wimbledon Piccolo Junior Saga Virginia Ruano Pascual Rod Laver June 2005 in sports Stefan Edberg 2005 US Open Women's Tennis Association Jimmy Connors Billie Jean King Mats Wilander Ai Sugiyama Sania Mirza Andy Roddick Roy Emerson Roger Federer July 2005 in sports Monica Seles Lindsay Davenport Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Goran Ivani__evi__ Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Michael Chang Datalore (TNG episode) Tennis Gustavo Kuerten Lleyton Hewitt Boris Becker Venus Williams Anastasia Myskina The Shining (film) John Newcombe Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Australian English Ivan Lendl Paola Su__rez Conspiracy (TNG episode) Jennifer Capriati Patrick Rafter June 2004 in sports Social rule The Star Wars Holiday Special She Loves You Marat Safin Michael Stich Theory of conduct Whose Line Is It Anyway?

tennis question well i have this problem where i play good tennis with my coach but i don't play as good when i play with my coach with my dad why is that tennis is totally mental playing with your dad can actually help you overcome a huge point in your game sometimes you go against people who intimidate you if you can overcome that you'll be untouchable focus on playing your game focus on your timing and don't worry about what your dad thinks you know me and my mom used to play in her day she was awesome and i used to be really intimidated then i started focusing on my game and my strategy and i started beating her when i stopped looking at her like my mom and more like and opponent while we were on the court it helped  Tennis Pete Sampras Tennis shots Table tennis Badminton Seishun Academy Middle School Serve (tennis) Grip (tennis) Paintball Andre Agassi The Championships, Wimbledon Roger Federer Norway national football team Steffi Graf Disc golf Golf Tennis strategy Baseball Real tennis Monica Seles ELO rating system Racquetball Ultimate (sport) Squash tennis Chris Evert Bill Tilden American football Four square Gustavo Kuerten Squash (sport) Basketball Grand Slam (tennis) Serve and volley Frank Sedgman Beer Pong Football (soccer) Pete Sampras Tennis Sport Don Budge Shogi Andy Roddick Water polo Snooker Suzanne Lenglen Minesweeper (computer game) Lacrosse Softball Texas Longhorn Athletics Bj__rn Borg Chess strategy and tactics Fencing Lottie Dod Billiards The Prince of Tennis Cricket Field hockey Weight training Chess opening Georgia Institute of Technology Table football Ty Cobb Magic: The Gathering Guilty Gear West Virginia University Mark Philippoussis Rugby union Poker jargon John McEnroe Sudden death Single-elimination tournament Playoff format University of Houston Eventing Texas hold 'em Contract bridge Davis Cup Sachin Tendulkar Sheepshead Dodgeball National Football League Scrabble Canasta Quake III Arena Association of Tennis Professionals Jack Charlton George Jay Gould II Quizbowl Ivan Lendl FC Rostov Andrew Murray (tennis player) Justine Henin-Hardenne Reggie Jackson Violin Beach volleyball Capoeira Mahjong

i always hit my forehands back too high and my backhands haven't been working for me lately it's so frustrating ugh lol anyways how can i change that thanks alot ah i often have the same problem there are two reasons as to why backhands seem to float let me offer a a few tips to keep it in shape lack of topspin one of the usages for topspin is to make sure that a hard struck ball falls onto the court since you seem like you have been hitting for a while i would suggest that you take the ball in front of your body a bit more than from the side if you take the ball late on the bounce when it is at your side less of the force on the ball is directed forward and will cause you to overshoot hitting the ball slightly in front of you not only allows for accuracy but also helps to generate the topspin you need for the ball to land within the boundaries of the court lengthen your stroke and follow through this applies more to your backhand in order to make a controlled and accurate shot you need a strong base of support for your arms on a backhand you do this in two ways bend low for stability and plant your foot on the ground if you're a rightie it should be the right foot if you're a leftie use the left foot the stroke should follow after getting into the ready position be sure to take a healthy backswing using one arm as a brace for support make contact at the side or slightly in front and throw your full weight behind the stroke you should never try to stop midway through your stroke at waist height instead make sure that the racket face finishes near shoulder length it should be if you bend low brush up on the ball if you need more topspin i hope this will add consistency and power to your game ace 'em  Pete Sampras Tennis Andre Agassi Roger Federer Steffi Graf Table tennis Badminton Monica Seles Real tennis Social rule Squash (sport) Cincinnati Bengals Bj__rn Borg Violence in sports Grandview, U.S.A.

whose grand slam career would you rather have sampras' or agassi's i would lean towards agassi's a career grand slam on different surfaces pretty stellar sampras was a total pro and never lost his focus people can continue to use stats to validate careers but for my money andre agassi is the most talented man in the history of the court now that doesn't mean that he always showed to the dedication of a sampras or federer but i think he was the best tennis player especially if you factor in his height kind of short if he could have had another mph on his serves he would have had more grand slam titles over all i enjoyed watching the game of agassi much more than sampras not only did agassi win all the slams at least once he won a gold olympic medal i miss him he was the only player that i made a point to watch i can't take anything away from pistol pete but i would have rather lived through agassi's eyes  Marat Safin Pete Sampras Roger Federer Yevgeny Kafelnikov Manicure Andre Agassi Goran Ivani__evi__ Lleyton Hewitt Harmonica Gustavo Kuerten Pedicure Nail (anatomy) Timpani Textile manufacturing Tennis Sock Charles O.

can someone explain how tennis is played i enjoy watching it but do not understand how points are awarded some basic rules stuff like that here is how a tennis match goes from start to finish toss a coin and pick heads or tails the winner of the toss decides who will serve first the loser decides which side of the court each player will start on first in a tennis match you must win or more points to win a game depending on how many points the other player has won either or games to win a set depending on how many games the other player has won and you must win out of the sets played to win a match if you win the first two sets there is no need to play a third you have already won the match each game both players start at love which means points in tennis st point is called nd point is called rd point is called th point wins the game so if the server wins the first point the score is love but if the receiver wins it it's called love the server's score is always anounced first so if the server wins the first two points and the receiver wins the next point the score is called you must win a game by at least two points so if both players have reached or duece you must continue playing the game until one player wins two consecutive points when the score is deuce if the server wins the next point the score is then called ad in or advantage servers name if the server looses the duece point then the score is called ad out or advantage receivers name if the score is ad in and the server wins the next point he has won the game if he looses that point the score goes back to deuce theoretically a deuce game can go on forever until one player wins two consecutive points the server starts the game by serving into the deuce court right hand side of the court diagonally trying to get the ball in the opposite service box you get two tries if the serve goes in the box the point is started but if it doesn't then it's called a fault and you get a second chance if the server faults twice double fault they loose the point on the next point the server then moves to the other side and serves from the ad court or left side of the court play continues like that rotating sides after every point if the ball touches the net on the serve but lands correctly in the service box it's called a let serve and it's basically a do over you can have as many lets as you need because you are not penalized for a let ball however if the ball touches the net on a serve but lands outside the service box it's a fault at any other point in the game if the ball touches the net it's still considered to be in play if you toss the ball before a serve but catch it in your hand or let it drop to the ground it's not a fault and you are not penalized however if you make any attempt to hit the ball before serving even if you miss it will count as a fault if it doesn't go in the service box each set the first player to win games wins the set as long as you win by two games for example if the game score is on your serve and you win the next game you have won the set however if the score is and you win the next game you have not won the set yet the opponent still has one more game to stay in it because you must win the set by at least two games if both players have reached then you have to play a tiebreak to determine who wins the set players must rotate ends after every odd game has been played ie rotate ends after the st game the rd game the th game etc tiebreaks if player a served in the last game then player b will serve the first point in the tiebreak the next two points are served by player a then player b serves the next two and so on basically the server changes after every odd point after ever points are played both players will rotate ends in order to win a tiebreak you must be the first player to win points again winning by two if the score reaches in the tiebreak you keep playing until someone wins two consecutive points the winner of the tiebreak wins the set match most matches are played in a best of sets in grandslam tournaments the men play best of sets but those matches can go on for or hours or more most people play best of both players must shake hands at the net this is an unofficial sportsmanship rule in tennis challenge system a new development in the sport over the last year and a half has been the hawkeye challenge system in tournaments played on hardcourts each player has two challenges per set in which they can challenge a line call in or out example if player hits a ball that is called out but he she saw it as good they can challenge the call and a computer enhanced video replay is show on the bigscreen if player was correct the call is overturned and they will either replay the point if player was close enough to the ball to be able to return it or player will automatically win the point if player had no possible way of returning it if a player wins a challenge they keep their two challenges but if they loose the challenge they automatically loose the point and they have one of their challenges taken away terminology rally period of time when the ball is in play ace when a player serves a good ball that the receiver cannot get their racket on groundstroke a forehand or backhand executed after the ball bounces once volley ball that is struck before it hits the ground usually at the net half volley a shot that is hit immediatly after the ball bounces once on the uprise the most difficult shot in tennis smash overhead shot that is hit above the head with a serve like motion lob a shot that is executed high and deep in the court often sailing over the opponents head often used with topspin dropshot a shot where the ball is tapped so slightly that it falls just over the other side of the net so the opponent has to run up to it flat shot powerful type of shot where the ball is hit very hard with almost no spin on it topspin type of spin motion where the player brushes up over the top of the ball as they hit puts forwards motion on the ball and makes it dip down into the court and bounce up higher slice type of spin motion where the opponent 'cuts' underneath the ball as they hit puts backspin on the ball and makes it float slower and lower over the net unforced error a mistake made by a player net ball or out of bounds due to their own lack of precision timing or mishits forced error a mistake made by a player that was caused by the opponent if a player is overpowered stretched out wide or on the dead run when they make an error  Roger Federer Grand Slam (tennis)

why are there more righties than lefties in tennis maria sharapova is a leftie but decided to play as a right handed is being a left handed in tennis a bad thing the simple answer is there are more right handed people in the world and so out of players are right handed and perhaps as left handed kids learning tennis in a big group they follow what the others are doing in maria sharapova's case when i was younger i played a little bit more left handed i played lefty for about a year or something when i was then i played a little bit both hands then i went back to right handed also carlos moya's is a leftie playing right handed nobody forced me it was just the hand i used when i started out at three or four maybe somebody just handed me the racket that way on the other hand rafael nadal is a rightie playing left handed when he was younger toni his uncle and coach decided that his two handed backhand would benefit from a strong right arm playing left handed is definitely not a bad thing in tennis in fact it is usually regarded as a little advantage i think it's good he's a lefty federer said because it also changes the dimensions of the rallies the way you play the spins come the other way so that's going to be interesting that puts a totally different game plan in place  Roger Federer Andre Agassi Rafael Nadal Pete Sampras Bj__rn Borg Tennis Open Era Association of Tennis Professionals French Open Grand Slam (tennis) Teen Girl Squad Lleyton Hewitt Gustavo Kuerten Andy Roddick Boris Becker Steffi Graf Ivan Lendl Goran Ivani__evi__ Stefan Edberg Justine Henin-Hardenne Double the Fist Carlos Moy__ The Championships, Wimbledon Michael Chang Marat Safin Mark Philippoussis Tank Aerosmith Jim Courier KaBlam!

someone please tell me all about string tention what do most women use is perfect or no o ya my racquet is a wilson nsix two ncode hello again secretlover the wilson n ncode or ncoded skunk is a very good racquet i assume that you got the square inch midplus the power level is a low mid which should provide you with enough pop the x string pattern is my favourite in the wilson line and you should find a large sweetspot on this frame the recommended tension range of is what wilson feels will suit the player best for playabilty would give you excellent control but require you to have a full swing power wise it will still have enough power for a full swing at the low end say it would give you the most power but as it is already a powerful midplus frame players may find the control lacking tennis shops that string frames for players and potential buyers to demo usually do them at mid which is why would be a recommended starting point for you it will only be after you hit with it and play a set or two that you can determine if it is the right tension for you or if you need to add a couple lbs for more control if you are hitting long or decrease a couple lbs for more power if you find your shots falling short on court with the swing you use normally in matches there is no way to tell perfect tension for you without you playing the frame at different tensions to determine for yourself when i switch frames i will pick up anywhere from frames so that i can try different strings and different tensions to find my perfect match most people won't do that and i wouldn't recommend you too if you play tournaments then frames or more is the norm next would be the string some string are more elastic than other and you may need to string higher soft multi's gut some are extremely harsh and you may need to string lower luxilon is one of these which is why they say string lower than normal next gauge thinner gauge strings are more giving or pocketing and will add more power to the frame lower gauge or thicker strings will not stretch or give as much if you think this is confusing or complex the pros are said to know if their frames are strung even a pound less than usual and have them restrung daily in tournaments whether they may have used the frame or not talk about extreme and picky but it is their livelyhood and they are sensitive to the racquet read through the customer feedbacks try to find players similar to yourself females at a certain level of play see what they say about the frame and see what string and what tension they were using this may help you decide too http www tennis warehouse com feedback html pcode n hope all this helps  Roger Federer Tennis The Championships, Wimbledon Gustavo Kuerten John McEnroe Jimmy Connors Women's Tennis Association Pete Sampras Andrew Murray (tennis player) Andre Agassi Wild card Playoff format Michael Chang Tennis Masters Cup Playoff Lleyton Hewitt Duelists' Convocation International U.S. Open (tennis) Rod Laver Serena Williams Ivan Lendl Bj__rn Borg Sania Mirza Pok__mon Trading Card Game Thomas Muster Fernando Gonz__lez Go ranks and ratings Andy Roddick U.S. Open (golf) Sergi Bruguera Norway national football team Certification Professional golf tours PGA Championship Suzanne Lenglen Arthur Ashe Mark Philippoussis Lindsay Davenport Grand Slam Cup Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering) Virginia Ruano Pascual National Football League ELO rating system Igor Andreev Tim Henman Stefan Edberg Richard Gasquet HSBC World Match Play Championship Virginia Commonwealth University Grand Slam (tennis) Rugby union Teacher The Open Championship Tiger Woods Tennis Open Era Martina Hingis Marcelo R__os Tournament Magic: The Gathering Goran Ivani__evi__ LPGA James Blake Snooker Michelle Wie Rafael Nadal Physician Table tennis Michael Campbell Australia national football team Bundesliga (football) Boris Becker Jennifer Capriati Golf Poker jargon Davis Cup Don Budge Arnold Palmer Mats Wilander Go (board game) Jack Nicklaus Juan Carlos Ferrero Nikolay Davydenko Lawyer Credit union Jarkko Nieminen Football World Cup Pilot certification in the United States Quizbowl Vijay Singh PGA European Tour Justine Henin-Hardenne Sports timeline Lottie Dod Billie Jean King Patrick McEnroe Poker tournament

how do points work in the atp how do points work i was watching the rogers cup and the announcers were talking about richard gasquet doing so well last year finals and lost to roger federer and this year he got eliminated in the second round and the announcers were saying this was going to affect the points he got from last years rogers cup or did i misunderstand you heard correctly the scoring in the atp works based on calculating for each player his total points from the 'mandatory' events the four grand slams and the nine atp masters series tournaments and his best five results from all eligible international series tournaments from the past weeks since the rankings are recalculated after each event in the year if a player did really well in a tournament the year before and if he doesn't do as well the next year he loses the points that he won from the previous year this therefore means many of players have to play in the same tournaments that they did well in in order to defend the points they received the year before  Justine Henin-Hardenne Andre Agassi Kim Clijsters Roger Federer Bj__rn Borg Elena Dementieva Martina Hingis Gustavo Kuerten Tennis Boris Becker Pete Sampras Steffi Graf John McEnroe Heir Apparent Lleyton Hewitt Hollyoaks Women's Tennis Association Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ai Sugiyama Association of Tennis Professionals Jennifer Capriati Characters from Arrested Development Am__lie Mauresmo Martina Navratilova Monica Seles Volleyball Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Carlos Moy__ Ivan Lendl Lottie Dod EastEnders Badminton Texas Longhorn Athletics French Open 24 Hours of Le Mans Virginia Ruano Pascual Jimmy Connors Paul Is Dead Marie Antoinette Friends Michael Schumacher Kodocha Chris Evert Juan Carlos Ferrero Venus Williams Knots Landing Suzanne Lenglen Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Billie Jean King Family Janet Jackson Ravi Shastri Big Brother (USA TV series) Joke Lindsay Davenport University of Texas at Austin Tiger Woods The Open Championship Malcolm in the Middle Family name Diana, Princess of Wales R.S.C.
