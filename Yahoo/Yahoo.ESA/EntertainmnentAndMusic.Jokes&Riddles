father thought for a moment then answered goask your mother if she would sleep with brad pitt for amillion dollars then ask your sister if she would sleepwith brad pitt for a million dollars and then ask your brother if he'd sleep with brad pitt for a million dollars come back and tell me what you learn from that so the boy went to his mother and asked would yousleep with brad pitt for a million dollars the mother replied of course i would we could reallyuse that money to fix up the house and send you kids toa great university the boy then went to his sister and asked would yousleep with brad pitt for a million dollars the girl replied oh good heavens i love brad pittand i would sleep with him in a heartbeat are you nuts the boy then went to his brother and asked wouldyou sleep with brad pitt for a million dollars of course the brother replied do you know howmuch a million bucks would buy the boy pondered the answers for a few days and thenwent back to his dad his father asked him did you find out the differencebetween 'potentially' and 'realistically' the boy replied yes 'potentially' you and i are sittingon three million dollars but 'realistically' we're living withtwo hookers and a future congressman try this pea story cute is close to joke babs miller was bagging some early potatoes for me i noticed a small boy delicate of bone and feature ragged but clean hungrily apprising a basket of freshly picked green peas i paid for my potatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh green peas i am a pushover for creamed peas and new potatoes pondering the peas i couldn't help overhearing the conversation between mr miller and the ragged boy next to me hello barry how are you today h'lo mr miller fine thank ya jus' admirin' them peas sure look good they are good barry how's your ma fine gittin' stronger alla' time good anything i can help you with no sir jus' admirin' them peas would you like to take some home no sir got nuthin' to pay for 'em with well what have you to trade me for some of those peas all i got's my prize marble here is that right let me see it here 'tis she's a dandy i can see that hmmmmm only thing is this one is blue and i sort of go for red do you have a red one like this at home not zackley but almost tell you what take this sack of peas home with you and next trip this way let me look at that red marble sure will thanks mr miller mrs miller who had been standing nearby came over to help me with a smile she said there are two other boys like him in our community all three are in very poor circumstances jim just loves to bargain with them for peas apples tomatoes or whatever when they come back with their red marbles and they always do he decides he doesn't like red after all and he sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an orange one perhaps i left the stand smiling to myself impressed with this man a short time later i moved to colorado but i never forgot the story of this man the boys and their bartering several years went by each more rapid that the previous one just recently i had occasion to visit some old friends in that idaho community and while i was there learned that mr miller had died they were having his viewing that evening and knowing my friends wanted to go i agreed to accompany them upon arrival at the mortuary we fell into line to meet the relatives of the deceased and to offer whatever words of comfort we could ahead of us in line were three young men one was in an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts dark suits and white shirts all very professional looking they approached mrs miller standing composed and smiling by her husband's casket each of the young men hugged her kissed her on the cheek spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket her misty light blue eyes followed them as one by one each young man stopped briefly and placed his own warm hand over the cold pale hand in the casket each left the mortuary awkwardly wiping his eyes our turn came to meet mrs miller i told her who i was and mentioned the story she had told me about the marbles with her eyes glistening she took my hand and led me to the casket those three young men who just left were the boys i told you about they just told me how they appreciated the things jim traded them now at last when jim could not change his mind about color or size they came to pay their debt we've never had a great deal of the wealth of this world she confided but right now jim would consider himself the richest man in idaho with loving gentleness she lifted the lifeless fingers of her deceased husband resting underneath were three exquisitely shined red marbles  Friends Sin City Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart

squirrel question just for entertainment first correct answer with explaination gets the points a squirrel climbs a tree that is m high with a circumference of m suppose the squirrel climbs the tree in a uniform upward spiral turning times around the tree how far did the squirrel travel here's my guess if you go directly around the tree three times without goes up you would travel meters if you went directly up without going around it would be metres so you can use these values as a right angled triangle to work out the hypotonuse a squared b squared c squared where a b and c the hypotonuse or the distance the squirrel travelled so therefore c the squirrel travelled metres i hope this explanation makes sense  Tide Metre Speed of light Kepler's laws of planetary motion Gravity Volleyball Species Pi Softball Basketball Force Sun Circle The nature of God in Western theology Expert system Eye GED Collision detection Stairway Scientology beliefs and practices Glider Theory of conduct Zeno's paradoxes Yosemite Valley Normal distribution Triangle Ethernet Crossword Helicopter Jumpstart 3rd Grade Standard deviation Time travel Archimedes Sierra Nevada (US) Antenna (radio) Hyperbolic geometry Sundial Milky Way Four square Northern Flying Squirrel Geodesy Snooker Squirrel Hipparchus (astronomer) Aristarchus Conker's Bad Fur Day Many-worlds interpretation Maxwell's equations Starfleet ranks and insignia Torque Trigonometric function Scrabble (game show) Glossary of graph theory Napier's bones Angle Fixed-wing aircraft Symmetry Great Pyramid of Giza Solar system Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Catalan number Bayesian inference Parabola Charge (heraldry) String theory Robert Goddard (scientist) Pascal's triangle Billiards Sail-plan Labor theory of value On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Quantum computer Pythagorean theorem Wa shogi Opportunity rover ATLAS experiment Complex number Professional wrestling holds Gee EPR paradox Eratosthenes Phillips curve GunBound View camera Supernatural Avalanche Now You See It Coriolis effect Depth of field Sciurinae Transformer Faster-than-light Problem of universals Polyhedron Overhead lines Cerebellum Tsunami Solar power Alhazen

have you heard the joke about the poison watermelon this dude had a wattermellon stolen from his patch and put up a sign saying' beware one of these wattermellons is now poison the next morning there was another sign that said now you beware two of these wattermellons are now poison i think the point is that the thief had come back and retaliated it doesn't matter whether the dude had actually poisoned one of his own watermelons or had just put up the sign to frighten off the thief he wouldn't have known if the thief was for real either or which one he would have poisoned if he had been for real so all the watermelons would have to be discarded anyway  Ocean's Twelve Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Joker (comics) MapleStory The Tale of the Body Thief Johnny 5 Clown Denis Leary Waking the Dragons Quest for Glory The Marshall Mathers LP Vlad III Dracula Kimi Finster The Hobbit Jackass: The Movie Ragnarok Online FoxTrot Anne Rice Breath of Fire III Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Curse of Fenric YuYu Hakusho Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Juggalo Spidey Super Stories Steven Wright Bart's Girlfriend Wayne's World 2 Cheating in poker Blink-182 Oh My Goddess!
