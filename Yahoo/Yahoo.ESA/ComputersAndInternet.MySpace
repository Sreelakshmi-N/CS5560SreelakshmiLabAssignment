i reported abuse and i am wondering if they will take action on myspace there are some very awful awful videos posted by some looney that i came across when i was just looking through videos the videos are showing our soldiers being tortured killed etc being that he posted these isn't that innapropriate i have done it times now because i just can't believe that is allowed on there i know we have freedoms but this idiot is no journalist i mean something has to be done it is so disgraceful to our soldiers and their families of those who have lost them it just make me sick so my is will they let his profile stay that way and will they leave those videos on there even with our freedoms they still have their own rules so they should do something right that definitely sounds like a violation however the myspace team usually runs automated programs to replace their human moderators and so they may have programmed the site to only send them videos to review only if they have been flagged a certain number of times by a number of different users personally i find them to be very unreliable they take days to respond to your emails and often times they dont reply at all my best advice is not to fixate on that video try to forget about it and it'll eventually be deleted after a matter of time they don't usually last that long anyways because responsible users like you are quick to report em good for you  Something Awful Forums Stopping e-mail abuse Something Awful Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act RuneScape cheats MySpace E-mail Cindy Sheehan E-mail spam Internet troll IBM PC compatible Computer Beavis and Butt-head Internet Relay Chat Amnesty International Democratic Underground The Best Page in the Universe Fark.com GameFAQs message boards Computer virus Gmail GameFAQs Neopets John Lott Utilitarianism Guantanamo Bay Yusuf al-Qaradawi Forum moderator Slashdot subculture Unlawful combatant Independent Media Center Internet forum Theory of conduct TV Tome 2channel Mafia (game) Xanga Ajax (programming) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Colbert Report The Amber Spyglass Password Expert system Wikipedia Rachel Corrie Monday Night Football International Freedom of Expression Exchange Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Netfilter/iptables Slashdot trolling phenomena John Kerry military service controversy Aladdin (1992 film) LiveJournal Social software Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Pretty Good Privacy Ex-gay Spam Prevention Early Warning System Swift Vets and POWs for Truth Orkut Make money fast Weezer Kenneth Bigley Uses of torture in recent times Blog War on Terrorism Phishing Search engine optimization Computer and video games Girls Aloud Karl Rove DeviantART Scientology versus The Internet Spam (electronic) Terri Schiavo Downing Street memo Mouse (computing) Pat Tillman U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Have I Got News For You KMFDM Public domain America Online Cross site scripting Oil-for-Food Programme OpenDocument 2003 Invasion of Iraq Ann Coulter Podcasting Debugging Internet phenomenon Extreme Programming Tag Slashdot Camp Delta 2004 Republican National Convention Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

why do people esp young girls post pictures of themselves in their underwear and such on myspace esp answer if you do this seriously i'm just curious and don't you get creepy comments for attention i don't personally do this but having worked with youth and many adults who follow in these patterns they tend to have a want and a need to be noticed appreciated and to just have attention and in our society today where the physical is what is considered to make a person beautiful which i don't agree with cause there is more to someone being beautiful than just their body they want to be appreciated and looked at as beautiful and they want that wanted feeling and attention  Autism Child sexuality Motion picture rating system Near-death experience Physical attractiveness Prank flash Transsexuality Marilyn Monroe Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Charles Goodyear Sharon Tate Pedophilia Anne Rice Childlove movement Narcissism Adult attention-deficit disorder Shaggy dog story Buttocks Plame affair Kimberly-Clark Corporation Social rule Neuro-linguistic programming Taxi Driver Kender Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Charles Manson Love The Emancipation of Mimi Lucas Cranach the Elder Lewis Carroll Asperger syndrome Black (people) Internet troll Abortion debate Histrionic personality disorder Human sexual behavior Infantilism Percy Bysshe Shelley LiveJournal Alexander Technique Surveillance Theory of conduct Fahrenheit 9/11 The Adventures of Pete & Pete Richard Feynman Carmen MySpace Milton H.

adding your own song to myspace this is probably a dumb question how do you upload your own song to a profile on myspace not a band i know how to add from another profile you can't upload music to myspace only music profiles can do that you can make a fake music profile to upload your own music just make sure you use a real e mail address to verify that account myspace won't process the music you upload until the account has been verified it's fast and easy to create a new e mail at gmail com to do that after your new e mail is created go to the music section of myspace in the red bar menu at the top you will see a link for new artist signup all the way to the right or just click the link below  Gmail Mind transfer E-mail MySpace Web page EMule Phishing Danger Hiptop Mozilla Firefox BitTorrent Hotmail Facebook (website) Debian CPAN Spam (electronic) Xanga Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Minesweeper (computer game) Webmail Pump It Up IPod Fall Out Boy Opera (web browser) DCPlusPlus Mac OS X v10.4 Internet fraud E-mail spam KMFDM Stopping e-mail abuse Uploading and downloading Jennifer Lopez Warren Ellis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Extraordinary Machine Perl Mouse (computing) Make money fast DeviantART Mozilla Application Suite Social software Blogger The Monkees Sampling (music) Contemporary Christian music Nine Inch Nails United States Postal Service Google RuneScape cheats Death rock March (music) Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System Google Desktop Marching band ITunes Missingno.

i have a myspace question if they are cracking down on deleting profiles does that mean if put up pictures with phrases that joke about stalking and hiding dead bodies will i get deleted they are not actually cracking down on deleting profiles that is just another rumor that keeps circling every once in awhile there are at least million profiles on myspace it is just totally impossible for the people at myspace to actually go through people's profiles or bulletins one by one and actually delete profiles or save them from being deleted as stated in another rumor if you are reported by another myspacer for the pictures phrases because they think they're offensive then maybe they'd take action but it's highly highly unlikely there is no one working for myspace that is actually out looking for people to delete contrary to popular belief they only delete people if they actually violate the terms of service and someone reports them so make sure people know that you're joking or set the album of those pictures so that only your friends can see them or something after you sign in click add edit photos then click friends only next to the album here are all the terms of service tos that apply to what you choose to post on your profile regarding the pictures phrases you're talking about i suggest you read through them real quick and make sure you don't violate any of them content posted myspace com may delete any content that in the sole judgment of myspace com violates this agreement or which may be offensive illegal or violate the rights harm or threaten the safety of any person myspace com assumes no responsibility for monitoring the myspace services for inappropriate content or conduct if at any time myspace com chooses in its sole discretion to monitor the myspace services myspace com nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the content no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate content and no responsibility for the conduct of the user submitting any such content you are solely responsible for the content that you post on or through any of the myspace services and any material or information that you transmit to other members and for your interactions with other users myspace com does not endorse and has no control over the content content is not necessarily reviewed by myspace com prior to posting and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or policies of myspace com myspace com makes no warranties express or implied as to the content or to the accuracy and reliability of the content or any material or information that you transmit to other members content activity prohibited the following is a partial list of the kind of content that is illegal or prohibited to post on or through the myspace services myspace com reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who in myspace com's sole discretion violates this provision including without limitation removing the offending communication from the myspace services and terminating the membership of such violators prohibited content includes but is not limited to content that in the sole discretion of myspace com is patently offensive and promotes racism bigotry hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual contains nudity violence or offensive subject matter or contains a link to an adult website includes a photograph of another person that you have posted without that person's consent myspace tos http www myspace com index cfm fuseaction misc terms mytoken ad b c bdf d c a a ae  Independent Media Center LiveJournal Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Motion picture rating system Treaty Abortion debate Freedom of speech Spyware Plame affair Article One of the United States Constitution Pornography Hate speech Separation of church and state Supreme Court of the United States Public domain Appeal Copyright Stopping e-mail abuse Constitution of Ireland First Amendment to the United States Constitution Consensual crime MySpace Internet troll Censorship in Australia Classified information Child pornography Democracy Children of God Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Wikipedia Drug abuse OpenDocument Australian constitutional law Contract SCO v.

myspace pics i noticed on a few peoples myspace pages where their interests are sometimes they have pictures up like for example for their favorite movies they have a picture of a movie like just say it was the matrix a picture of the matrix how do you put pitcures in your interests i want to do that my friend all you need to do is go to www photobucket com and look up what you want to put on your page this site has thousands of images you can use once you choose what pictures you want to use left click the html tab this will copy the code for that specific image now go back to edit profile and you should see several boxes interests books movies etc right click the box you want the image to appear in and choose paste don't forget to click on the save changes or all your work will be for nothing the box about me is for your layout only don't put anything else in there because it will make it harder for you to change it when you want to a helpful hint when you paste an image in the boxes follow the code with three dots this makes it so much easier to figure out where one image ends and another starts  MySpace Opera (web browser) Macromedia Flash Cascading Style Sheets Mouse (computing) Patricia Ford JPEG HTML Digital photography Screenshot PostScript Prank flash Web traffic Opportunity rover HTTP cookie Hello world program Yearbook International Phonetic Alphabet ASCII art Photography GameFAQs Facebook (website) Editor HTML element Paul W.

is this the reason why you can't change your birthdate let me see if i got this right i'm but in my native country i'd be considered one year older months in the womb is counted so on myspace i put down my age as i would like to change it back to the real date since the country i'm in now i would be but myspace doesn't let me change the date anymore my friend says he is able to and he is so i am thinking that this reason is because if you are younger than minor then your birthdate is locked in so you can t change it for safety so does this mean when i turn on myspace anyway that i will be able to change it my birthdate to my age that i want thank you perhaps it is a glitch with myspace i just went to my page was able to change my birth date several times with no problems  Birthday MySpace Nine Inch Nails Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Gia Carangi Missingno.

why do people hack into myspace accounts mine was and ok mine was hacked into i got on my home page and it said this thing from tom said someone had phished into my account so i had to make a new password what should i do now anything do you think it is better to create another myspace instead of just another password or do you think that will be just as good and ppl wont be able to post any wierd bullitens or anything thanks well a hacker is also a person some can be good other's bad check everything on your myspace is it normal or someone has messing up with anything because a bad hacker will really destroy you the first chance they got or just silently use your account without you even knowing ask your friend if they receive any strange mail from you etc if not changing a password will be okay from what i could gather it seem you open your myspace using public computer eg school computer and forgot to log out or accidentaly save your password on the computer and somebody retrieve it both can be done very easily so be careful with what you do from now on back to topic as i said before there's good and bad and in this case it is either good hacker because telling you to change password or stupid hacker want you to be frightened but i think it is the first case so change your password should be sufficient edit i forgot to mention that if you use same username and password on more than one account you need to change them all the basic mindset if you have someone user pass is trying on the other site to see if it's working so change it all  Password Hacker RuneScape cheats Gmail Phishing Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Password cracking Internet fraud E-mail spam GameFAQs Neopets MySpace Internet forum Hacker (computer security) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Rootkit E-mail Uniform Resource Locator Timeline of hacker history Password (game) Cheating in Counter-Strike Windows XP Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Social rule Stopping e-mail abuse GunZ The Duel Dictionary attack Surveillance Oracle database Malware Backdoor Password (video games) Kerberos (protocol) Buffer overflow Perfect Dark Computer insecurity Danger Hiptop Phreaking Online banking .hack Xanga Slashdot Undergrads Leet ROM hacking Passphrase Linux kernel Cypherpunk Web traffic System/34 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Neuromancer Spam (electronic) Forum moderator The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Theory of conduct Something Awful Forums Computer forensics RuneScape slang and terminology H2G2 Evil Colossal Cave Adventure MindVox Dystopia (computer game) Social software AOL Instant Messenger Database Gaia Online AOHell MMORPG Richard Stallman Authentication Emacs Ebook Cryptography Hacker ethic Chrono Trigger Pitaten Secure Shell Slashdot subculture Link (Legend of Zelda) LiveJournal Opera (web browser) Computer security Bad Wolf Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Long Game Mark Abene British national identity card Warren Ellis Ecco the Dolphin Witches (Discworld) Hackers (short stories) MSN Messenger Hack (technology slang) Shen Gong Wu

i'm thinking of doing a myspace want a public profile except from just one person i don't mind a public profile b c i think it would be cool to get in touch w old school friends who only know me by my maiden name i had a stalker several years ago he has a myspace account he's the only one i don't want searching finding me is there a way to do this i'm not grasping or is it all or nothing i tried hyphenating my name putting both last names together no matter what i can be found by just searching my maiden name even w the married on there too make sense drew r it's not a case of blocking him it's a case of i don't want him to know anything about me or that i even exist anymore since the stalking i'm in a new place new life etc sounds like you don't want him to see any of your info so blocking might only stop him messaging you and not viewing your info obviously you don't want to use a fake name otherwise people wont know it's you so the only things i can suggest is not getting one or having the police involved when if it gets out of hand if this isn't the best answer you get i really do hope you get one as myspace is a great place for friends and fun it's just a shame some peoples idea f fun is most peoples idea of idiocy peace out  Theory of conduct Social rule MySpace Milton H.

what would be a reason you could think of to take someone off your friendslist give me at least reasons as to why you'd delete a friend on myspace i want a list of real friends and not a bunch of strangers some people try to collect a mob of strangers to look popular but i want friends who really interact with me if months go by without a word i tend to delete them they are starting drama on other people's pages and their page is full of people's retaliation comments to their insults and i don't want any part of it i just like to keep my list small i actually visit everybody's pages and blogs and read them and i only have so much time in a day a smaller list means i actually can interact with my friends again because i don't like to collect strangers i want to interact with the people on my list would be impossible to interact with on a meaningful level i thought he wanted to be friends but he is just chasing booty if i say i'm not looking then i'm not one guy i deleted because he kept leaving crude comment graphics with naked women in them on my page i didn't like that all over my page the announcement a day spammers have to go the pass then on to friends and if you get it back you are loved e mail spammer has to go too spam only tastes good with eggs their page is suddenly set up to appear like an advertisement i've made tons of money sealing envelopes at home are you interested in a business opportunity blah they have really really creepy friends that start visiting my page and leaving weird comments and i just don't like their crowd and i don't know them that well anyway a blog entry put me off like a racist rant or something politically charged that tainted my feelings toward them enough  E-mail spam Gmail Blog Stopping e-mail abuse Little Britain Theory of conduct EastEnders Andrew Sullivan Neopets Internet phenomenon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Shaggy dog story Make money fast Link spam One Tree Hill (TV series) Social software E-mail Friends Kodocha Search engine optimization Ocean's Twelve Cindy Sheehan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Privacy Knots Landing Goatse.cx Internet troll Ludwig Wittgenstein H2G2 Philosophy of language Kender The Best Page in the Universe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Trusted computing Daredevil Surveillance Electrophysiology Prank flash Fahrenheit 9/11 Extreme Championship Wrestling Internet fraud FidoNet Undergrads Spam Prevention Early Warning System Kill Bill Homestar Runner Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 Samurai Deeper Kyo Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Frank Sinatra The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Paul Is Dead Prisoner's dilemma Oasis (band) Time Out of Mind Internet forum Ren and Stimpy Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Major League Baseball television contracts Whois MAME Independent Media Center Spidey Super Stories Religious Society of Friends South Park Objectivist philosophy Plame affair Jacob Pavlovitch Adler Meta-reference America Online Megan Griffin Email authentication James T.

myspace messaging question i sent a message to a friend a few days ago and never received an answer i have to admit that i was a bit nervous to sent it because it was about asking someone to hang out someone i don't spend much time with i look in my sent box and it's not there i was told to send it again because it could be a glitch should i send it again even though this person could've just ignored it completely if it doesn't show up in the sent box does that mean they never received it okay you need to remember what happened when you sent it did it take a long time to say send did you have to refresh the page if so it probably was never sent most likely if it wasn't in your sent box then no it wasn't sent but lets say you did send it the worse thing that can happen is it doesn't get responded too just simply type at the beginning of the letter hey i wasn't quite sure if i had sent this already because i was having computer problems but do you wanna hang out then immediately check your sent box  Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Jumpstart 3rd Grade StarCraft: Uprising E-mail Anonymous remailer Social rule Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hey Jude Little Britain Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Objective-C Kurt Cobain Time Out of Mind The Star Wars Holiday Special She Loves You Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Emperor of Dune Dog training 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Domain Name System IP (complexity) Cliff Richard MySpace Halting problem Plame affair Unified Modeling Language Datalore (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Kasparov versus The World Internet Group Management Protocol Avenue Q I Want to Hold Your Hand Object-oriented programming Make money fast Symbiosis (TNG episode) Morse Code Past teachings of Prem Rawat You Don't Know Jack Shadow the Hedgehog Wonderland (McFly album) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Friends Hamming code Error correction and detection Intelligent design Milton H.
