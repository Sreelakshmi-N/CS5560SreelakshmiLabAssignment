help how do i remove red candle wax from linoleum uh oh that's not good i'm thinking you've probably already tried the obvious scraping and melting techniques if you have a real deep stain and you're desperate to get it removed and out of sight maybe you could try a steel wool pad or brillo because if you've already removed the surface wax and you can still see the red you might have to scrape away at the actual linoleum to make it go away all this depends on how big the stain and where it is located middle of floor edge of room corner etc and whether this floor is attached to a place you own or rent for instance if you are owner wal mart has some really cute rugs good luck  Casting Mattress Carpet Knife Seismic retrofit Glass Drill bit Brillo Pad Wok Top-bar hive Weaving Surrealist techniques Wax Printed circuit board Tire Cross-country skiing Christmas tree Upholstery Shroud of Turin Soldering Dice Wallpaper group Valles Marineris Funeral of Pope John Paul II Textile manufacturing terminology Wood finishing Ski Plastic Paint Oceanic trench Textile manufacturing Wax play Pysanka Staines Woodworking Dundas Square Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling match types Iron Linoleum Dye Gilding Histology Katana Mnemonic Steel Disc brake Palace of Westminster Staining (biology) Clarinet Welding Lighting Beeswax Alkane Stainless steel Livestock Oil platform Seal (device) Care Bears The Adventures of Pete & Pete Candle Fast bowling Out of Gas Gramophone record Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Japanese tea ceremony Western concert flute Cultural Revolution Maxilla Diamond enhancement Sword making Prostitution in Germany Motor oil Pittsburgh Steelers Trademark Charles Goodyear Ski wax Tuberculosis Sand casting John Hancock Tower Leather Property (ownership right) Wood carving Rent (musical) Linen Chatsworth House Law of value Dance Dance Revolution Bloodstain pattern analysis Repouss__ and chasing Tattoo Abstraction Brazing Magical objects in Harry Potter Property tax Ultraviolet Out-of-body experience Naval mine Shaggy dog story Petroleum

how do you make your own windex i've googled a couple of recipes for windex glass cleaner i don't want anything that smells too vinegary i know there are packets you can buy that you just add water to but i want something that is more natural since i have a newborn i mix vinegar and water then add a tiny bit of liquid dish soap i mean tiny just a drop or two in a bottle that little bit of soap really helps cut grime especially in the kitchen where cooking grease is everywhere and the film on windows left over from commercial cleaners using only a little works and doesn't foam up i have also seen recipes that also use some rubbing alcohol to help evaporate the mixture faster that might help with the smell what's wrong with vinegar cleaning the smell is gone very quickly don't use bleach as another answerer suggested spraying it in the house is not only unhealthy but it could bleach your stuff  Vinegar Soap Rum Ketchup Brewery Hydrogen peroxide Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Dishwashing Laundry detergent Sodium hypochlorite Mayonnaise Barbecue Dry cleaning Sushi Plastic Japanese cuisine Drill bit Ammonia Ham Cheese Fire extinguisher Hamster Jam (TV series) Bong Idli Kitchen Carburetor Soap bubble Gilding Paint Ice cream Breastfeeding Otitis externa Wine Haloalkane French fries Sulfuric acid Acetic acid Disinfection Menstrual cup Cuisine of Denmark Mattress Sewage treatment Haggis Ramen Gumbo Beer Bread Stir frying Bacon Genericized trademark Fish and chips Roman eating and drinking Wood pulp Little Britain Food preservation Molotov cocktail Jewish cuisine Kosher foods Homer Simpson Culinary mustard Skunk Wheat beer Drag racing Casting Water Curry Sea-Monkey Cuisine of the Philippines Tattoo Worcestershire sauce Soup The Star Wars Holiday Special Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Fire fighting Glossary of firefighting equipment Food Cookware and bakeware Alcoholic beverage Cat Tea Coffee Honey Sugarcane Champagne (beverage) Social rule Ozone Martini cocktail Peruvian cuisine Water (molecule) Collodion process Pancake Car washing techniques Cajun cuisine Justification (theology) Water purification Glycerin

how do i prevent bleeding on new clothes i plan to wash all of my different colored shirts together eventually i have done this for years and never had a problem but i am going off to college soon and want to be able to wash everything together right away without worrying about bleeding one of my new shirts is red by the way what should i do to prevent bleeding i don't have many of the same color so i can't wash each color individually i was thinking about washing the new shirts in the sink first individually i heard of a trick about using vinegar salt or something to set the color but if i put one shirt in each sink how much vinegar and salt should i use how long should i let the shirt soak should i use cold or hot water do i need to put detergent in if so how much how many times should i do this before i can be confident that the color wont run is there anything else i can do instead thanks a bunch i will choose best answer you can set the dye simply by adding a cup of vinegar or salt to the rinse water the first time you launder them by soaking them you will cause the dyes to bleed out thus diluting their color i also usually use a shout color catcher in the washer to catch any dye bleeding out while it is washing so fill the washer with cold water add your detergent and the color catcher then add the vinegar to the rinse dispenser and add the clothing if you use salt you have to stop the machine after it has washed and filled with the rinse water put the machine on the shortest wash cycle for the fiber content of the garments you have in the load i usually throw vinegar in the rinse water with dark colored clothing every other time i launder them to keep my dark colors from fading it also acts as a fabric softener and the smell dissapates in the dryer  Vinegar Upholstery Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Dry cleaning Washing machine Menstrual cup Laundry detergent Tofu Soap Detergent Clothing Laundry Sento Tattoo Haggis Dishwashing Leather Cruising (maritime) Starch Car washing techniques Staining (biology) Sulfuric acid Tag Sushi Hard water Jute Textile manufacturing terminology Electrophysiology Undergarment Tallit Edible salt Coffee Tanning Acetic acid Sodium hypochlorite Wok Mattress Manicure Yarrow Technicolor Cochineal Diaper Gram staining Bleeding Salt Plumbing fixture Smelt Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sewage treatment Denim Rebreather Carburetor Shaving Phosphorus Ammonia Water Psoriasis CPU cache Cheese Sulfur Food preservation Ironing Soy milk Cuisine of the Philippines Soap bubble Alum Plastic Rice Kilt Water (molecule) Peanut Indigo dye Kimono Sodium chloride E-6 process Jewish cuisine Sodium hydroxide Gilding Weaving Academic dress Wound Shaggy dog story Otitis externa Chowder Menstrual cycle Fencing 2005 World Series Japanese tea ceremony Bong Beachwear Piccolo Junior Saga Characters of Naruto

does smoking in the shower absorb the smell no i am sorry to say but this does not have this affect on cigarette smoke and for this problem i recommend this get rid of smoke odor if you've recently burned a steak or if your chain smoking aunt recently paid you a surprise visit remove the lingering smoky odor by placing a shallow bowl about three quarters full of white or cider vinegar in the room where the scent is strongest use several bowls if the smell permeates your entire home the odor should be gone in less than a day you can also quickly dispense of the smell of fresh cigarette smoke inside a room by moistening a cloth with vinegar and waving it around a bit good luck  Bong Fish and chips Vinegar Skunk Tobacco Odor Sauna Sulfur Tobacco smoking Smoking pipe Cigar Tofu Cuisine of the Philippines Barbecue V.F.D.

will washing a cat's food dish in the dishwasher spread germs to the other dishes in the dishwasher my roommate won't allow me to wash the cat's dishes in the dishwasher because she thinks the cat's germs could get spread to our dishes and then to us i argued that the hot water combined with soap should kill germs on plastic and ceramic dishes although maybe not on kitchen sponges no the water in a dishwasher gets hot enough to sterilize the contents not to mention the detergent that cleans the dishes do not wash the cat's dishes by hand as that will spread germs from the sponge to any other dish it is washed with now if you want to throw the sponge away after it is used on the cat's stuff which gets kinda expensive that will keep the germs from spreading  Dishwashing Dishwasher Agar plate Car washing techniques Detergent Soap Hamster Textile manufacturing Kitchen Soap bubble Menstrual cup Sponge Hand washing Washing machine Cookware and bakeware Japanese tea ceremony Procter & Gamble Hard water Cuisine of the Philippines Morphology (linguistics) Cruising (maritime) Dry cleaning Disinfection Japanese cuisine Foodborne illness Bread Guns, Germs, and Steel Fuzzy logic Chinese cuisine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tattoo Breakfast Plastic Sewage treatment Tofu Laundry detergent French fries Laundry Cantonese cuisine Pizza Hell's Kitchen (television) Sauerkraut Care Bears Kosher foods Iron Chef Cleanliness Cuisine of Thailand Domestic water system Jewish cuisine Bong Central heating Dollar store Glycerin Korean cuisine Animal Customs and etiquette of Japan Sterilization (microbiology) Egg (food) Sterling silver Swedish Chef Garfield Swimming pool Teapot Menstrual cycle Milk Stir frying Weebl and Bob Ice cream Asepsis Minestrone Lutefisk Birth control Ramen Feet washing SpongeBob SquarePants Cha chaan teng Ovarian cancer Urticaria Rice Hydrotherapy Chopsticks Oregano Brillo Pad Pepper spray Sento Wound Sulfuric acid Potato Ripped Pants Solar power Roman eating and drinking Slow cooker Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cajun cuisine Nuclear fallout Collodion process Cat Cuisine of Laos

can i mix in baking soda when i'm doing my laundry if so how much do i add yes you can i'd say cup of baking soda because it makes the clothes smell better it neutralizes the acids and softens the clothes it's also been known to give you whiter whites brighter brights and odor free clothing baking soda can be very effective at removing stains formed by age because it is a natural cleaner your older linens can be trusted to be whitened and brightened by its effects it acts as a natural softener and is gentler for those with sensitivities to chemicals in their laundry i would highly recommend adding baking soda i use it every time i have to do laundry in my house and so does everyone in my family it's easier to use makes the clothes fresh and i personally think baking soda gets rid of stains better than bleach would  Laundry detergent Hydrogen peroxide Vinegar Sodium hypochlorite Bread Sodium hydroxide Water purification Laundry Ammonia Skunk Chocolate Hydrochloric acid Urticaria Baking powder Bleach Sodium percarbonate Washing machine Sulfuric acid Ultramarine Bong Sodium Carbon dioxide Flour Sodium carbonate Menstrual cup Ozone Citric acid Paint Hydrogen chloride Tooth bleaching Sulfur Illegal drug trade Mouth ulcer Tooth enamel Sugar substitute Natural gas Glass Toothpaste Tooth Cocaine Soap Textile manufacturing Staining (biology) Alum Urine Camouflage Acetone peroxide Acetic acid Base (chemistry) XML Linen Mattress Casting Hard water Pancake Wood pulp Organic food Hebburn Phosphorus Tofu Leblanc process Psoriasis Spotted Skunk Hair coloring Brewery Cat Shampoo Cheese Disinfection Nitroglycerin Carbonated water Tea Nutrition Coca Perfume Odor Sterilization (microbiology) Honey Henkel Water (molecule) Egg (food) Shoe polish Soda lime Food coloring Milk Mountain Dew Polyethylene terephthalate Trans fat Organic peroxide Alkali Cyanide Tuberculosis Cocoa Diamond enhancement Photographic developer Shroud of Turin Rebreather Fire fighting

what can i do to remove a ink stain on my leather sofa its not that old this really depends on what type of leather it is if it is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an ink stick the fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it it is a good idea to have one in your house if you have a pale leather and children you should also be using a good quality leather protector on your suite this will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off if an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts using hairspray is very risky ait but can make the matter far worse as it can spread the ink over a bigger area especially on an aniline style leather and can sometimes then be impossible to fix nail varnish remover or any other solvents will remove the finish and pigment which will need replacing do not use baby wipes as they are about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it please do not try milk it is a silly idea that this will work and will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish if the ink is on an aniline style there is nothing that will remove it because the ink will have re dyed the leather it may dissipate over time with cleaning and protecting old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish this is probably best left to the experts silicones furniture polish are the worst thing to use on leather as they will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather and will eventually break all the finish down and make it crack leather needs water and should not be protected against it leather does not need conditioning it needs cleaning and protecting on a regular basis with water based products this will keep it rehydrated and supple oils will make things much worse leather should be cleaned gently not scrubbed so 'elbow grease' will only do damage to the finish nail varnish remover solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather source s www lttsolutions net leather care consultnts to the furniture and cleaning industries  Paint Upholstery Leather Dry cleaning Knife Manicure Varnish Printed circuit board Drawing Inkjet printer Pottery Violin Tattoo Woodworking Brush Tooth Soap Vulcanization Welding Biodiesel Cross-country skiing Strap-on dildo Dairy Textile manufacturing Corrosion Drill bit Water (molecule) Shoe polish Soy protein Brewery Perfume Hemp Soldering Wood Lacquer Aniline Dye Solvent Water Fecal incontinence Sewage treatment Hydrogen peroxide Tofu Diving suit Casting Benzene Turquoise Explosive material Chair Shampoo Coffee Bong Aluminium Chromium Haloalkane BASF Sulfuric acid Wood carving Extreme Programming Inflation Skin Poker jargon Diamond Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tanning Clinker (boat building) Shoe Seismic retrofit Petroleum Home repair Motor oil Concentration Nine Inch Nails Industrial wastewater treatment Computer virus Pastel Brazing Fire extinguisher Gilding Textile manufacturing terminology Painter and decorator Silly Putty Cast iron Comanche Diving Organic food Clothing Second Battle of the Atlantic

how do you remove cigarette odour from a house i recently moved into a rental apartment and the last tennants smoked like a chimney inside it really really smells as a result i've tried airing it out and used air freshener but it doesn't help at all does anyone know what can be done thanks so much pretty much the best way to remove the odor of tobacco smoke from an area is to deep clean and paint as another respondent mentioned if your apartment complex won't pay for the paint then the best you can do is sprinkle baking soda on the carpets let that absorb for about minutes then vacuum deep cleaning the remainder of the apartment should do the trick and of course febreeze any fabric window coverings  Bong Cigarette Cannabis cultivation Air pollution Carpet Carbon dioxide Skunk Illegal drug trade Bread Smoking ban Tobacco Vacuum Tobacco smoking Kitchen Smoking pipe Cocaine Halitosis Solar power Toilet humour Sauna Lung cancer Apartment building Odor Sin City Fire fighting Vacuum cleaner Airbag Apartment Perfume Property tax Home repair Vinegar Blood Simple Billboard (advertising) Sento Kakapo Remediation Japanese toilet Tofu Tobacco advertising Ammonia Glossary of firefighting terms Autonomous building Mattress Buckingham Palace Glass Seismic retrofit Firefighter Rebreather Magical objects in Harry Potter Wok Cyanide Nuclear explosion Deep Throat (Watergate) Acetic acid Fossil fuel power plant Casting Water purification Grand Central Terminal Upholstery Fan (implement) Cannabis (drug) Cleanliness Durian Cuisine of Denmark Economy of the United States Hard disk Faster-than-light Newtown, New South Wales Chatham Square Natural gas Jersey City, New Jersey Hydrogen cyanide Ultraviolet Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks W.

what is best to clean my venetian blinds with i want to clean them but i don't want to ruin them what cleaning products should i use on them my favorite way works on vinyl or metal mini blinds is to take them down from the window put them in the bath tub heat up a gallon of white vinegar not boiling but hot like a cup of coffee or it'll melt and warp vinyl blinds and pour on them it'll cut any greasy residue from the air like cooking and smoking fill the tub with just enough hot water to cover them and swish the water around a bit let soak about minutes then rinse with warm water using vinegar will also give them an air freshening quality too believe it or not once the vinegar odor evaporates do not use harsh chemicals and stiff brushes because the strings will become fragile and break if they do need wiping use soft rags  Vinegar Casting Textile manufacturing Bong Acetic acid Dishwashing Coffee Cheese Swimming pool Manicure Dishwasher Mattress Brewery Sulfuric acid Dry cleaning Solar power Menstrual cup Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Barbecue Hard water Tea Internal ballistics Rice Fossil fuel power plant Water (molecule) Incandescent light bulb Soldering Water Welding Comanche Wok Fire extinguisher Decaffeination Haggis Customs and etiquette of Japan Instant coffee Glossary of firefighting terms Sento Cuisine of the Philippines Dairy Hot tub Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Haloalkane First aid Cannabis cultivation Bacon Soap Japanese cuisine Ice cream Hand grenade Car washing techniques Pottery Solvent Sulfur Methamphetamine Fujian tea ceremony Onsen Hydrochloric acid Hot spring Violin Glass Air conditioning Smoke-screen Sake Soap bubble Wine Mercury (element) Plastic Steel Idli Agar plate Autoclave Printmaking Food preservation Top-bar hive Brazing Ketchup Soul food Motor oil Mouth ulcer Aluminium Chinese tea culture Air pollution Carbon dioxide Japanese toilet Forge Halva Hydrotherapy Hydrogen Glossary of wildland fire terms Evaporation

i know partially hydrogenated oils are unhealthy what about hydrogenated oils is it the same thing or is this ok to eat fully hydrogenated oils are saturated fats they occur naturally and artificially partially hydrogenated oil is the same idea but it hasn't been fully hydrogenated and there are still one or more double bonds between the carbons in the fatty acid chains when this is done artificially the fatty acid can bend into a trans conformation making a trans fat essentially this means that the sides of the fatty acid chain bend toward each other like where represents the double bond there are some natural unsaturated fats and those have a cis conformation in which the chains bend away from each other these are more easily broken down by the enzymes our bodies make  Trans fat Hydrogenation Saturated fat Omega-3 fatty acid Alkane Fatty acid metabolism Nutrition Margarine Fat Lipid Biochemistry Enzyme Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency Carboxylic acid Amino acid Alkene Biomolecule IUPAC nomenclature Triglyceride Hair conditioner Hydrogen Protein Nutrient Protein structure Hydrocarbon Chemical formula Atkins Nutritional Approach Water (molecule) Serine protease Ethylene Hydrogen sulfide Cracking (chemistry) Acid Peanut butter Insulin Benzene Vitamin Polymerase chain reaction Propionic acid Covalent bond Ketone E number Biodiesel Cannabinoids Olive oil Polymerization Cooking oil Alcohol Veganism Biotin Haloalkane Polymer Organic chemistry Nucleic acid Cheese Acetic acid South Beach diet Sulfur Carbon dioxide Abiogenic petroleum origin Coenzyme A Milk Hydrogen bond Cellular respiration Cell (biology) Wax Hypercholesterolemia Linus Pauling Photosynthesis Energy development Alkyl Tocotrienol Tocopherol Hemoglobin Ascorbic acid Cyanide Citric acid cycle Biological membrane French fries Formic acid Peptide Gastric acid Protein-energy malnutrition Isomer Oily fish Soap Sulfuric acid Francis Crick Hypoglycemia Hydrogen chloride Soil Adrenoleukodystrophy DNA Plastic Coronary heart disease Mustard oil Petroleum Hydrogen peroxide

my shirts keep turning orange here's my problem for some reason all of my shirts are turning orange in the washing machine my mom does the laundry yet she can't explain why it happens i do not own a single orange shirt nor does anyone else in the house yet my shirts continually come out with orange patches around the collar nobody else's shirts just mine this has been an on going problem for the past or years one shirt after another falls victim to the orange patch at first we thought it was just clothes from old navy even some of my pants from there grey ones began to show orange spots now we have found that it happens to any and all of my clothes what could be the problem does anyone know why this affects only my clothes and no others in the wash since it is happening only to your clothes and not everyone else's in the house then i would hazard a guess that it is something you are coming in contact with find whatever it is that you are using or coming in contact with that no one else in the house uses and you'll probably have your culprit some of these items could be acne medicine tanning lotion sunblock or a chemical you may be exposed to outside of the home oil etc you'd be surprised at how much of an item can transfer from you to your clothing or how little of it can be a problem hehehe i know of a story of one car manufacturer they had a big problem with paint peeling on their cars when they finally chased the problem down it was the antipersperant some of their paint employees were wearing and they were fully suited in protective clothing but enough was transferred through their sweat to their hands and then to the car surface that it caused the paint to peel heheheh one other source to consider prescription medicine some medicines have some strange side effects for example if you use certain antibiotics you need to stay out of direct sunlight because you will burn easier some meds cause you to create more 'oil' on your skin etc again find whatever it is that you are using or coming in contact with that no one else in the house is and you will most likely have your source have fun  Psoriasis Acne Eczema Sunscreen Sunburn Skin Plastic Leather Canadian Armed Forces Common cold Social aspects of clothing Urticaria Undergarment Shirt Car handling Characters in the Smurfs Fire fighting Electrophysiology Hydrogen peroxide Casting Spidey Super Stories Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Magical thinking Cowboy Essential oil Renewable energy Ultraviolet Textile manufacturing Comanche Manual transmission Tattoo Procter & Gamble Soap Jute Scar Mesothelioma Chemise Dioxin The Family from One End Street Doctor (Doctor Who) Energy development Gaia Online Sento Protective clothing The Amazing Race Methamphetamine Spontaneous human combustion Hay fever Manicure Upholstery Patent medicine Dairy Pneumonia Scabies Tag The Inside Pottery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chaos Emerald Rosacea Tire Hiking Sun The Warriors Puberty Motor oil Solar power Doraemon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Items in the Metroid series Laundry Single bullet theory Jesuit College Preparatory School Suit (clothes) GunBound The Dalek Invasion of Earth Mercury (element) Operation Petticoat Androgen insensitivity syndrome Quake III Arena Softball Carbon dioxide Scenes from a Memory Ozone depletion Medicine Hazing The Invisibles Hemp Fast bowling The Caves of Androzani Fecal incontinence White-collar worker War of the Worlds (2005 film) Animal Crossing Waste management

the air condition system in my house is getting mildew in the filter area and also the structure is sweating also is leaking a little bit any clue you need to go ahead and turn the unit off and open the door so it can dry out spray the areas with mold with a solutionof tsp tea tree oil wal mart pharmacy in oz water then wipe it up don't rinse the sweat could be caused by the drain pipe being clogged that's what happened to me one time had to borrow my neighbors the plumber air compressor to blow it out you will need someone to stand outside where the drain pipe drains and tell you when nothing more comes out of the pipe to avoid that problem you pour cup straight bleach into the pipe and it will clean the pipe all the way to the outside it is especially likely if you have pets in the house another problem could be corrosion of the line that holds the refrigerant if that's the case you can only have it fixed by a professional tip the can refill the refrigerant but you need to start saving for the new unit as it is only a quick and unefficient fix your unit has to work harder which will continue to increase your bills i broke down and replaced mine last summer after i got a electric bill and i had been without my a c for two weeks i haven't had a bill over since  Air conditioning Thermal power station Dairy Home repair Bong Air pollution Domestic water system Motor oil Refrigerator Menstrual cup Seismic retrofit Autonomous building Brewery Kitchen Haloalkane E85 Cheese Gas compressor Furnace Basement Ammonia Dishwasher Glossary of firefighting equipment Dry cleaning Hard water Tea Soy protein Plastic Sento Refrigerant Erie Canal Cray-1 Soldering Siphon Casting Water purification Urinary incontinence Turbocharger Irrigation Apollo 13 Baby bottle Two-stroke cycle Mosquito Heinkel He 100 Thermostat Second Battle of the Atlantic Phase change heat pump Geodesic dome Carbon dioxide Drill bit Swamp cooler HVAC Dishwashing Solar power Economy of Russia Drainage Dialysis Coffee Toilet paper Cruising (maritime) Tire Diamond Sewage treatment Rebreather Knife Fire fighting Hoover Dam Fossil fuel power plant Motorcycle Volleyball Asbestos Water supply Inkjet printer Hydrogen peroxide I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Soap bubble Wind power Vinegar Welding Toyota Prius Energy development Fluid pressure Hamster Corrosion Diving The Amazing Race Wood Ozone Car washing techniques RuneScape quests Gold standard Hebburn Textile manufacturing Town gas Glossary of firefighting terms Zuiderzee Works

how to make a basement apt look more nice no matter how much i clean it it looks like a mess when i got divorced i had to move back to my parents house with my mo old the only available space for me was the basement i was determined to make what was just an unfinished area look like home i actually had no walls save for the outside walls and bought the large tan bamboo roll down blinds the sell at home depot to make them they come in a cheaper plastic version which is what i used tan and come as long as or foot so i hung them next to one another from the ceiling beams to form walls i even hung pictures from wire attached to the ceiling beams right in front of the blinds it gave the illusion of pictures on the walls since i am assuming you already have walls here are some other tricks windows are a big part of making the basement look like a basement here's a deception hang a curtain rod just at the bottom of the window and put a pair of cafe curtains on it now hang a matching pair of swag style curtains with tie backs on the rod above the window making sure they are long enough to come down over the cafe curtains you now have the illusion of a regular window this does volumes for making it look less like a basement in a living room area you can use long drapes over miniblinds and do the same thing just let the blinds go down to where a regular window would end and then use regular length drapes my walls were cinderblock but i painted them i bought gallons of floor paint made for garage basemnet floors in a pretty sand color and painted away it looked great i also got a berber carpet remnant at home depot and put that down finally you can hang pictures you do need a cordless drill and a masonry bit but it is possible for lighter stuff i actually utilized holes that were in the cinderblocks to keep it organized i agree with everyone above you have to realize that in a small space you need less stuff being that i had a baby i had alot of stuff i had to keep i invested in tan plastic tubs so they would blend in with the walls i picked one corner and stacked them high side by side then i got a pretty fabric shower curtain in a neutral beige bought a cheap shower curtain rod and hung this in front of the tubs from hooks in the ceiling beams instant closet another shower curtain rod hung behind the curtain provided somewhere to hang coats dresses etc i had wicker baskets with my son's toys that sat on the tubs and another that held my bed linens i shopped at dollar stores thrift shops and big lots and did all of this for very little be creative and good luck  Textile manufacturing Seismic retrofit Basement Drill bit Chair Chatsworth House Carpet Passenger car Volleyball Plastic Hamster Mattress Jackass: The Movie Wilton House Casting Upholstery Solar cell Wood carving Skateboarding trick Irish Houses of Parliament Textile manufacturing terminology Bungalow McMansion The Brady Bunch Aerial (dance move) Bus models used in New York City Transit Christmas tree Bong Combine (Half-Life 2) Glossary of climbing terms Masonry Antenna (radio) Solar power StarCraft: Uprising Straw-bale construction Stairway The Time Machine Animal Crossing Bristol Grammar School Cruising (maritime) Sundial Characters in the Smurfs Apt Pupil Professional wrestling throws Customs and etiquette of Japan Door Great Teacher Onizuka Top-bar hive Professional wrestling holds Xanadu House Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Magic (illusion) Professional wrestling slang The Inside Printed circuit board Lighting Glossary of nautical terms Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shoe Dial M for Murder Glossary of firefighting equipment Paintball 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gay bathhouse Unreal Doom engine Comanche Surveillance Shaggy dog story Anchor Holkham Hall Disneyland Brewery Floppy disk John Cage Undergarment Knife Bathroom Wheel of Fortune Cannabis cultivation Pittsburgh Steelers Die (manufacturing) EastEnders Suplex Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Puppet Columbine High School massacre Avenue Q Ron and Fez Microeconomics Francis Bacon (painter) Piccolo Junior Saga

my micro fiber couches are looking terrible how do i clean them there are a few places one my couches where my one year old daughter has rubbed her cookies and then places where she will put her mouth and it leaves a ring on them i have tried to use the resolve cleaner and i think it made it worst i have tried to rub it out with water and it will take the cookie or what not away but it leaves like a water mark ring it is driving me crazy to look at them so any advise would be so great thanks any and every website that offers info on cleaning microfiber says the same thing use a clean white towel and water they also frequently mention using denatured alcohol mixed with water especially for ink coffee etc in my experience cleaning houses the trick is to get a fairly stiff scrub brush after the water used to clean is dry use the scrub brush in circles on the area it usually removes the remaining water marks as for the cookie stains i would make a dilute mix of mild dishsoap and water and go at the stains with that scrub brush then dab at it with the towel and plain water and repeat as above take care not to use much soap or it will be hard to get out with a little one if you haven't already i'd look into scotchguarding good luck  Upholstery Manicure Sento Hand washing Customs and etiquette of Japan Bong Gilding Cast iron Tattoo Ethanol Mattress Violin Dishwashing Menstrual cup Dialysis Soap Microfiber Soldering Brewery Vinegar Brush Wood Vacuum cleaner Sauna Towel Washing machine Paint Fecal incontinence Hamster Tooth Hydrogen peroxide Body piercing Glycerin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shoe polish Genericized trademark Dry cleaning Car washing techniques Wound Lionel Corporation Wok Japanese toilet Weaving Hyperthermia Textile manufacturing Halitosis Hashish First aid Chocolate Pottery Flour Staining (biology) Sharon Tate Laundry Hat The Shining (film) Woodworking American and British English differences Cookie Sulfuric acid Oral hygiene Sodium hypochlorite Professional wrestling slang Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tea Laundry detergent Shaggy dog story Scarification Neopets Acne Diving suit Joseph of Arimathea The Legend of Zelda series races Soy protein Inkjet printer Brazing Knife Car wash Gay bathhouse Tooth enamel Paper Strap-on dildo Coffee The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Printmaking Japanese tea ceremony Canary Yarrow Alcoholic beverage Drill bit Drag racing Breastfeeding Justification (theology) Isopropyl alcohol Leaf Plastic Poodle Typewriter American Psycho Common cold

how do i keep flannel from fading i have these really cute p j 's and they're flannel and i don't want them to fade when i wash them so i was wondering if there is a secret to washing them you can set the dye in the fabric by washing them in warm water with a cup of regular salt dissolved in it let them soak for at least a half hour then continue the cycle as normal the thing with flannel and fading is that if the yarns aren't dyed prior to their being woven into fabric they are then surface dyed and because flannel is fuzzy or brushed textured they will inevitably fade no matter what is done you can tell which flannel you have by looking at the inside of the fabric if it is exactly the same as the outside it was dyed prior to being woven and therefore the yarns have been saturated if it is lighter than the outside or if the outside has a printed pattern it is the latter and i'm sorry it will fade at least with the salt soaking it may prolong the fading from happening i hope this helped  Textile manufacturing terminology Weaving Upholstery Knitting Cloth Yarn Leather Ink Ammonia Menstrual cycle Textile Technicolor Jute Dry cleaning Cashmere wool Kimono Tofu Alpaca Casting Dye Indigo dye Clothing World Series Batik Silk Calotype Tire Soap Tattoo Tooth Undergarment Coir Collodion process Bong Laundry detergent Dog Opportunity rover Linen Wallpaper Soil Nuclear fallout Decompression sickness Edible salt Anodising Washing machine Screen-printing Charles Goodyear Acetic acid Dairy Menstrual cup Crochet Laserdisc Idli Towel Korean art Fuzzy logic Pottery Denim Rice Mattress Tie-dye Cheese Felt Mars Exploration Rover Kosher foods Sodium hydroxide Manicure Cochineal Ion exchange resin Solar cell Inkjet printer Water Tanning Water (molecule) Xiaolin Showdown Alum Thermal power station Grunge music Ikat Industrial wastewater treatment Motorcycle Turquoise Water purification Sari Compact disc Domesticated turkey Electrophysiology Carbon dioxide Sodium sulfate Car wash Horse Milton H.

selfcleaning oven vim baking someone at someone else's house stuff spilled over and baked on i didn't realize it was a selfcleaning oven and started to use vim to clean it is this a problem can i not use selfcleaning until i get all the vim off and why not thanks for any help the vim is only on a small spot on the bottom of the oven in the centre it's not touching any components it's also natural i don't believe it has any chemicals that could produce gases under heat but that is what i'm mostly concerned about if i get most of it off the problem is that some will stick with the batter that has burned on will it be ok where is the vim take a look at the oven it should have pyrolitic or catalytic liners since they need to be rplaced from time to time they should be removable get them out and rinse them thoroughly unfortunately if you've scrubbed them or applied vim you may have compromised their function you may have to replace the liners never use bleach or any other chemical substance on the liners you will ruin them completely the manufacturer of the oven should have a help line you can call find the manufacturer on the web get the serial model no for the oven it's usually visible on the frame when the door is open or it may be on the floor of the oven itself self cleaning ovens require intense heat to initiate the self clean process i would not advise doing this until you've removed any residue nb all racks including the side supports need to be removed before initiating a self clean if the vim is only on the floor of the oven and there doesn't seem to be a removable liner there then clean what you can wipe off the vim take the racks out you're good to go natural doesn't necessarily mean it won't have achemical reaction but as long as the vim is not on a catalytic or pyrolitic surface just wiping most of the residue off will be fine anything remaining will basically turn to dust  Wok Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Upholstery Carburetor Dishwasher Bread Town gas Stove Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Catalytic converter Alcohol fuel Brewery Cremation Coal Drill bit Welding Hydrochloric acid Printed circuit board XML Hydrogen peroxide Microwave oven Fuel injection Explosive material Motor oil Internal ballistics Biodiesel Unicode Water (molecule) Knife Lighting Bong Hydrogen economy Enceladus (moon) Sulfuric acid Haloalkane Asbestos Energy development Renewable energy Diseases of the honeybee Solar power Hard disk Sterilization (microbiology) Sewage treatment Coffee Origin of life Dry cleaning De Lorean DMC-12 Chocolate Nuclear weapon design E85 Casting Textile manufacturing Gas metal arc welding Incandescent light bulb Hebburn Vacuum tube Olduwan Soldering Magnesium Toyota Prius Cassini-Huygens Baking Plastic Francis Crick Nuclear explosion Glass Enzyme Fusion power Sun Manicure Sento Fire extinguisher Ozone depletion Refrigerator Spacecraft propulsion Industrial engineering Biochemistry Aluminium Barbecue Sodium hypochlorite Heinkel He 112 Eight ball Oscilloscope Air pollution Soap Dialysis Windows XP Glossary of firefighting terms Gasoline

why does my room stink i just cleaned my fucking room with the rug doctor alright now after i fucking smells like ass like someone or a rhino shited in my room why the fuck does it smell like that and what the fuck can i do to get rid of that reeking smell sorry for the bad language but it just fucking makes me mad and frustrates me entirely when you use a rug cleaner a lot of water gets into the rug and if it has a foam underlay to pad it there will be a lot of moisture trapped it will take a long time to evaporate but you can help matters if you air the room as much as possible with fans and open windows don't put any furniture on the rug for days because all this moisture has to evaporate or you will have mildew and mold in the rug from the bacteria that will be growing in it try a few drops of nilodor in a cup set it inside the room also febreze is helpful and has a nice scent you have to be patient till things get back to normal if worse comes to worst you may have to repeat the cleaning process and this time suck all the water out of the rug i hope you don't have to lift the rug and remove the underpad hang in there a lot of us know exactly what you're going through it will get better sooner or later  Upholstery The Shining (film) Vacuum cleaner Bong Andrew Dice Clay Sulfur Casting Social rule Shit Menstrual cycle Jackass: The Movie Air conditioning Sugar beet Water Fecal incontinence The Young Ones (TV series) Brewery The Marshall Mathers LP Shaggy dog story Midnight Run Rain Fire fighting Thermal power station Dry cleaning Punk ideology Paragliding Vacuum Cheese Cannabis cultivation Plastic Conker's Bad Fur Day Ron and Fez Halitosis Textile manufacturing Dairy Otitis externa Milton H.

how much should i charge for washing windows i am trying to start my own housecleaning service i have a few clients already i charge a set price for vaccuming dusting mopping etc but i feel that things like window washing cleaning out the fridge cleaning the oven and laundry ironing should be charged extra the problem is i don't know how much extra what do you think is fair cleaning windows is a pain and once you set a price the homeowner becomes a pain in the butt you need to realize that window cleaning or washing means both sides what if the house is two storied now you need a ladder if you are writing up a proposal or just a pricing guide i would state that you only do windows on the bottom floor at a rate of a window that's a side no second floor outside windows will be done only the insides at a window as far as cleaning out the refrigerator goes that should be about because you have to remove the entire contents and clean all the shelving don't forget that includes the outside and the top i would also state that all cleaning supplies should be supplied by the home owner cleaning the oven what a pain i would say for those white stove tops that have burnt on crap on them that oven cleaner works really well and will not remove the paint laundry and ironing yuk i don't mind laundry to much but ironing is a pain i would recommend that they drop their ironing off at a professionals because people are really picky about this subject and if you mess up one article of clothing it could cost you several months salary i would like to make a suggestion one of the new waves of the future is designer closets i am going to include several web sites for ideas you can help during the building process of a home or remodel a older home it really is pretty basic and pays well also organizing garages shelve installation the rule of thumb here is materials times three for your labor cost what you do is figure out what all the materials cost everything from screws to shelving to hangers then multiply that number times three to get your labor cost http www californiaclosets com http www closetandstorageconcepts com http www easyclosets com http www closetmaid com main cfm http www easytrack com http www closetspecialtiesbydave com http www closetsbywellington com or go to google and type in designerclosets here are the fasteners that you will need to install shelving on drywall they are called drywall anchors and are easy to install home depot sells them i prefer the metal ones you can buy them cheaper at a nail and screw company look at the pictures of these anchors these hold alot of weight http fastenermegastore com rawl wallboard anchor kits p html they are called zinc zip its on this next one click on medium duty zip it http www kinter com anch f htm thsi next one is a computer cd software so that you can work with the customer and they can see what they are paying for http www closetdesigner com just some food for thought when you decide that you would like to make some real money usually on these jobs you tell the home owner that you need down to start the job that way you have the money to buy the materials if you are worried that you can't read a measuring tape home depot sells on with fractions on it about and there is no room for error also if you are worried that you don't know how to use these wall anchors have your dad or boyfriend show you how i use these in my home to install shower rods towel bars tissue holders practice at home it's really very easy just screw it into the wall then screw what ever you want to it good luck let me know when you make a fortune or you can always find a trim carpenter to help you with your jobs of course you will have to add that to your estimate never give away your estimating procedure because once they figure that out they no longer need you the job money should be confidentail between you and the home owner  Drill bit Kitchen Upholstery Screw Common Unix Printing System

natural and homemade cleaners one time i saw a recipe for a cleaner that mixed ammonia with dawn and something else to make a cleaner anyone know what it was white vinegar mildly acidic white vinegar dissolves dirt soap scum and hard water deposits from smooth surfaces yet is gentle enough to use in solution to clean hardwood flooring white vinegar is a natural deodorizer absorbing odors instead of covering them up and no your bathroom won't smell like a salad any vinegar aroma disappears when dry with no coloring agents white vinegar won't stain grout on tiled surfaces because it cuts detergent residue white vinegar makes a great fabric softener substitute for families with sensitive skin try these recipes to harness the cleaning power of white vinegar homemade spray cleaner recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup white vinegar cup water in the kitchen use vinegar and water spray to clean countertops lightly soiled range surfaces and backsplash areas in the bathroom use vinegar spray cleaner to clean countertops floors and exterior surfaces of the toilet for really tough bathroom surfaces such as shower walls pump up the cleaning power by removing the sprayer element and heating the solution in the microwave until barely hot spray shower walls with the warmed generously allow to stand for to minutes then scrub and rinse the heat helps soften stubborn soap scum and loosens hard water deposits undiluted white vinegar undiluted white vinegar straight from the jug makes quick work of tougher cleaning problems involving hard water deposits or soap scum use undiluted white vinegar to scrub the inside of the toilet bowl before you begin dump a bucket of water into the toilet to force water out of the bowl and allow access to the sides pour undiluted white vinegar around the bowl and scrub with a toilet brush to remove stains and odor use a pumice stone to remove any remaining hard water rings clean shower heads that have been clogged with mineral deposits with undiluted white vinegar place to cup vinegar in a plastic food storage bag and secure the bag to the shower head with a rubber band let stand for hours to overnight then rinse and buff the fixture to a shiny finish add one cup of undiluted white vinegar to the laundry rinse cycle instead of commercial fabric softener white vinegar softens clothes and cuts detergent residue a plus for family members with sensitive skin baking soda baking soda's mild abrasive action and natural deodorizing properties make it a powerful replacement for harsh commercial scouring powders put baking soda to work in your organized home sprinkle baking soda onto a damp sponge to tackle grimy bathtub rings scour vanities or remove food deposits from the kitchen sink for tougher grime make a paste of baking soda and water apply to the tub or sink and allow to stand for to minutes dirt soap scum and deposits soften and are easier to remove slow running drains keep bathroom drains running freely by pouring to cup baking soda into the drain and dribbling just enough hot water to wash the solution down let stand for hours to overnight then flush thoroughly with hot water the deodorizing effect is an added bonus do not use this method on blocked drains rubbing alcohol rubbing isopropyl alcohol provides the base for an evaporating cleaner to rival commercial window and glass cleaning solutions use this glass cleaning spray recipe for windows mirrors chrome fixtures and for a shiny finish on hard surface ceramic tiles homemade glass cleaner recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup rubbing isopropyl alcohol cup water tablespoon white vinegar ammonia a strong alkaline solution clear non sudsing ammonia creates stronger window and all purpose cleaning recipes than acidic vinegar choose non sudsing varieties of household ammonia for these cleaning recipes suds may look like they're working but they're tough to rinse and remove try these formulations for spring cleaning or tough chores strong glass cleaner recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup rubbing isopropyl alcohol cup water tablespoon clear non sudsing ammonia strong all purpose recipe mix in a sprayer bottle t clear non sudsing ammonia t clear laundry detergent cups water furniture polish most of us no longer use hard to apply furniture wax but rely on oil based polish to keep furniture protected and shiny our salad dressing version avoids the danger of silicone oil found in most commercial polishes and sprays silicone oil can penetrate tiny cracks in furniture finish and enter the wood causing problems in the event refinishing is needed lemon juice dissolves dirt and smudges while olive oil shines and protects the wood furniture polish recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup olive oil cup lemon juice shake well and apply a small amount to a flannel cleaning rag or cleaning cloth spread evenly over furniture surface turn cloth to a dry side and polish dry  Strap-on dildo Beer Sterilization (microbiology) Citric acid Alum

is it ok to wash my dry clean only comforter i have the same question i did a search on yahoo answers and online there seems to be a lot of disagreement is it expensive have sentimental value or not easily replaced if you said yes then maybe you should dry clean it if not some people have safely washed their dry clean only comforters a woman who said she used to work testing appliances said use a high setting because the water evaporating cools the dryer but cautioned not to overdry and cautioned that if you do not dry it properly and throughly you can get a musty smell and clumping another caution is if the comforter is polyester because it melts at medium and high heats some people say you can use the gentle cycle cold water and line dry lay it flat to dry i do this with the few dry clean only clothes and curtains i have and it works fine but a comforter is much thicker and would seem to pose a problem drying and what about the stitches it is too large to go in a lingerie bag and then into the washer but do not line dry it if the area you live in is humid some people say you can put it in the dryer too but that you need to use a low setting note laundry mat commercial dryers are often more powerful home dry cleaning kit makers say not to use them it seems a home setting of low is not equal to a laundrymat commercial one or the kit makers just do not want the liability i am concerned it would cause shrinking especially given my comforter seems to have a dry clean only fabric on the top the pretty part one would see looking at the bed and a washable fabric on the bottom part that faces the matress some say they have successfully used home dry cleaning kits i have read up on that before when i was trying to find a solution to the dry clean only comforter you have to use the bag they come with which is not large enough for queen and king size comforters they say you must use the bag for it to work and caution against just placing the clothes in the dryer they say do not use their kits as a replacement for dry cleaning they are to be used to freshen your clothes maybe the comforter manufacturers do not want the liability so they say dry clean only that way if you mess it up when you wash it then you pay the bill instead of them i thought of this but then was reading and a poster said they read about this before see  Mattress Washing machine Dry cleaning Air conditioning Autonomous building Sento Textile manufacturing Coffee Dairy Laundry Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Toilet Brewery Nuclear power Asbestos Sauna Plastic Japanese tea ceremony Soap Jute Water Hydrogen peroxide Japanese toilet Dishwasher Diving suit Welding Bong Social rule Kitchen Hamster Condom Fiberglass Opportunity rover Cruising (maritime) Instant coffee Hard disk Genericized trademark Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Diaper Cannabis cultivation Drill bit Corset Drainage Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ironing Gas metal arc welding Hot air balloon Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Motor oil Illegal drug trade Changeroom Climate of the United Kingdom Carburetor Top-bar hive Basement Toyota Prius Seismic retrofit Glass Ocean thermal energy conversion Bedbug Bicycle Electric motor Swamp cooler Fire extinguisher Dialysis Violin Undergarment Paint Incandescent light bulb Explosive material Avalanche Irrigation IPod Nuclear reactor Car washing techniques CPU design Energy development Kimono Sewage treatment Transformer DVD Professional wrestling match types Home repair Microeconomics Alcohol fuel Collecting fossils Chocolate

why are the fleas worse i tried flea bombs that didn't work tried the home made solutions yesterday salt borax lemon water mothballs and this morning it's worse took out a mattress they seemed to love now what no it's not dangerous to use bombs in an room house with a basement and i did call an exterminator who told me it would take days to kill fleas and told me some of these home remedies well flea bombs only kill the live fleas they do nothing to kill the eggs larve so i'm guessing you are in the middle of a new cycle of little pests or some of your foggers may not have discharged properly and if that is was the case the fleas may have fled to a room that wasn't treated like say a basement or attic space if that is the case you may be able to call the number and get a refund if you have the receipt it's important when treating your home for fleas that you leave closets and cabinets open and treat all floors enen a basement so having said here's what you do go to the wholesale club and buy yourself some baking soda lbs for and iodized salt and mix them together in a ziplock or whatever sprinkle that on your carpets the baking soda will smoother the larve and the salt will puncture and kill the eggs i would leave this on overnight it's not harmful to pets or children get a flea collar and put it in your bagless vacuum or in the bag and the next day vacuum really really well and either throw away the bag in a sealed grocery bag or empty the bagless outside away from the house you can use the baking soda salt on the furniture as well if you have an animal it would be a good time to go to petsmart and get zodiac flea drops for your pet they are a lot cheaper than frontline advantage and they work treat your pet if you are worried give your pet a bath and use dawn dishsoap or any dishsoap you have and leave it on for about min that will kill any fleas on your pet if you do not have a pet talk to some friends that do and see if you can borrow their pet before it is treated with flea tick drops and use it as bait let the pet hang out at your house for acouple days and then use the drops the fleas will be killed you also may want to treat your yard with a flea bomb or liquid treatment i know that ortho makes several wet dry applications you still may need to in acouple weeks bomb and keep up with the vacuuming to check for more fleas leave a desk lamp out at night shining into a white light dish with a bit of water and some dishsoap the fleas are attracted to the warm light and when they jump into the water the dishsoap makes them stick and they die good luck  Flea Bedbug Hamster Mattress Vacuum cleaner Chicken Bread Plastic Tea Cannabis cultivation The Inside Dog Fancy rat Carbon dioxide Animal Crossing Toilet humour Diseases of the honeybee Kitchen EastEnders Cat James Hanratty Tofu Mouth ulcer Jewish cuisine Sea-Monkey Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sodium Theory of conduct Spidey Super Stories Ultraviolet Lighting Egg (food) Vinegar Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Battery (electricity) Dialysis Basement Illegal drug trade USS Tunny (SS-282) Tlingit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Water (molecule) Pancake Autonomous building Vacuum Dairy John Frusciante Brewery Pet skunk The Dalek Invasion of Earth Red Hot Chili Peppers Insomnia Dog training Solar power Rabies Ocean's Twelve Rebreather Customs and etiquette of Japan Bacon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Pet Sounds Sessions Fire fighting Breakfast Chinchilla Kodocha Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence The Young Ones (TV series) Electrophysiology Water Coffee Hydroponics Charles Peace Betting (poker) Reservoir Dogs The Lovely Bones Donald Rumsfeld Ferret Sin City Fire extinguisher Paint Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Planet of the Daleks Social rule StarCraft: Uprising Tobacco I Want to Hold Your Hand Night (book) Bong Columbine High School massacre Carburetor First aid

ii have kids what is the best way to get organized we live in a bedroom house there seems to be stuff eveywhere want to cut down on the clutter i have boys girls boys are girls are and months old ikea it's inexpensive and they have lots of great organizational furniture and items they sell plenty of various kids things too especially for storing books toys and project supplies under bed storage is a great place to store lots of clothes or bedding with that many kids things will never be perfect but the best way to be organized is to make sure that everything has a place that way it can always be returned once it is used additionally teach your children from a young age to pick up after themselves and to clean up before they switch from one thing to another never go to bed with a messy home and it will become a habit lastly unless an item has sentimental or monetary value if you haven't used it in a year throw it away or donate it unused items can take up so much space in a home that can otherwise be used for storing and putting away items that you use each day  Hamster Strap-on dildo The Brady Bunch Sears Holdings Corporation Getting Things Done Animal Crossing Empire Burlesque IKEA The Jeffersons (South Park) Neopets The Apprentice 2 Target Corporation Emergency preparedness Kitchen Bedroom Dog training RuneScape locations Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Clothing RuneScape economy Floppy disk About a Boy My Little Pony Charles Goodyear Hilary Duff Plastic Dollar store Surveillance Harmony, Minnesota Bedbug MapleStory Fry's Electronics Laura Schlessinger Sister Princess Japanese tea ceremony Sesame Street Shawn Michaels Titans (comics) Kimberly-Clark Corporation Computer The Sims 2 Microeconomics Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Oprah Winfrey Rich Mullins Brewery Atlas Comics (1950s) Boarding school Monticello Upholstery Amazon.com Boy Scouts of America Social rule Atari 2600 Dairy Domestic rabbit Gaia Online The Apprentice 3 Fancy rat Andy Warhol Textile manufacturing Child Mattress Video game crash of 1983 Defense Logistics Agency Jackass: The Movie Blankets (graphic novel) Beavis and Butt-head Berkshire Hathaway Inventory The Jazz Singer Gramophone record Destiny's Child Time Out of Mind Do it yourself Furniture Salad Fingers Dormitory Argos (retailer) Le Corbusier Billy the Kid USB flash drive Weebl and Bob W.

how do i clean mold out of a mattress my family and i moved to a humid area about six months ago and our stuff has been in storage until today when i got my mattresses out they were covered in mold they are fairly new and extremely expensive so i don't want to get rid of them does anyone know a way to clean the mold out that won't ruin the mattresses and will completely get rid of the mold so that it won't regrow toss the mattresses no matter how expensive the mattresses are they are ruined mold can be extremely dangerous especially for people with allergies or immune system problems it's not worth your health to hang onto moldy mattresses mold is a plant and the roots will have penetrated to the inside bleach will not work contrary to what most people think as evidenced by the answer above me because of the chemical make up of bleach the active bleach ingredient will not penetrate a surface only the water part of the solution will and the water is what the mold needs to thrive and grow so when you use bleach on mold you are actually giving it what it wants the water true the mold plants on the surface may be killed the spores probably will not be killed by bleach and the mold stains may disappear but you have not killed the root of the problem when people see the mold stains disappear they mistakenly think they have killed the mold with is simply not true what will work for of all mold types is vinegar but you would really have to dump gallons on the mattresses and soak them all the way through also tea tree oil will kill virtually all mold but this is expensive and to get enough to do the job a new mattress would be cheaper don't gamble on this throw the mattresses out  Mattress Plastic Strap-on dildo Toxic mold Water purification Menstrual cup Vinegar Sodium hypochlorite Cheese Disinfection Coir Tooth enamel Hydrogen peroxide Sake Solar power Bacteria Ozone Allergy Coffee Bong Pollution Hamster Sterilization (microbiology) Naval mine Flowering plant Acorn Dishwashing Water Theory of conduct Coral reef Ecology Wheat RuneScape skills Explosive material Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Dog Myxobolus cerebralis Fungus Hard disk Alcohol fuel Hydrogen economy Illegal drug trade Root Peanut Energy development Weed control Tattoo Mosquito Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Chocolate Hemp Wind power Autonomous building Floppy disk Mushroom hunting Houseplant Carbon dioxide Environmental concerns with electricity generation Sorghum Irrigation Immune system Carnivorous plant Ice cream Rooibos Hair coloring American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Renewable energy Thermal power station Casting Xenomorph Plant Mach kernel Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Saved by the Bell Arguments for and against drug prohibition Tea Sulfuric acid Natural gas Laundry detergent Sodium percarbonate Dishwasher Piccolo Junior Saga Tiberium Air-raid shelter Wood pulp Soil pH Fire extinguisher Polyurethane Biodiesel Psoriasis Fuel cell Nuclear power Birth control Hydrochloric acid Diaper

glue marks on canvas pumps anyway to remove it this can be tough so i would suggest getting some tweezers and pulling off any loose pieces and then trying a paste made of white vinegar and baking soda the porous baking soda will act as an exfoliant and the vinegar will hopefully break down the glue with its acidity the only thing is that there may be a stain left on the canvas even after you get the glue off if they were inexpensive and you can buy another pair without breaking the bank then just get rid of them hope this helps  Vinegar Bread Acetic acid Sodium hydroxide Carbon dioxide Glass Carboxylic acid Ramen Upholstery Toffee Dairy Fish and chips Mouth ulcer Cello Baking powder Poker jargon Cocaine Plastic Weathering Barbecue Bulk vending Tire Harp World War Three (Doctor Who) Flour Psoriasis Carbonated water Professional wrestling slang Solvent Printed circuit board Soul food Menstrual cup Textile manufacturing Acne Alum Chocolate Laundry detergent Cookware and bakeware Cleopatra VII of Egypt Guitar Potato Bicycle frame Toilet humour Brewery Casting Piccolo Junior Saga Ceramics Full line vending Knife Surrealist techniques Nail (anatomy) Textile manufacturing terminology Hydrochloric acid Kodocha Cuisine of Denmark Bacteria Babe Ruth The Last Supper (Leonardo) Passover Illegal drug trade Biscuit Nasal irrigation Cocoa Canvas Internal ballistics Tooth Hydrogen peroxide Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pickling Coca-Cola Manifold Hydroponics Tooth enamel Sodium acetate Cheese Wood Sodium Pottery Collage Kayak Monosodium glutamate Sugar substitute French fries Bokken Food additive Great Teacher Onizuka Spidey Super Stories Bong Fermentation Soda lime Jewish cuisine Conker Tea Hair conditioner Sushi Skunk Sulfuric acid Charcoal Water purification Conker's Bad Fur Day

how can i keep clean laundry from smelling musty smells great after washing could it be the dryer i use fabric softener and dryer sheets sometimes things even smell good after drying but sitting in the basket they develop the odor is there some way to really super clean the dryer first when drying clothes make sure they get completely dry if they are going to sit in a basket for awhile if they are not completely dry hang them up or put them on a drying rack if they sit in a basket and are not completely dry they will develop mildew as for the smell run the washer on the hottest water setting and pour a cup of vinegar into it even if they smell great after washing now is as good a time as any to clean it as for the dryer reach in and wipe down the surface with an a clorox cleaning wipe or even a baby wipe make sure you get every nook and cranny then run the dryer on the highest heat setting with a few towels the terry cloth acts as an abrasive with a dryer sheet made with baking soda arm and hammer makes dryer sheets i think if that doesn't work then you might want to consult an appliance repair shop to see what they suggest good luck  Washing machine Upholstery Menstrual cup Car washing techniques Textile manufacturing Vinegar Cookware and bakeware Sauna Diaper Dry cleaning Wok Casting Manicure Laundry Urticaria Dairy Japanese toilet Plastic Procter & Gamble Jewish cuisine Brewery Laundry detergent Japanese tea ceremony Kitchen Soap Tattoo Diving suit Tofu Bong Sodium hydroxide Printmaking Ironing Gilding Animal Crossing Cruising (maritime) Toilet paper Wound Comanche Toilet Compost Bread Feet washing Acetic acid Hydrogen peroxide Glass Sushi Clothing Hand washing Jute Sulfuric acid Lake Black pepper Blood Simple Fecal incontinence Knife Detergent Water Luck Cocoa Drill bit Paper Tlingit Home repair Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hot air balloon Deluge (mythology) Glossary of climbing terms Steel Microfiber Laundromat Hygiene Coffee Shoe Charles Goodyear Sodium carbonate Cannabis cultivation Oxyacetylene Top-bar hive Novelty (locomotive) Domestic water system Leather Citric acid Tea Baby bottle Wudu Water purification Basement Thermal power station Hangi Repouss__ and chasing Dialysis Motor oil Garden Strawberry

why should i bother cleaning my room go ahead call me an immature teen but i never quite understood the obsession as long as nasty stuff like dirty clothes and food dishes are where they belong i honestly don't really see the point in cleaning i don't invite people over anyway and i think clean ends up looking creepy and fake i don't wear shoes inside the house anyway and my floor isn't completely covered with stuff anyways so it can be swept and mopped when needed otherwise i just don't understand why i have the rest of my life to be a miserable adult with a to why can't i kick back and sit in my room as is it's not like it smells plus with everything out i actually find things faster since i don't have to remember what drawer it is stuck in which is really inconvenient since i have an unusually bad memory i don't see any reasoning that goes beyond i say so i'll wash the dishes and feed the pets and all that jazz but i don't think my room really needs it it's not like roaches abound well technically my dad is the one who bought the house and he doesn't really care as long he is doesn't have to come in in return i refrain from commenting on those huge ass dust bunnies on the desk in his room also i don't understand the clean room responsible connection i'm actually not that bad i keep my locker pretty organized at school i am in charge of holding on to my records so i have my files organized but i don't feel much compelled to clean my room except to shut my mum up i probably just jinxed it but the roaches party in my mom's meticulously cleaned living room and kitchen more than anywhere else i've only ever seen roaches in my closet where my stuff is supposed to be plus the stuff that's laying around is what i use the most so it gets shifted every so often instead of just settling there forever also about people taking my stuff that's why i don't like having people over in the first place but if it's that important i will notice i also love how i should clean because men like women who keep there place clean erm so i basically should change my behaviour toward my room for the sake of potential guys sorry i'm not quite in the boy or girl crazy teen stereotype yes i know that work makes you do things you don't want but at least there's a paycheck with my room the mess is back there in a few days since i actually live inside of there after all and that clutter is just a result of me actually being alive in there no my part of florida just sucks palmetto bugs anyone making the bugs unavoidable and like i said they're in the kitchen and such and beyond my control unless i suddenly get the the money to call professionals for my parents so i do have baits and spray and my room has stayed as safe as i can get it and keep in mind i am a teen that lives with my parents i have to clean eventually ever so often and i'm fairly certain that i would notice a million carcasses littered in my shoes and stuff ah but lennie while i could understand the dust and germs especially since it's so humid here the idea isn't to put it off but rather to keep sweaty things and stuff that can rot away and then it doesn't really matter where my stuff lands since i'll likely be using it again fairly soon also i do not believe that it is a reflection of myself i mean a room there are much better reflections such as my taste in clothing choice in friends or even how hard i work in school even if i despise it it's just a room a place to lay my head and store my stuff until i get up and go back out into the world how can it reflect me when i didn't even choose the year old furniture then again it's the perfect definition of a teen scattered thoughts over the base palette that your parents gave you ehem overall i still would like to know why the state of my room would even matter to others in this case my mother i don't even share a room james i find that very offensive seemingly you have gathered from the fact that i am questioning why i should clean my room that i am a lazy slut who will sleep around and have five kids for your information i do work hard i am in the top two of my class and i have no problem putting effort into the things that i need to do however i have yet to see my life go up in flames because i didn't hang my jacket up or stick my favorite flip flops back in the closet i see no reason why my room would reflect on me holding down a job whatever happened to things like education experience or how hard i'll work to keep that job i was unaware that a job interview included a home inspection stop being a jerk and assuming that i have to fit some twisted stereotype of yours because i don't want to clean my room everyday it's the things that you can't see that should be worrying you bacteria and fungus can cause all manner of diseases and air borne illnesses like meningitis and worst case scenario could also result in death this is serious stuff you should dvr how clean is your house on bbc america

vacuum reviews i am lokoing for some suggestions on the best vacuums for a house with a dog that sheds constantly the fur keeps clogging my upright so i think i am going to go with a canister vac however i do not want to spend a lot of money any thoughts i agree with pebblespro everyone will say a dyson however my husband and i own a housecleaning company and have used them on several occasions and they are not that great in fact i would say they are overrated except by consumer reports which places dyson in the middle ranking among a lot of other vacuum cleaners they do have good suction but then again so do most vacuums nowadays i've been trying to research myself different vacuums to replace the one we currently have it is getting old after checking out a lot of different vacuums we went with the eureka capture a new release by eureka it is pretty good except i would say the suction is not as good as the one we have now it has awesome attachments is durable and e z roll tires which is good for hardwood floors keep in mind thouugh our standards are high because we have to use them everyday and they have to be good and reliable the one that i would recommend though is what is our previous vacuum before this one the eureka smart boss this one has great suction power and has a long hose and attachments it was rated a best buy by consumer reports and carries the good housekeeping seal of approval something dyson doesn't have i am contemplating returning the eureka we just bought to go and buy another one of these we just wanted to see if there was something better out there anyway i know others will suggest many other vacuums but my advice is shop around go to the stores and pick up the displays and play with the attachments see which one fits you also amazon com has many reviews of vacuums that people have personal experience using so check them out too good luck  Vacuum cleaner Dyson (appliances) Abortion Vacuum Upholstery Tire Hydraulic machinery Bulk vending Gross domestic product Glossary of firefighting equipment Hard disk Advertising Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mattress Pacific, Missouri Transistor Poker jargon Paintball Electrophysiology Siphon Scuba set Bong Digital audio broadcasting Motion picture rating system Electronic commerce Supply and demand Carburetor Good Times Surveillance Glossary of wildland fire terms Dredge Galactic Civilizations Breastfeeding Anchor Incandescent light bulb B-47 Stratojet Circuit breaker Windows XP UK Singles Chart Kirby Corporation Clothing Capitalism Audiophile M16 (rifle) Inflation Luminiferous aether RFID Colonization of the Moon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AT&T The Catcher in the Rye Ammunition Bicycle lighting Charmed Diving cylinder Jam (TV series) Internet fraud Eureka, California Solar power Nintendo Central processing unit James Dyson W.

dry cleaning question does lemon juice remove stains i can't take some of my work trousers to the dry cleaners as i am too embarrassed are there any home remedies for removing stains like i heard of lemon juice are there any others vinegar i had a little adventure at work with a co worker and somehow i got my own spunk all down my trousers can you help thanks yes lemon juice does remove some stains but you might prefer white vinegar as it removes stains and will remove odors and residues left by detergents and dry cleaning chemicals white vinegar is an all purpose cleaner degreaser it also freshens and softens like a fabric softner so you don't have to use those expensive fabric softners as vinegar is less expensive it also is touted as being the best disinfectant in the world and is gentle when used with water here is the method for removing stains in the laundry and for removing stains soften fabrics kill bacteria eliminate static and more there are so many benefits to be reaped by adding cup white vinegar to your washer's rinse cycle that it's surprising that you don't find it prominently mentioned inside the owner's manual of every washing machine sold here are the main ones a single cup of vinegar will kill off any bacteria that may be present in your wash load especially if it includes cloth diapers and the like a cup of vinegar will keep your clothes coming out of the wash soft and smelling fresh so you can kiss your fabric softening liquids and sheets good bye unless of course you happen to like your clothes smelling of heavy perfumes a cup of vinegar will brighten small loads of white clothes added to the last rinse a cup of vinegar will keep your clothes lint and static free adding a cupful of vinegar to the last rinse will set the color of your newly dyed fabrics pat away water soluble stains you can lift out many water soluble stains including beer orange and other fruit juices black coffee or tea and vomit from your cotton blend clothing by patting the spot with a cloth or towel moistened with undiluted white vinegar just before placing it in the wash for large stains you may want to soak the garment overnight in a solution of parts vinegar to part cold water before washing unset old stains older set in stains will often come out in the wash after being pretreated with a solution of tablespoons white vinegar and tablespoons liquid detergent in quart liter warm water rub the solution into the stain then blot it dry before washing sponge out serious stains cola hair dye ketchup and wine stains on washable cotton blends should be treated as soon as possible that is within hours sponge the area with undiluted vinegar and launder immediately afterward for severe stains add cups vinegar to the wash cycle as well good luck  Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Coffee Menstrual cup Hydrogen peroxide Laundry Sewage treatment Water purification Acetic acid Tofu Car washing techniques Soap Tea Cuisine of the Philippines Diaper Hard water Bong Fecal incontinence Citric acid Sterilization (microbiology) Detergent Western blot Tattoo Plastic Sulfuric acid Mattress Clothing Dishwashing Urticaria Cheese Dairy Jewish cuisine Paint Glycerin Halitosis Rum Solvent Japanese toilet Cuisine of Denmark Staining (biology) 613 mitzvot Kosher foods Sugar beet Manicure Haggis Wine Menstrual cycle Gram staining Shroud of Turin Textile manufacturing terminology Embalming Mayonnaise Procter & Gamble Water Sodium percarbonate Agar plate Carbon dioxide Common cold Sento Sodium hydroxide Hand washing Breakfast Sulfur Bread Ketchup Starch Gilding Escherichia coli O157:H7 Beer Comanche Indigo dye Barbecue Sake Champagne (beverage) Lemon Soap bubble Flax Sauna Brewery Japanese tea ceremony Shaving Genericized trademark Towel Chocolate Industrial wastewater treatment Soldering Toilet humour Lemonade

house cleaning with kids mothers could you please share your cleaning and organizing tips it seems like everytime i turn around i am stepping in something sticky or wet and i am constantly picking up toys my house is not very big and i am not an organized type of person i really need some tips on how to organize thank you hi the laundry is piled up to your ears the dishes have a funny green funk growing on them and you could have sworn you had a table somewhere in the kitchen sound familiar trust me you aren t alone whether you are a working work from home or stay at home mom the household chores add up with the ever increasing responsibility of after school activities volunteer work or just trying to make some time for yourself the cleanliness of your home seems to be the first to go a little bit of organization and some help from the rest of family will make the problem easier to handle the first thing i would do is enlist the help of your family don t walk around thinking that having a clean house is your responsibility alone all of those other people live there too and are capable of helping to make it a pleasant environment for everyone the man of the house can do more than fix a clogged drain he can do dishes laundry dust and yes even windows tell him if he s worried about dishpan hands to wear gloves seriously talk to your husband about ways he can help out find out what he hates and the two of you set a schedule that limits the amount either one of you has to do your personal hated chore most men aren t sure which job will actually be of help some guidance from you could make all the difference in the world now as far as those little people who live under the stairs go definite guidelines have to be established if you manage to catch your children in that stage where they want to help you have a golden opportunity to teach habits that will stay with them teach them that a family helps each other and their job in that family is to keep their home clean remember to keep their jobs age appropriate and be patient i am the first to admit that organization is not my strong point developing a system that makes sense for your life and home is key to household bliss i usually spend one morning or afternoon a week cleaning the house the rest of the week is spent keeping up with daily chores and laundry it never ceases to amaze me how many dirty dishes and clothes three kids and a husband can make the whole family takes about hour to pick up the assorted clutter before bed that way the house is clean and ready to start the day in the morning that may not work for everyone so adapt the idea to your schedule obviously for events like a family get together or party it will take longer than a few hours to clean during those times i would suggest giving yourself plenty of time and schedule breaks so you don t burn out don t forget lighting and closing doors to messy rooms can do wonders for the overall appearance of your house in my experience keeping up with chores is the best way to prevent them from becoming a bigger hassle than necessary of course if you asked my ceiling fans they would disagree with me the traditions of spring and fall cleaning originated for a purpose it s a good reminder to take care of those out of the way semi unseen tasks that get overlooked in everyday clean ups i am especially fond of the fall cleaning so that i have a clean start for holiday decorating for some reason i don t like the look of sparkling ornaments with a backdrop of dust a tidy organized home runs more smoothly than one that isn t don t take it too far though there is more to life than perfect blinds and windows like family time and enjoying each other of course i do suggest being able to find each other so straighten up at least that much seriously who ever heard of the attack of the dust bunnies narendra  Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Milton H.

smelly photos any way to remove odor from them hey all does anyone have any good tips for removing odors from pictures we had a fire in january and i suppose we're lucky to have been able to recover most of them they're in boxes in the basement however they stink something awful it's hard to even open up the box i'd hate to just throw them out and i was thinking about sticking an air freshener or something inside i don't want to risk further damaging the photos with spray any suggestions thanks you could stick a large bowl of charcoal in with them charcoal will absorb the smells and kill the bacteria and as long as they are in a bowl they won't hurt the pictures after about days change out the bowl if they still smell cause the charcoal can only absorb so much you could also use a large bowl of salt or baking soda but they won't absorb as much at a time as the charcoal  Bong Sulfur Skunk Carbon dioxide Toilet humour Cannabis cultivation Acetic acid Foot odor Stink bomb Water purification Phoebe Buffay's songs Fume hood Fire fighting Iron Steel Diseases of the honeybee Flatulence Michael Moore Vermicompost Tofu Kurt Cobain Happy Tree Friends Pottery The Adventures of Pete & Pete Ammonia Toothpaste Shoe Poker jargon Odor Menstrual cup Professional wrestling match types Homer Simpson Deodorant Hydrochloric acid Ice cream Paracetamol Olfaction Tobacco V.F.D.

my house stinks man its not like its dirty and messy its just like any other house but for some reason it smells like year old cheese and the bathrooms man they smell like perfume mixed in with crap what can i do to make smell better especialy the bathrooms mold has heart attack first off a good cleaning with bleach to kill any germs or bacteria also kills mold as that sounds like it could be it the smell i mean next if you have a basement and attic make sure they are both well ventilated you need to air out the whole house so open every window and vent you have also check for water damage in the basement if there is water coming in the dampness will cause mold and the smell will knock your socks off lol but its also very dangerous for your health so do please check all this out once you have done all that cleaned vented etc go over all furniture with something like fabreez and get some good fragranced plug ins or scented oils etc to place around the home also if you have central air or heating its a good thing to check the ducts and make sure they are cleaned also as this can be your source of smell also you can place some fragranced sheets over the vents of these also another good idea is to lightly spray all light bulbs with your favorite scent so every time you open a light the room will smell really nice one more thing if your house is older check under the sinks in the kitchen and bathroom and make sure that you have the s type i think its called for water drainage if you don't then you are getting methane gas into the home which is bad for your health and causes a horrible smell my old house had straight drainage smell was horrible changed them and smell was gone as the water inside the s keeps out the gas and sewer smells and don't forget to clean out those pipes too with baking soda and vinegar that is about all i can think of good luck to ya and btw if it is mold have it cleaned out by a professional just in case because it is dangerous to your health cannot stress that enough  Air pollution HVAC Kitchen Fire fighting Basement Perfume Japanese toilet Hydrogen sulfide Bong Menstrual cup Natural gas Houseplant Sulfur The Shining (film) Hamster Autonomous building Sewage treatment Bread Upholstery Cheese Geodesic dome Strap-on dildo Solar power Radon Air conditioning Plastic Flatulence Tofu Fume hood Diseases of the honeybee Odor Domestic water system Home repair Rebreather Furnace Swimming pool Social rule Foodborne illness Ozone Two-stroke cycle Skunk Dymaxion house The Young Ones (TV series) Soap Renewable energy The Brady Bunch Alkane Glossary of firefighting terms Spotted Skunk Oxyacetylene Dishwasher M16 (rifle) Blood Simple Lighting Acetic acid World War Three (Doctor Who) Olfaction Asbestos Gas metal arc welding Methane Airbag Gasoline Halitosis Fire extinguisher Ammonia Multiple chemical sensitivity Brewery Dormitory Tobacco Volcano Futurama (TV series - season 2) Jewish cuisine Motor oil Dairy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ventilation Lake Thermal depolymerization Hydrogen peroxide Chatsworth House Tank Abiogenic petroleum origin Fluorescent lamp

whirlpool gold washer years old fills and drains won't agitate or spin but makes noises like it is washing machine experts should i try to repair or replace ps the load just prior to it breaking down had a pillow and it became unbalanced and the machine banged around alot before i heard it did i break a belt or something thanks that model has no belt it s a direct drive your problem is the coupler assembly between the motor and transmission is broken because of overloading a common problem with whirlpool and kenmore top loaders it s not really that big a deal though the coupler kit has to be replaced it s worth approximately more than that and you re getting ripped off labour takes between and minutes tops so that should give you an idea of your total cost if you phone around and get labour quotes it takes me roughly minutes from start to finish if everything goes good you may even get a good flat rate for the whole job if you pay cash and don t need a receipt dena f unfortunately that s not the problem in this case because the washer won t spin also if it was an agitator problem the washer would still spin the only reason it drains in this case is because the pump is attached to one end of the motor so as long as the motor runs it ll drain but because the coupler is broken the motor can t drive the transmission for either wash or spin  Washing machine Electric motor Rail terminology IPod Toyota Prius Cruising (maritime) Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family Thermal power station E85 Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Tractor Motorcycle Fossil fuel power plant Manual transmission Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Robot Wars Tire Ford Motor Company Winning Streak Upholstery Dry cleaning Coupling (railway) Hydraulic machinery 24 Hours of Le Mans Floppy disk Wheel of Fortune Wind turbine Surveillance Motor oil Bicycle Microeconomics Paintball Krag-J__rgensen Filling station Casting Transmission (mechanics) Airsoft Carburetor Radio controlled car Siphon Lathe Elevator Diesel engine Paintball marker Industrial Revolution Indianapolis 500 Automatic transmission Dairy Chevrolet Corvair engine Drag racing Modem Lionel Corporation American Motors Brewery Compact disc Home repair Turbocharger Table saw Weight training CPU cache Pittsburgh Steelers Ford Mustang RuneScape Mini-Games Ford Ranger EV Whitewater Spark plug Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dialysis Labor theory of value High-voltage direct current The Amazing Race All-terrain vehicle Truck M60 machine gun Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Autogyro Electrical generator Hendrick Motorsports $ale of the Century Semi-trailer Babe Ruth Toilet humour M16 (rifle) Hybrid vehicle Slot machine Phonograph General Motors Mars Exploration Rover Inflation Ford Thunderbird T-64

can bed bugs jump off a mattress and into carpet and stay there for weeks then jump on someone elses matress i have a situation where somebody has moved out of a house and there was absolutely no furniture in the house and there is only carpet in the bedrooms then a new person has moved in they claim that bed bugs were in the house from the first day they went in i am asking is it possible for the bed mites to stay in the house or did the bitch bring them in her mattress please help court cases are a comin' it is more likely that she brought them if the house was empty however although they are called bed bugs they are actually dust mites dust mites live off dead skin which is why they love being in beds every night they can have a good feed they don't harm us they actually do us good by removing the dead skin and allowing new skin to breath they help us to have healthy skin however i have a funny feeling that what this person is calling bed bugs are not bed bugs but body lice if it is body lice then she would most certainly have carried the lice herself the lice cannot survive in carpets etc for too long they need the body for feeding and breeding they are not like fleas fleas will have a feed lay eggs and then jump off the carrier they will then wait for a different host to come along and have a feed breed and lay eggs on that host etc etc body lice can't jump the only way they spread is from either close contact between people or through coming off the host and waiting for the host to return in other words if you carried the lice you would have to brush against her for any of the lice to cross over to her if she lays in a bed and the louse come off her body they will wait until she returns to that bed one other highly likely explanation is that it is highly likely that she has slept with somebody that was carrying body lice if she only has them in a certain area of the body they may even be pubic lice crabs and therefore if they are pubic lice she would have had to sleep with you if you gave them to her lol as it appears that this person is possibly suing you you need to get more information as to exactly what these bugs are once you know exactly what they are you can get your defence btw bed bugs dust mites are microscopic so she would not be able to see them only feel them if she could see them then they are lice you need to find ourt which type as there are three common ones head lice but they do only stay on the head pubic lice crabs which only live in the pubic hair and body lice which can live on any part of the body but do prefer the hottest parts i hope this info helps  Crab louse Bedbug House dust mite Diseases of the honeybee Mattress Guinea pig Fancy rat Pediculosis Flea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pubic hair Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tick Hair Mosquito Honeybee Beetle Anopheles Poker jargon Louse Scabies Depilation Professional wrestling holds Prostate cancer Dog Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Crab Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Waterbed Cat Clothing Puberty Hematophagy Dog agility Black Death Breastfeeding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fugu Kakapo Theory of conduct Insect Equine conformation The Subtle Knife Rocky Mountain spotted fever Lou Gehrig Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Bat Platypus Aerial (dance move) Sexually-transmitted infection Darwin from Orchids to Variation Muslim ibn Aqeel Donald Neilson Snake Hamster Out-of-body experience Hazing Professional wrestling throws Plagues of Egypt Thermal power station Malaria Body piercing Allergy The Cure Mange Schistosomiasis Arthropod Funeral Gypsy moth Computer virus Micronauts Heartworm Professional wrestling attacks Tsetse fly Mario Breath of Fire III Albatross 613 mitzvot Pok__mon Abilities Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Customs and etiquette of Japan Meat Loaf Skin The Legend of Zelda series enemies

help dry cleaners turned my wedding gown yellow i was watching a talk show and the topic was how dry cleaners have been charging women for a service they didn't do you send your wedding gown to the cleaners to be preserved and they box it up all nice and pretty and seal it the gown is preserved for years air tight this is where they get you because they know the box is not to be opened for at least years so they don't do a thing to the gown the host of the show had her gown preserved over years and she was going to open it for the first time to see if her gown had turned yellow she opened the box and her gown was a ugly dark yellow she started to cry right there but then she got mad and said to everyone who is watching go get the box your gown is in and open it i was scared to open mine but i did and it was horrible my beautiful gown was now ugly yellow but not the hat the hat was still white my question is can anything be done can it be dyed back to it's original white can anything be done for my gown thank you i agree with the first poster somewhat oxi clean is like a magic potion i wouldn't soak the dress though i would test a small patch first and if it works i would spray the dress rinsing it clean thouroughly and then allow it to air dry for storage i would look in your local yellow pages for a company not a dry cleaner that specializes in wedding gown preservation they might also have a solution for the yellowing so you might want to call them first if you do use oxi clean and it does work wrap it in acid free tissue paper and store it in one of those vacuum seal bags the kind you can do yourself with the vacuum cleaner hose good luck to you sweetie i hope you can salvage your dress one more option if by chance your dress cannot be saved cut a few pieces of the lace and or trim and have it professionally framed as a keepsake you could also have a hanky made out of a remnant once the pieces are cut you could try again to soak them in the oxi clean good luck  Textile manufacturing Vacuum cleaner Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clothing Mattress Bong Upholstery Dry cleaning Jackass: The Movie Academic dress of Oxford University Textile manufacturing terminology Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Teen Girl Squad Tlingit Friends Wedding dress Vacuum Jute Evening gown Gaia Online Padm__ Amidala Characters in the Smurfs Kimono The Phantom Manor RuneScape quests Black tie Menstrual cup Oscilloscope The Inside Undergarment Kasparov versus The World Theory of conduct Spidey Super Stories Sento Black Paper Genericized trademark The Ashlee Simpson Show The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Contact lens Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Tattoo The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Contender (television series) Japanese tea ceremony Advertising Taliesin Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Food preservation Casting Hat Have I Got News For You Time Out of Mind Academia Reservoir Dogs YuYu Hakusho Kilt Shrek 2 Glossary of firefighting equipment The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Skirt and dress Phoebe Halliwell Waking the Dragons Pottery Toilet paper Peter Shilton Solar power Wood Court dress Tanning Diablo II Bus models used in New York City Transit Origin belief Papa Lazarou Teletubbies Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Top-bar hive Knife Clothing terminology Characters of Naruto Hamster Manifold Little Britain The Star Wars Holiday Special RuneScape locations Dyson (appliances)

how do i get ink out of leather does anyone know how to get biro ink out of my leather sofa my little girl went a bit mad with the biro pen lol this really depends on what type of leather it is if it is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an ink stick the fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it it is a good idea to have one in your house if you have a pale leather and children you should also be using a good quality leather protector on your suite this will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off if an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts using hairspray is very risky ait but can make the matter far worse as it can spread the ink over a bigger area especially on an aniline style leather and can sometimes then be impossible to fix nail varnish remover or any other solvents will remove the finish and pigment which will need replacing do not use baby wipes as they are about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it please do not try milk it is a silly idea that this will work and will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish if the ink is on an aniline style there is nothing that will remove it because the ink will have re dyed the leather it may dissipate over time with cleaning and protecting old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish this is probably best left to the experts silicones furniture polish are the worst thing to use on leather as they will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather and will eventually break all the finish down and make it crack leather needs water and should not be protected against it leather does not need conditioning it needs cleaning and protecting on a regular basis with water based products this will keep it rehydrated and supple oils will make things much worse leather should be cleaned gently not scrubbed so 'elbow grease' will only do damage to the finish nail varnish remover solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather source s www lttsolutions net leather care consultnts to the furniture and cleaning industries  Paint Upholstery Leather Dry cleaning Knife Ink Printmaking Drawing Manicure Varnish Printed circuit board Tattoo Inkjet printer Pottery Drill bit Brush Woodworking Tooth Textile manufacturing Vulcanization Welding Biodiesel Cross-country skiing Violin Dairy Corrosion Water (molecule) Soy protein Mattress Brewery Perfume Wood Lacquer Aniline Solvent Water Fecal incontinence Dye Sewage treatment Tofu Daredevil Diving suit Ballpoint pen Casting Benzene Explosive material Inflation Coffee Shampoo Aluminium Humphrey Bogart Soldering Haloalkane BASF Sulfuric acid Wok Extreme Programming Turquoise Skin Comanche Poker jargon Hydrogen peroxide Diamond Tanning Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Shoe Clinker (boat building) Chair Nail (anatomy) Seismic retrofit Petroleum Color theory 2000 Australian Grand Prix Motor oil Disc brake Wood carving Keynesian economics Chromium Cheese Nine Inch Nails Industrial wastewater treatment Theory of conduct Bong Computer virus Pastel Fire extinguisher Brazing Textile manufacturing terminology Tire

what's an easy way to clean a nice leather jacket you need to use a good quality water based foam leather cleaner do not use anything containing oils waxes or silicones most 'conditioners' contain waxes or oils and furniture polish contains silicones baby wipes are the worst thing you can use as they will destroy the finish on your leather they are very strong alkiline cleaners to neutralise urine acid on babys skin so they are not the right thing to use on leather saddle soap is too harsh a lot of leather wipes contain chemicals which will also destroy the finish or leave residues on the leather which will damage it fairy liquid or washing detergents contain more salt these days to get dishes clean and this will break the finish down on your leather this has been verified by the manufacturers as with the baby wipes you should also follow cleaning with a good water based leather protector which will act like a 'scotchgard' and inhibit dirt and stains from being absorbed and make cleaning easier the next time dry leather needs rehydrating with water and oils and waxes should not be used as the natural oils do not dry out of leather wiping over with a damp cloth regularly will help to do this it is important to maintain a regular cleaning regime cleaning dirt off the surface regularly and inhibiting the absorption of body oils into the leather with a protector is the best way of doing this the alternative is a brand new product on the market called lazy leather this is the latest technology in cleaning and combines an effective cleaner with a protector it is quick and easy to use and should be used as a maintenance product once your suite has been cleaned or from new if you have just bought it leather should only shine if it was shiny to start with adding a shine means you are adding something to the surface which could damage it in the long term if it has lost its shine then it has lost its top finish which will need repalcing source s www lttsolutions net leather care consultants to the furniture and cleaning industries  Dry cleaning Upholstery Leather Soap Shampoo Motor oil Sulfuric acid Mattress Shoe polish Plastic Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Casting Manicure Car washing techniques Hydrochloric acid Clothing Psoriasis Strap-on dildo Fire extinguisher Sewage treatment Tofu Detergent Glycerin Menstrual cup Energy development Vacuum cleaner Hydrogen peroxide Hemp Pottery Thermal power station Laundry detergent Coal Wok Solar power Ammonia Petroleum Water (molecule) Violin Veganism Gilding Hamster Vinegar Jute Fire fighting Procter & Gamble Washing machine Citric acid Japanese toilet Paint Peanut Acne Corrosion Skin Knife Biodiesel Welding Tanning Diving suit Lionel Corporation Urinary incontinence Smoke-screen Contact lens Dairy Tattoo Sodium hypochlorite Oil refinery Carbon dioxide Printed circuit board Sodium sulfate Nuclear fallout Industrial wastewater treatment First aid Chromium Characters in the Smurfs Hat Carbon dioxide sink Haloalkane Future energy development Alcohol fuel Kimberly-Clark Corporation Solvent Eczema Gas metal arc welding Gramophone record Berkshire Hathaway Nuclear weapon design Cast iron Soap bubble Hydrogen chloride Glass Laundry

gritty bathtub stains my bathtub has recently started getting a gritty buildup mostly on the bottom of the tub but a little on the sides as well it just looks like regular staining but when i try to scrub it it feels hard and does not rub off easily at all even with mr clean magic eraser that works on virtually everything anybody know what this is and what works to get rid of it btw this is an old porcelain type tub not one of the new plastic ones careful that you don't ruin the finish on your tub if you scrub with anything that takes the finish off you will always have a tub that holds the dirt and is very difficult to clean try clr it should remove any kind of dirt or calcium lime and rust build up if that doesn't work you will need to resort to more serious measures use ajax or comet powder and a kitchen scrub pad wet the tub first apply the powder to the scrub pad then scrub the tub in small areas at a time get into the tub sit on the edge and you will have less muscle strain good luck remember we're all in this together except for the people who don't have a tub  Upholstery Mattress Casting Dishwasher Drill bit Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan Urinary incontinence Laundry Knife Wok Strap-on dildo Cast iron Sterilization (microbiology) Fecal incontinence Swimming pool Bong Top-bar hive Soldering Dishwashing Snowboarding Internal ballistics Motor oil Laundry detergent Violin Shampoo Illegal drug trade Japanese tea ceremony Woodworking Hard water Piccolo Junior Saga Plastic Chair Fire extinguisher Glass Paint Lionel Corporation Dialysis Cookware and bakeware Equine conformation Bathing M16 (rifle) Social rule Manicure Handloading Time Out of Mind Scrubber Bicycle Dry cleaning Menstrual cup Siegfried Line Sauna Hot tub The Inside Coriolis effect Phosphoric acid Brush Diseases of the honeybee Flue gas desulfurization Jackass: The Movie Dairy Plaster Termina Lawn mower Tofu Gilding Mouse (computing) Japanese toilet Water purification Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cubic zirconia Glossary of climbing terms Car washing techniques Brewery Toilet Diving Drawing Vitreous enamel The Legend of Zelda series enemies Kitchen Rifle Surveillance TLC Ren and Stimpy Mortar (masonry) Sodium hypochlorite Theory of conduct Computer virus Tattoo Thermal power station Residual-current device 2000 Australian Grand Prix Explosive material Skiing Electrical wiring Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vacuum cleaner

any organization tips please okay school starts in exactly two weeks and my office and bedroom are both complete disasters i'm usually an organized person but with all the new text books and clothes everything's beginning to cram i've already gotten rid of some stuff i don't need and sold it on ebay any other ideas on how to organize it all i'd like to start the new year fresh what i have been dying to do in my house is take it one room at a time completely empty everything in the room except large furnature items that you know will be staying in there put it all in another room and pick through the stuff only put back the stuff in the room that is necessary in there what you have left over decide if it can go somewhere else in your house if not then pitch it sell it give it away whatever that's if you actually have time to do that it could take a few days but it would be worth it in the end as far as school organization i bought a cubbie hole furniture piece from walmart for only like i use it for my kids toys but it would be great to organize backpacks books school supplies etc my cubbie unit comes with cubes in it depending on how many kids you have give them a certain number of cubes to put their things in they also sell great closet organizers that have the days of the week marked on them i am thinking of getting one for my daughter this year when she starts school this way on sunday i can put each day's outfit in the slot and cut down on time in the mornings by picking out clothes if your kids are old enough to pick out their own clothes to put in the slots that works even better if you start with a clean house it's easier to keep it organized so give your house a good cleaning and encourage your kids to put the things in appropriate places so they know where it is for the next day  Blankets (graphic novel) Animal Crossing Aerial (dance move) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hamster Japanese tea ceremony 1957 World Series The Apprentice 2 Hilary Duff Wal-Mart Cube (film) RuneScape quests Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Columbine High School massacre Strap-on dildo Topps Upholstery Social rule The Inside Textile manufacturing Wilton House Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog training Harrow School Fischer Random Chess Amazon.com 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ocean's Twelve Winning Streak Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Cruising (maritime) Drill bit The Dalek Invasion of Earth Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Star Wars Holiday Special Kitchen Clothing Hey Jude MapleStory Soap opera The Marriage of Figaro Magic (illusion) USS Vestal (AR-4) Extreme Programming Getting Things Done Vegeta KTVK Small Soldiers The Brady Bunch Bulk vending GED The Amazing Race The Catcher in the Rye Fancy rat Emergency preparedness Neopets RuneScape locations Cleveland Browns Floppy disk Trapped in the Closet EastEnders The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fecal incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Empire Burlesque Changeroom Beavis and Butt-head James Hanratty Planet Waves Tofu The Apprentice 3 Internet fraud Kodocha Silent Night, Deadly Night Lionel Corporation $ale of the Century Theory of conduct USS Waters (DD-115) Bong Billy the Kid Chess strategy and tactics Anderson Cooper Shaggy dog story Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Chopsticks Hash table Philip J.

how do i clean a raw silk lamp shade i have a lovely large eames lamp and the shade is beige raw silk but is is generally dirty i dont want to wash it as it may get water marks or shrink or something what to do it is a vintage lamp and i think the person who owned it before me was a smoker as i think it has nicotine all over it i have several silk lampshades and here is how i clean them first use the brush attachment to vacuum off any dirt dust and hair that has collected on the shade you cannot use any product that is liquid based or you will get water marks if the shade is small enough you can place it in a bag filled with salt and use it to scrub the shade to generally clean it and leave it in the bag for a couple of days to absorb odors and dust if it is very large you can use dry carpet cleaning granules like those made by resolve capture tech or chem dry carefully agitate the dry cleaning granules on the shade being careful not to snag the natural texture of the silk use a very large box to capture the excess granules or do double duty like i do and do it over carpet or upholstery that also needs cleaning if you do the latter agitate then let it dry on the carpet or upholstery and vacuum it up  Upholstery Vacuum cleaner Carpet Mattress Bong Opportunity rover Jute Hydroponics Car washing techniques Plastic Tofu Coffee Soap Casting Tobacco Textile manufacturing Nuclear fallout Lighting Solar power Skin Car wash Pottery Sugar beet Textile manufacturing terminology Dairy Roomba Leather Soldering Instant coffee Polyurethane Silk Wool Top-bar hive Kerosene lamp Hamster Tea Drawing Japanese tea ceremony Hand washing Spider Fishing Laundry Dialysis Thermal power station Vacuum Japanese toilet Menstrual cup Hat Dust Brush Tanning Dishwashing Brewery Angling Ice core Wound Manicure First aid Textile Movie projector Ammonia Sugarcane Autonomous building Illegal drug trade Cigarette Food preservation Shampoo Cigar Gilding Cleanliness Yerba mate Radio controlled car Cheese Fan (implement) Glossary of wildland fire terms Kirby Corporation Honey Collecting fossils Clothing Tattoo Leaf Laundry detergent Soy protein Genericized trademark Lionel Corporation Gelatin Haloalkane Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carnivorous plant Rebreather Psoriasis Incandescent light bulb Siphon Photoelectric effect Ozone Wound healing phases Glaze Microfiber

natural cleaning methods i have a lot of respiratory issues and household cleaning products really bother me i'm trying to find natural ways of cleaning my home without buying all those expensive green products any tips white vinegar mildly acidic white vinegar dissolves dirt soap scum and hard water deposits from smooth surfaces yet is gentle enough to use in solution to clean hardwood flooring white vinegar is a natural deodorizer absorbing odors instead of covering them up and no your bathroom won't smell like a salad any vinegar aroma disappears when dry with no coloring agents white vinegar won't stain grout on tiled surfaces because it cuts detergent residue white vinegar makes a great fabric softener substitute for families with sensitive skin try these recipes to harness the cleaning power of white vinegar homemade spray cleaner recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup white vinegar cup water in the kitchen use vinegar and water spray to clean countertops lightly soiled range surfaces and backsplash areas in the bathroom use vinegar spray cleaner to clean countertops floors and exterior surfaces of the toilet for really tough bathroom surfaces such as shower walls pump up the cleaning power by removing the sprayer element and heating the solution in the microwave until barely hot spray shower walls with the warmed generously allow to stand for to minutes then scrub and rinse the heat helps soften stubborn soap scum and loosens hard water deposits undiluted white vinegar undiluted white vinegar straight from the jug makes quick work of tougher cleaning problems involving hard water deposits or soap scum use undiluted white vinegar to scrub the inside of the toilet bowl before you begin dump a bucket of water into the toilet to force water out of the bowl and allow access to the sides pour undiluted white vinegar around the bowl and scrub with a toilet brush to remove stains and odor use a pumice stone to remove any remaining hard water rings clean shower heads that have been clogged with mineral deposits with undiluted white vinegar place to cup vinegar in a plastic food storage bag and secure the bag to the shower head with a rubber band let stand for hours to overnight then rinse and buff the fixture to a shiny finish add one cup of undiluted white vinegar to the laundry rinse cycle instead of commercial fabric softener white vinegar softens clothes and cuts detergent residue a plus for family members with sensitive skin baking soda baking soda's mild abrasive action and natural deodorizing properties make it a powerful replacement for harsh commercial scouring powders put baking soda to work in your organized home sprinkle baking soda onto a damp sponge to tackle grimy bathtub rings scour vanities or remove food deposits from the kitchen sink for tougher grime make a paste of baking soda and water apply to the tub or sink and allow to stand for to minutes dirt soap scum and deposits soften and are easier to remove slow running drains keep bathroom drains running freely by pouring to cup baking soda into the drain and dribbling just enough hot water to wash the solution down let stand for hours to overnight then flush thoroughly with hot water the deodorizing effect is an added bonus do not use this method on blocked drains rubbing alcohol rubbing isopropyl alcohol provides the base for an evaporating cleaner to rival commercial window and glass cleaning solutions use this glass cleaning spray recipe for windows mirrors chrome fixtures and for a shiny finish on hard surface ceramic tiles homemade glass cleaner recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup rubbing isopropyl alcohol cup water tablespoon white vinegar ammonia a strong alkaline solution clear non sudsing ammonia creates stronger window and all purpose cleaning recipes than acidic vinegar choose non sudsing varieties of household ammonia for these cleaning recipes suds may look like they're working but they're tough to rinse and remove try these formulations for spring cleaning or tough chores strong glass cleaner recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup rubbing isopropyl alcohol cup water tablespoon clear non sudsing ammonia strong all purpose recipe mix in a sprayer bottle t clear non sudsing ammonia t clear laundry detergent cups water furniture polish most of us no longer use hard to apply furniture wax but rely on oil based polish to keep furniture protected and shiny our salad dressing version avoids the danger of silicone oil found in most commercial polishes and sprays silicone oil can penetrate tiny cracks in furniture finish and enter the wood causing problems in the event refinishing is needed lemon juice dissolves dirt and smudges while olive oil shines and protects the wood furniture polish recipe mix in a sprayer bottle cup olive oil cup lemon juice shake well and apply a small amount to a flannel cleaning rag or cleaning cloth spread evenly over furniture surface turn cloth to a dry side and polish dry  Beer Hemp Coal

is it safe to use laundry dye on my screen tees http www hottopic com hottopic store product jsp folder c efolder id product c eprd id bmuid is it safe to use laundry die on this shirt along with my other screen tees you can re dye screened tees but you may find that the dye will also go in between small spaces left inside the screened design this is especially true if the t shirt is an older one and the screened design is cracked or thin please note the suggestions i'm giving are for dying fabric the same color or very close to the original color trying to change a fabric's color completely is more involved for instance you can dye an orange shirt red but you can't make it yellow if the shirt is black it's got to stay black you can redye the shirt and protect the design in two ways take a q tip dip into a bit of dye and put a small dab on a tiny part of the design to test let it sit for ten minutes or so the dye should wipe away with a damp cloth leaving the design clean put something between the layers of the t shirt so the dye doesn't get on the back of the shirt if you want to make sure the dye doesn't adhere to the design cover the design with a resist this involves patience and a steady hand because you'll be painting the resist over the design ensuring that no dye will seep in common resists are waxes or gutta i would use gutta because it's easier to work with and you don't have to heat it make sure you test the gutta to see if it dissolves the paint though again test a tiny area if you use this method be sure to put something behind the design so you don't have any bleeding through the fabric you can buy clear gutta from dharma trading company online they can also answer questions you may have sounds like a lot of work huh it is rit dye costs about per package gutta will also run five or six bucks if you're not happy with the shirt's color it might be easier and just about as cheap to buy a new one personally i would skip trying the resist and just dye the shirt after testing an area good luck  Plastic Casting Upholstery Textile manufacturing Printed circuit board Pysanka Light-emitting diode Undergarment Floppy disk Inkjet printer Batik Compact disc Welding Tattoo Wind turbine Color Paint Paintball Cochineal Solar cell Condom B-47 Stratojet Paul Is Dead Kimono Chromium Integrated circuit Christmas tree Leather Circuit design Aluminium Technicolor Extreme Programming Electrophysiology Textile manufacturing terminology Strap-on dildo JavaServer Pages Internal ballistics The Warriors Clothing CPU design Poker jargon Traditional animation Seismic retrofit Aerial (dance move) Staining (biology) Printmaking Titanium Shirt M16 (rifle) Windows 2000 Animal Crossing Parachute Brewery Knife Equine conformation Mattress Dairy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act DVD Social rule Tag T-shirt CD-R MP3 Bong Tie-dye Weaving Curling Top-bar hive Diseases of the honeybee Dry cleaning Indigo dye Sento Leaf Pottery Wood carving Illegal drug trade Diamond enhancement Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Glossary of American football Menstrual cup Ironing Chicago White Sox Typewriter Fire fighting Oxyacetylene Doctor (Doctor Who)

did i open pandora's box i have always worn pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office needless to say with me dressing that way my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity about it as i was getting ready for work one day i asked him what the fascination was and he told me that he found it alluring and sensual when i wear pantyhose and that he was curious to experience that feeling so i hiked up my skirt eased out of my sheers handed them to him and told him to slip them on i let him keep them on for a few minutes and he went absolutely crazy over the way they felt which i thought was kind of neat now hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again i don't want to deny it to him because of how fascinated he is and how much he liked it that one time i'm thinking if i can limit it to a few minutes around the time we go to bed we could have fun with it was i wrong to do this how should i handle this i totally agree with endless cherish this there are unfortunately far too many perfectly straight men with wives and children and corporate jobs just like they're supposed to who have an interest that deviates from the norm and it kills them because they don't have anyone in their lives they can trust enough to confide in your husband is very lucky to have you as someone he can truly talk to i would recommend that you two take some time together and explore this send the kids away go to a hotel whatever you have to so you two can be alone play then take some pillow time together and give yourself a chance to get comfortable of course it's going to be strange at first but your relationship will only be stronger for the exploration and who knows you may end up learning a few things about yourself that you didn't even think could happen best of luck  Milton H.

why do my towels never smell clean they seem to always have that musty wet smell to them i wash them every couple days with soap and liquid fabric softner but they never really seem to smell clean they are hung to dry after every use and not piled on the floor wet so i don't get why they'd smell bad mold can grow on your towels very fast even if you hang them to dry right away if the area is humid they will stay damp just long enough for the mold to infest the best way to kill the mold is to bleach the towels if they are colored you can still use bleach but make sure it is highly diluted fill the machine add in cup of bleach then add the towels by making sure the bleach is evenly dispersed in the water you'll avoid those yellowish white bleach spots they may fade slightly but it's worth it to kill the mold even if the mold is dead the smell might remain if so add a cup of baking soda the next time you wash them they'll freshen right up  Menstrual cup Casting Upholstery Dishwashing Textile manufacturing Laundry detergent Washing machine Sauna Diaper Paper Hydrogen peroxide Vinegar Common cold Dry cleaning Japanese toilet Tea Water purification Hand washing Wok Halitosis Sento Menstrual cycle Towel Paper towel Hyperthermia Manicure Skunk Plaster Chocolate Dishwasher Cheese Sugar Glass Laundry Sand casting Bong Soap Car washing techniques Detergent Cannabis cultivation Linen Ammonia Sodium hypochlorite Compost Flour Hamster Organic peroxide Plastic Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Sulfuric acid Cocoa Fire fighting Mattress Sushi Disinfection Tofu Wheat Polyurethane Tattoo Concrete Sugarcane Dairy Sodium hydroxide Ultramarine Sodium percarbonate Gilding Houseplant Hemp Gypsy moth Diseases of the honeybee Bromine Polyethylene terephthalate Hebburn Bread Fire extinguisher Typewriter Spotted Skunk Fecal incontinence Carbon fiber Comfrey Thermal power station Polar Bear Procter & Gamble Weaving Diving suit Champagne (beverage) Brewery Water Bacon Vanilla Urinal Vermicompost Egg (food) Seismic retrofit Cruising (maritime) Glycerin

does the fabric conditioner enter the machine on the rinse cycle my machine's been taking it before the rinse cycle and my clothes are hard so i've had to do a main wash and let it run thru until the spin and then i restart it on rinse with the fabric cond and then spin it's an old machine but we're renting yeah i've been putting it in the right compartment but it's taking the conditioner too early during the wash stage so i now have to let the wash go all the way thru and then when it's stopped i add the condition to the right part and then put it on rinse and spin unfortunately our landlords told us when we moved in that we would have to buy a new machine and take it with us when we move because they don't want to pay for repairs or replacement it's in our contract so we might end up buying a new one but it works for now because i know how it operates lol if you use a downy ball you won't have to run back to the washer to catch the rinse cycle you put the downy ball containing fabric softener in at the beginning of the wash cycle and when the first spin cycle stops the action releases the fabric softener from the downy ball so it dispensed just in time for the rinse cycle so simple the downy balls cost about or less than  Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Dry cleaning Fast bowling Procter & Gamble CPU design RISC Electrophysiology Laws of cricket Digital circuit Volleyball Laundry detergent Fossil fuel power plant Dairy Aerial (dance move) Tag Football (soccer) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Rugby union Soap Upholstery Wheel of Fortune Laundry Embedded system Pinball Tire CPU cache Sento Thermal power station IPod Four square Lathe Types of bowlers in cricket Glossary of American football Detergent Cray-1 Billiards Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Hybrid vehicle Hard water Winning Streak Fabrication (metal) English cricket team Tenshinhan Skateboarding trick Battle of Plattsburgh Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sewing machine Classic RISC pipeline The Price Is Right Charles O.

cleaning tiles and laminate floors help i have tiles and laminate floors in my house i used to use a generic spray floor cleaner on them but i've just found out it must the cause of film on them i could constantly see footprints and it was driving me crazy i read on here to use water and vinegar to clean them instead which i have done but as soon as someone takes one step onto either the tiles or laminate you can still see that footprint mark on them i'm going insane with this because it is like i can never get them to look shiny and clean please help surely there must be a solution i've had this problem with my laminates too after mopping several times with vinegar and very hot water you should notice it getting better but as one poster suggested buffing the floor helps remove the film quicker i've used a couple of old towels and skated around on the floor to help remove the film or if you have children make a game out of it and pull them around the house on an old comforter or quilt it will help remove whatever residue is still on the floor and should help with the footprints  Sento Mattress Menstrual cup Upholstery Bulk vending Drill bit Psychiatric hospital Dry cleaning Transformer Japanese toilet Table saw Squash (sport) Dialysis Brewery Japanese tea ceremony Drag racing Wok Sewage treatment Sulfuric acid The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Ron Weasley Fecal incontinence Dishwasher Carpet Dishwashing Basement Diving suit Manicure Energy development The Shining (film) Tattoo Urinary incontinence Randomness Fire fighting Kitchen Opportunity rover Irrigation Mach kernel Reservoir Dogs Asbestos Printed circuit board Jackass: The Movie Seismic retrofit Contact lens Escape from New York Hyperthermia Dundas Square Sauna Ice resurfacer Super Nintendo Entertainment System World War Three (Doctor Who) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Sharon Tate Saw II Blood Simple Ra (board game) Toilet paper Soldering Parquetry Sanitary towel Tile Equine conformation Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Volleyball Space Shuttle program Bathroom Electric motor Scottish Parliament Building Manhunt (video game) Adam's Peak Solar power Mahjong Nacre Gilding Otitis externa Bow (weapon) The Sims 2 Hard disk The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Aerial (dance move) Graffiti Taikyoku shogi Oswald Mosley Diseases of the honeybee Trace fossil Swingout Mosaic Hydrogen peroxide Impact crater Finders Keepers Collision detection Acquire Washing machine Little Britain Roof Domestic water system Wallpaper Caving

is it normal to do laundry every other day we're a family of and it can be very depressing i've a family of we do it twice a week midweek for clothes and weekend for linens and clothes you might want to use your towels for more than one day if you hang them up promptly and let them dry you can get up to a week out of them same with bed linens it is actually depressing to do laundry so many times and not efficient because you're not doing full loads but you're taking all of the time energy with a half washer and half dryer load another trick i'll bet there are people in your family who put perfectly clean clothes in the hamper because they decided not to wear it and it was easier to put in the hamper than fold back up hey i've got kids i know what i'm talking about what i did for weeks was keep track of what they wore and then put the non dirty stuff back in their drawer without washing it it was a bit rank from being in with the clean clothes and they were warned that mom wouldn't wash clean clothes twice whether they were in the hamper or not  Washing machine Textile manufacturing Diaper Upholstery Laundry Hey Jude Social rule Hemp Sento Linen Laundromat Textile manufacturing terminology Menstrual cup Japanese tea ceremony Dry cleaning Mattress Characters in the Smurfs South Park Bedbug Washboard Clothing About a Boy Menstrual cycle Urticaria Tattoo The Family from One End Street Sewage treatment Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Empire Burlesque Hey Arnold!

good wooden floor cleaner anybody knows an easy way to clean the wooden floor of the kitchen sometimes even if you use mop it still leaves some stains behind i want something easy to wipe that stains out wood floor maintenance most wood floors can be kept clean by first sweeping or vacuuming with a floor nozzle to remove most of the surface dust and dirt then damp mopping with clear water dip a sponge in clear water squeezing it out so that the mop is barely damp almost dry use very little water and rinse your mop thoroughly after each use since excess water can dissolve protective coatings alter the color of the wood and raise the grain to roughen the surface if your floors are not dirty enough to need mopping every week then you should not do it as it will wear the floors faster not to mention waste your time simply sweeping is often all they need if need to restore the shine to your wood floor after you get it clean try damp mopping it with cup vinegar and tablespoons furniture polish in a gallon of warm water vinegar is also useful for removing any soap residue or build up but should not be necessary every week  Vacuum cleaner Vinegar Upholstery Dry cleaning Brewery Menstrual cup Soap Car washing techniques Dishwasher Wok Dishwashing Casting Manicure Wood Diving suit Gilding Textile manufacturing Mattress Violin Soldering Kitchen Japanese toilet Fire extinguisher Lighting Drill bit Coffee Hamster Carpet Bong Carburetor Sento Soap bubble Printmaking Wood carving Motorcycle Japanese tea ceremony Home repair Plastic Friction Seismic retrofit Naval mine Phosphoric acid Japanese cuisine Sewage treatment Sulfuric acid Paint Hat Compost Primer (paint) Tattoo Houseplant Vacuum Pottery Fan (implement) Comanche Toilet paper Laundry detergent Deforestation Tobacco Tea Diseases of the honeybee Wind turbine Hemp Hard disk Lacquer Irrigation Dundas Square Cast iron Sodium hypochlorite Fire fighting Chopsticks Jewish cuisine Printed circuit board Cleanliness Laundry Barbecue Roomba Dialysis Cuisine of the Philippines Strap-on dildo Domestic rabbit Brazing Vermicompost Tooth enamel Ice resurfacer Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Oscilloscope Shroud of Turin Motor oil M16 (rifle) Haggis Fossil fuel power plant McMansion Bulk vending

does anyone know how to get urine stains and smell out of furniture here is four ideas to help you get started one if the urine has actually soaked into the couch upholstery you're pretty much out of luck because you'll never get deep enough to get it for surface cleaning vinegar and water is the best never use ammonia ammonia is a component of urine and it will just encourage the animal to reuse the same spot two spray it with hydrogen peroxide let dry repeat if needed three simply try some baking soda it seems to do the trick just sprinkle on let sit overnight and vacuum up four get an enzymatic cleaner urine gone nature's miracle etc walmart has a couple of versions just make sure it says somewhere on the bottle that it has enzymes then the trick is to totally saturate the area and let air dry don't add cleaner dilute it w water or add any other substance you have to leave it alone to let the enzyme action work and if the area was previously treated w some other type of cleaner you may have to do several applications you can buy urine gone w a black light that will light up the urine areas in the dark it works well as long as the area is still lighting up keep applying the enzymatic cleaner once the area no longer lights up you can go back over it w cleaner if needed the urine gone can discolor carpets where sprayed but the spots come out completely w regular steam cleaning after the enzymatic cleaner had done it's work to check out technique go to planet urine http www planeturine com dsp furnitureupholstery cfm you can find more suggestions where these were found at thriftyfun com http www thriftyfun com tf tip html  Vacuum cleaner Upholstery Enzyme Vinegar Contact lens Mattress Coal Sodium hypochlorite Laundry detergent Ultraviolet Water (molecule) Brewery Copper Dry cleaning Biochemistry World Wide Web Vacuum Acetic acid Hamster Drill bit Japanese toilet Urine Carpet Advertising Autonomous building Bread Disinfection Hydrogen economy Urinal Casting Water Mass spectrometry Tooth enamel Food preservation Dairy Sulfuric acid Skunk Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Carbon dioxide Cannabis cultivation Glossary of firefighting equipment Coffee Solar power Urinary incontinence Ocean thermal energy conversion Paint Textile manufacturing Tattoo Sewage treatment Manicure HyperText Transfer Protocol Plastic Dishwasher Glass Sodium hydroxide Western blot XML Fossil fuel power plant Cocaine Thermal power station Vitamin C Tofu Sterilization (microbiology) Natural gas Tea Toilet Wood Energy development Hydrogen Mouth ulcer Organic peroxide Explosive material Protein Gas metal arc welding Phosphorus Leather Hydrochloric acid Hypoglycemia Cuisine of Denmark Iron Hair coloring Chemoluminescence Psoriasis Rebreather Bacteria Toilet humour Cyclodextrin Horseshoe Molecular biology Toothpaste Marine aquarium

what is the best way when washing towells to keep them soft i find my towells seem to lose their softness after a few washes even though i use a fabric softener fabric softener may make for soft towels but they lose a huge amont of their absorbency adding fabric softner to the wash cycle or in the dryer is like waxing your towels also too many washer 'rinse' cycles don't adequately rinse towels try putting a few freshly washed towels back into the washer add water and agitate the load for a minute or two likely you'll find a fair amount of detergent foam on the water's surface try washing your towels by putting them through a normal wash cycle w laundry detergent then after the load is allegedly lol done reset the washer to put 'em through a second full cycle without detergent and no fabric softener instead add cups of white vinegar to the first wash cycle after the load is done dry your towels without adding a fabric softener sheet they'll be fluffy and absorbent and really clean washed like this your towels will last longer smell better and do a much better job of both absorbing water and drying on the towel rack than when normally washed hope this helps tx griff  Laundry detergent Dishwasher Upholstery Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing Detergent Manicure Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Mattress Casting Soap Sento Laundry Vinegar Diaper Procter & Gamble Plastic Sauna Urticaria Hard water Hand washing Menstrual cycle Wok Motor oil Citric acid Dairy Sewage treatment Hat Carbon dioxide Western blot Seismic retrofit Hydrogen peroxide Thermal power station Japanese toilet Sodium hydroxide Fecal incontinence Rice Textile manufacturing terminology Fossil fuel power plant Tofu Cheese Weaving Sodium hypochlorite Soap bubble RISC Toilet Eczema Dialysis Water Tide Industrial wastewater treatment Laundromat Halitosis Batik Glass Electrophysiology Coffee CPU design Paper towel Sanitary towel Water purification Mouth ulcer Sodium carbonate Tattoo Phosphorus Internal ballistics Sushi Massage Diving suit Gilding Instant coffee Solar cell Textile Feet washing Vulvovaginal health Shaving Ironing Polyethylene terephthalate Glossary of firefighting equipment Yerba mate Contact lens Strap-on dildo Steel Climbing equipment Disc brake Psoriasis Fluoride therapy Cast iron Top-bar hive Sulfur

ink off a white leather couch i really need ink off my white leather couch real leather from as ball point pen how this really depends on what type of leather it is if it is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an ink stick the fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it it is a good idea to have one in your house if you have a pale leather and children you should also be using a good quality leather protector on your suite this will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off if an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts using hairspray is very risky ait but can make the matter far worse as it can spread the ink over a bigger area especially on an aniline style leather and can sometimes then be impossible to fix nail varnish remover or any other solvents will remove the finish and pigment which will need replacing do not use baby wipes as they are about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it please do not try milk it is a silly idea that this will work and will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish if the ink is on an aniline style there is nothing that will remove it because the ink will have re dyed the leather it may dissipate over time with cleaning and protecting old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish this is probably best left to the experts silicones furniture polish are the worst thing to use on leather as they will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather and will eventually break all the finish down and make it crack leather needs water and should not be protected against it leather does not need conditioning it needs cleaning and protecting on a regular basis with water based products this will keep it rehydrated and supple oils will make things much worse leather should be cleaned gently not scrubbed so 'elbow grease' will only do damage to the finish nail varnish remover solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather source s http www lttsolutions net leather care consultnts to the furniture and cleaning industries  Paint Leather Dry cleaning Knife Plastic Drawing Ink Pottery Manicure Varnish Printed circuit board Tattoo Inkjet printer Vulcanization Textile manufacturing Strap-on dildo Brush Tooth Welding Cross-country skiing Water (molecule) Biodiesel Drill bit Violin Dairy Corrosion Woodworking Solvent Mattress Perfume Brewery Wood Lacquer Aniline Shoe polish Water Color theory Fecal incontinence Sewage treatment Tofu Soldering Diving suit Casting Benzene Explosive material Coffee Shampoo Inflation Volleyball Aluminium Concentration Seismic retrofit Bullet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Haloalkane BASF Sulfuric acid Wok Cheese Extreme Programming Turquoise Motor oil Fast bowling Cast iron Dye Tanning Shoe Typewriter Poker jargon Diamond Brazing Fluoride therapy Softball Clinker (boat building) Petroleum Chair Theory of conduct Chromium Disc brake Wood carving Keynesian economics Nine Inch Nails Humphrey Bogart Industrial wastewater treatment Laser engraving Bong Stucco

what is the best way to clean floorboards mop vacuum cleaner if you're talking about hardwood floors the best way to clean them is to make a daily sweep with a dust mop it's important to keep the floor clean so that the finish won't get scratched on days that i vacuum my rugs i use the vacuum attachment made for bare floors to vacuum the hardwood floors around the rugs you'll need to occasionally damp mop your hardwood floors i recommend buying a cleaning solution specifically made for hardwood floors make sure you rinse your floor if the label says to do it you'll create build up that will eventually dull your floor if you are supposed to rinse and don't do it if you are talking about wood molding or shoe molding the best way to keep them clean is to use the duster attachment of your vacuum if the dust is damp or is built up over time use a cloth dampened with a solution of parts water to part vinegar you'll have to be on your hands and knees to use the cloth but once you've had to do it on your hands and knees you'll be able to vacuum the wood molding each time you get your vacuum out to do your rugs it will keep the dust from building up and keep your house less dusty this is particularly important if you are allergic to dust which tends to hide out at the corners of every room  Vacuum cleaner Carpet Vinegar Soap Dust Hay fever Vacuum Casting Aerial (dance move) Sento Drill bit House dust mite Mattress Japanese tea ceremony Menstrual cup Hard disk Carbon fiber Roomba Japanese toilet Fire fighting Hamster Body piercing Wood Car washing techniques Basement Contact lens Polyurethane Brewery Dairy Violin Plaster Chair Hardwood Punt (boat) Allergy Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling aerial techniques Textile manufacturing Seismic retrofit Chatsworth House Hat Plastic Stairway Naval mine Tattoo Dishwasher Hiking Citric acid Bulk vending Kirby Corporation Cheese Gilding Woodworking The Young Ones (TV series) Casualty lifting Billiards Shoe Exact solutions in general relativity Glass Knife Bethalto, Illinois Dry cleaning McMansion Plywood Dishwashing Oscilloscope Professional wrestling throws Home repair The Parting of the Ways Professional wrestling attacks Clothing Timber framing Perfect Dark Professional wrestling match types Gypsy moth Cleanliness Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Kitchen Fecal incontinence Alanis Morissette Fancy rat Model aircraft Sesshomaru Molding (decorative) Diving The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Printmaking Carburetor Gaia Online Phonograph Clarinet Changeroom Transistor King George V School Cello Laser printer Softball The Hoover Company Air purifier

what is the best detergent for washing clothes and why i use liquid tide and it seems to gray things and the colors are dull it sounds like you have hard water there are water softeners you can add to your wash like calgon for instance or borax you can also add cup baking soda to any wash there are some detergents that claim they work well in hard water you can always try one of those i happen to use all free and clear because of my allergies but when i have a hard water problem i sometimes have to wash my whites with c baking soda and c bleach add to your bleach reservoir in your washing machine or follow label directions if you don't have a bleach reservoir i don't recommend using bleach often it will eventually break down the fabric and make it yellow borax also tends to break down fabric so i wouldn't use it too often either i've used all these methods and the bleach and baking soda combination works best where i live everyone's water is different you may find that another of my ideas works best on your particular problem  Laundry detergent Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Detergent Vinegar Hydrogen peroxide Sodium percarbonate Sodium Soap Sodium hydroxide Sodium carbonate Bread Menstrual cup Borax Urticaria Plastic Dry cleaning Wood pulp Dishwashing Hard water Phosphorus Glass Carbon dioxide Casting Tooth enamel Boron Glycerin Chlorine Tea Condom Hair coloring Tide Multiple chemical sensitivity Upholstery Tattoo Soap bubble Jute Brewery E-6 process Champagne (beverage) Eczema Weaving Ice cream Cookware and bakeware Lake Laundry Procter & Gamble Bleach Gilding Dairy Ecco the Dolphin Fecal incontinence White bread Leblanc process Flour Linux Hydroponics Sugarcane Coffee Hebburn Cocaine XML Egg (food) Extreme Programming Bulk vending Henkel Experiment Siphon Illegal drug trade Titanium Tooth E number Fuzzy logic Theory of conduct Water Wood Color Wheat Pepper spray Technicolor Coir Sulfuric acid Chocolate Paint Sulfur Mattress Ultramarine Alcoholics Anonymous Textile Felt Potassium hydroxide Reservoir Dogs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Textile manufacturing terminology

do air purifiers really work i want to buy one and hear some responses any bad brands my air purifier isn't going to arrive until monday but i've read enough user opinions that i believe they do work and work well two of the very important things to consider are the size of the unit and the cost of the replacement filters you obviously want the larger units that can move all the air in the room and filter it multiple times within one hour some of the filters are incredibly expensive so before you buy any model check with the manufacture web sites and do cost comparisons they should have at least two filters in them charcoal and hepa filters  Air purifier Digital photography Hard disk Neopets Floppy disk Incandescent light bulb Censorware Water purification Air ioniser Gross domestic product Mutual fund E-mail spam Vacuum cleaner Stereoscopy Synthesizer Photography Stopping e-mail abuse NTFS CPU cache Cleanroom Water supply Mac OS X Loudspeaker Laserdisc Nintendo 64 F-16 Fighting Falcon System/36 PNG Liquid crystal display Ford Motor Company Inertial guidance system Virtual memory Python programming language Gmail Sport utility vehicle Spam (electronic) System/34 PlayStation 3 Carburetor Cascading Style Sheets E85 Leica Mach kernel Audiophile Hash table XML Computer Blog Air filter Cross site scripting Low-pass filter Bicycle lighting Fossil fuel power plant Database High-definition television Mozilla Thunderbird B3ta Extreme Programming Windows 2000 Web crawler Commodore 64 Analog-to-digital converter Steam (content delivery) Dry cleaning LiveJournal Airsoft Dairy Windows XP Comparison of web browsers Biodiesel Paracetamol RISC Mattress Motor oil IBM PC compatible S__CAM F/A-22 Raptor Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Binoculars View camera Modem Atari 8-bit family Air traffic control Intellivision RFID Syphon Filter Scale model Dialysis SCO-Linux controversies Denial-of-service attack Teletext Wayne Corporation MS-09 Dom Mozilla Application Suite Firewall (networking) Charcoal Diesel engine Thread (computer science) Redundant array of independent disks

how do you clean anti perspirant stains from underarms of cotton shirts found this on a website tried it once it's easier and less time consuming to go out and buy a new shirt toss the stained ones in the trash tips to remove antiperspirant stain we suggest diluting a half cup of ammonia with cups of water and daubing the solution on the stain repeatedly until it is lightened or removed entirely take two aspirins crush them and mix with a half cup of hot water pour directly on the stain and allow it to sit for a couple of hours baking soda add enough water to cup of baking soda to form a runny paste apply directly to the stain and work it in if the stain is particularly bad and smelly let the baking soda paste remain on the garment for a couple of hours then brush it off baking soda is very good for removing odors fresh or concentrated lemon juice you may squeeze fresh lemon juice directly on the stain until it is quite wet then add a spoonful of table salt rub between your fingers until the stain lifts this also helps remove dark underarm stains on t shirts and undershirts if it is a bright sunny day exposing the garment to the sun and allowing it to dry will enhance the stain removing power of the lemon juice meat tenderizer another one for ripley s believe it or not moisten the perspiration stain with warm water then sprinkle liberally with meat tenderizer work it is and allow it to sit for several minutes then launder as usual salt regular table or pickling salt is a miraculous ingredient in many things including household cleaners use salted water to soak stained garments mix with white vinegar for a very good stain remover use with lemon juice see tip above white vinegar mix a cup of white vinegar with cups warm water dip stained garment in vinegar solution and scrub between your knuckles if the stain is persistent you may soak the entire garment in the vinegar solution for a couple of hours before running through a normal wash cycle check the fabric label to be sure it does not need to be dry cleaned oxi clean this is a wonderful product for eliminating many clothing stains follow manufacturers directions borax this is an old time cleaning remedy that is still appropriate today plus its a whole lot cheaper than some of the costly products on the supermarket shelves run warm water through the stain then sprinkle on a generous amount of borax don t go crazy but use enough so that you can see it like a good shake of salt on the stain rub it together with your fingers and then launder as usual  Tofu Cuisine of the Philippines Textile manufacturing Bread Menstrual cup Bong Acetic acid Kosher foods Gilding Cuisine of Denmark Dairy Barbecue Plastic Upholstery Dry cleaning Ham Tea Ketchup Alum Casting Sulfuric acid Sugar beet Coffee Hot dog Idli Mattress Carbon dioxide Manicure Mouth ulcer Breakfast Bacon Mayonnaise Rum Hydrochloric acid Soft drink Cheese Ramen Clothing Cantonese cuisine Water purification Japanese cuisine Dishwasher Russian cuisine Pancake Sodium hydroxide Fish and chips Psoriasis Sodium hypochlorite Tooth Ice cream Dialysis Undergarment Tattoo Cocaine Laundry detergent Citric acid Paint Japanese tea ceremony Soy protein Thermal power station Foodborne illness Chocolate Water Sauna Potato chips Tobacco Roman eating and drinking Black pepper Volleyball Water (molecule) Soap Cuisine of Brazil Bagel Laundry Pickling Peruvian cuisine Starch Comanche Hydroponics Yerba mate Brewery Sugarcane Social aspects of clothing Perfume Toothpaste Sushi

how high up should water appear in a front loading washing machine i noticed at the laundrymat that the water does not appear at the bottom of the window it only rises just below presumably filling a basin below that the perforated washer chamber cylnder spins thru i know that they've had a problem with patrons putting in too much soap and causing an overflow i'm wondering if they are reducing the water level in the washer to combat that problem and cut down on their costs for water and hot water very cheap place i used the laundrymat today and my clothes seem to be clean and free of soap the rinse cycle is the same low water situation so maybe the washer is not designed to have water at the height of the door front loaders do not use as much water as top loaders if it is high efficiency it uses even less water the water does not come up to the window  Washing machine Dry cleaning Sento Sewage treatment Toilet Tattoo Plumbing fixture Tidal power Two-stroke cycle IPod Dam Seismic retrofit Internal ballistics Hard water Laundry Soap Wind turbine Dishwasher Bong Krag-J__rgensen Textile manufacturing Upholstery Jet engine Dairy Dishwashing Menstrual cup M16 (rifle) Spark plug Steam engine Laundromat T-64 Garbage truck Diesel engine Thermal power station Hard disk Nuclear power Tractor Clinker (boat building) Japanese tea ceremony Recumbent bicycle Fountain Energy development Four-stroke cycle Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Mattress Stirling engine Car washing techniques Library (computer science) Brewery Bicycle Motor oil Machine gun Paintball marker Electrophysiology ZX Spectrum Panama Canal Detergent Automobile Tank Wave power Virtual memory CPU cache Soap bubble Turbocharger Tide Flush toilet Equine conformation Water RISC Cruising (maritime) Fusion power T-72 Coffee Air gun Solar cell Windows XP Hydrogen economy Motorcycle Solar power Floppy disk Air conditioning Drainage Autogyro IBM PC compatible Sport utility vehicle Carburetor Rise of the Robots M60 machine gun Electric motor Wound Fire fighting Urinal Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Oscilloscope Pebble bed reactor Toyota Prius Transformer

how you do get dog pee out of the carpet help most doggie and cat stains that seep into a carpet go directly into the pad below if you pour anything on the stain it too goes directly to the pad below which yes in the case of nature's miracle will help eliminate the odor from the carpet but then you have a different worry mold and or mildew from the wet pad underneath that doesn't get quite dry from blotting a towel down on the carpet to bring up the moisture also putting more liquid on a rug that seeps into the pad below also seeps into the floor below that and can destroy maybe a beautiful hard wood floor under all that carpet and padding and if you rent this could be an expensive repair before you move out if you don't think the landlord will check all the rugs pads and underneath don't kid yourself i'd say go ahead and do the spot cleaning with nature's miracle but try to put something under the padding so more liquid won't get onto the hard floor underneath if you can't do that because it's wall to wall carpeting you may be stuck putting down a replacement patch cutting out the spot in the rug and padding and laying down an exact rug match and padding patch in it's place or just call a professional rug cleaning company but once you get it wet if you don't dry it totally right away you do run the risk of mold and or mildew or ruining a big spot on the under floor  Upholstery Carpet Fecal incontinence Mattress Wound Casting Plastic Strap-on dildo Hamster Fire fighting Basement Pottery Tag Chair Stairway Urinary incontinence Seismic retrofit Campfire Professional wrestling match types Polyurethane Wheat Wood Boxing Paper Priestly Code Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Hazing Woodworking Cheese Snoop Dogg Psoriasis Tooth enamel Sento Aerial (dance move) Glossary of partner dance terms Textile manufacturing Jute Toilet humour Mark Guglielmo Soldering Bicycle brake systems Japanese toilet Home repair Vacuum cleaner Professional wrestling holds Manual transmission Chatsworth House Naruto jutsu Bacon GunZ The Duel Shoe RuneScape quests Playoff Sauna Glossary of wildland fire terms Genericized trademark Snooker Surveillance Chocolate Ice hockey Roomba Towel Amateur telescope making Baptism Hard disk Violin Fire extinguisher Ayrton Senna Air pollution Comfrey Equine conformation Plaster Royal Rumble Treehouse of Horror V Hemp Mixed martial arts Water Cat Laws of cricket Concrete Electrophysiology Tofu Paint Xanadu House Garden Strawberry Drill bit Flea Elevator Diseases of the honeybee Menstrual cup Miracle Volleyball Tlingit Poker jargon Primer (paint) Syphon Filter Valles Marineris Polyethylene terephthalate Livestock

can i machine wash a cotton wool blend cotton and wool there is no label stating the directions you can but don't put it in the dryer since both are natural fibers and have the tendency to both shrink and become mis shapen treat them as delicately as possible use a detergent for delicates like woolite cold water and the gentlest cycle on the washer i would not allow it to go through the spin cycle either because mine has a tendency to stretch out woolens because it is so fast so i remove the garment after it goes through the rinse cycle take a very thick terry towel on which i lay the garment and gently squeeze out the excess water by rolling it i block the sweater reshape it and allow it to dry on the dryer while i do other loads turning it now and again until it is dry you can also use the dryel method of dry cleaning it in the dryer if it only needs freshening  Textile manufacturing Washing machine Dry cleaning Upholstery Textile manufacturing terminology Knitting Menstrual cup Car washing techniques Dishwasher Carding Diving suit Wok Diaper Cochineal Cashmere wool Paper Hand washing Weaving Laundry Wool Dairy Laundry detergent Mattress Soap Tea Yarn Fecal incontinence Clothing Felt Detergent Cotton Wound Towel Jute Domestic rabbit Carbon dioxide Sento Menstrual cycle Hat Leather Cannabis cultivation Industrial wastewater treatment Japanese toilet Linen Coffee Woodworking Toilet paper Urticaria Sterilization (microbiology) Ironing Tofu Manicure Sugar beet Spinning wheel Dye Coir Domesticated turkey Screw Rice Fossil fuel power plant Casting Shampoo Gilding Nitrocellulose Agar plate Gramophone record Halitosis Sewage treatment Collecting fossils Sauna Glove Earwax Professional wrestling holds Tanning Tallit Sleeping bag Hard water Electrophysiology Cotton mill Textile Tire Soy milk Sushi B-47 Stratojet Hay Utah Space elevator Shirt Hydrogen peroxide Pottery Energy development Champagne (beverage) Dialysis Gram staining Tattoo Motor oil Wood Hydrogen chloride Cellulose acetate

bed bugs i don't want them so how do i make sure i don't get them eeeewwwwwwwwww okay are we talking true bedbugs or the gross little mites that everyone is talking anout lately true bed bugs are not very common anymore they are decent size bugs easily seen and leave distinct brown marks along the seams of mattresses etc and they bite leaving itchy welts buying used sheets and bedding doesn't mean you'll have bed bugs sheets can be washed in hot water or with bleach and will be fine or they can go in a ziploc bag in the freezer for days and then washed that kills anything you may be worried about you can pick them up by bringing your pillow from home into a hotel or even putting your luggage on or near the bed in a hotel that has them if it is truly bed bugs you are worried about here is the protocol for getting rid of them keeping them away the first step in control is to eliminate the possibility of bed bugs physically climbing over a mattress or bed to feed pull the bed away from shelving or the wall and coat the legs of the bed with a band of vaseline about inches wide use effective means to prevent or exclude bed bugs from the sleeping area this could include keeping a zone around the bed bed bug free by careful examination and removal of bed bugs with a stiff brush and vacuum and by caulking cracks double sided carpet tape may be effective in trapping bed bugs and excluding them from sleeping areas rather than replacing one mattress with another that is also likely to become infested consider encasing the mattress with a bed bug tight cover bed bugs inside the cover will be unable to feed and will die out since freezing weather will kill bed bugs you may be able to place suspect furniture outdoors during the winter for a period of time to eliminate an infestation do not bring used furniture into the home unless it can be visually inspected in side and out as bed bug free that said here is some info on dust mites which are far more common follow the link and click on the dust mites bar i warn you it's gross keep in mind most info on the web is put out there by companies peddling products or devices to clean away mites so it's their job to make sure it sounds as horrible as possible in reality these mites are harmless unless you have allergies to them do not bite humans and have been around longer than us that being said read on http www technoplaz com pages pagedustmites htm whichever bugs have you skeeved out good luck and hope this helped  Diseases of the honeybee Brewery Fancy rat House dust mite Upholstery Waterbed Drill bit Floppy disk Top-bar hive Bed (furniture) Menstrual cup Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Strap-on dildo Cat Plastic Dairy Vacuum mattress RuneScape quests Pillow Textile manufacturing Mosquito Software bug First aid Gramophone record Carpet Cascading Style Sheets Dog training The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Poker jargon Hamster Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mouse (computing) Equine conformation Naruto jutsu Allergy Vacuum cleaner American and British English differences The Amber Spyglass Roomba Combine (Half-Life 2) Genericized trademark Welding Avenue Q Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of climbing terms Glossary of nautical terms Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents Insomnia Gaia Online StarCraft Secret Missions Opera (web browser) Gross domestic product Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wget Guinea pig Animal Crossing Bong Protoss Wood Urinary incontinence Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Subtle Knife RuneScape cheats Pok__mon Abilities Sluggy Freelance Tag Hemp Biological pest control Refrigerator ITunes Fecal incontinence Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Fast bowling Thermal power station Dishwasher Sento Blood Simple Kitchen Professional wrestling match types Casualty lifting Dog agility The Catcher in the Rye Berth Aluminium Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Carnivorous plant Carburetor View camera
