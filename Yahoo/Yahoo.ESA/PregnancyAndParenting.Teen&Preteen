year old girl pregnant my year old daughter announced she had been bringing a boy back to the house in the lunch times from school and having sex and now she thinks shes pregnant mortified is not the word as we have brought her up better then that anyway we told her we'd sort it got a pregnancy test and it's negative thank god what upsets me is after the first cry she doesn't seem to care or see it as a bad thing what do i do do you think she does care and is covering it up i feel like i don't know her at all yes she has afather living with her we've been married nearly twenty years and yes she knew about contreception why on earth would i have the morning after pill hanging round the house thats just an odd reply hi nicola thanks god she isn't pregnant u say and its true it is fantastic she isnt at this fragile age this can be a disaster i personally think that you handelled the situation pretty good but few good lessons are to be learnt yes u did deal with the situation well and it is very good that you kept your calm and u did not scare her she did deverve a good shake up to reality but that'a dif story by you keeping calm means she knows she has u to count on and to come to when she needs you but u i suppose just realised that do not know your daughter very well and you will need to try and have more one to one conversation try and tell her more about the risks she is taking by having unprotected sex it is a wake up call for you may be to keep a closer eye on what she is doing may be spend more valuable time interract more with her go shopping together girly pampering a movie and so on it would be a very good idea to go and speak to a specialist who can have a chat with her as it is always different when it comes from someone else rather than mum who's saying things naggs all the time but no one's hearing her it is common for the teens to behave this way it is an age thing its time to think of getting her into birth control she needs to be made realise that a mistake of this kind is enough to be made once and her life will completely change our responsability as parents is to explain to our kids all aspects acording to age but at the end of the day the choice is theirs the education is for us to give even before school does it i feel that nobody is responsible for my child's education but me as a parent and based on this if something like this situation occures at least we do not beat ourselves up that we did not do what we were supposed to do at the right time we do get sometimes too busy with work and other stuff but our priority is one kids i would just go and speak with the boy's parents so they also save their boy from making a disastruos situation that they just narrowly escaped and also speak to the school and find out y is it that she's taking time off without anybody notifying you as a parent this way they both know they are watched last but not least be strict and set up rules together with your husband so she knows who the boss is  About a Boy EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miss Saigon Theory of conduct Kodocha Milton H.

son's toilet troubles i have a son who turned in july for about the last months he has started pooing himself this does not happen everyday but i do not know what to do some people have told us to ignore him and just get on with it as he is doing it for attention but i cannot understand why it happens and why it is not happening everyday for instance we went camping with friends over the weekend friday and saturday was fine sunday he done it four times once was minutes after we cleared him up it is like he goes to the loo but does not wipe himself properly when he does go he does tell us and we check him to make sure he has wiped properly which never seems to be a problem but this is just like he cannot be botherered to go has anyone else experienced this i have an yr old boy and a yr old girl and it never happended to them can someone give me some pointers please i think your son may have some sort of bowel problem it may be that he suddenly gets the urge and isn't able to hold it in properly this could be to do with his diet or could be anxiety related but it does sound like he just isn't able to get to the toilet in time either that or he knows he needs to go but doesnt want to and is trying unsuccessfully to hold it in i'd take him to the doctor to rule out any more serious medical issues but you also need to talk to your son about this tell him to go as soon as he feels the urge and that whatever he is doing can wait if he is just doing this because he doesn't want to go to the toilet then perhaps the suggestion that his school friends would be horrified will be enough to make him change his behaviour don't embarrass him though relative had a child with similar problems at age  Urinary incontinence Milton H.

i am so concerned with what is going on with the young people or teen agers whose to blame for this it's a problem people parents teachers and everyone should be concerned about with the growing population of teen agers so is the lure to participate in fraternities or groups which is eighther good or bad influence to the teen ager it seems just merely companionship partnership or whatever it mean jto the young people they've learned to show disrespect to the elder ones and also it seems they are losing the importantce of life and how it means to be alive also they have forgotten the sacrifices of their parents for them there must be an effective approach to this to change their point of view and shift their attention to something more important a year kid a dancer was just murdered and the reason behind maybe because he belonged to another group which to me is unethical maybe someone could share his her opinion and what would be the best thing to do are their strategies that needs to be done by whom the young ones are the hope of this nation where will they be i think alot of comes from lack of parent participation working parents single parents and blended families all leave children feeling alone it was so much easier when everyone in the family had a specific role now everyone is supposed to do and be everything  Ethics New Age Teenage pregnancy Abortion debate Asperger syndrome Homeschooling Consensus decision-making Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Drama Survivalism Domestic violence Sub-Zero Second language acquisition Transactional analysis Autism rights movement Charter school Polyamory Milton H.

does the pill work for pms mood swings my boyfriends mom told me that the pill will help with my moodswings that i have during and before my period does it really help or is she just saying this because she is always worried that i will make her a grandma i am only will the pill help me and if it does will it decrease my chances of getting pregnant later in life is there any risks for taking it at my age the pill can help with moodswings and other symptoms of pms like cramps however the effects of the pill are different for everyone and you won't know if you don't try it studies have not shown that the pill decreases your chances of getting pregnant when you are older and trying to conceive although if you take it for a long time some people have found that it takes a few months for their body to have regular cycles again after they are off the pill the risks tend to be the same for younger women as for older women depending on your size it may effect you more if you are smaller whether you decide to go on the pill or not it really is a good idea to prevent pregnancy too since you are sexually active you should see an ob gyn just for an annual exam good luck and i hope this helps  Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Birth control Premenstrual stress syndrome Tocopherol Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sleep Spina bifida Endometriosis Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Antidepressant Caffeine Paroxetine Sexual abstinence Neighbours Abortion Maprotiline Abortion debate Polycystic ovary syndrome Miscarriage Hypertension Acne Breastfeeding Dysmenorrhea Haloperidol Urinary incontinence Coffee Stroke Cancer Ectopic pregnancy Clinical depression Prolactinoma Herpes simplex virus Migraine Premature birth Social rule Breast cancer Methamphetamine Isotretinoin Diazepam Stomach cancer Turner syndrome Malaria Teenage pregnancy Domestic violence EastEnders Doxepin Pelvic inflammatory disease Progesterone Human penis size Progesterone only pill Human sexual behavior Baldness treatments Toxoplasmosis Sedative Huntington's disease Antiretroviral drug Sexually-transmitted infection Sexual revolution AIDS Schizophrenia Biology and sexual orientation Alzheimer's disease Sexual intercourse Tobacco smoking Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Depo Provera Intrauterine device Colorectal cancer Chemical abortion Human papillomavirus Apollo 8 Human sexuality Paracetamol Atherosclerosis Cytomegalovirus Gonorrhoea Childbirth Milk Kodocha Friends Intelligence quotient Solar variation Psychosis Atkins Nutritional Approach

to all with ear piercings and tattoos from desparate parent my teenage girl wants to put 'stretcher' in her ear i urged her to wait until she's to do something so permanent that might hinder future job prospects however she says she wont regret getting it when she is older so i was wondering if there were people out there who have or had an ear stretcher or tattoos and do or dont they regret getting them and why thanks in advance okay i am a year old girl and i personally i like piercings and tattoos but i think that is a little drastic i wouldn't let her do it like you said it might hinder her job opportunities in the future plus if she regrets it it will be difficult and costly to undo she should at least give it a lot of thought before she gets it done no one really ever does something thinking wow i'm probably going to regret this later so obviously she doesn't think she will regret it i myself have my tragus part of the ear pierced which isn't as drastic as what your daughter wants but i still think i should have given it more thought before i got it done it was pretty spur of the moment so basically the year old girl who likes piercings and tats agrees with the mom wow this is a first haha  Earring Charmed Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 5) Naruto jutsu Body piercing Atomic Kitten Calvin and Hobbes Friends Knots Landing Characters in the Smurfs About a Boy EastEnders Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Kurt Cobain Kodocha The Death Gate Cycle YuYu Hakusho Ken Chu Little Britain Social rule Characters of Naruto Fruits Basket Body modification Nine Inch Nails Zits Series finale My Life as a Teenage Robot Stewie Griffin The Fairly OddParents Megan Griffin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Angelina Jolie Invader Zim Questionable Content The Catcher in the Rye Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow Marilyn Monroe Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kylie Minogue Time Out of Mind Karl Rove Badly Drawn Kitties God Emperor of Dune Shaggy dog story Ashlee Simpson Kevin and Kell The Human Stain Negima Recurring South Park characters Tenchi Muyo!

is anyone else concerned that kids on here in their early teens have access to questionable material it concerns me that yahoo answers does not monitor what children are able to ask and receive answers to what should their responsilbility be they could require registration of all users that required credit card authorization seems sites like myspace and facebook are all having to step up to the plate in regards to protecting minors ok britney go to bed little girl i've seen answers be really graphic and obscene even if the child asked an innocent sex related question if all answers that were given were appropriate there wouldn't be an issue well speaking for some teens i honestly think that we have questions to we want to ask we're curious just as how much you are curious as long as the questions answers are reasonable and appropriate i think it'll be fine thought i do believe that there should someone to monitor the questions and answers so it doesn't get out of hand good to show attention to this matter  Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair Abortion debate Theory of conduct British national identity card Theodicy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Consensus decision-making Adolescence Britney Spears Titans (comics) Floppy disk Singapore gay equality movement Child pornography Facebook (website) Motion picture rating system Public domain Corporate governance Liberalism GED Password Closed-circuit television Civil rights Open Directory Project Sex education 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Domain Name System Pornography Avenue Q Joke A Course In Miracles Phishing Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Serial killer Trademark Windows XP Expert system Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Deconstruction 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Automatic number plate recognition Classified information Cross site scripting Privacy Internet Relay Chat Complexity classes P and NP Internet troll Scientology beliefs and practices Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kurt Cobain E-mail spam Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sexual orientation Copy protection Jumpstart 3rd Grade Driver's license Windows 2000 Child sexuality TLC Surveillance Jeopardy!
