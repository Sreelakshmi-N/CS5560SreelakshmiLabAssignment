guitar help ok heres the deal i have been playing guitar for a few years but i only own an acoustic and a classical nylon string i am looking for a electric guitar and dont know what i want i like pretty much andy music as long as its good rocks and alternatives my faovurite arctic monkeys kooks bloc party i like the look of the epiphone gibson les pauls but im not a big fan of metal in fact i hate metal and when i youtubed les pauls i could only find people playing metal on them so the next guitar i looked at was a fender telecaster standard im not made of money but unfortunatly my parentals dont like the look of them which sucks considering theyre my funds is there a guitar for me that looks good and sounds like a tele and if not whats something i can tell my parents to convince them to let me get the tele ten points for the best answer first of all les pauls are not only metal guitars they've been around since the early 's and have been used to play every type of music a guitar has been used for the reason people use them for metal is because they have a beautiful tone long sustain and high output so you can get crunchy rhythm and searing leads the one disadvantage they have for metal is lack of easy access to the higher frets from to because the neck heel joins the body at the th fret i guess this can be a disadvantage for any type of music but especially metal since a lot of soloing uses the higher notes i use mine for everything including metal but mostly for blues jazz and rock if you are used to playing acoustic guitar a les paul would be perfect for you because it sounds great and you'd already be used to not having easy high fret access but a les paul plays like butter compared to an acoustic so you really can't go wrong with one why do you think every big name guitarist owns one even strat players like stevie ray vaughn and jimi hendrix had les pauls telecasters are also great guitars and you can get a variety of sounds from them but they don't seem to be as tonally diverse as les pauls they may have slightly better high fret access but they're used mostly for country rock and some blues because of their characteristic bright twang they were the first production model electric guitar ever then known as the broadcaster hence their classic look and feel they also play very well and they're made by fender so they are great quality by the way don't get any les paul other than a gibson at least not a cheap knock off esp makes nice copies as does prs some better quality guitar companies make ok knockoffs but the real thing is the way to go stratocasters are also very nice and very tonally diverse and they offer excellent access to the entire fretboard if you play electric guitar you must own a stratocaster because everyone whos anyone has used them on their records and they sound great they have a scale which is a bit longer than the gibson scale so your hands have to adapt to longer stretches and this also affects the tone and string bending ability the longer scaled strings are under higher tension to maintain the same pitch as shorter scaled instruments such as the les paul and consequently the strings are a little more difficult to bend on a strat but that shouldn't be a factor in your decision because your hands will just become stronger there are a ton of different strat copies out there but i would suggest just spending the extra money from the start to purchase a quality fender and avoid the knockoffs inlcuding fender's own squier this will assure that you have a good quality instrument that won't hinder your playing and you won't have to upgrade at any point you then later have the option to just pick up a different type of guitar another big decision making factor is what sound you're after because strats and teles use single coil pickups while les pauls use humbuckers single coils have more bite they're brighter sounding and they produce a little hum whereas humbuckers have a warmer sound and buck the hum so you don't have to deal with amp noise but you can always swap out your pickups later and use single coil soapbars or coil taps in place of humbuckers for a single coil sound or use a stacked humbucker in place of a single coil for a humbucking sound i've heard from other guitarists that les pauls equiped with coil taps can achieve sounds similar to a telecaster listen to some of your favorite artists and see what they play if you want to achieve something similar to that sound then get a guitar similar to what they use if you want both humbucking and single coil sounds get a fender fat strat with a humbucker in the bridge position so if i were you i would get either a les paul or a stratocaster les paul would be my first choice because that's just my personal preference but a strat is probaly the best electric guitar in the world and perfect for a beginner strats are more affordable as well when comparing lower end models of strats and les pauls the latter are a bit more expensive or you could forget everything i just said and go buy a prs with a compromising scale beautiful tone looks and great playability oh and if you do get a strat get one with a tremolo vibrato bridge and learn how to use it hope that helps  Blues Gibson SG Harp Pickup (music) Effects unit Saxophone Brian May Acoustic guitar PRS Guitars Blood on

how do you avoid copyright contravention having spent weeks piecing together a home made karaoke you tube actually rejected it for copyright reasons however there are loads of karaoke type vids on there and on similar sites i was told there's also a similar channel on sky tv where the publics vids are broadcast but how do you actually get your vid to sky tv does anyone know anything about it we know why things are copyrighted the fact is even tv flaunts copyright rules and even some sites that reject certain performances allow other similar video's not quite the tv channel pays broadcast royalties in much the same way that a radio station does another way is to buy an authorised copy of the soundtrack for karaoke purposes moral of the tale check before you spend weeks on it now that you have spent weeks on it you can approach the labels and ask permission they may grant you free permission for the publicity although that isn't terribly likely they may simply offer you a royalty contract to pay a fee each time it is played but again you may struggle simply put copyright means exactly that the right to copy which you don't have  Public domain Copyright GNU General Public License Australian copyright law Copyleft Software patent debate United States Postal Service SCO-Linux controversies Fair use Cable television First-sale doctrine Japanese copyright law UK Singles Chart SCO v.

are the bagpipes hard to play i've wondered how to play and are bagpipes expensive well that's a hard question it's like any other musical instrument you're not going to pick it up and just start playing it takes the average beginner about a year on the practice chanter like a recorder before they are ready to go on the big pipes about another year before they are ready to go out in public and perform i've seen people playing the pipes within a year of starting and i've seen people taking practice chanter lessons for years it all depends on how much effort you put into it pipes are not inexpensive a brand new 'cheaper' set will cost about and then the price goes up depending how how many bells and whistles you add but one thing to remember is silver gold and ivory don't make it sound better or make you a better player now out of all the people who enquire about playing the pipes are you going to be one of the who pursue it further by contacting a local pipe band or piper  Uilleann pipes Bagpipes Music of Brittany Music of Ireland Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias Organ (music) Gaida Flute Music of Scotland Great Highland Bagpipe Swedish bagpipes Clarinet Timpani Harp Pipe band Saxophone Just intonation Electronic organ CPU design Plastic Tin whistle Violin Social rule Uilleann Guitar Universal Serial Bus Mandolin Hurdy gurdy The Waterboys Roddy Piper Extreme Programming Solar cell Davy Spillane French folk music Monopoly (game) Western concert flute Recorder Brian Jones (musician) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Harmonica Mutual fund Samples of music from the United States Seamus Ennis Percussion instrument Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bicycle lighting Woodwind instrument Piano Music of France Laserdisc Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Rush (band) Redundant array of independent disks Leo Rowsome Tubular Bells II Microphone Radeon Player piano Yohoho!

why is comedy so stupid now why is comedy so stupid now i remember when tv shows cartoons movies were actually funny and it seems like now everything is completely stupid i miss being able to laugh why is it that random stupid stuff is considered to be funny it's cheap and takes no talent to create i've come up with better things when i'm going to bed half asleep tv shows cartoons movies depend upon the uniqueness of the talents of comedians to provide the strings of comedic lines that are appropriate for their genres however if you look at the world that we are living in and the shape of our society there has been very little to laugh it seems that we are receiving a reguritated glop of the same stuff over and over and that's why it's not funny you've heard it before you are correct it's cheap and takes no talent to create very few of the shows have a real audience with some longevity they also depend upon the 'actor' to be able to 'deliver' the mess in spite of whether the material is funny or not case in point i like patricia headron everybody loves raymond and i like kelsey grammar fraizer as just mediocre actors in comedic positions but enough is enough they have their own shows and now they are going to be placed 'together' on a show this fall i don't see how the two of them together will be able to pull a show off anyone who has seen them will relate them to their old shows surely there are others out there who have something new to add to the soup i miss shows like the jeffersons sanford i love lucy and others who used their entire cast to create the comedic effect from week to week to keep their audiences laughing even seinfield was funny because the cast members created their own individual 'haha' and together they played off of each other i wonder what's coming down the pike where are the new students who are learning their craft of being comedians everybody today depends too much upon putting other cultures down in order to make 'funny' i have to admit there is one guy who is super funny to me and it's because he hardly breaks his lines it's a continuous laugh and he might be funny on television as a regular if given a chance katt williams but then again he uses so much profanity i doubt if they would write a script around his type of comedy he is definitely for the redd foxx after midnight hour smile  Social rule I Love Lucy Situation comedy Monty Python I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Tokusatsu Saturday Night Live Squidward Tentacles Shaggy dog story Whose Line Is It Anyway?

why does hollywood stll use reels when everything today is so high tech ya know everything is turning from digital to high def and they are still working with very old technology even the films themselves have come along way with computers in my personal opinion they should do away with movie theaters and cinimas because people can watch movies at home for a tiny fraction of the cost of going out to the theater standing in line buy all that stuff then watching a movie that would look better on your hd tv anyway if this really is the information age then why haven't they caught up there are actually reasons st film is the only medium which can be projected onto a big screen in a theater yes there are digital projection devices but they do not compare to current wide screen film projectors nd film is non volatile it can't be lost or corrupted because of a power surge or loss of power the actual production of a movie may be done in a digital medium but the end product which makes it to the public in a movie theater is a film strip which runs through a projector film is cheap and film doesn't forget the movie industry is moving to all digital cameras to do production instead of huge film cameras and actual film then they do editing and post production in the studio with digital editors and such add special effects again digitally and then they transfer the final cut to a film strip film is still the final stage since there is no adequate projection system for digital media directly to the big screen theaters will never go away a good example is the movie master and commander which i just saw recently on the tube it was nothing compared to seeing the whole thing in a decent theater maybe you do not appreciate the magnitude of a theater but i and a lot of other people do it may be that people can watch at home for a fraction of the cost but the important part about going to the theater is the magnitude of the experience the sound system in your home does not hold a candle to the modern day movie theater things like soap operas on tv skip the final transfer to film since it will not be shown in a theater and never be seen on a screen bigger than the largest tv so in that sense tv programs you are right they are moving to all digital productions but even on the best and biggest hd tv master and commander still looks better on the big screen  Movie projector Film Digital cinema Computer IMAX Movie theater Traditional animation 3-D film Widescreen Digital cinematography Serial Sound recording Photography High-definition television Gross domestic product IBM PC compatible Digital camera Cinerama Software engineering Home cinema Movie studio Machinima History of film Sound film Game programmer Computer animation Computer numbering formats Digital projector BBC One Motion picture rating system Transistor Loudspeaker Sound effect Motion capture Apple Computer Floppy disk Digital Contemporary culture of South Korea Stereoscopy Bluetooth BBC television drama George Lucas Movie camera CPU cache Technicolor Modem Warez Camcorder Demoscene Silent film Laserdisc Nuclear fusion Digital rights management Panavision Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Konica Minolta Electrical engineering Transformer Audiophile Crime film Geographic information system Hard disk 35 mm film Gramophone record Soap opera Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Meta-reference Compact audio cassette NTSC X Window System Dubbing (filmmaking) ABS-CBN Computer display Independent film 19th century in film Surveillance ITV Digital circuit Sony Projection screen Windows XP Solar power Channel 4 DVD Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Trailer (movie) Explosive material Blu-ray Disc Pornography CPU design

in afi's hit song love like winter i have asked many many different people this question and every one of them has been as confused as i am about the answer maybe you have an idea in the chorus of the song davey sings i met my love before i was born he wanted love i taste of blood he bit my lip he sings the chorus three times in the song and although in the second of the three he uses the word she instead of he the first and last are sung with the word he they aren't gay so why would he sing about his first love being a man and having him bit his lip dont try to tell me that he is singing that line on behalf of the females listening to the song because we all know that rockstars dont pretend they are a girl singing about their male lover hahahahaha that actually did happen except it was at a concert while he was singing xp  Another Side of Bob Dylan She Loves You I Want to Hold Your Hand Jon Secada Avenue Q Rich Mullins Whose Line Is It Anyway?
