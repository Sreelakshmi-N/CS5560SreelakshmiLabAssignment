why does american football not get more recognition worldwide im tired of little kids in england saying it doesnt take any talent real sports fans know thats not true but their has be a reason i know it will never be as big as soccer worldwide but i think it should be more popular well i love soccer and i dont like football but i dont hate it i watch the superbowl and the playoffs and some games in the regular season but i dont really enjoy it because it takes too much hours and only hour of play and really u dont need that much talent if your a linemen u just need to be strong and big but wide receivers and some other positions do require talent and i think the reason why is not popular around the world is to much timeouts and comercials to much pads in the player and it gets boring alot of times  Football (soccer) American football National Football League Super Bowl Cincinnati Bengals Major League Soccer Pittsburgh Steelers Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl I Playoff New York Giants Baseball Super Bowl III Glossary of American football National Football League Lore Jacksonville Jaguars New England Patriots Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXV 2005 NFL season FA Premier League Miami Dolphins David Beckham Super Bowl XXVIII Women's football (soccer) Comparison of Canadian and American football FIFA Series EA Sports Kansas City Chiefs San Francisco 49ers Cleveland Browns Football (soccer) positions Super Bowl XXVII Donovan McNabb Minnesota Vikings Football Super Bowl XXXIV The Football League Offensive team Monday Night Football Ultimate (sport) American football strategy Super Bowl XXXIX Bobby Charlton Cleveland Indians American Football League World Football League Super Bowl XXVI Salary cap Sudden death Canadian Football League Toronto Maple Leafs Super Bowl X Primera Divisi__n Argentina Arena football Football World Cup Playoff format National Basketball Association Toronto Argonauts Formation (football) Super Bowl IV Atlantic Coast Conference Indoor football Stanley Cup Atomic Kitten Syracuse University Orange Super Bowl XXXI Major professional sports league Michael Jordan New York Knicks Major League Baseball Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.

question for soccer defenders alright so basically i am very good technically i can juggle the ball around times and when it comes to one touch shot dribbling passing etc i am very talented i am a midfield though which means i need to be good technically which i am as well as being good in defending however i am very bad at defending i find it so difficult to win balls and i am usually the loser in winning balls help i need real thorough tips on how to defend like when to step blah blah etc thankyou so much your advice will help me suceed i used to be a sweeper but i also play in the wings wether front mid or back my best advice when you play defense is never hesitate when you go for a challenge do it coz when u hesitate the opponent takes advantage of that when you tackle a guy make sure you get the ball out of him also time your sweeps when he opens up slip your leg a bit to keep the ball in his full control and dont let ur opponent get away too much especially if he is a deadly scorer i would rather get a yellow than give up a break away attack  Football (soccer) positions Water polo Football (soccer) Defender (football) Basketball Rugby union positions Midfielder Glossary of American football Snooker American football Fast bowling Fielding (cricket) Rugby league Norway national football team Eight ball American football strategy Baseball Table tennis Chess terminology Tennis Team Fortress Classic Field hockey Fencing Canadian football Formation (football) Mixed martial arts Australian rules football Billiards Four square Tackle (football) Bobby Charlton Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ice hockey Cincinnati Bengals Touch football (rugby league) Harrow Football Aerial (dance move) Blitzball Mortal Kombat New York Giants Geoff Hurst Swingout Michael Jordan Rugby league positions Boxing Cleveland Browns Professional wrestling holds Offside law (football) Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXV Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Indianapolis 500 Football Sydney Riot of 1879 Fullback Super Bowl XXXVI Professional wrestling match types Super Bowl I Laws of cricket Tenshinhan Strap-on dildo Endgame Personal foul Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

manchester united v reading what did you think of the game i thought manchester united dominated the whole game and it's sad that rooney got hurt on the opening day we dominated the whole match and had many chances to win the game but we missed them it was a shame that wayne rooney got injured so early in the season hopefully he will be fit again very soon if he was on the pitch today then maybe he would have won us the game but i don't believe that we have something to worry about carlos tevez louis saha and ole gunnar solskjear will be available to play again very soon but reading weren't exactly going for the win were they for starters they started with one man up front but that's what most teams do play for a draw when they come to old trafford arsenal chelsea and liverpool may have won but one game doesn't make a season hopefully we will improve our finishing and get the title challenge back on track i am in a bad mood at the moment but hopefully reading can draw or beat chelsea in midweek chelsea arsenal and liverpool will all drop points at some stage manchester united didn't cheat but the referee had a bad game glory glory manchester united  Alex Ferguson FA Cup FA Premier League 2004-05 Manchester United F.C.

david beckham was it for hype or an actual chance of winning he has the number one jersey sales in the united states outsells any other sports figure in the world but has the us fans seen him play or they just heard of him and seen him pose in my opinion beckham is here for the money dont believe the bs about bringing soccer to america the usa has the largest youth soccer in the world but when it comes to the big game with big talent they just suck no coaching skills by an american when is the last time you heard of an american male soccer star beckham will play for england but as for his heart being in the mls only money would keep it beating the question is what is david beckham there for answer for the money and fame but he's so damn rich and famous already answer for purely football reasons even worse bull as if a player thinks that going from real madrid to la galaxy is a step up answer to change american's perspective on soccer and generate more interest hopefully in future americans would love soccer as much as they love their nba of course it's answer sure even a rich man would love to get even richer but we can all assume that money is not the number one reason for becks to come to mls it might be just one of the many other minor reasons the main and most important reason is because becks thinks that he can or has the potential to make soccer in america much more popular than its current level of interest this is where his fame comes in he is so famous through out the world probably even more so than football legend pele though not for footballing reasons i'm sure even americans who claim they have never heard of this name must feel curious and wonder why is this man so damn famous that is already what david beckham wanted to make even non soccer fans become curious and interested that was his aim and he has achieved that already the mls is already generating interest and money like never before and no one can deny that david beckham is the main catalyst for this change beckham is not the snob that everyone makes him out to be he is just an english lad wanting to give the best in whatever he does in this case it's football and hopefully achieve his aim he might be over ambitious in thinking that he can single handedly make soccer very popular in america during his time there but at least he did create much more interest and publicity for american soccer he did what so many before him failed to do so to answer your question david beckham's arrival at the mls was indeed hype but more than that he was trying to make soccer popular in america it was not a personal agenda abouting earning fat millions or signing autographs it was for the good of football he did not want to conquer america he wanted football to conquer america  David Beckham Major League Soccer Spice Girls Manchester United F.C.

how can i learn the tachtic of soccer while watching on tv i know there is defense mid field and attackers but i do not understand the job of mid fielders and how they switch positions also for defenders how they mark their defenders some are zoned defense some are men to men defense when the sub comes in how does it affect the team when and how do you use a sub i watch games on tv but i can not follow one player how he is positioning or whatever defense two central defenders protect from attacks coming from the centre of the pitch the two wide defenders protect the goal from wingers but are allowed to make attacking runs midfield you can be a defensive midfielder or an attacking midfielder you also have the wingers wide mid field players the wingers must be able to run with the ball and deliver crosses into the penalty area central midfielders are there to stop the ball getting through to your defense but can also attack when the opportunity arises strikers or forwards are out and out goal scorers it's best to have two up front but you can also play with just one upfront leaving a extra player to roam from midfield to attack subs are used at any time to give a more attacking of defensive option they are also used for injuries your only allowed in any one game  Midfielder Football (soccer) Baseball American football Glossary of American football Fielding (cricket) Softball Volleyball Water polo Defender (football) Cricket Winger (ice hockey) Canadian football Australian rules football Ice hockey Rugby union positions Leeds United F.C.

what sport would you prefer more soccer or surfing and why i love both but i want to know which one will be better i would prefer soccer allot more because its a contact sport and to me there's nothing better than slide tackling some one on the ground also it is way more fun to play a sport as a team with other people and honestly is there anything better then scoring a goal it's the best feeling in the world to me but surfing is always chill to be able to relax on the beach and go out in the morning with some friends i enjoy them both allot but i have to go with soccer  Football (soccer) Indoor soccer Ultimate (sport) Rugby union Major League Soccer Field hockey Water polo American football Football (soccer) positions Rugby football Australian rules football Football Volleyball Canadian football Rugby league Baseball Melbourne Cricket Ground Gaelic football National Football League Lore Surfing Sport Hurling Broomball Lacrosse Frankie Hejduk Tackle (football) Tie (draw) Pel__ Norway national football team Cincinnati Bengals Diego Maradona Women's football (soccer) Major Indoor Soccer League Arena football Chicago White Sox Bundesliga (football) Ice hockey Playoff format Windsurfing Counter-Strike maps Perth, Western Australia Zico Mia Hamm Kitesurfing September 2004 in sports Wheelchair rugby Basketball Captain Tsubasa History of rugby league Table football Sudden death Sports in Puerto Rico Football World Cup 1990 Team handball Comparison of Canadian and American football Curling Surf's Up The Beach Boys FIFA Series Eric Wynalda Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.

ok people stop the hijinks what is the point there are fellow americans that put down soccer and there are people of all nations that will put down football i will jump on any of my fellow countrymen who put down other nations over a game and i ask that everyone try to do the same it is ridiculous to have to keep answering the same old and tired questions i am tired of seeing the same old arguement about which came first which one is aptly named and which one is more boring i love and respect both sports no matter what they are called i often say that i have the best of both worlds but if you are unable to at least respect the other sport then don't resort to dissing or name calling let's keep it in check and believe me as an american i soak up every drop of information i can get on television in regard to soccer from around the world we need sponsors who want to put it on tv we need to differentiate the sports here we can't have two sports with one common name guess which one gets called soccer yes i do have a sense of humor but that sort of activity only feeds the anti soccer faction it's hard to sell the game here and i need all the help i can get i am part of a group that is trying to get mls to place a team here in philadelphia and i am amazed at the level of disdain toward soccer much less the apathy especially when there were kids in a tournament around a month ago i do not agree with what certain users did as a matter of fact i'm somewhat dissapointed but there have been certain fans from other sports who started bad mouthing soccer football and the users are just trying to get back when they should have just ignored it now i too am an american but the users are acting like children over this hopefully we can put this incident behind us and get back to why we are all on here seahawks rule  Football (soccer) Rugby union American football New York Giants Playoff Baseball Rugby league Ultimate (sport) Theory of conduct Martial art Ayrton Senna North American Soccer League Football Norway national football team Football World Cup Playoff format The Jim Rome Show Hip hop rivalries Sport Volleyball Rugby football Indoor football United States men's national soccer team Table tennis Tennis Whose Line Is It Anyway?

david beckham beckham must be the most overrated player in the history of football that's not saying he's rubbish i think he's a very good player and i am a fan of his but the hype that surrounds him is unbelievable look at the real barcelona struggle to buy him real got him and after games the fans were saying what's the big deal in the meantime barca spent similar money on a true world class player in ronaldinho it will be the same at la galaxy fans are expecting a player of pele like stature who's gonna beat men while juggling the ball on his nose and what they're gonna get is a good honest hardworking player who has a good range of passing and great delivery from set pieces c'mon i'm right aren't i angler you are right i didn't want to be too harsh cos i thought everyone loved beckham on here the stats show that his set pieces are pretty awful but the media constantly show his free kick out of that actually goes in ok so he's a good player but is it fair that he earns more in a week than i would in a year i too have a family to support and with all the problems in the world i find it unfeasible to be able to pay anyone that amount of money ranting i guess if i played football i wouldn't be saying that but since i'm female i wouldn't be earning that anyway so bored of the beckhams  American football Cincinnati Bengals National Football League FIFA Series Bryan Robson Poker jargon Theory of conduct Football culture Football (soccer) positions Major League Baseball television contracts Bobby Charlton New York Giants Football (soccer) Norway national football team Newcastle United F.C.

how can anyone justify david beckham being one of the best futbol players of our generation the guy is way overpaid and is basically stealing money from the la franchise since when get making wicked free kicks make you a superstar there are much better players that don't get the same recognition i think he owes it to posh spice you guys are missing the point of the question i understand he is bringing recogintion of the game to the usa my question is why he isn't even that good and certainly hasn't made any impact to the sport in the usa other than tricking fans into buying tickets to a games he doesn't even play in i used to think becks was overrated when he played for man utd i was wrong what happened when he left man u they didnt win the premiership until this year they bought ronaldo to replace him and it took him years to develop dont get me wrong ronaldo is way better than becks ever was becks used to run up and down the wing whipping balls into the box not just free kicks back in the day beckham had great endurance england said they didnt need him but they struggled to score goals and they had to recall him now that they brought him back they are a totally different team beckham has scored in three world cups how many players have done that you say that much better players dont get ther recognition its because they arent winning championships or they are on worse teams and they seem like they are really good players but if they transfered to a good team they would just get lost much like shaun wright philips lay off becks he is a great player  David Beckham Manchester United F.C.

what is the fascination with david beckham i see the media are cooling off a bit since david beckham moved to la galaxy i never could quite understand the media frenzy anyway i mean he's good but isn't what i would describe as a truly great player anyway who would you say is the greatest footballer currently playing secret keeper you've changed your name haven't you ryan giggs is still playing for them sorry can't bring myself to use foul language redknapp and shearer are both retired and are currently pundits redknapp for sky sports and shearer for the bbc i wouldn't say they were 'greats' either not in the same way as pele cruyff maradonna or zidane anyway so who in todays game is going to go down in history like them adam h he always was a bit lame in my opinion dolia i think you have a point but i think he's got famous off the back of his wife's fame if he hadn't married a spice girl then i think he'd have just remained an ordinary player for an ordinary club love him or hate me well i love him as a due of respect that is he is the most iconic footballer in the world those ronaldinhos kakas and ronaldos are well known in the football world i repeat football world but trying asking people who dont know anything about football chances that people wil know about beckham is more than they will know about kaka ronaldinho ronaldo well in my opinion he is truely a great footballer not the greatest thou he is not someone who will rely on pace so age is definitely not something that will stop him and look at his freekicks can anyone match up to his i can only think of nakamura and juninho those are the only that are close to beckham in terms of free kicks ability if i am to say the greatest footballer i would say it is steven gerrard just look at his contribution to liverpool he is no kaka nor ronaldo but he keep it simple and produce always wif his trademark runs  Steve McManaman David Beckham Alan Shearer Ronaldo FIFA World Player of the Year Norway national football team FIFA Series FIFA 100 Football (soccer) Manchester United F.C.

looking for an article on beckam vs ronaldiho i believe there was on world soccer magazine but not sure if it was from on line the article had photos of these two players side by side and was being compared on all different levels to give them a grade if you can give me a site or information i would appreciate it i like both players but i am more for ronaldiho his play is amazing i also support beckham for his courage in all his accomplishment and goals hard to say man but i'm agree with you in that ronaldinho is the best player and i think that is an insult for him to compare it with bekham but hey that just me  Football (soccer) David Beckham Ronaldinho Football culture Football (soccer) positions Field hockey Football chant FIFA Series Midfielder FIFA World Player of the Year American football England national football team Brazil national football team Rugby league Ultimate (sport) Rugby union Lacrosse Water polo F.C.

what are some things that i need to know or skills to be a good full back in in u im kind of new to soccer help would be nice firstly congratulations for taking up the wonderful game of soccer football to some and secondly well done for being a fullback sometimes its all guts and no glory but it can be a very rewarding position particularly when you score a rare goal anyway my advice is to mark closely as the previous person said and to be hungry for the ball not giving attackers time on the ball is vital you also have to know when to dive in and contest the ball and when to hang back and jockey if you are outnumbered in defence best to try to force the attacker to the sideline by jockeying and not let him through the middle organisation in defence is also vital make sure on set pieces corners free kicks etc each opposing man is marked and when moving up make sure the defence is in a straight line to catch the opposition offside knowing when to move forward in attack is also a skill there's nothing better than winning the ball with a strong tackle and turning defence into attack run with the ball pass to a midfielder or forward and continue your run to make the extra man you might snare yourself a goal remember to get back if the play breaks down or have someone cover for you anyway good luck  Glossary of American football Football (soccer) positions American football Rugby union Football (soccer) Australian rules football Rugby union positions Rugby league Canadian football Volleyball Rugby league positions American football strategy New York Giants Defender (football) Fullback Football Norway national football team Touch football (rugby league) Baseball Offside law (football) Super Bowl XXI National Football League Lore Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XVIII Cincinnati Bengals Rugby football Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl X Poker jargon Super Bowl XXIV Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl XXXIV Offensive team Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XVII Fast bowling Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXVI Pittsburgh Steelers Carolina Panthers Indoor soccer Super Bowl XXIII Snooker Super Bowl I Super Bowl V Midfielder Super Bowl XII Chess terminology San Francisco 49ers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXXVI Cleveland Browns Billiards Jack Charlton Bobby Charlton Tag Leeds United F.C.

soccer in the us why is soccer so unpopular in the us i live in alabama and everyone says soccer is for gays and hippies i just tell them that a least our high school soccer team made the playoffs and the football team didnt haha stupid rednecks i have the same question why do so many alleged sports fans like and appreciate a variety of sports football to hockey to baseball to golf etc yet when it comes to soccer the mood turns sour and almost violently antagonistic i mean some folks don't like golf but you never hear them screaming and carrying on about how horrible it is the same with other sports but when it comes to soccer let the vile diarrhea of the mouth begin i don't want to hear the lame excuse that there is not enough scoring baseball and or hockey have long been low scoring affairs i don't want to hear that it is boring not enough action give me a break baseball in nearly unwatchable with all the delays and football is five seconds of action followed by a minute of standing around don't get me wrong i am a sports fan and can appreciate most sports i have a tough time with those that are based on judging skating gymnastics etc what is it about soccer that creates such animosity is it the jingoistic view that since it wasn't invented in the usa it is inherently evil is it that xenophobic fear that since the usa is not the top dog that we can't or won't appreciate it is it the fact that it is an easy target because it appears 'everyone' hates it and you're just stupid to even like something that the masses which quite often are asses frown upon is it because folks can get a quick laugh if they make fun of it  Baseball Football (soccer) Playoff Sports timeline Sport Major League Soccer The Jim Rome Show Major League Baseball television contracts September 2004 in sports Ice hockey Boston Red Sox April 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports New York Jets American football Wayne Gretzky St. Louis Cardinals 2004 American League Championship Series Philadelphia Eagles Football July 2005 in sports October 2005 in sports World Series Texas A&M University Golf Stanley Cup Water polo Ty Cobb Eric Cartman March 2005 in sports Playoff format National Hockey League Salary cap College football University of Houston Associated Press Athlete of the Year Roller hockey June 2005 in sports Los Angeles Kings Toronto Maple Leafs May 2005 in sports I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Atlanta, Georgia Field hockey Summer Olympic Games January 2005 in sports Buffalo Bills National Hockey League rivalries November 2004 in sports Carolina Panthers Michael Jordan October 2004 in sports Georgia Institute of Technology Chicago White Sox Matt Hardy Equine conformation Steve Nash Virginia Commonwealth University September 2005 in sports Montreal Iron Bowl Jim Thorpe Babe Ruth Miracle on Ice Counter-Strike Cleveland Browns Sport in the United Kingdom National Hockey League All-Star Game Overtime (sport) Cleveland Indians Indian sport Atlantic Coast Conference Vin Scully Reggie Jackson Women's sports ESPN25 University of Denver Tie (draw) Lacrosse New York Yankees New York Knicks Pete Rose Sports in Canada Relegation Arkansas Razorbacks Southeastern Conference National Football League Lore Yelena Davydova David Beckham Football World Cup Al Michaels

what league is the best considering english teams have made it to the final the past three years and in the version three of the teams in the semi finals were from the premiership does this mean that the english league is the best league in europe the italian serie a is far too defensive for me and it is pretty corrupt the matchfixing scandals involving ac milan juventus and a few other italian clubs really rocked the league last year's serie a was boring and inter milan won the league by coming points clear of the second placed team as roma i think the la liga is pretty exciting and barcelona fc is my favorite team there are lots of brazilian players and it is pretty entertaining there is more flair and you its not as quick as the premier league so there is chance to show of your skill i support manchester united and i think that the premier league is the best league in the world the league is more attacking than defensive and it is really competitive we have a big four consisting of arsenal manchester united chelsea and liverpool next year will be pretty interesting because tottenham hotspurs will be hot on arsenal's heels all year in last year's champions league all the english clubs topped their groups and three if the semi finalists were english clubs last year's bundesliga's title race was great and it went right down to the wire but bayern munich had a bad season and didn't even qualify for the champions league they will be missed in order to make the bundesliga more popular a german club needs to go far in the champions league and perhaps even win the competition i would say the portuguese league next they may not be that popular but the team that is going to win the title isnt as predictable as it is in france we all know who is going to win lyon i would say the epl is the best league in the world followed by the la liga and then the serie a then the bundesliga and then the potuguese league  Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

give him a difficult time and this was a response he is too young to be captain but mr silva asked me and now he is no longer with us world cup incident on july after the sending off of united team mate wayne rooney in the quarter final of the world cup between england and portugal and after much speculation in the english media that he had influenced rooney's red card ronaldo told reporters that he thought he should get out of manchester as the circumstances are not right to keep playing there i have told my agent i am prepared to leave i want to do it in the best manner possible i want to play for real madrid and dream of doing so ronaldo allegedly told the spanish sports daily marca on july he also told sic a portuguese television channel he cannot understand all verbal violence and pejorative speculation about him ronaldo declared he did not behave wrongly when portugal defeated england and so cannot be blamed for defending his home country colours he added that he cannot live and work in a place where people do not like him so he would be glad to move out of england after england's elimination ronaldo was attacked by the english tabloids the sun made a dart board with a picture of his wink in a similar fashion to the one made after the world cup for david beckham by the daily mirror another english tabloid ronaldo has said that rooney was a friend and that he was

ronaldo was loudly booed each time he had possession of the ball by french and english fans alike several reports accused ronaldo and other members of his side of trying to influence the referee by diving there have been similar accusations in the past and ronaldo has been booked for the offence more than once in the english premiership shortly after he dropped back to second place in the online voting for best young player it was reported by bbc sport that this was partly because of an email campaign by an england supporter urging people to vote for luis valencia who was the second place player to prevent ronaldo from winning the award though the online vote only affected the nomination process fifa technical study group awarded the honours to germany's lukas podolski citing ronaldo's behaviour as a factor on july united released a statement saying the club can confirm there is no possibility of cristiano being sold cristiano recently signed a new contract until and the club fully expects him to honour that contract the club will not listen to any offers for cristiano and on july sir alex ferguson said cristiano will be coming back while chelsea manager jos mourinho said if he stays in england i think he can turn things around in addition sir alex ferguson sent assistant boss carlos queiroz to portugal hoping to change the young player's mind and rooney pleaded with ronaldo

hypothetically speaking 'what would you do in this scenario ' here's yet another of my hypothetical questions imagine this scenario fifa made a law that all clubs had to have a set amount of match day stewards and if they didn't comply to the rules the consequence would mean your club would face expulsion from the league unfortunately you find your club were finding it difficult to recruit enough stewards job description the job was well paid for your services but it meant standing with your back to the on going match and you had to keep an eye on the crowd at all times obviously meaning you cannot watch the match the question is simply would you take the job on for the good and survival of the club or would you sit back praying for an eleventh hour candidate to take the job thanks for the kind wishes chelsea shrimper much appreciated same goes for your boys too hiya damio damn i knew there was a flaw in the question some where you obviously have never been to blackpools sided ground i dream of the day we get the other stands built let alone having a big screen installed yes i would take the job btw congrats on your result at the weekend i hope blackpool continue to do well  FA Cup Torquay United F.C.

whcih epl defender do u think would make a good striker very interesting question er essien is techincally not a defender he is a midfielder asked to play in defense for chelsea cos they haven't got a half decent right back and alves is not an epl defender yet chelsea are interested in him so he cant really count so then below are a list of defenders whom i think could be converted into potential strikers do note that i have excluded defenders such as terry who scores goals too because scoring with his head is typical defender's goal i'll choose those who can score with their left or right foot daniel agger liverpool scored some great goals in his short career at liverpool and still counting plays with the same elegance as man utd's rio ferdinand but scores more goals usually defenders score goals with their head but this guy can do some damage with his feet just ask chelsea fans and who can forget his goal against west ham last season kolo toure and william gallas arsenal they can score goals with their feet too can charge forward with much menace too ashley cole micah richards and eboue chelsea man city and arsenal respectively all three are explosive wing backs who can dribble has plenty of pace to burn and tricky dribbling skills their ability to cut in from the flank rather than attack from the deep means that they belong to the thierry henry mould unorthodox strikers john arne riise liverpool ultimate terror for opposing defenders they'd rather riise score because if he misses most likely it's because the ball hit their legs and broke them players like rio ferdinand and ricardo carvalho would make better midfielders rather than strikers because even though they can play some football and are very comfortable with the ball at their feet they don't really possess much goal threats hence with their good passing range they'd more likely be converted to midfielders not strikers  Leeds United F.C.

zidane to play in australia for sydney fc i just heard that sydney fc will be asking zidane to make a guest appearence in the friendly game against la galaxy featuring david beckham what do you think about that juniniho should be playing in the same game too but should sydney just use the players they have give them the chance to play or should they go ahead and get zidane to play also where does zidane play now i thought he retired so he might not be match fit or am i wrong sufianolilano why would i want to lie about it check out the links below http www news com au heraldsun story html news ninemsn com au article aspx id www news com au dailytelegraph story html haoren l what the f k are you on about piss off well bela that is a little offencive and you guys sometimes forget that small teams have fans too in countries that are trying to promote the game and would love the chance to see their hero's play live i wonder whether you have watched much of our a league or asian cl matches so its not big for you but it sure as heck is for me and many other zizou and or sydney fans in australia anyway he is a good friend of becks and if it comes off it will really help highlight and promote the sport even more in australia and the usa he would likely make a cameo appearance for maybe the second half i'm sure he can handle that it's one match not a comeback he has done it for charity games and the poverty games it will be awesome if this can be pulled off i don't think that the boys would be devastated to give up their position for a half of football to play alongside the maestro i have my tickets so darn i hope he comes i'm stoked babyboy you are just too sweet xxx  David Beckham Football (soccer) Zin__dine Zidane Peter Shilton Rugby union Australian rules football Steve McManaman Gordon Banks The Ashes Major League Soccer Rugby league Real Madrid Bryan Robson Football culture National Football League Baseball Super League (Australia) Satchel Paige Sydney Swans Final Fantasy IX Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles English cricket team Michael Owen American football Sydney Riot of 1879 New York Giants Water polo Football chant West Bromwich Albion F.C.

is raul tamudo or sergio aguero a better striker choice for my la liga fantasy team and who should start in midfield between dos santos and raul garcia raul tamudo is a much better choice he starts every game and scores much more goals than aguero he's a bargain and is definately worth it if you need a cheap striker who will give you goals in midfield i'd say go with raul garcia i'm not sure if you mean the dos santos playing for barcelona or almeria in fantasy play its important to be bringing in players who are going to be starting or atleast playing in nearly everygame dos santos playing for barcelona probably isn't going to get much oppurtunity amongst all og the midfield wizards in barca  Real Madrid Ra__l Gonz__lez FC Barcelona Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Alex Ferguson Norway national football team Michael Owen Midfielder Leeds United F.C.

i see david elleray former referee is renewing calls for sin bins in football do you agree personally speaking i don't and here's why first of all in football it's very easy to deny a team posession so if a team know they're down to men for say minutes then their first reaction will be to simply get the remaining players behind the ball and ironically teams a man up will be less likely to score sin binnings would very quickly become something that completely kills the flow of a game probably also the in stadium atmosphere as the supporters realise they've got minutes to go to the loo or get a pie and also the player who gets sin binned is getting a breather so imagine him coming back on the field and right away making a lung bursting run to skin a tired defender and score who's really been penalised then you make a great argument against this idea it would destroy the flow of the game and it would give too much power to the referee as if they don't have enough its another judgement call too fallible  Football (soccer) American football Canadian football New York Giants Cleveland Browns Rugby union 1957 World Series Cincinnati Bengals Volleyball Water polo FA Cup Baseball Super Bowl XVII American football strategy Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl IX Carolina Panthers Gaelic football Penalty shootout (football) San Francisco 49ers Tag Iron Bowl Super Bowl XIX Glossary of American football Rugby league Buffalo Bills St. Louis Cardinals Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVII Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XVIII All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Softball National Football League Lore Newcastle United F.C.

what soccer team international or club should i be backing up ok the problem is i need to support a team but the us team is garbage and so are our club teams so that isn't an option i don't want to just jump on the bandwagon and be like all the people who cheer for chelsea manchester utd italy etc just because they win alot should i just go w countries of my heritage or is there a way to magically find out which team has the least amount of douche baggy players and support them your obviously a fud mate you can't support a national team thats not your country it just doesnt work like that and you don't support a team on the basis if they are going to be successful i sincerly hope you don't choose celtic choose your local team and country regardless of their form and then maybe you can be considered to be a decent football fan  Manchester United F.C.

a question regarding world cup assignation has there ever been discussion among the powers that be to assign the hosting of the world cup to the country that won the previous tournament for example say italy gets to host and that tourney champion hosts what are the pro's and con's three obvious problems first it takes more than years to get a country ready for the world cup it's why they announce it so many years in advance like the olympics only on a slightly smaller scale you could theoretically fix this by giving the winner the hosting position years hence rather than four second problem the winner might not have the capability of hosting the tournament you need a certain number of stadiums above a certain capacity not many countries have that third problem they like to rotate the continents so that more areas of the world become exposed to the world cup with europe south america winning all the time you would sort of leave africa asia and north america out in the cold  Norway national football team Football World Cup 2006 (qualification) Football (soccer) PGA European Tour Football World Cup 2002 FIFA Football at the Summer Olympics 2003 Rugby Union World Cup Germany national football team Football World Cup 2006 Brazil national football team Playoff format Football World Cup 1990 Football World Cup 2018 Jeopardy!

americans often say the reason why they dont like football soccer is because of low scoring why if you look at the english league or spanish league or infact most other leagues you usually get scores of or or even higher why is it americans complain about this if you look at the english league you only see a couple of draws over many weeks in american football a game can last up to hours and over that time the score are often only in the s or even less do americans not realise that the reason why the points difference is so big is due to the fact that you get points for a touchdown and then an extra point for the mighty hard part of kicking a ball over and between an unguarded goal also another point for doing the same thing in open play a game of football lasts at most hour mins from start to finish and you only get goal point for a goal australia beat samoa in soccer yet the highest score i can find in nfl is washington vs n y giants if you break it down this is only touchdowns at best why do you say this is the reason it's because we are conditioned to high scoring in all our major sports it isn't because we chose to be that way many teams in all sports do surveys based on the input of their season ticket holders they have surmised especially and unfortunately in the national hockey league and major league baseball that fans want more goals and more runs scored generations of americans are nurtured to believe that offense wins games i say hogwash the only thing i care about is that my teams come out on top it is interesting to me as well why my fellow countrymen complain about low scoring low scoring to me is like calling an incision a small cut scoring is scoring a cut is a cut there is no need for more description my point is that fans of football and fans of soccer may never understand why they are the way they are all that is important is that we try to be ambassadors of our sport i have the best of both worlds go eagles go dc united i am a huge fan of soccer and football my advice to anyone is that if people are intentionally putting down other sports just point out to them what they are missing if they don't like a sport don't let them think that it is acceptable to put it down  National Football League American football New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Playoff New England Patriots Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXVI Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII New York Jets Baseball Rugby union Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XIV Buffalo Bills St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XI November 2004 in sports Major League Soccer The Football League Super Bowl IX World Football League Super Bowl XXIV Canadian football Sudden death Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl I Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XVIII Football Super Bowl XXXI September 2005 in sports Super Bowl III Overtime (sport) September 2004 in sports Comparison of Canadian and American football American Football League Playoff format Super Bowl Glossary of American football October 2005 in sports Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XIII FA Cup Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXVI Australian rules football Super Bowl XV Major League Baseball Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXIII December 2004 in sports San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs Australia national football team Negro league baseball Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Sports timeline Super Bowl X Philadelphia Eagles Rugby football Monday Night Football American football strategy Baltimore Ravens Ice hockey Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl VI Jim Thorpe Rugby league Salary cap Arena football Ty Cobb History of rugby union Manchester United F.C.

who do you think is the best goalkeeper and what do you think of gregory coupet i thinks hes probably at lest in the top definitely petr cech he's the kind of solid no frills keeper all top class teams need look how chelsea struggled along when he was absent this should be enough evidence that even a world class team like chelsea overflowing with talent can miss a keeper and lose almost half of their games is really amazing best of all he's only very young for a keeper this gives him more than a decade to develope into an even better player yet talk about youngsters and we have keepers like igor akinfeev scott carson also and lukasz fabianski who at present look to have the most potential to be future world class custodians gregory coupet is no doubt the undisputed no in the france national team but what he gets week in week out is ligue football and he has to leave lyon and go play in a better league to realise his true potential not that he has much time left he's already but coupet is no doubt one of the most able keepers in the business probably just behind cech buffon and casillas overall ranking petr cech gianluigi buffon iker casillas gregory coupet edwin van der sar  __ker Casillas Petr __ech Norway national football team Chelsea F.C.
