horse show colors i am looking into showing a brown and white pinto pony next year in western and i was wondering what main color i should wear i am looking forward to doing halter showmanship pleasure veratility and trail next year this is also my first year showing and i am really really nervous about it are there any pointers on how to keep my cool in the ring the color i had in mind was turquoise but i am having second thoughts on that i think a great idea is to see if you can hold mock shows at your barn maybe invite a bunch of kids and their parents that way there's other competitors and there's a bit of an audience too have your trainer or a volunteer act as a judge and run the gamut of classes you and your peers are primarily interested in a big part of my nervousness in the ring stems from being the sole person in the ring at one time with all eyes on me so to speak i think if you've got the opportunity to be in that situation beforehand and enable yourself to overlook it and relax with a bunch of people watching you perform then you'll be less nervous and keep your cool also the more shows you attend the better you'll feel about entering the ring as far as colors are concerned i think the following colors would go well with a brown and white pinto maroon bright red hunter green purple depending on whether or not its a gelding or mare of course navy blue bright blue  Horse Color Horse show Arabian horse Dragon Booster Milton H.

small animal advice i want a hamster and my dad already said yes but my mom said no because she wants me to get a bunny i can get either so which one is nicer and how much do they cost for the pet and the supplies starting off thanx rabbits can be timid if you don't hold them and play with them frequently they require a bigger cage and more frequent changes of bedding simply because they are larger and therefore produce more waste on a regular basis however hamsters can sometimes become aggressive and territorial after a period of time and become biters the most lovable hamster i have found are dwarf hamsters they don't get much bigger than across so they require only a small amount of space and they're precious i had one until i had to move and i gave her to my friend and she was and still is as sweet as can be however a friend of mine got a different breed of hamster teddy bear i think and that thing is so aggressive in its cage it'll bite and draw blood if you're not careful as far as cost is concerned i think a hamster is the least expensive of the two but if you give a bunny enough love and attention i think you'd be happier with your choice simply because they're a lot bigger more cuddle able and more entertaining  Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pet skunk Ferret Care Bears Canary Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Golden Hamster Calvin and Hobbes Bugs Bunny Animal testing Physical intimacy Poker jargon RuneScape quests Unreal Rabbit Nuclear power Rabbit (zodiac) Monster Rancher monsters Garfield Cat Livestock The Adventures of Pete & Pete Waste management Minor Harry Potter Beasts Pet store Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography RISC Phoebe Buffay's songs The Young Ones (TV series) Kodocha KaBlam!

is my rabbit pregnant my rabbit keeps on resting and growing so i dont know if shes on her growspert or not i thought she was a netherland dwarf but then she's more like a mix of a netherland dwarf and a mini rex please help me the male died a couple days before i thought she was pregnant so i don't know what to do and also she lives in a cage so if she is pregnant tell me what kind of box i should put in the cage oh and this was unexpectablly so i didnt know it was supposed to happen the male was her brother i didnt know when she was pregnant sorry there is something you can do called palpatation or palpating this is when you feel the doe's underside for kits however if you do this incorrectly or too rough strongly you can damage the kits so this is not recommended without practice the surest way to find out if your rabbit is pregnant is to wait days if your rabbit does not deliver within this time she is not pregnant or has reabsorbed her litter one sign that your rabbit might be pregnant is if she carries nesting materials to a certain place and or if she starts pulling her underbelly fur and nesting with that she will be gaining weight of course she will also begin to pluck out her fur and build a warm nest for her babies make sure there's a box or something in her hutch to make sure the babies are suitably warm you might also notice a change in her eating habits and her social manners she might be drinking more water or eating more food than normal she may also change personalities completely a little or even not at all if she's normally nice she might become mean don't hold it against her she's just being maternal and making sure she can protect her babies when they're born a couple weeks after mating put her to the male again under close supervision if she refuses him chances are shes pregnant the most reliable way is to palpate her abdomen this technique is difficult to learn for someone who does not frequently breed a lot of rabbits because it takes practice when it was been days to two weeks past the breeding date i will place the doe on a non slip surface facing me and i will put my right hand over her ears and shoulders then i will place my left hand palm up under the abdomen just in front of the pelvic bones i will gently press upward with my fingers while pressing in from the side with my thumb this will bring the embryos if any into position between my thumb and fingers they feel something like grapes and are about that size or larger having detected the developing kits i will discontinue and return the doe to her cage i will not palpate the rabbit's left side with my right hand because it is too easy to mistake a kidney for a kit on that side you can also check the doe's vent if she is in the early stages of pregnancy her vent is usually small and pale though she may pink up again towards the end of her day pregnancy always check again on the th day after breeding if there is only fetus you may have missed it at weeks or the doe may have re absorbed her litter it is a good idea to leave a nest box with the doe just in case she is pregnant but keeping it a secret  Pregnancy Breastfeeding Dog Breech birth Guinea pig Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Fancy rat Obstetrics Days of our Lives Fast bowling Harp Platypus Poker jargon Chicken Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends Abortion Cephalic disorder Kakapo Elephant Diving Social rule Cat Menstrual cup Aerial (dance move) Boxing M16 (rifle) Ferret Frogman Stuttering Knife Rabbit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Miscarriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gesture Fertility awareness European Rabbit Knots Landing Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Violin Sexual reproduction Double bass Childbirth Humphrey Bogart Tetrapod Coeliac disease Japanese tea ceremony Spider Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Skateboarding trick Magic (illusion) Tarantula Menstrual cycle Abortion in the United States Trapping Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Oral sex Red Squirrel Milton H.

why does it cost so much for the average joe to go into space i would imagine because it would be an pleasure trip instead of a business one space missons are mostly conducted for scientific expeditions currently there really is no profit in it for someone to randomly pay for space travel and burial in space is often just as pricey as far as i understand maybe when there is a reason to visit space more often like extraterrestrials or interplanetary colonization i don't see a person being able to get past the aeronatics administration much less the upper atmosphere aside from that it's not cost effective even if there is a purpose currently it still takes billions of dollars and years of planning and research for space exploration besides a flight to space is extremely stressful on the body it takes top condition and specialized training before and after the launch for astronauts and aeronautic engineers even when they are in zero g they have a specialize workout routine now if you're talking about those plane rides where they visit the ozone layer they aren't technically space flights since they never leave the atmosphere of the earth what they do is fly up high then free fall causing a sense of zero g not the actual removal of gravity just the effect of it they are very expensive because it takes specialized planning an inherent risk to be had i think they make you sign a waiver and they haven't really paid off the specialized plane they built just for the trip if you ask me i don't think this generation will see many stars beyond what you can view laying in your yard at night a sad fact for us all  National Aeronautics and Space Administration Crew Exploration Vehicle Space exploration STS-62 Space Shuttle program International Space Station Terraforming Space colonization Space Race Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Gravity European Space Agency Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Colonization of the Moon Space elevator Ozone depletion Solar system Moon Jupiter Saturn V Hubble Space Telescope Ozone hole Weightlessness Cassini-Huygens Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Aircraft Space burial Scientology beliefs and practices Fermi paradox Mars Earth's atmosphere Unidentified flying object Space tourism Spacecraft propulsion Gliding National Weather Service Theory of conduct Apollo 15 Tide Project Orion Human adaptation to space Mir Flood geology Sun Solar power satellite Tier One Earth Venus Plame affair Exploration of Mars STS-107 Michael Griffin Planetary habitability Rocket Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Avalanche Scramjet Extraterrestrial life Insurance Galileo spacecraft Ozone layer Interplanetary travel Opportunity rover Broadband Internet access Life insurance Ionosphere Mercury (planet) Apollo 8 Cyberspace Helicopter Vulcan (Star Trek) Boeing X-43 STS-41 Causality Purdue University Global Positioning System STS-51-L STS-87 Space opera in Scientology doctrine Nuclear power Carl Sagan Science fiction film Model aircraft Public transport Solar variation Planet Mars Exploration Rover Car handling National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Robert Zubrin Decompression sickness David Leestma

newt tank still dirty after cleaning i just did a partial water change in my newt's gallon tank i was really annoyed though because even after that work it's still dirty it has little brown pieces of poo and some leftover bloodworms that he didn't eat floating around how do i get it clean do i have to take out the stones from the bottom and clean them is the filter still working right it's a gallon one and it was brand new a few weeks ago so it sould be fine is it harmful for my newt to be in kind of dirty water it may be harmful yes because poo releases certain types of gases that are generally not okay to be inhailed think of people working at a sewer treatment plant and how they have be aware of gasses around them i was thinking that it's possible the dirt and poo has wedged itself under the rocks or between the rocks and when you moved them it came floating up to the surface clean off the rocks to see if this helps test your filter in a seperate bowl to see if it's working right maybe do an experiment by mixing sand and water in a seperate bowl and putting the filer in if the sand is still there then you have a filter problem but my guess is there was hidden poo you didn't get when you cleaned it good luck  Sewage treatment Brewery Fire extinguisher Marine aquarium Aquarium Bong Biodiesel E85 Thermal power station Motor oil Vacuum cleaner Carbon dioxide Japanese tea ceremony Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Opportunity rover Shit Houseplant Leo Frank Fire fighting Hydrogen economy Tuff Carburetor Eutrophication Tank Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Water Conker's Bad Fur Day Hamster Axolotl Goldfish Sewer Anchor Slow sand filter bed Flush toilet Hemp Toilet Ocean thermal energy conversion Swimming pool Pollution M60 machine gun Coffee Glacier M16 (rifle) Glass Tobacco Queen (band) Air pollution General relativity Dirty Work (album) Dairy Ron and Fez Nuclear fallout Diesel Water (molecule) Toilet humour First Battle of the Atlantic Nuclear power Solar power Kenny McCormick Erosion P-47 Thunderbolt Clothing Diving suit Motorcycle Coal Portland cement Drawn Together Nuclear reactor Hydrogen sulfide Piccolo Junior Saga Dialysis Blonde on Blonde Wheel of Fortune Bread Geology of the Moon Casting Fast bowling Energy development Sand Squad Leader Stereoscopy Textile manufacturing Pitaten Scouting Heinkel He 100 Automobile emissions control Hazing American lobster Tina Turner Glossary of firefighting equipment Magical thinking Scuba set Oil platform Gasoline Cannabis cultivation Tooth Gowanus Canal

chinchilla cage location question i just bought a chinchilla last week and right now his cage is in my bedroom which isn't frequented by people except for myself at night i was wondering if i should move him to a more central location like the family room i have two dogs that bark a lot that are always in the family room so i'm not sure if this would scare the chinchilla thanks i let him out during the day and go in and hold him but i'm not sure if i should put him in a central location where people are around a lot talking etc i was reading that if they're in a place with a lot of noise that you need to cover them with a sheet during the day so they can rest this all depends on how old your chinchilla is if your chinchilla is still a baby i would sugest leaving in your room once it becomes old enough chinchillas usually like to see whats going on and they love to meet new people i also have two dogs who bark alot and my chinchilla barely notices them nothing really scares chinchillas also this is very important you have to remember to pay attention to the chinchilla makee sure that it has time to run and jump around when we first had our chinchilla we kida forgot about him so he became mean but he was still young so we trained him to olve us again i hope that answered your question  Chinchilla Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga The Curse of Fenric Shaggy dog story Rent (musical) The Champions She Loves You StarCraft: Uprising The Inside The Shining (film) Billboard Hot 100 Rich Mullins John Cage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

rabbit how to litter box train how to tell if it 's a boy or girl how to disipline we have a rabbit that is about months old now how do you go about litter box training or whatever you call it so that he can freely run around the house i hate locking him up all the time but i hate following him to pick up poop all the time also how can you tell if it's a boy or a girl and what do you do to discipline them when they bite or are chewing on something they shouldn't be the last thing i was wondering was can you train a rabbit to come by name also are you supposed to clip their toenails in his cage put a box with litter in it in the spot that he usually relieves himself in when a rabbit is mature the males usually have very noticeable testicles you can't miss them when they bite or chew pull them away and say no in a firm voice as you would with a cat or dog they may or may not learn to recognize their name it depends on the rabbit clip their toenails often otherwise walking on curved nails could be painful for them  Dog training The Inside Ferret Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy rat Garfield Milton H.

if something does not test on animals then how do they test their product do they test it on people and if so how because they must test it somehow and why dont other companies test their products in the same manner is it a money factor convienence factor or what yes they test it on people the company advertises for this and people come and test a product for a certain sum of money wage i think animal testing is done for a convenience factor and a little bit of a money influence dogs and cats can't sue you if something really bad happens when the product is tested on them i also imagine that having an animal to test on is cheaper than paying a human  Pharmaceutical company Gross domestic product Procter & Gamble Rabies Microeconomics Insurance Sweatshop Animal testing Contract Life insurance Heckscher-Ohlin model Inflation Credit card Supply and demand Capitalism Online marketing Economics Law of value Dairy Wal-Mart Food and Drug Administration Health insurance Television commercial People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Labour economics Factor analysis Ferret Rational pricing Fear Factor Free trade Opportunity cost Apple Computer Surplus value Person Medical malpractice Microsoft General intelligence factor Spyware Ecology Coca-Cola Explosive material Menstrual cycle Marketing research Tom Waits Measures of national income and output Keynesian economics Economic rent Pitaten Las Vegas Monorail Corporation Efficiency wages Welfare economics Social class Annuity Quality control Animal rights Walt Disney Capital accumulation Tariff Amway Normal distribution Nutrition Kashrut Continued fraction Deflation (economics) Organic composition of capital Dog intelligence Motivation Cat Education Socialization Technocratic movement Napster Automation Biodiesel Chuck Jones Huntingdon Life Sciences Factors of production Fair use Heartworm Prime number Means of production Parody advertisement Great Teacher Onizuka Urea 401(k) Pet skunk Traditional animation Education in the People's Republic of China Illegal drug trade Capital controversy Anthrax Principal-agent problem Model (economics) Commodity Graduate school Saturday morning cartoon Animal Liberation Front Mail fraud

what type of pet should i get click here please i was thinking about getting a dwarft bunny but then i changed my mind and i thought about getting a skinny pig i already have turtles cat and dog give me a estimate of how much everything would be if i got a bunny or a skinny pig thanks for your help i don't suggest you get a guinea pig or a dwarf rabbit to your cat and dog they pose as live food and will try to attack it if you must keep it out of reach but the scent of a predator in the house may scare them or stress it if your dog and cat is fine with prey animal then feel free to expose it to them always supervise but generally they don't do that especially dogs cats are better with rabbits but not dwarf rabbits dwarf rabbits are the same size as guinea pigs and will still look like live prey to them the cost isn't necessarily low either for all supplies i would say everything toys cage clean up litter food etc will cost up to dollars or more  Domestic rabbit Dog Hamster Cat Ferret Guinea pig Rabbit Pet Bugs Bunny Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Fox hunting Fancy rat Coprophagia Pig Who Framed Roger Rabbit Island Fox Brown Bear Taikyoku shogi Tyrannosaurus rex Invader Zim European Rabbit Hunting Domestication Animal communication Livestock Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Pet skunk Housebreaking Lion Meat KaBlam!

hamster help i want to save up and buy a pet hamster i need name ideas and a idea of the costs for the first month thanx for the first month the costs are the worst after that it's not so bad for the first month you'll need a new cage which give or take can run you from to so lets say and you'll need cage accessories like a wheel food bowl roll a bout wheel water bottle package of bedding package of food chew toys bed the actual hamster will cost you from to depending on the breed and the store you buy from i suggest buying from petco and to be wary of pet stores that want to sell you more than one hamster or a lot of extras that you won't really need i also suggest not buying a dwarf if you're a first time hamster owner because they are more difficult to tame serians and europeans seem to be more well suited for children's pets after the first month you should estimate buying one package of food and one package of bedding once a month a new chew toy once a week or once a month depending on the size of the chew toy you give them as well as one new toy or new bed every six months they will destroy the old ones and need replacements every now and then please research hamster care before buying one here's a great link on hamster care short sweet and easy to read http www petco com caresheets small animals hamster pdf another great thing to do before you buy anything is to research the products go to petsmart com and search hamsters below link when you see a product you like click on it and look for the words product review click on the words product review and there you can read what other people who bought that product had to say about it so this way you can dodge bad products and buy the good stuff first waste less time and money this way here's the link http www petsmart com global search search results jsp good luck  Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Ferret Animal testing Pet skunk Unemployment Plastic The Apprentice 2 Guinea pig Chinchilla Bulk vending Pet store The Joker's Wild Capital accumulation Dog training Mouse (computing) IPod Best Buy Dog Energy development Wal-Mart Organic food Illegal drug trade Dairy Milk Cat Pet Wheel of Fortune Cruising (maritime) Sewage treatment People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Tobacco Trademark Golden Hamster Alcoholic beverage Mattress Commodore 64 Neopets Microeconomics Nuclear power Password Gaia Online Married... with Children PETCO Park Gross domestic product Wealth Nintendo Homestar Runner Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Dollar store Equine conformation Famine O scale Floppy disk Hydrogen economy Copy protection Labour economics The Skeptical Environmentalist Capitalism Drag racing PHP RuneScape economy Ashton-Tate Stuttering Bread Fish farming UK Singles Chart Portable Document Format Web crawler Privatization My Little Pony Nintendo DS Slashdot trolling phenomena Gmail Hyperinflation Daylight saving time MapleStory Commodore International Breastfeeding Canary Fugu Inflation Final Fantasy XI Japanese tea ceremony Spyware CPU cache Our Gang Boston and Lowell Railroad Great Teacher Onizuka Theory of conduct Discus (fish) Ice cream Agriculture Common Agricultural Policy

how much does it cost to have a pet euthanized dont criticize this has been one of the hardest decisions i have ever had to make my cat is very sick and is skin bones it looks like one of those poor animals you see on the the aspca animal cops shows this is the sweetest cat my husband and i have ever owned and it really bothers us he has a tumor the size of a lemon in his stomach martinamagrace its a male years old and like i said he has a tumor it can be fixed for and they said that theres a very big chance he could pass during surgery also they said that after the surgery he would probably only live to months oh and its name is clouds why does it bother you that i didnt mention that jordan s he has a tumor he has no room for food he trys to eat but cannot keep it down dont be rude unless you know the whole situation do you think that i would just let him starve without taking him to the vet to see whats wrong oh and they suggested it thank you the cost wouldn't be more than cdollars now this may sound foolish and childish but it helps me its a poem about where animals go when its time for the final goodbye just this side of heaven is a place called rainbow bridge when an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here that pet goes to rainbow bridge there are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together there is plenty of food water and sunshine and our friends are warm and comfortable all the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by the animals are happy and content except for one small thing they each miss someone very special to them who had to be left behind they all run and play together but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance his bright eyes are intent his eager body quivers suddenly he begins to run from the group flying over the green grass his legs carrying him faster and faster you have been spotted and when you and your special friend finally meet you cling together in joyous reunion never to be parted again the happy kisses rain upon your face your hands again caress the beloved head and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart then you cross rainbow bridge together  Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sin City Cat Dog Care Bears Pitaten Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Fancy rat Ferret Shaggy dog story Salad Fingers Prostate cancer Doris Day Piccolo Junior Saga Aerial (dance move) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Garfield Cliff Richard Friends W.I.T.C.H.

do you have any information on an animal sacrifice this weekend while at my husbands parents farm an incident happened with their horse thursday the horse was found trapped in their bob wire fence they got her out and started to treat her wounds and she seemed to be doing fine early saturday morning the horse was found dead in the pasture this may be a little gruesome so stop reading this now if you are squeamish when they found her they said her throat was slit and there was no blood in sight it seemed as though someone had drained the blood also her ear was cut off and so were her genital area the police were involved and took a full report but said there wasn t any evidence and i m sure not much will happen anyway we are assuming that this is cult related and may have been an animal sacrifice does anyone know who or what kind of people may want to do this i m hoping to find some information on what kind of people would do this thank you for all for your answers they are greatly appreciated this took place in ruston louisiana sorry i did not mention that before also my mother in law called one of the animal protection programs in that area i m not sure exactly who she called about the matter i m sure she will not rest until she finds someone to help catch the people who did this to her horse this saturday was also my sister in laws wedding so not only were we busy preparing for that but we were also dealing with this situation i mentioned to my mother in law that she should get the media involved so everyone in that area is on a look out to watch for their cattle and horse there has been an increase world wide in the number of animal mutilations that occur but it is not related to any cult it is the work of sick individuals who get their kicks from hurting defensless animals i hope that every one of them is caught and punished if they are doing this to animals they will do it to people once the thrill of hurting animals does not give them a big enough high  Female genital cutting Sin City Cattle mutilation EastEnders Cindy Sheehan Captain Thunderbolt Sacrifice Capital punishment Theory of conduct Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Domestic violence Fox hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animism Supernatural Milton H.

will rabbits eat more in warmer or colder temp why rabbits do eat more in winter colder weather then in summer they need more calories to maintain their body temperature in colder weather bunnies have a body temperature of degrees rabbits also drink more water in winter they need more water to help digest the extra food you will be able to feel how much heavier the litter pan is too i was amazed when we moved from the arid dessert to a colder climate how much of a change there was in my bunnies one thing to remember is that you need to feed more in the winter but not over feed you do not want a fat bunny and the health problems associated with a fat bunny i noticed that all of my bunnies thrived in the cooler temperature they played more too when it is warmer they tend to lie around more just like me  Bird migration Climate of the United Kingdom Water Thermoregulation Temperature Domestic rabbit Albedo El Ni__o Chocolate Ice age Temperate Milankovitch cycles Severe weather terminology (United States) Guinea pig Warm-blooded Weather front Little Ice Age Urban heat island Latitude Breastfeeding K__ppen climate classification Global warming Hamster Cat Alcoholic beverage Water (molecule) Coffee Customs and etiquette of Japan Atlanta metropolitan area Swimming Tofu Geography of Poland Anorexia nervosa Healthy eating Soft drink Geography of Peru California Geography of India Dieting Rabbit Global climate model Nutrition Dog Season Ozone depletion Global warming and agriculture Geography of Chile Geography of Spain Goblin Valley State Park Obesity Climate of Salt Lake City Oxnard, California Anchorage, Alaska Winter Cloud Dead Sea Taboo food and drink Autonomous building Effects of global warming Fancy rat Hypoglycemia Standard enthalpy change of fusion Western Canada Climate of the Alps Ozone hole Swimming pool Energy Veganism Arizona Seabird Egg (food) Humidity Sorghum Astronomy on Mars E85 Calorie Cereal Capercaillie Robert Falcon Scott Weather lore Diving suit Relative humidity Hyperthermia Tuatara Omega-3 fatty acid Milk Toronto Diamond dust Climate of Antarctica Ice cream Vermicompost Beer Quang Ninh Province Hibernation Roman eating and drinking Gondwana Fat Antarctic krill Motor oil

calm a horse down on the trail i'm a reasonably experienced rider riding for about yrs and recently i've started riding at this place that does trail rides and lets me come and take horses out on the trailes on my own the horses are pretty responsive on their own except when we get fairly close to home the horse starts to get excitable wanting to gallop home and start prancing it's hard for me to get them to just relax and not gallop home because if i relax in the saddle they start to run and i don't want to be constantly pulling on the reins or have really close contact it's western and circling only seems to distract them momentarily are there any tricks i can use to get them to be much calmer on the way home our rides usually last about an hour and we gallop canter part of the way home then start to walk for a bit but once we get really close the problems start to arise i'm only out on the trails with them so i don't really have acess to an arena to work with them before hand running home to be fed to see barn pals or just to be done is a horrible habit that many public trail horses seem to have quite frankly it's irritating green riders often let horses get away with such things for fear of correcting them or because it's fun to race back to the barn unfortunately unless you are the only person riding this horse i wouldn't expect this issue to resolve quickly if you are the only person riding this horse then i can offer some advice on how to fix this horse's nasty habit it can be very upsetting to deal with an excitable hot horse you try to pull and they fight it you try to slow them down and they prance in place in the back of your mind you know you should relax but you are nervous too start with the simplest thing to fix no cantering or galloping home as soon as you start back to the barn even if it's a hour away no running that said lope your little heart out once you are a good distance away from the barn on the first stretch of your ride try to really spend your horse's energy before you even turn around to come home now i said lope for a reason when you are trail riding one fun gallop up a hill is acceptable but tons of galloping and cantering up and down and around causes your horse's brain to go out the window all a hot horse wants to do is run run run so don't let him lope a lot trot walk second problem the horse's familiarity with the trip home this horse clearly knows what's going to happen because you are obviously very routine about it you canter part way home then you walk because you don't want to sprint for the barn your horse thinks okay we're starting to walk i'll be able to see the barn in minutes yesssss find a new way home even if you have to weave in and out of trees find a new way home now even with a new path home the horse may still bounce up and down with excitement at the sight of the barn when this happens stop the horse turn around and head for the hills do not reward your horse by riding to the barn you can both quietly walk to the barn or you can go back to the trails once the horse calms down turn back towards the barn if the horse gets jumpy again stop back up and turn around this will certainly become a mind game for the both of you you cannot overpower a horse but you can win the mental battle hopefully your horse will give in and walk to the barn don't let him when your horse is willing to approach the barn at a walk find a place to trot and lope some round pen sized circles work the horse as if he were on the arena flat circle to the left and to the right for minutes each way then once again turn the horse back towards the trail walk him away from the barn for about minutes dismount and lead him to the barn to break this habit you will need to be very patient never get off at the same place two days in a row and always dismount with the horse facing away from the barn don't run on the way back to the barn and don't give in hope this helps best luck  Milton H.

my cat always bothers my dog my cat always bothers my dog like trying to scratch him or chasing and biting his tail it's really bothering me and proly him my cat is about months old and even tho i try and stop her she never listens to me help this is normal behavior for animals the cat is trying to establish its place in the hierarchy of the family since it is a kitten and still learning the dog is likely allowing it to go unchecked in time the cat will exceed the limit and the dog will take charge and inform the cat in no uncertain terms just how much it can get away with don't be surprised if it seems like they are about to kill each other they won't after this happens you should have many years of respectful attitude for each between the two  Cat Socialization Manx (cat) Dog Puma Leopard Feral Gray Wolf Garfield Kitten Dog training Azumanga Daioh Domestic rabbit Obedience training Pet skunk Domestication Lion Philosophy of language Minor Harry Potter Beasts Catgirl Cheetah Tom and Jerry (MGM) Rabies Saga (band) Hybrid Mickey Mouse Krypto the Superdog Greyhound Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog show Pack (canine) Serial killer Leopard Cat Housebreaking People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Alignment (role-playing games) An American Tail Regular expression Guinea pig Treecat Hamster Pirate radio Heartworm Dog agility Ren and Stimpy RuneScape quests Animal communication Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Kakapo Cats (musical) Randomness Spot the Dog Fancy rat Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Shaggy dog story Tooth enamel Richard Chase Animal rights Semiconductor device Speed of light 2000 Australian Grand Prix Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Serval Musical mode American Alligator Morphology (linguistics) Oliver and Company Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Object (computer science) Ron and Fez Tokyo Mew Mew Giovanni (Pok__mon) Schutzhund Pet Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Sonic the Hedgehog Taboo food and drink Feral child The Jetsons Spotted Skunk Spider-Man Comparative psychology Elektra (comics) Mixed-breed dog The Marshall Mathers LP B3ta Joseph Smith, Jr. Thermoregulation Behaviorism God Emperor of Dune Marilyn Monroe The Smoking Room Mystique (comics) Siamese (cat) Maka dai dai shogi Louis Wain Life expectancy

any ideas for an unusual pet i want to get a pet not many people have that is friendly and tame it has to be exotic or really surprising preferably the size of a small dog many animals frequently sold as exotics are not well suited to be pets and would be better off without human interaction do not choose an animal just because it is exotic or rare research as many species as possible and always keep the animal's best interest in mind sure an arctic fox may seem really neat but are you really able to provide an adequate enclosure and ensure the fox won't be miserable once summer comes it's important to keep in mind why you've never seen xyz exotic animal kept by anyone too exotic animals are usually only one or two generations removed from the wild if that and are not considered domesticated by any means those factors don't make for a tame and trustworthy pet exotics usually require specialized enclosures and nutrition and finding a veterinarian experienced with exotics can be challenging while i do not believe that exotics should never be kept as pets it's important to remember all of the specialized care that goes into them and that most people are not capable of providing adequate care  Pet skunk Veterinarian Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Dog Cat Domestication Zoo Feral cat Ferret Microchip implant (animal) Monkey Fox Introduced species Fox hunting Arctic Hunting Island Fox Taboo food and drink Tooth enamel Animal rights Biodiversity Pet Veterinary medicine Rabies Gray Wolf Pet store Rabbit Animal testing Theory of conduct Skunk Guns, Germs, and Steel Domestication of the horse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Password Dairy Phantom cat Marine biology Animal shelter Chicken Final Fantasy XI Garfield Social psychology Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Human height Prehistoric Britain Bicycle lighting Dream Malignant melanoma Kashrut Monster Rancher monsters Veganism Tattoo Pig Comparative psychology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rat Loudspeaker Perfect Dark Floppy disk Bat Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Wombat Gambling Human Animal cognition Requirements analysis Working dog Publicly funded medicine Elephant Animal Farm Gerald Durrell Treecat Peter Singer Empathy Heartworm Neolithic Psychosis Socialization Neopets Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Nutrition Shrimp farm Particle physics Hypoglycemia NetHack House Artificial selection Hash table Chinchilla Education in the United States Stone Age Motivation Whaling Fennec

is it normal for my bunny to have black skin my bunny has been losing a little of its fur nd ive noticed a few days ago that her skin is black is that normal do some bunnies have black skin yes it's totally normal but what's not normal is that your bunny is losing much fur did you take her to the veterinarian for a check up there could be many reasons why your rabbit could be losing too much fur the most obvious reason would be as you mention that your rabbit is just shedding rabbits shed their coat every three months and a light shedding is followed by a heavy shedding then again a light shedding heavy shedding and so on there seems to be significant differences in the way rabbits shed some rabbits may shed completely in a week but with others it will take two weeks or even several weeks to complete their shedding process also some rabbits will get some bald spots here and there while shedding others can get even almost completely bald when they moult and still others will show no bald spots at all another reason that this could be happening is that maybe your bunny could have an allergy to a specific food fur mites stress or ring worm you should take her to the veterinarian to see what is going on or if it's just a process of shedding otherwise it might be an allergy or fur mites but my old bunny used to have pink and black skin mixed together and since i took her to the veterinarian every month he noticed it a couple of times and didn't really say anything bad about it if your veterinarian says that your rabbit has fur loss from stress related symptoms prevent this to prevent stress results from boredom keep in mind that a rabbit should get at least to hours of supervised free time outside the cage daily in the living room bunny proof the room i e make sure electrical cords are hidden or covered with tubing and that you should provide your bunny with plenty of toys such as twigs from untreated apple trees cardboard boxes untreated wicker baskets and so forth but if it's not because of stress listen to your veterinarian and do as he she says about your rabbit's fur loss good luck sweety and to your rabbit as well  Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Allergy Moult Dog Cat Hamster Poker jargon Diseases of the honeybee Dairy Ferret Acne Manx (cat) Prostate cancer Asthma Hypoglycemia Pet skunk Breastfeeding Baldness Psoriasis Menstrual cycle Medical prescription Heartworm House dust mite Herpes simplex virus Livestock Hair Animal testing Insulin Fur Thermal power station Trapping Ozone depletion Clinical depression Human skin color Gaia Online Cat coat genetics Bugs Bunny Diode Childbirth Spina bifida Ultraviolet Migraine Eczema Ozone hole Rabbit Scientology beliefs and practices Leather Milk Leaf Winter Radiation therapy Christmas tree Aluminium Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Senescence Tire Cancer RuneScape quests Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Capercaillie Group A streptococcal infection Multiple sclerosis Traumatic brain injury Chinchilla Casting Psychiatric hospital Thermoregulation Honeybee Stoat Vitamin C Coeliac disease Garfield Myxobolus cerebralis Invader Zim Diabetes mellitus Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Textile manufacturing terminology Transformer Cephalic disorder Medicine Canary Audiophile Stopping power Kitten Shetland Sheepdog Big Brother (Australian TV series) Jumpstart 3rd Grade

week almost week old bunny today i was out with the rabbits and i saw one of the female bunnies sniffing the grey bunnies ass about hours later i went out and the grey one attacked me none of the other bunnies did and im worried she might be pregnant we took them to the vets about days ago and the vets think that there is one boy the boy is going tomorrow is it possible that he could have made the grey bunny pregnant absolutely bunnies multiply well like rabbits they don't have to be very old and it only takes one male one minute and you will be the mom to a few kits you need to watch your young bunny take her to the vet or ask the vet if she is old enough or if it will cause her any problems she may eat the young bunnies if she is too young when they are born or they may be stillborn but bunnies do it so well you may end up with healthy bunnies if so you need to find homes for them right away or you will end up with a house full of rabbits again  Rabbit Bugs Bunny Guinea pig Baby Blues Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Kangaroo Ferret Tiny Toon Adventures Sluggy Freelance Babs and Buster Bunny Goatse.cx Jean Grey Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Family from One End Street Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Red Squirrel House Mouse Wile E.

what is the best walking solution for ferrets ferrets are crafty little things and are likely to slip out of a leash or harness unless it's on fairly tight if you really want to walk your ferret just make sure it's on tight and keep them in the house for a bit while you tote them around on it eventually the ferret will try to wriggle out and if they succeed at least it happened inside the house and not outside where it's harder to catch them longer term ferrets who have been in the house and have little exposure to the outside world seem to get overwhelmed and may try to stick by you though my two ferrets shiver in excitement and perhaps nervousness when i take them outside bottom line just make sure the harness is tight enough that they can't get out and obviously that they're able to breathe okay  Ferret 1957 World Series Dog training Strap-on dildo Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Housebreaking Horse Glossary of climbing terms Aerial (dance move) World Series Rabies Poker jargon 2000 Australian Grand Prix Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Ai Yori Aoshi Internal ballistics Falconry Gag (BDSM) Leash New York Giants Textile manufacturing Car handling Badger Billiards Have I Got News For You Sluggy Freelance Glossary of American football Hydrogen sulfide Undergarment Knife Snowboard Static Shock Frogman Surfing Kitesurfing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving 101 Dalmatians: The Series Modem Sinfest High-heeled shoe Ecco the Dolphin Boom Town (Doctor Who) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Breathing gas Futurama (TV series - season 2) Drifting (motorsport) Buttocks Decompression sickness Malibu Comics Electrophysiology Working animal Wheel of Fortune Horse tack Hyperthermia Hedgehog First aid Action potential Professional wrestling holds Ozzy Osbourne Social rule Ferret armoured car Paranoia Agent American football strategy Pittsburgh Pirates The Death Gate Cycle Offensive team Sandy Koufax Fecal incontinence X-ray Brewery Paratrooper Horse gait The Shining (film) Queen (band) Diver Propulsion Vehicle War of the Worlds (2005 film) Reptile Hulk (comics) Diving suit The Dalek Invasion of Earth Sprint (race) Harmonica Babe Ruth Characters in the Smurfs IPod Marching percussion Rammstein Trapping Ultima Online Robert Fripp Tight end Nerve agent Lung cancer The Vile Village Empire Burlesque Blood (computer game) Carbon dioxide

why do mosquitos put venim in after they suck blood i wouldn't mind if they just came and feasted on my delicious blood and then buzzed off but why do they have to put that itchy stuff in afterwards i have been told it's to stop the bleeding but first of all such a tiny pin prick what bleeding and second why would a mozzy care about me bleeding this question just came to me last night when i couldn't sleep because of one of these annoying lil buggers i did know how to spell venom d it's that ole typo i instead of o thing heehee no one is going to believe me wheee so they put the venom in first i always thought they did it afterwards as a thank you the mosquito's saliva contains an anticoagulant to stop your blood from clotting otherwise it wouldn't be ble to feed on your blood our immune system then releases a chemical called histamines to fight off the foreign substance histamines cause the blood vessels near the bite to swell and it also irritates the nerve endings which is why the area around the bite itches see the web link for a diagram and more info http www washingtonpost com wp dyn content graphic gr html the best and cheapest rememdy that i have found for dealing with mosquito bites is to soak a wash cloth in very very hot water the water should be as hot as you can bear and then a little more place the wash cloth over the affected area hold it there until you feel the bites tingle this will feel very good this is because the heat causes all the histamine the protein used by the body to initiate immune responses which include irritation and itching in the skin surrounding the bite to be released at once this is the tingling sensation the skin around the bite is therefore deprived of histamine until it can make more about hours and the itching subsides the web site below offers other suggestions on how to relieve the itching http www wikihow com get rid of a mosquito bite  Mosquito Allergy Mast cell Malaria First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Histamine Eczema Hay fever Stomach cancer Urticaria Stroke Hematophagy Inflammation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Rosacea Scabies HyperText Transfer Protocol Mastocytosis Bedbug Cirrhosis Conjunctivitis Urinary incontinence Wound healing phases Immune system Pain Intravenous therapy Homeopathy Cancer Breastfeeding Vampire Leech Autoimmune diseases World Wide Web Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spider Methamphetamine Acne Blood (computer game) Tarantula Multiple sclerosis Enzyme Fecal incontinence Carpal tunnel syndrome Skin Asthma Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Tick Anticoagulant Aspartame Jock itch Shark Rheumatoid arthritis Chemotherapy Dialysis Textile manufacturing Yarrow Schistosoma mansoni Tattoo Menstrual cycle Cat Bladderwort Sauna Web server Blood Chronic fatigue syndrome Leukemia Vomiting Basophil granulocyte Diabetic neuropathy Group A streptococcal infection Cocaine Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Crab louse Alcoholism Platelet Menstrual cup Blood vessel Marilyn Monroe Lyme disease Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eye Ebola The Star Wars Holiday Special Website Pneumonia Childbirth Crohn's disease Endometriosis Schistosomiasis

what will my rabbit do with her older babies my rabbit had a litter of six on th of july my rabbits are in a shed i let my female rabbit out of her cage in the shed for a run round but the other day the male broke out of his cage and they were mating when i found them im really worried that bunny may now be pregnant if she is what will she do with her other babies when she has new ones i dont want to take the st litter away from her to soon does anyone know what age they can leave thier mum and what age can they be held also does anyone know if bunny will harm her oldest babies when the new ones are born if she is pregnant if anone has any advice please help im worried wow how irresponsible well to answer your question the mother will push the kits to wean earlier due to the strain on her body from the nursing kits and the pregnancy depending on the breed of rabbit some can wean as early as weeks but just because you see babes eating and drinking does not mean they are weaned so make sure you are certain they are fully weaned before moving them they should be fine to stay with mom when she starts nesting she will kick them out of the nest box and most likely keep them out and away from it does are pregnant for days so as that date gets closer start keeping an eye on mom and how she is acting towards her older kits rabbits are social creatures and should not harm her older kits but will push them away to some degree as the time draws near mom will need to be well fed and would be a good idea to get suppliments to add to her water for extra vitamins minerals etc due to the extreme strain of having nursing kits and supporting a pregnancy rabbits are reflex ovulators so chances are she is in fact pregnant i would strongly recommend getting her fixed after she kindles births so no further accidents happen as well as getting your buck fixed something else to keep in mind is that those babies will need to be seperated by sex at months old to prevent inbreeding between siblings to sex the kits grab the kit by the scruff of the neck and gently support the rump on a table hold the tail between your index and middle fingers and gently press down on the front part farthest from the tail of the genital mound you will see either a round hole or a pole in the male and a slit in the female aslo by three months most breeds of rabbit will start to drop their testicles which will appear as small hairless bumps on either side of the genital mound hopefully you are able to find a home for all these babies and are more careful in the future  Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Guinea pig Hamster Dog Cat Elephant House Mouse EastEnders Ferret Rabbit Chicken Condom Abortion debate Pregnancy Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Red Squirrel Poker jargon Herpes simplex virus Characters of Lost Pet skunk Kitten Cephalic disorder Menstrual cycle RuneScape quests Strap-on dildo Platypus Horse Professional wrestling holds Red Fox Prostate cancer Social rule Childbirth Oral sex Friends Professional wrestling throws Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gray Wolf Kangaroo European Rabbit Folic acid Knots Landing Fox hunting Melanie Wilkes Manx (cat) Cytomegalovirus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tigon Child sexuality Tocopherol Chinchilla Capercaillie Spina bifida Obstetrics Sea-Monkey Humpback Whale Psoriasis Violin Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Kevin and Kell Hazing Oral contraceptive Dairy Aye-aye Days of our Lives Cheetah Transsexuality Menstrual cup Sexual orientation Birth control Koala Premature birth Humphrey Bogart Masturbation Carpal tunnel syndrome M16 (rifle) Fecal incontinence Richard Chase Fasting Vitamin C Rigging Nerpa Backstroke American lobster Toxoplasmosis Mountain Gorilla Happy Tree Friends Vampire Glossary of American football Sin City Giant Panda Tasmanian Devil

has anyone come into contact with a lipizzaner i was wondering about the breed i usually ride a lipizzaner when i go riding in hungary where they are extremely common hungarians refer to them as a hungarian breed a claim they share with the austrians they mature late like arabians and they tend to be very highly spirited the year old stallion i was riding threw me twice but he was a magnificent creature to behold even as i was flying through the air they have tremendous endurance much like arabians and andalusians which have related ancestors buying a lipizzaner in the usa is prohibtively expensive however you can snatch them up for eu in hungary though you need to have them transported overseas if you intend for them to go to the usa along with fresians which i tend to ride more in the czech republic lipizzaners are my favorite pleasure riding horse however you have to enjoy a bit of a contest with them as they do try to show you who's boss at first  Lipizzan Horse Arabian horse Magyars Hungary Dressage Andalusian horse Equine conformation Akhal-Teke Austria-Hungary Thoroughbred Heinkel He 112 Mixed-breed dog Kingdom of Hungary Domestication of the horse Austria Connemara pony Slovenia Czechoslovakia Welsh Cob (Section D) Vienna ICAO airline code Eurovision Song Contest Santa Claus Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

are dalmations good dogs i am thinking about getting a dalmation from my local humane society could someone give me a website or something with some info many thanks god bless yes dalmations are wonderful dogs the dalmation is an active energetic dog that enjoys lots of exercise dalmations are people like and people oriented and they do best when given the opportunity to spend lots of time with and around their families they're rather sensitive too if a dalmation is what you're craving for be prepared to make him part of your life both indoor and outdoor dalmations love to play and play and play as most dalmations they don't get tired very easily but a lot of play will help dalmatians shed lots of hair year round their stiff short hairs cling to most surfaces and weave their way into fabrics making them difficult to remove shedding can be reduced by giving the dog a brisk five minute daily brushing outdoors dalmatians are natural dogs cat like in cleanliness and free of doggy odor their toenails should be kept trimmed as they grow rapidly long nails are understandably uncomfortable for any dog dals may object to having their nails trimmed unless they are trained early but it must be done frequent brushing helps to keep them clean without disturbing their protective skin oils during their daily brushing check eyes and ears for irritation also during warm weather check for fleas and ticks while outdoors frequent bathing especially with harsh soaps can lead to dry skin and skin problems in dalmatians most dals clean up well with a damp towel or the use of a plain gentle soap be sure to rinse very well as soapy residue will irritate the skin ask your vet to show you how to empty the anal sacks this procedure should be done whenever you bathe your dalmatian in order to avoid infection about food for your dalmation it's pretty simple there are as many brand preferences as there are dalmatian breeders but there are some generalizations that can be made the authors and other breeders have had good success with premium dry type foods pro plan nutro eagle purina one natures recipe etc because they contain high quality ingredients like real meats instead of meat meal and because they minimize the amount of purines corn meal soy meal meat by products and preservatives the dog seems to make better use of the premium brand foods therefore generating less fecal waste dalmatians do not generally require canned dog food however it is sometimes useful in encouraging the finicky eater do not feed your dalmatian foods with cute colors and shapes as these require additives that may cause or aggravate skin allergy conditions further information on food choices may be found in the medical problems section under the discussion of the unique urinary characteristics of the dalmatian breed please feel free to share your food success stories with us especially if you live in a country other then the united states dalmatians usually eat very quickly and most seem to be always hungry and as a result do not do well with self feeding this can lead to overweight dogs with higher incidences of medical problems later in life adult dals should be fed either once or twice preferred a day from to cups total depending on their weight and activity level some adult females do well on as little as cups of food per day most puppies do better with smaller daily servings your breeder should tell you how often how much they were feeding when you pick up your puppy if you want more information on dalmations you can go to these sites that are really helpful http www ehow com how care dalmatian html http www ehow com tips html http www dogpage us dalmatian htm http www dog names org uk dalmatian htm http dogs puppies dogs central com dalmatian puppy http www canismajor com dog dal html  Fancy rat Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Menstrual cup Halitosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Dairy Tofu Veganism Dalmatian Food Soap Pet skunk Havanese Gas metal arc welding Stomach cancer Insulin Vegetarianism Labrador Retriever Tooth Strap-on dildo Sewage treatment Shampoo Milk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Hot dog Textile manufacturing Manicure Tire Anopheles Chicken Coeliac disease Hiking XML Acne Keeshond Mattress Garfield Radiation therapy Comanche Crohn's disease Mosquito Diabetes mellitus Customs and etiquette of Japan Cannabis cultivation Dialysis Cancer Mixed-breed dog Tattoo Physical attractiveness Housebreaking Tick Basset Hound Tarantula Kosher foods Dog training Anorexia nervosa Equine conformation Bong Agriculture Carburetor Organic farming Peanut Ferret Hypoglycemia Diving Hair Violin First aid American Eskimo Dog Biodiesel Nuclear power Egg (food) Diseases of the honeybee Brewery Infantilism Dog agility Sauna Animal testing Certified Nursing Assistant

indiscriminate breeders female dog or cats can produce to litters a year on average male dog or cats can contribute to litters a year what should be done to stop people from allowing their animals to breed indriscriminantly and then expect the tax payers to pick up the tab for their irresponsible behavior btw calling them no kill shelters is misleading it just means that they take the animals to a vet to euthanized they don't do it on site there is not much that can be done other than try harder to enforce the fact that it is an outrage breeders are all about the almighty inbreeding has caused many breeds german shepherds etc to have agression problems hip dysplasia and a host of other disconcerting things i for one would like to inflict pain on some of these greedy people  Dog Mixed-breed dog German Shepherd Dog Cat Dobermann Domestic rabbit Selective breeding Manx (cat) Breed registry Pet skunk Guinea pig Labrador Retriever Dog breed Docking Ferret Border Collie People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals House Mouse Gray Wolf Socialization Havanese Border Terrier English Springer Spaniel Livestock Fancy rat Beagle Puppy mill Hybrid Animal shelter Golden Retriever Liger Belgian Shepherd Dog Bernese Mountain Dog Pet store Kitten Whippet Tibetan Mastiff Dachshund American Pit Bull Terrier Black panther Rabbit Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Great Dane Maine Coon Dog show Australian Shepherd Puma Animal testing Tigon Obedience training Dog breeding Inbreeding Lethal injection Alaskan Malamute Tobacco smoking Lion Italian Greyhound Show cat Basset Hound Estrus cycle Ice hockey Smooth Collie Feral cat Fox hunting Equine conformation Microchip implant (animal) Dog training Domestic violence Sunday Silence Animal husbandry Euthanasia Monster Rancher monsters Pit bull American Kennel Club Agriculture English Setter Microeconomics Domestic goat Keeshond Life expectancy Herding dog Griffon Bruxellois Cheetah Domestication Police dog Greyhound Rescue group Boxer (dog) Taboo food and drink Horse Hunting Pekingese Siberian Husky Domestic sheep Laika German Shorthaired Pointer Working dog

how old does a hermans tortoise have to be before they are allowed outside tortoises are no longer kept as they used to be living outside you should never house your tortoise outside as our temperatures are too low and out winters are too long so you should always house them inside in a vivarium but if it is a hot day and you are in the garden you can take them out with you for a few hours but keep a close eye on them but ever be tempted to take your eyes off them as they can bury them selves so quickly and you can easily lose track of them  Reptile Tortoise Quang Ninh Province Solar power Astronomy on Mars Sun Harvey Comics Hypothermia Avalanche Incandescent light bulb Climate of the United Kingdom Casting Welding Season Blue Peter Hamster Spacecraft propulsion Billboard Hot 100 Severe weather terminology (United States) Turtle Optical fiber Tea Sleep Sento Timekeeping on Mars Fluorescent lamp Cao Cao Knife Diseases of the honeybee Hot air balloon Hun-Apu Bugs Bunny 1925 serum run to Nome Motor oil Gangtok Stirling engine Cliveden Key West, Florida Liquid crystal Bread Cypress Gardens Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Quotation mark Pete Herman Lake District Goldfish Mercury Atlas 6 Internal ballistics Capercaillie The Queen of Spades Blackjack Cecil Turtle Polyethylene terephthalate Japanese tea ceremony Eldfell Tortoise (tank) Heat Stereoscopy Vacuum tube Airbag Sauna Tortoise (band) Mojave Desert Balliol College, Oxford Thermal power station Geography of Spain Compost Passive solar Steel Perth, Western Australia Common cold Pottery Tank classification Hard disk Big Bang Rathfarnham Grande Prairie, Alberta Kasparov versus The World Toowoomba, Queensland Gerald Durrell Greenhouse Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival Apollo 13 Leviathan Venus Turkish Van Iranian architecture Mycoplasma Sundial Air-raid shelter Poker jargon Tank Electrophysiology Monsoon Operation Market Garden Fertility awareness Spark plug Turbojet Dry Tortugas Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station

i know bunnies eat salads but is it safe to put salad dressing on it i want to know but i don't want to expirement i don't want my bunny to get ill no you should not put dressing on it in fact a salad is not all that good for them iceberg lettuce does not have any nutritional value for a rabbit it is also high in water and can cause loose droppings you can give some veggies as a snack such as carrots they love apples for a treat actually dandelion greens and flowers are very good for rabbits they have potassium in them so basically like bunny bananas you can also add hay or alfalfa cubes to vary their diet many of the pet store rabbit feeds contain corn which is not good for rabbits and is more or less a filler there are many other more healthy alternatives to salad for your rabbit best of luck with your bunny  Guinea pig Hamster Salad Rabbit Hamburger Potato McDonald's Cuisine of the Southern United States Alfalfa Fancy rat Salad Fingers Food Lettuce Potassium Sauerkraut Tofu Hypoglycemia Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography One Piece minor characters Cuisine of Denmark Escherichia coli O157:H7 Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Jewish cuisine Bread Kevin and Kell Easter Bunny Bugs Bunny Atkins Nutritional Approach Chinese New Year Healthy eating Sodium chloride Cat In-N-Out Burger Tomato Food preservation Japanese tea ceremony Egg (food) Taboo food and drink Trans fat Kiwifruit Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Laos Apple Hay Carrot The Rabbit of Seville Dandelion Burdock Acorn Mango Goldfish Cuisine of Malaysia Organic farming German cuisine Sluggy Freelance Peanut Flowering plant Mel Blanc Banana Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Singapore Tiny Toon Adventures Meal Bearded Dragon Chocolate Sauce Brandy and Mr. Whiskers Nutrient Pig (zodiac) Milk Sprouting The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Goatse.cx Vegetarianism Internet phenomenon Domesticated turkey Serbian cuisine Sandwich Shit Watermelon Care Bears Fruit Natural health Organic food Silage Ramen Caesar salad French cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Spidey Super Stories Stomach cancer Electrophysiology

how many pet owners here still vaccinate their dogs cats yearly i've done lots of research on this and have decided to no longer vaccinate my dogs every year once they've received all of their puppy vaccines and their one year booster i was just wondering how many others have done the same http www critteradvocacy org are we over vaccinating our pets htm http www naturalanimal ca new archives archive htm it's not only me but many vets in our area are beginning to see the problems associated with over vaccinating and have been changing their protocol some now recommend vaccinating every to years instead of every year do you vaccinate your children when they're a little older after they've already received all of their childhood vaccinations no you don't and you don't get shots yourself anymore either because you got them all when you were little right and you've now got antibodies in your body to fight off these diseases so why would your pets and their immune systems be any different truth is they aren't we're in the process of finding a new vet my current vet shudders at raw and won't do titer testing to see if the dogs actually need to be re vaccinated they can't it through their heads that its not a money issue its a health issue they keep telling me that having titers done is more expensive than just vaccinating i tell them that's not the point and we go round and round last time we were in with one of my labs and i practically had to beg them to do blood work and then they didn't even do the one specifially asked for was the last straw kind of got off topic there but as soon as we find a new vet no the dogs won't get shots every year rather they'll have a titer to test to determine immunity leves and if they are on the low side then we'll vaccinate rabies have to do that every years by law what alot of people on yahoo don't realize is that vaccines last for much much longer than a year in both people and dogs after that first series when your a kid you only need boosters every several years tetanus is a good example that one is good for years dog vaccines are no different so why give them every year if they don't need them especially since studies are showing that the every year vaccine protocol is leading to many health problems instead have a titer test done it involves a blood draw they check immunity levels to disease and you decide to vaccinate from there much more healthy for the dog that way  Rabies Pet skunk Cytomegalovirus AIDS Cancer Multiple sclerosis HIV vaccine Pneumonia Thimerosal Vaccination Autism Dog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medicine Tetanus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma MMR vaccine Malaria HIV test Smallpox Toxoplasmosis Controversies in autism Vaccine controversy Jonas Salk Autism epidemic Mumps Prostate cancer Allergy Louis Pasteur Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Tuberculosis Autoimmune diseases Herpes simplex virus Antiviral drug Pasteur Institute Measles Streptococcus pneumoniae HIV Andrew Wakefield 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference Infectious disease Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Influenza Domain Name System Nutrition Hepatitis B Blood transfusion Hepatitis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Medical record Mark Geier The Invisibles Alzheimer's disease Veterinarian Marburg virus Anthrax Sickle-cell disease Housebreaking Epidemiology Microchip implant (animal) Natural Hygiene Duesberg hypothesis H5N1 Chagas disease Microeconomics Socialization Domestic rabbit Adverse effect (medicine) Ebola Labrador Retriever Genetically modified food Tocopherol Dog training Common cold Docking Fancy rat Extreme Programming Rheumatoid arthritis World Health Organization Cervical cancer Hypoglycemia Bioterrorism Guinea pig National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act Leukemia Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Tobacco smoking Theory of conduct Human papillomavirus Lupus erythematosus

does anyone know how to best care for a chinchilla i am thinking of getting one you can buy a number of books on the subject or tsalk to loacl breeders or pet stores for specific advice but i'll put the main points here facts chinchillas live years they are sometimes timid but always friendly and curious they can jump up to feet in the air if they need to they are noctournal but will be awake for you if you always play with them at a specific time they can adjust to a costant schedule habitat your chinchilla needs a decently sized cage with several levels ledges for them to jump on make sure the chinchilla has access to fresh water in a bottle hay that is not on the floor of the cage and a nice place to hide sleep at all times the cage should also not have a wire bottom if it can be helped as they can break their legs and warp their feet play time take your chinchilla out and play with them in a closed area like a bedroom or bathroom let them jump run and sniff everything try to do this around the same time each day so your chinchilla will expect it health your chinchilla needs a sand bath every days just keep a big bowl or a bath house from a pet store with some sand in the bottom for your chin to roll around in give your chinchilla plenty of hay and water with the occasional pellets or seeds you can also feed a few treats to your chinchilla but not too many or they will have some digestive issues rasins per day keeps my chinchilla happy and healthy make sure your chinchilla has plenty of wood to chew on vet visits and emergencies make sure you have a local vet that can care for your chinchilla if a problem should arise never let your chinchilla get wet as their fur can grow mildew do not let your chinchilla get too hot if it seems very hot in your home give your chinchilla an ice pack in a sock to snuggle next to to stay cool keep up with your chinchilla and love it and it will be an amazing pet  Chinchilla Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat Mattress Cat Pet skunk Garfield Canary Plastic Dog Chicken Tea Water Pet Coffee The Sims Professional wrestling match types Hiking Death Valley National Park Bon Jovi Shaggy dog story Sento Textile manufacturing Fire fighting Breastfeeding Sauna Happy Tree Friends Fecal incontinence The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Conker's Bad Fur Day Urinary incontinence Champagne (beverage) Pebble bed reactor Blood (computer game) Francis Bacon (painter) Neopets Hydrotherapy Tobacco Japanese tea ceremony Cheetah Caving Hay Cruising (maritime) Brewery W.I.T.C.H.

do you think animals can tell a human's race gender i was visiting a college professor who told me that her dog was afraid of blacks and dark skinned mexicans i was pretty taken aback that someone with a phd would say this but it made me wonder if she is right so dog owners veterinarians is this possible serious answers only please gender yes they can tell as far as race all they can see are shades of grey so it doesn't matter if you're light brown or dark brown if a dog is mistreated by someone with a certain look not just skin color but hair and build chances are that dog will react negatively when other people with that look are around i've got three birds and one of them hates blonde women i'm not kidding and will actually go out of its way to bite them if they get close enough  Hair color Dog Human skin color Melanin Cat Blond White (people) Color Dragon Booster Hair Pet skunk Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gray Wolf Tattoo Dobermann Garfield Joke Black W.I.T.C.H.

how to properly hold a bunny does anyone know how to properly hold a bunny i hold it with both my hands around its stomach sometimes but i am not sure if that is the right way i've owned a bunny for almost years now i hold my bunny in my lap while i'm sitting so all of her feet are on a solid surface if i have to stand up and hold her i put all feet on my chest and hold her with my hand under her butt so she feels really really secure if you hold her around the stomach you can accidentally squeeze her and hurt her or she could twist really hard and jump out of your hands and fall to the floor getting hurt a worse case would be that she leaps or twists out of your hands and breaks her spine just make sure the bunny is always supported whenyou hold them  Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling throws Diving Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Spanking Volleyball Equine conformation Mattress Jackass: The Movie Swingout Drill bit 2000 Australian Grand Prix Suplex Drowning DDT (professional wrestling) Crash test dummy Casualty lifting Neckbreaker Skateboarding trick Strap-on dildo Billiards Breaststroke Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling match types Wood carving Menstrual cup Gymnastics Horse Rabbit Conspiracy (TNG episode) Motorcycle Asana Trapping Piledriver (professional wrestling) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Domestic rabbit Diver rescue Anatomical terms of location Backbreaker Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hazing Bookbinding Horse tack Recovery position Cheerleading 1957 World Series Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fast bowling Dropkick Fecal incontinence Kimi R__ikk__nen Archery Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Woodworking Fathers' rights Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Leap year M16 (rifle) Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Condom Salute Montgomery Burns Seismic retrofit Indianapolis 500 Suicide methods Lindy Basic Tai Chi Chuan 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Sea star Human anatomy Dialysis Sperm Whale In The Groove (game) Chopsticks Pump It Up Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Mixed martial arts Diving suit John F.

filing goat horns when we bought our pygmy goat from a petting zoo six months ago the man in charge said the horns could be filed down is this true and what is the process involved i had no interest in de horning our goat but i'm about ready to get a companion for her who is de horned and i don't want to risk injury to the new goat you can file the horns down but you cannot completely remove the horns by filing horns have nerves and a good blood supply so you have to be really careful doing it you can only file about a quarter to a half inch at a time make sure to have some blood stop powder or wonder dust on hand in case you go too far leave it alone for a few weeks and then file a little more i've seen people get them filed down to about half size by doing it that way i personally prefer leaving the horns on any of my goats that were not disbudded as babies i have horned polled and disbudded goats together with no problems if they use their horns too much they can be taught not to use them by taping something to the end of them for a while section of hose tennis ball with a hole in it etc don't leave anything on too long or it will cause the horn to get soft underneath  Goat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Floppy disk Gramophone record Breastfeeding Drill bit Money Traumatic brain injury Violin Hard disk Volleyball Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Equine conformation Childbirth Dairy Firearm Baseball Satyr Corran Horn Urinary incontinence Penis Domestic rabbit Captain Thunderbolt Textile manufacturing terminology Livestock Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Siegfried & Roy Prostate cancer American football strategy Typewriter Terri Schiavo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Table tennis Pet Sounds Dobermann 2001 anthrax attacks Asbestos Cephalic disorder Plastic Ammunition Stopping power Thermal power station Doom enemies Mouse (computing) Milk ROC presidential election, 2004 Stroke Knots Landing Monty Hall problem Irrigation Tourniquet Bong Fast bowling Hamster Pain Social rule Casting Mattress Horse Stem cell Anal sex Hubble Space Telescope Young adult literature Medical prescription American football Snooker Shark Cartridge (firearms) Shoe Triage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet humour Cheese The Mountain Goats 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Domestic goat Stomach cancer Plame affair Female genital cutting Fecal incontinence Clarinet Slow Train Coming Microeconomics Texas Longhorn Athletics Aortic dissection 1957 World Series Myocardial infarction Paradox Patch (computing) Menstrual cup Decompression sickness Basic English File system Explosive material Mount St. Helens

petco or petsmart what store pet store do you prefer i've heard rumors that petco maybe be going out of business in a few years also it depends to me where petco or petsmart is petco kind of reminds me of petsmart though because they both are basically almost the same in new jersey there are petsmart's and they are all the same except one of them only sells reptiles and accessories for them i mean it's what i know for starters it also depends on the price of product in each store i'd usually prefer the store that cost less because i don't want to spend so much money on one product that may not be so useful afterwards not a lot of people can afford things in petco and petsmart i don't really notice anything different in petco and petsmart the only reason why i go there is because i want to keep my animals healthy so i don't really care about which one is better petco and petsmart both have the same amount of cons and pros so i guess everybody has their own cons and pros towards petco and petsmart i think they're both o k but i don't really think either one of them are the best what matters is what food and products they sell that can be helpful for an animal all of my petsmart's and petco's don't really catch my attention or even interest me i only go there for my animals not for myself  PETCO Park Microeconomics Apple Computer Hamster Dairy Energy development Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Supply and demand Health insurance Pets.com Labor theory of value Capital accumulation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Inflation Fancy rat Bulk vending Law of value Domestic rabbit Insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Livestock Fish farming Urban sprawl Gross domestic product Free trade Nuclear power Surplus value Animal rights Confidence trick Exchange value Life insurance Philosophical skepticism Illegal drug trade Hyperinflation Economy of the United States Organic food Capitalism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hybrid vehicle Retailer Guinea pig Bread Chili con carne Organic farming Supermarket Married... with Children Neopets Pet store Bish__jo game Philatelic investment Laserdisc Kashrut Tax Microsoft Surplus product Commodore International Intellectual property PE ratio Productive and unproductive labour Opportunity cost Breastfeeding CPU cache Yu-Gi-Oh!

do farmers hate their animals well i was wondering if they do because i was watching this video from peta and it showed how animals get treated and some answers say that thats a commercial farm what does that mean and if their is no such thing i was wondering do all farmers beat their chickens with metal poles or barb zap their cows or do they appreciate their animals please i just dont get it whats the truth i don't trust peta i agree with some of the things they stand up for but sometimes they are way too over the top most farmers that i know who have their own personal farm treat their animals well the veterinarian i work for grew up on a farm and now she is a veterinarian and takes care of animals for a living if she didn't love and take care of the animals on her farm then she probably wouldn't have grown up to be a veterinarian  Animal rights Dairy Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Agriculture Veterinarian Farmer Garfield Animal testing Chicken Pok__mon Live!

can rabbits swim and could they swim in a pool with cholorine it is a lop eared rabbit also yes rabbits can swim in fact they are really rather proficient at it i would not however recommend allowing a rabbit to swim in a pool with chlorine as rabbits are far more sensitive to products than humans are so a safe level of chlorine for a human would not be safe for a rabbit this fact that they are more sensitive is one major reason rabbits are were used in animal testing for products used on humans such as cosmetics lotions shampoos etc because if a product will not irritate the rabbit it is unlikely to do so on a human i had a rabbit when i was young that really enjoyed a nice summer swim in our kiddy pool when the weather was hot however one must also keep in mind that rabbits panic easily so if they are unable to get out of the water they may panic and drown they also are more susceptible to climate shock than many other animals so care must be taken that the rabbit not over heat itself or become chilled do to the swim  Swimming pool Swimming Body piercing Chlorine Rabbit Dog Domestic rabbit Bathing Shampoo Hyperthermia Drowning Diving Cat Livestock Care Bears Sodium hypochlorite Pikmin Survival skills Sewage treatment Disinfection Tattoo Air conditioning Hiking Ranma __ characters Thermoregulation Hamster Aspartame Fountain Escherichia coli O157:H7 Kevin and Kell Asthma Multiple chemical sensitivity Water Guinea pig Diving suit Acne Chronic fatigue syndrome Volkswagen Golf European Rabbit Solar power Sunlight Ammonia Mobile phone radiation and health Energy development Platypus Veganism Sento First aid Dairy Explosive material Lake Burley Griffin God Emperor of Dune Psoriasis Plastic Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Triathlon Rebreather Hydrochloric acid Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Eye Haloalkane Menstrual cup Wind chill History of swimming Draize test Otitis externa Brewery Breastfeeding Shark Welding Orca Ecco the Dolphin Human sexual behavior Decibel Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gun politics Conjunctivitis Clinical depression Butterfly stroke Albinism Stroke Renewable energy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Full Metal Panic?

hamster help ok well i have had hamsters in the past and i have done everything the interent tells me to do with them so as you can lift them out and pet them but no matter what hamster i get they always bite everyone and you couldnt out your fingers anywhere near them i have another hamster a little ginger coloured syrian hamster and it is the exact same i cant go near him or he will bite me has anyone go any ideas that might help me tame my hamster now i have already had him about half a year so or any future hamsters i get i could still use some help anyone got any ideas what i can do next hamster i get what hamster do you think i should get i would like one that is easy to handle and easy to tame i take it syrians are not the best what is your opinion on syrians for handling and what hamsters are best for handling you definetely want to make sure that they are completely awake before trying to get them out of their cage they get grumpy you say you've had these hamsters for a year yet it sounds like you only had them for a day you haven't been able to take your hamsters out because they are mean however by not taking them out they are only getting meaner they need a lot of attention you should try letting them run loose in a bathtub while you sit with them make sure the drain is clogged this gives an opportunity for you to be more active with them you really need to try to get them out of their cage to be played with they are probably going to nibble and bite until they get used to your scent it's just the way they are the more they are handled the more they get used to it if you are planning on getting another hamster i would wait until yours goes to the other side it is hard to introduce new hamsters to old ones because they are territorial however in the future i would suggest trying a teddy bear hamster or a black bear hamster these guys were bread for their temperment so they are a little bit easier to tame if you want to try a different type of hamster you could go with the dwarf winter white hamsters working at a petstore i can tell you that out of all the hamsters i had to handle the winter whites bit me the least but as with all hamsters they need lots of handling to be happy  Golden Hamster Ferret The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Time Out of Mind John Cage Dog training The Taming of the Shrew Pet skunk Knife Care Bears Textile manufacturing Volleyball Milton H.

what do you think will incourage you people to spay nueter your dogs i am guessing for some people telling them that nuetering spaying your dog will result in a longer life for your dog spayed females no longer go into heat and this means no bloody messes and she wont attract unwanted unnuetered dogs to the area nuetered dogs wont go out looking for unspayed females and get hit by a car females will be releived from cancers that occur in their reproductive system males wont get testicle deiseise pets are much calmer after spaying and nuetering the number of dogs in animal shelters would go down if telling dog cat owners those facts isn't enough than what will get people to nueter their dogs cats should people lower the price should their be rewards such as a free dog collar or something to make people at least consider the operation there are so many people on yahoo awnsers that say they don't plan on spaying nuetering their dogs some of those people arnt even planning to breed yet they refuse to spay nueter and it sort of irritaates me day have you even listened what about your pets inprooved health does that matter or are you just stubborn delta dawn is sooo right more people need to visit their local animal shelter preferably one that isn't no kill so they'll see how many poor animals end up there with the possibility of being euthanized some people are just too thick headed to understand why it's a bad thing to leave an animal intact if they don't plan on breeding responsibly those people aren't going to be convinced too easily unfortunately thank god for places that offer free or low cost spaying and neutering i think offering affordable services will help bring down the number of unwanted animals in the world it won't solve the problem completely but it's a good start  Dog Cat Domestic rabbit Animal shelter Sterilization (surgical procedure) Socialization Housebreaking Ferret Manx (cat) Pit bull Feral cat Fancy rat Dog training Theory of conduct Mixed-breed dog Hamster Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Shaggy dog story Castration Pitaten European Rabbit Extreme Programming The Apprentice 2 The Price Is Right RuneScape quests Social rule Friends Kodocha Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Kakapo God Emperor of Dune Dog agility Reservoir Dogs Obedience training Shrek 2 Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Taboo food and drink Kitten Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Animal Crossing Pekingese Capitalism Vernon Schillinger Dobermann Golden Retriever Rabies Livestock Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Death Gate Cycle Karma Discordianism Dilbert Public transport Cloning Rescue group Prostate cancer Past teachings of Prem Rawat Transactional analysis Philosophical skepticism Hunting Rabbit Rhodesian Ridgeback Bob Barker Border Terrier Phoebe Halliwell Incarnations of Immortality Alaskan Malamute Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insurance Supply and demand Pet store Pet Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dog breed Sin City Jam (TV series) Contract Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Free trade Working dog EastEnders Gray Wolf Ontological argument People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Puppy mill

where should i let go of my rabbit i feel bad it is in a small cage and i wanted to set it free i live in miami fl and i have seen some wild in the everglades should i let it go there i would not let it go in the wild your rabbit is used to having its food given to him it would not know how to go and hunt for food it would also be a good prey for othre animals i would suggest that you look om the internet to see if you can find a local zoo or a petting farm in your area where you can take the pet some animal shelters take rabbits and other pets i would just hate for the rabbit to die after you have taken care of it for such a long time  Ferret Rabbit Domestic rabbit Dog Falconry Guinea pig Zoo Hunting Rabbits in Australia Bugs Bunny Cat Pet Fox hunting Fancy rat Bat Livestock European Rabbit Hamster House Puma Trapping Chinchilla Animal rights Domestication Everglades National Park Game (food) Feral cat Taboo food and drink American Alligator Pet store Kevin and Kell Cheetah Who Framed Roger Rabbit Dingo Poker jargon Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Pet skunk Tyrannosaurus rex Microchip implant (animal) Serval Monkey Medieval hunting Burmese python Pet Sounds Animal shelter KaBlam!

can you bathe a hamster if so please share all info on the topic this will be much apsherated hamsters are aqua phobic afraid of water by nature so unless there is a specific reason that outweighs the stress and trauma of the bath then it is not a good idea the only reason i can think of to even try is if he has gotten something on his fur that self cleaning would be toxic in this case your best option is to put him in the bathroom sink and rinse him carefully and gently with a squirt bottle take care to protect him from injury near the drain never expose him to running water or leave him unattended in water you can dampen a washcloth ring it out well and pet him with it if he has soiled his fur with something sticky that could result in matting  Hamster Pet skunk Sento Tattoo Toilet Menstrual cup Japanese toilet Bathroom Water purification Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Nuclear power Yerba mate Carnivorous plant Diving Water Fecal incontinence Poodle Animal testing Dry cleaning Body piercing Tobacco smoking Shampoo Sewage treatment Cat Customs and etiquette of Japan Psoriasis Rebreather Motor oil Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Mesothelioma Social rule E-6 process Mosquito Towel Upholstery Hard water Bidet Species Golden Hamster Polychlorinated biphenyl Plastic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bleeding Windows 2000 Bathing Chicken Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

would you change your life for your pet i have been offered a job in california i live in the uk but i have a dog who i love so much she is if i take her with me i think the heat could kill her she hates it and if i don't like my new job that would mean quarantineening her for months to come back to the uk and the seperation could also kill her she loves me and follows me everywhere shes like my child would you put your pet first or do you think im a little crazy i am seriously thinking of not going i think you're fantastic i moved abroad and got a puppy straight away i then decided that i wanted to return to the uk i simply couldn't do it and chose to stay abroad for the sake of my dog eleven years later she passed away and i'm still living abroad i believe that it was my fate to stay here but you only have one life i believe that fate has a path for you and you know what you really want to do if that means going to la then perhaps you could leave your dog with a relative until you figure out if you're going to like la if you take your dog make sure you research the kennels used for quarantine should you decide to return to the uk ring the rspca for advice on that matter it used to be six months of quarantine so at least that's been reduced if you chose not to go i believe that that's a good decision if you do go then that's a good decision also because you may be happier with life out there and your dog will be happy because you're happy the best thing would be to leave her with a relative that she's comfortable with until you get settled the main thing is you are agonising with this huge decision and that's the way it should be because she's part of your family i do believe that your needs and her needs should be considered equally good luck  Shaggy dog story EastEnders Knots Landing Dog training One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Dog agility Dog Animal rights Pitaten Kodocha Into the West (miniseries) Obedience training The Critic Phoebe Halliwell W.I.T.C.H.

fleas on my pets okay i have three cats and a dog that all stay in the house well we let the dog out i just found fleas on my cat because her belly is pink so i could see them what is the best way to get rid of fleas and keep them gone because of course we still have to let the dog out you need something like frontlineplus good source and cheaper than the vets is petshed com i use it so i know it works a flea comb with a cup of hot water a little dish liquid to dip the comb in when you comb your dog cat lots of vac bags and vac everyday and remove the bag and tie it in a shopping bag and take out of the house this will work and you should see improvements within two months don't use sprays powders house bombs flea collars and over the counter products they are dangerous and are full of pesticides and can harm you and your pet cycle of the flea they hatch from a cocoon like a butterfly in one week they are an adult as a adult they lay a egg every hour of their lives up to years they live the eggs hatch into a larva in about two weeks they spend three weeks as a larva and then they wrap themselves into a cocoon in the cocoon stage you can't kill them unless you plan on burning down your house fire is the only way to kill them in this stage what makes them hatch from a cocoon is vibration heat and all sorts of things they need a host to feed on within one week or they will die problem being is the cocoons can take up to five months to hatch and they all hatch at different rates wow that is a lot of fleas frontlineplus uses two ways to kill the fleas they first have an ingredient that paralyzes the flea so it can't feed and it dies it does this for two weeks the following two weeks it just inhibits the flea eggs of the fleas that feed on them and eggs don't hatch this is why it takes a few months but it does work btw flea baths don't work either and will make it so the frontlineplus won't work  Flea Biological pest control Red Hot Chili Peppers Gypsy moth Tick Insect Mosquito Chicken Cat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Beetle Coffee Bedbug Heartworm Plastic Milk Spider Xenomorph Dracunculiasis Fancy rat Kakapo Bee Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Zerg Egg (food) Cantonese cuisine Saturniidae Crab louse Ant Pet skunk Brood (honeybee) Hamster Tofu Livestock Myiasis Cheating in Counter-Strike Baylisascaris Hookworm Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Ascariasis The Fairly OddParents Hornet Leatherback Sea Turtle Customs and etiquette of Japan Honeybee Krill Explosive material Seabird Honeybee life cycle Thermal power station Richard Chase Hyperthermia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Fire fighting Dairy Salmon Socialization Sulfur Cracking (chemistry) Coconut crab Sonic Adventure Cocaine Brewery Swimming Billboard Hot 100 Rebreather American Alligator Korean cuisine Dog training Tungiasis Bacon Clownfish Spruce Budworm Cockchafer Chocolate Mercury Atlas 6 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Queen bee Solar power Mercury 4 Digenea Feral cat Caffeine Dilbert Shrimp farm Schistosomiasis

pet allergies i just got a bichon and i read on the internet that they have hair not fur so people won't be allergic to them but ever since we brought her home my allergies have been bad has anyone else have had problems with their bichons this following is available in the internet the bichon frise is often recommended as a breed for families with allergies it is important to discuss this with your allergist before making a decision to buy any pet experience shows that those with mild allergies may be able to share a home with a bichon the person with severe allergies may be at risk for a severe attack when exposed to these dogs others will fall between those parameters it is important that you find out before making a purchase that your allergies will not be affected or how severely the best way to find out how you will react is to spend time in the presence of a bichon this should be done in a place where no other animals are present to avoid exposure to other allergens the minimum amount of time would be hours and repeated exposure is recommended how can you arrange this find a friend with a bichon or contact a breeder who will allow your family to visit for an extended time have each allergic person hold the animal and be in the room throughout the exposure time any allergic adults should be a part of this exposure even if you are buying the puppy as a child s pet if you do decide to buy the bichon realize that adult coats are different from puppy coats so allergic individual should be exposed to both also make sure that the puppy can be returned if this does not work out responsible breeders ask you to sign a contract that offers certain guarantees and you can expect to include your own agreed upon conditions before signing another consideration before buying is that pets will spend some time outdoors and may bring outside allergens in on the feet and coat he and you will be better off if he spends most of his time inside you would be advised to find an area where he can relieve himself on concrete and then you should be a responsible dog owner by cleaning up after him realize that he may also bring in dander from other animals every time he goes to the groomer or to the vet s office so his coat care may be up to you grooming products may contain perfumes now that you have looked at the allergy factor be sure to read before you buy your puppy to find out about other considerations before you make up your mind that the bichon or any pet is a part of your future  Hay fever Allergy Asthma Havanese Dog Domestic rabbit Cat Guinea pig Bichon Fris__ Eczema Food allergy Maltese (dog) Chronic fatigue syndrome German Shepherd Dog Multiple chemical sensitivity Housebreaking Shetland Sheepdog Life insurance Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Conjunctivitis First aid Angioedema Tattoo Peanut Labrador Retriever Zoophilia Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Psoriasis Hamster Nuclear power Common cold Toy dog Latex allergy Golden Retriever Tooth enamel Pet skunk Food Pet store Tarantula Decompression sickness Plame affair Mixed-breed dog Multiple sclerosis Rabies Infantilism Urinary incontinence Motion picture rating system Annuity American Eskimo Dog Dog training Acne Socialization Protein Urticaria One Tree Hill (TV series) Pekingese Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Perfume Anorexia nervosa Microeconomics Airedale Terrier Tobacco smoking Insomnia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pneumonia Cyprus dispute Second language acquisition Microchip implant (animal) Docking Poodle Cancer Contract Health insurance Body piercing Antihistamine Obstetrics Estoppel Capitalism Dog show 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Crohn's disease Skinny Puppy English Springer Spaniel Prostate cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Portuguese Water Dog

do the animal shelters bare any responsibility at all for euthanzia according to some estimates to million dogs and cats were tragically put to sleep last year at our nation's animal shelters some people blame the public entirely for this for not spaying and neutering their dogs and cats or keeping their pets for a lifetime other's say the shelters too have to share some of the blame because they are not doing enough to prevent the killings here are two views http www nokill org news htm http www animalsinourhearts com shelter impact htm what is your opinion on this i personally think the shelters and the shelter workers want to try and put all the blame for the tragedy of euthanzia on to the public to ease their guilty consciences but when they lie to people which happens alot more than most people realize and tell them their animals are going to be adopted when they know very well these animals are too young or too sick or for some other reason can not be put up for adoption they are the only one's really culpable for the animal's death  Cat Animal shelter Feral cat Animal euthanasia Socialization Domestic rabbit Dog Pet skunk 2005 Kashmir earthquake Ferret Rabies HyperText Transfer Protocol Animal rights Castration Pet Southeastern Anatolia Project EastEnders Kitten People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Mutts Hunting Chernobyl accident Agriculture Fox hunting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans House Working dog Homelessness British National Party Greyhound Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microchip implant (animal) September 11, 2001 attacks Maison Ikkoku Pitaten Wal-Mart International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement One Piece minor characters Andrew Carnegie Darfur conflict HTTP cookie Elvis Presley Knots Landing Web server Domestic violence People's Republic of China The Secret of NIMH Phishing Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cultural Revolution Hurricane Wilma A Canticle for Leibowitz Taboo food and drink DDT Housebreaking Manx (cat) Burial Privacy Babe Ruth Kodocha Domain Name System Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Simone Weil Puma 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Livestock Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Social work Capital punishment Zoophilia Pet store Community emergency response team Conscience Ra's al Ghul Biodiversity H5N1 South Park Tobacco smoking Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Shaggy dog story Bulgarian language Animism Estoppel Feral 2001: A Space Odyssey (novel) Rabbit Lycanthropy Peter Singer Tiger Combat stress reaction Air-raid shelter Dream Skunk Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Culpability Nature versus nurture Death of a Salesman Hurricane Ivan

what do u think of this a man is talking about eating dogs in korea but my main question is do u think it is selfish to deprive your pet of its natural environment to be your companian as mentioned in one of his paragraphs http www animalfreedom org english column dogmeattrade html read the fourth paragraph no i don't think it's selfish to keep animals as pets nowdays most animals are bred to be companion animals and have never experienced life in their natural environment so it would actually be more disruptive to both the animal and the environment to let it run loose the dogs cats and other animals sold in the petshops etc simply haven't got the necessary immunitites or survival skills to live without a human carer while most breeds retain many of their natural instincts centuries of controlled breeding by humans have destroyed the neccessary instincts they would have developed if the species hadn't been domesticated the reality of the situation is and as unfortunate as some may think it the natural environment of most animals today is in fact our living rooms couches and the backyards of human civilisation wether you agree with it or not it's a fact that most animals are better off being kept as companion animals not all animals of course but most  Cat Dog The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Domestic rabbit Ferret Human Hunting Livestock Working dog Artificial selection Pet Hamster Quotation mark Gray Wolf Guinea pig Taboo food and drink Introduced species Pig Pet skunk Rat Cloning Working animal Fox hunting Ecology Guns, Germs, and Steel Feral cat Kangaroo Rabbit Skunk Discordianism Inception of Darwin's theory Puma God Emperor of Dune Hybrid Socialization German Shepherd Dog Simone Weil Animal rights Biodiversity Species Selective breeding Brown Bear Sociobiology Border Terrier Extinction Altruism Human nature Animal testing American Alligator Comparative psychology Carnivore House Mouse Objectivist philosophy Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Housebreaking Goodness and value theory Anarcho-primitivism Cyberspace Veterinarian Therianthropy Reproduction The Smoking Room Felis sapiens Feral Liger Peter Singer Agriculture Civilization Obedience training Wealth American Bulldog Monster Rancher monsters Urantia Sant Thakar Singh Social Darwinism Border Collie Fancy rat Treecat Puppy mill Garfield Narnia Plame affair Miyamoto Musashi Greyhound Adam Smith Rabies Motivation Natural selection Chicken Kevin and Kell Island restoration Dream Firefighter Reality Internet phenomenon Zoo Maine Coon Animal communication Excel Saga

how does moving pets overseas work i don't envisage living in australia my whole life but more importantly i don't envisage ever leaving any of my pets i expect specifically my dog and bird cockatiel to live at least another years so i just thought i'd ask in general how it works moving pets overseas i know they have to go into some kind of quarantine what does that actually mean do they take your dog away from you or something or is it more like he can't leave the house for a while before you leave or something for a long plane journey how are dogs and birds transported are they sedated or anything is that dangerous especially for birds is it dangerous to move a small bird like a cockatiel also what about that bird flu thing if they had it in a country would you be allowed to bring the bird back to australia again quarantine is a government run process in which your animal is basically put in a shelter of types and sits there for a few weeks to a few months depending on the animal's type and the country it came from you can visit your pet if you like but you cannot take it home until the quarantine is up workers there will feed and water the animal for you and give it a bit of exercise for plane transportation it all depends some people worry that their pet won't be able to take the flight well so they have a veterinarian sedate them prior to the journey usually the animals are put in the lower part of the plane along with the baggage luggage sometimes you can have a pet as carry on but it is hard to reserve such a seat and the animal's crate and size must meet certain regulations  Hamster Pet Cockatiel Dog training Quarantine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dog Domestic rabbit USS Wasp (CV-18) Rabies H5N1 Microchip implant (animal) Hal Colebatch Fancy rat Veterinarian Feral cat Ferret House Livestock Cat Dobermann Dairy Greyhound Tooth enamel Characters of Lost Agriculture in Australia Bird migration Spanish flu Tick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Airline Gerald Durrell Organic farming USS Taussig (DD-746) USS Waters (DD-115) British nationality law USS Alamo Housebreaking Hunting American Alligator Working dog USS Willard Keith (DD-775) Introduced species Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Taboo food and drink Governor-General of Australia Theory of conduct Australian constitutional law Utility cycling Insurance Guinea pig Paragliding History of British nationality law USS Enterprise (CVN-65) Appeal Obedience training USS Wright (AV-1) House of Lords Pet store Unclean animals John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Donald Rumsfeld Trade union Airport security USS Abbot (DD-629) Customs and etiquette of Japan RuneScape quests London Congestion Charge USS Sea Dog (SS-401) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Dog agility Mutts Spider USS Philip (DD-498) Shaggy dog story Gliding Kodocha USS Walke (DD-723) Animal euthanasia New Zealand elections Heartworm Animal rights Parrot Working animal Patent application Marine aquarium Canadian House of Commons Greyhound racing Bicycle USS Allen M.

i have a lopped eared rabbit but her ears havnt dropped any ideas why the ability of lops to 'lop' is based on the base of the ears and top of the head referred to as the 'crown' in younger rabbits because they're so small the crown is fairly narrow and the weight of the ears is very little usually they will have 'helicopter ears' where the ears are horizontal or held at an odd angle sometimes their ears may even stick straight up usually as they age about months old the crown will have widened and the ears thickened and the ears will drop and lay naturally sometimes lops who have not been bred to be show quality never lop if the parents weren't selected for desirable traits your rabbit's crown may be too narrow to allow the ears to lop as they should if that's the case there's not much you can do but enjoy her unique ear carriage  Dog Equine conformation Domestic rabbit Rabbit Mixed-breed dog Gray Wolf Aerial (dance move) Internal ballistics Species Temporal bone Guinea pig Earring Carburetor Ear Hearing aid Anchor Horse Wood Cincinnati Bengals Car handling Spatial disorientation Professional wrestling throws Fancy rat Poker jargon Gobi Desert Docking Diamond Dog show Gramophone record Professional wrestling attacks Flight controls Farthing (coin) Television Strap-on dildo Labrador Retriever Prosopis cineraria Selective breeding European Rabbit Hat Billiards Platypus Knife Professional wrestling holds Otitis externa Scapula Genetic drift Mandible Super Mario 64 DS Colours, standards and guidons Manx (cat) Precession Continued fraction Who Framed Roger Rabbit GunZ The Duel Diamond cut Stereoscopy Thailand Artificial selection Sonic X History of the halfpenny German Shepherd Dog Radar Haircut Plant breeding Arabian horse Parachuting Spaniel Pachypodium bicolor Tank Aberration in optical systems Sniper Whitewater Knitting Cat Artillery Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Minor Harry Potter Beasts Skateboarding trick Diving Phil Collins Sound localization Helicopter Table saw Charge (heraldry) Bicycle English Cocker Spaniel Egyptian pyramids Microphone Elevator M__ni__re___s disease Strategic management Radio controlled airplane Balance disorder Diablo II Francis Galton Boxing International Phonetic Alphabet Worms weapons and tools Kevin and Kell Monty Python

why is my cat so distant my cat doesnt like it when i hold it or wana pat it it scrathes me and when i let it go it starts licking its fur as if i made it dirty or something and it hurts my feelings does my cat hate me or am i doing something wrong not all cats like it when their owners pick them up or pet them at times it's common that cats lick their fur after you put them down ours do that if you have been aggressive towards your cat in any way as in hitting him her for punishment that will cause your cat to get skittesh around you and not want you to pet them if this is what's going on you will have to leave your cat alone for a while and let your cat come to you for affection when he she is ready it will take a while to regain trust in your relationship and you may never regain your cats trust if this is the case that is my mom's cat sarah is a 'pissy kitty' ever since we got pebbles she became hateful she doesn't like anyone to pet her or love on her or pick her up only my mom can do it and it's not very often i think it's a territorial thing and she just got mad at us getting a new kitty and stayed mad lol she's up there in age though too so it could be just crankiness i hope this helps i know it feels awful when your pet doesn't make you feel loved but hang in there she he could be just moody or i just reread your question and noticed you put that your cat scratches you when you put her down sometimes that could mean that your kitty has arthritis and it hurts when you touch in certain spots sarah my mom's cat has arthritis and it hurts her at times if your kitty is up there in age it could be that if your cat has arthritis or you suspect it take your cat to the vet so that they can give your cat some meds that will ease the pain then you just might see a loving kitty again  Cat Garfield EastEnders Kodocha Guinea pig Teacher's Pet (Disney) Badly Drawn Kitties Ferret Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Random Harvest Pet skunk Knots Landing Days of our Lives Rent (musical) Eric Cartman Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Kim Possible Dog Rabies Recurring South Park characters Poker jargon Ranma __ characters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ren and Stimpy RuneScape quests Social rule Domestic rabbit Dog training Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Tag Housebreaking Revolutionary Girl Utena Theory of conduct Girly The Fairly OddParents Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Something Awful Rocko's Modern Life Atomic Kitten Dead Like Me Capital punishment Okashina Okashi Phoebe Buffay's songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fruits Basket Great Teacher Onizuka Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yoko Ono Blood on the Tracks Hip hop rivalries Phoebe Halliwell Ron Weasley Zoophilia Mutts Phoebe Buffay Equine conformation The Death Gate Cycle One Tree Hill (TV series) Ed, Edd n Eddy Rheumatoid arthritis Trailer Park Boys Little Britain Past teachings of Prem Rawat Serial killer Catscratch Osteoarthritis Animal rights Fancy Crane Sin City Charmed Pok__mon Live!

is it wrong to catch a fly then tie a thread to his foot and fly him like a kite i find all of your answers interesting and i found it fascinating how easily most of you found it interesting and funny that this was being done to a living creature it also occurred to me how easy it was for most of you to just dismiss the life of a fly as completely unimportant and expendable it also occurred to me that this is the same mentality that allowed michael vick to do what he did to dogs i am not saying that what you are doing is equal to what he has done what i am saying is the attitude towards a living creature be it a fly or a dog is the same interesting how as human beings we feel we have the right to decide the worth of an animals life and whether we should destroy it or protect it  Sesshomaru Alignment (role-playing games) Animal rights Gray Wolf The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Kitesurfing W.I.T.C.H.

what do you feed wild baby rabbits you do not feed wild baby rabbits anything you leave them alone and allow the mother rabbit to take care of her babies the best info on orphaned wild bunnies comes from this website http www rabbit org faq sections orphan html it states many people mean well when they contact hrs after discovering an abandoned nest of wild rabbits often they wish to rehabilitate them with some advice from others the reality is fewer than of orphaned rabbits survive a week and the care that people attempt to provide can be illegal unnecessary and potentially harmful the best thing you can do is put the bunny right back where you found him in the general area as the mom will only come back at night to call and find him leave the area if injured please contact a wildlife rehabilitator or rabbit vet immediately rabbits hide their nests in plain view often putting them in the open for example in the middle of the lawn as well as in brush piles and long grass if you find a nest that has been disturbed do all you can to restore and protect it rather than bring the infants inside if a dog has discovered the nest keep your dog away from the area and reconstruct the nest with grasses if need be you can move the nest a few feet away where safer rabbit mothers nurse their babies for approximately minutes a day they will be in the nest early in the morning and then again in the evening the milk is very rich and the babies fill up to capacity within minutes mother rabbits do not sit on the babies to keep them warm as do some mammals and birds they build a nest with fur and grasses which helps to keep the babies warm in between feedings if you come across a nest of bunnies in the wild and the mother is no where to be seen please do not disturb them this is normal by removing them from the nest you are greatly reducing their chances of survival if your dog disturbs a nest or you find a wild bunny with its eyes open please put him back if not injured mom will be coming back at night to call and feed him only once in the middle of the night do not take the bunny inside or feed him that is the mom's job it is a matter of his her survival and up to us as humans to leave nature be and let the mom care for her young we often hear of mothers moving their babies and their nests and have seen moms come back every night for up to a week to look for her missing baby do not take the baby from the mom or she will be frantic it is illegal to capture and keep wild rabbits as pets it is even illegala to keep them for a short time unless you have the proper permits either put the bunnies back where you found them or contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm these people have the specialized training to care for sick injured and orphaned wild animals they also have the state and federal licenses that allow them to keep wild animals for a short time until they are ready for release  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Dog Breastfeeding Rabbit Cat Hamster Elephant Ferret Fox hunting Hunting Gray Wolf European Rabbit Kakapo Quotation mark Seabird Capercaillie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Platypus Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Falconry Tasmanian Devil KaBlam!

what animal do you think is easier to train dogs or cats i have had dogs and cats both i have trained them to do tricks and all the little things they need to know what was hardest what was the easiest dogs are by far the easiest of the two dogs naturally want to please their owners so they are more willing to learn dogs also will learn just using praise as a reward where as cats need motivation cats are more independent and not as willing to please anyone except themselves some cats love treats some are uninterested if your cat has some special food you can use that to reinforce something he she is doing to get them to repeat it cats take more time and patience than dogs do to train also hope this helps  Dog training Obedience training Fancy rat Cat Reinforcement Dog intelligence Clicker training Socialization Garfield Dog Kung fu Housebreaking Hamster Alaskan Malamute Pet skunk RuneScape quests Animal trainer German Shepherd Dog Kim Possible Domestic rabbit Trailer Park Boys Obi-Wan Kenobi Mutts Felis sapiens Italian Greyhound Scooby-Doo Happiness The Cat in the Hat Sheikh Abdullah Chesapeake Bay Retriever Pet Spot the Dog 2 Stupid Dogs Ferret Leopard Animal rights Ranma __ characters Domestication Working dog Azumanga Daioh Motivation Francis Crick Alexander Technique Oliver and Company Service dog Conditioning Animal Farm Carnivore Operant conditioning Object (computer science) Dog food Mixed-breed dog Weimaraner Crate training Care Bears Cowboy Bebop Phantom cat Shetland Sheepdog Animals in space Manx (cat) Feral Jack London Australian Cattle Dog Selective breeding Laika Dog agility Canary Taboo food and drink Sonic the Hedgehog Zoophilia Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Sinfest Behaviorism Police dog Tooth enamel Havanese Hearing impairment Pitaten Brown Bear Cloning Reading education Alfred Hitchcock History of brain imaging Cats (musical) Mickey Mouse Microchip implant (animal) S.H.E Team Rocket 101 Dalmatians: The Series Cat food How the Grinch Stole Christmas!

about how much money does it cost to own a horse let me just start by saying that it costs a lot it's not something you jump into without giving serious thought and time first you'll want to buy all of the supplies for your horse this includes all your brushes and a box to keep them in i paid for all of this together you'll need a halter and lead rope you'll also need a bridle can cost upwards of for a nice new one bit around for a simple snaffle saddle anywhere from a few hundred a used english two a few thousand a show english or western saddle and girth if you're riding english around then there's the actual horse a decent starter horse can cost up to but a proven show horse can cost tens of thousands of dollars this all depends on what you plan to do with the horse and if you have enough time and experience to retrain a horse with more problems after you've bought the basic supplies and the horse you have a whole boatload of new costs you can own your own property and keep your horse their but you'll have to buy your hay and feed and it has to be at least two acres one horse to every two acres plus you'll want another farm animal as a companion for your horse goat mini horse etc as horses are herd animals and will get lonely on their own for the most part or you could board your horse for a full board with feed turnout etc my barn charges a month which adds up to a year just to make sure your horse has food and a place to stay you'll also need to have regular vet checks shots deworming teeth floating and you also want a bit of money saved in the case of an emergency founder colic laminitis caught in a fence etc you'll also have to have a farrier visit every to weeks costs all depend on your area and the farrier's costs but a horse that just needs trimming will obviously cost less per visit than if he needs trimming and his shoes reshaped this is all assuming that you have no problems with your horse allergies hives etc if anything goes wrong that can costs hundreds of dollars out of your pocket  Horse tack Equine conformation Dairy Horse Microeconomics Livestock Cowboy Inflation Bridle Domestic rabbit Money Hunt seat Comanche Poker jargon King Ranch Horseshoe Conker's Bad Fur Day Cat MMORPG Supply and demand Laminitis Milton H.

how those a hen get pregent but there is soo many hens and usally one roster sorry for my spelling he selects the female usually the closest one to himself droops one wing to the ground circles her then grabs her by the back of the head and climbs on her back balancing himself by flapping his wings he lowers his tail and places his vent in direct contact with that of the hen where the passage of sperm from his cloaca to her oviduct takes place the entire sex act takes less than seconds and it appears the most satisfying thing for the female is fluffing the feathers and shaking the body immediately afterwards once sperm has been transferred they swim along the mucous lining of the oviduct until they reach the infundibulum where they fertilise the ovum as it passes through from the ovary it takes some to days for the sperm to travel and that explains why it normally takes that long after initial mating for fertile eggs to occur conversely a hen may still lay fertile eggs some days after being mated for the last time  Sexual reproduction Fertilisation In vitro fertilisation Ovum Bird Spermatozoon Menstrual cycle Digenea Ovulation Sexual intercourse Earthworm Capercaillie Ostrich Spider Chicken Grasshopper Shark American lobster Skateboarding trick Ovary Egg (biology) Vagina Parthenogenesis Professional wrestling throws Fertility awareness Moss Sex organ Water polo Puberty Roundworm Dragons (Pern) Tuatara Infertility Flight controls Semen Beetle Pregnancy Ploidy Leatherback Sea Turtle Kakapo Orgasm Nile crocodile Glossary of American football Condor Twin Sex Krill Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Homunculus Emergency contraception Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Male reproductive system (human) Intersexuality Professional wrestling holds Sexual selection Sexual dimorphism Aphid Drosophila melanogaster Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Apollo 8 Annelid Albatross Hermaphrodite Pterosaur International League Egg (food) Peafowl Antarctic krill Whale Humpback Whale Single Transferable Vote Epididymis Ascariasis Spermatogenesis Alternation of generations Housefly Birth control Emu Glossary of partner dance terms Aerial (dance move) Acanthocephala Octopus Hen Harrier The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Death Gate Cycle Deluge (mythology) Chimera (genetics) Seabird Woman Abortion debate Man Anopheles Dog Coconut crab Mallard Penguin

animal testing labs i hate that animals have to be tested on but i feel that it is for the best to help fight disease processes in humans but i have a question does anyone know for a fact how these animals in the testing labs are treated do testing labs have anyone who just loves on the animals there are things in this life that are not fair animal testing is one of them i am also concerned about those who are employed to care for the animals that are used in tests i imagine they start this job wanting to be as kind as possible but become calloused to the pain and suffering they see as a mechanism to survive what they have to do because they have bills to pay and family that depends on them for food shelter etc god help any sensitive person that gets stuck in this job as it kills your soul i would feel safe in saying that no there is no one in the lab there for the main purpose of loving on the animals some of them become vicious as the pain becomes more unbearable and would pose a threat to human health with some of the diseases they are purposely infected with we live in an imperfect sometimes cruel world and the sooner you can face that fact and learn to live with it the better i mainly have a problem with animal testing when it used for developing cosmetic products hair dye makeup skin creams etc these things have nothing to do with health just appearance and vanity  Animal testing Prostate cancer Theodicy Medicine Drug test Animal rights Dairy Tattoo Anthrax Stomach cancer Crash test dummy Livestock YuYu Hakusho Pneumonia Guinea pig Aspartame Abortion debate Consciousness Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Acne Simone Weil Human sexual behavior Malaria Goodness and value theory Gelatin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bob and George God Emperor of Dune Dog HIV test Domestic rabbit Addiction Kashrut The Amber Spyglass Methamphetamine Psoriasis Breastfeeding Traditional Chinese medicine Professor X John Howard Yoder Rabies Veganism Meaning of life Hepatitis C Tocopherol AIDS reappraisal H5N1 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Happiness Tuberculosis Homeopathy Insulin Food and Drug Administration Aristotle Chronic fatigue syndrome Nutrition Summa Theologiae Psychology Church of Christ, Scientist American Psycho Traumatic brain injury Clinical depression Cat Lyme disease Zoophilia Pitaten Pharmaceutical company Allergy Diabetes mellitus Vegetarianism Rei Ayanami Overpopulation Anorexia nervosa Skin Autism Soul Fecal incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ultraviolet Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices Pet skunk The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex W.I.T.C.H.

inexpensive pet that can live in a gallon i want an inexpensive pet that can live in a gallon it's entire life it can be land dwelling or aquatic i already have fish and hermit crabs i'm thinking of getting an albino clawed frog though any tips on how to care for them b you should choose a pet because it's something that interests you not just because you have an empty tank and want to see what you can possibly fit into it that leads to collection more animals than you can properly care for and you'll end up either letting them die from neglect or getting rid of them because you're bored and didn't want them to start with i care for my pets i'm sorry you got that impression but i don't just buy pets because i have an empty tank thank you very much i also don't have a collection of animals i can't properly care for i care for every single one of my animals turtle's or a hamster i like hamster cuz you can train them to come to their name and stuff  Pet Hamster Neopets Axolotl African clawed frog Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) Pet skunk Hermit crab Pet store Creatures in Bionicle Marine aquarium Dog Garfield Biodiesel Microchip implant (animal) Cat Coconut crab Animal communication Fauna of Australia Minor Harry Potter Beasts Shrimp farm Guinea pig Fishing Aquarium Sea-Monkey Aerial (dance move) Goldfish Meat Snapping turtle Fancy rat D'ni wildlife Crab Monster Rancher monsters Pet Sounds Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Animal MapleStory Strap-on dildo Dead Like Me Domestic rabbit Pet Shop Boys American Alligator Infantilism Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Ferret Shredder (TMNT) Cloning Animal testing Health insurance Knots Landing Internet phenomenon The Young Ones (TV series) Blood (computer game) Autogyro RuneScape quests Finding Nemo Richard Feynman Dinosaur Animal shelter Frog Autonomous building IAR 80 Nocturnal animal Albinism The Ashlee Simpson Show Angel Sanctuary Procrastination Meriones unguiculatus Dr. Seuss Violin Drill bit Aquaman Tenshinhan Theory of conduct Jakks Pacific Galaxy Angel Friends Puma Toyota Prius The Sims P-47 Thunderbolt Pinky and the Brain The Hampster Dance The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Bristol Zoo Immortality Predation Legend of Zelda series songs F-16 Fighting Falcon Butters Stotch Firefighter Hamtaro Operation Market Garden Pogo Animal Crossing German Shepherd Dog Paul McCartney Timmy Turner

aggresive shih tzu ok so i have this shih tzu named puffy who is so cute but she bites me sister's fingers i tell her no and she leaves them alone but when i turn around she starts biting them again not only does she bite a lot but she also barks like crazy she barks all day and all night we used to be really nice to her when we barely got her she sleeped in my room we played with her whenever she pleased we pampered her like crazy but then she became aggresive and now she finds herself sleeping in the bathroom and isn't allowed to get out except for when she has to poop or eat and we only play with her outside after she poops for like minutes are we punishing her too harshly am i being too mean to her for biting and hurting my sisters should i get her a trainer you should not punish her it is truly not her fault it is simply the way you raised her pampering is not always a good thing she wants attention all the time and to show her anger she bites and barks to get attention in order for her to change so do you start off with letting her out of the bathroom your dog is barking because you trained her to do it she speaks and you obey woof and you open the door to let puppy out woof and you open it again to let her in woof and she gets a treat woof for a tummy rub you get the picture she has learned to get attention through barking and does this because she is unhappy bored or upset it is easy to fall into this trap because the very nature of barking gets your attention for the same reason it is easy to forget to praise and reward your dog when she is not barking to train her out of this habit do not yell in the wild wolves howl as a community which makes the dog want to join in when you yell you are going to teach her to stop by firmly saying quiet when she starts to bark hold up a treat under her nose she will stop and try to eat the treat move it away and say quiet she will be watching the treat if she stops barking give her the treat and praise her she will most likely start barking again but with practice she will understand that she will only get treats if she is quiet to stop biting throw the dog off if you are on the couch and she jumps up and starts biting you push her off and ignore her she may keep trying keep jumping up but keep at it if she jumps up and does not bite praise her calmly but do not touch her as soon as she tries to bite throw her off if you are on the floor and she bites put her in her crate or bed if she is trained to go to her bed then send her there like a time out if she does not have basic training you should give that to her i would recomend getting a trainer becuase this can become difficult and frusterating to owners if these tatics don't work  Housebreaking Obedience training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

how to teach dwarf hammsters not to bite out of my dwarf hamsters bites alot and how can a teach it of pick it up so it wont bite first you must learn the cause of the biting it is to defend themselves right hamsters actually rarely bite their first instinct is to run and hide but when you are holding them they cannot do that so they resort to biting they are scared remember this when you get frustrated it's important to be calm and move slowly so from now on place your hand in the cage with a small treat on your palm position your hand so they have to climb on your hand to get the food so they'll probablky grab it and run let them do this daily for a while then start holding the treat in one hand with your original hand in the cage for climbing as they come for the food draw it further so they venture more and more this teaches them that you are a source of food and not harmful or dangerous at all also never grab them always lift them with two hands cupped around provide that there is no loud noise as this will only stress them and handle them daily no less  Hamster Dog training Domestic rabbit Brown Bear Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling throws Pet skunk Guinea pig Tag Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spider Magic (illusion) StarCraft: Uprising Professional wrestling holds Aikido Suplex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Hansel und Gretel Snake charming Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling aerial techniques Swingout The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Drizzt Do'Urden Spider-Man Glossary of climbing terms Boy Scouts of America Ferret Pok__mon Live!

what do you think will happen when california enacts a mandatory spay neuter program for all pets will more animals find homes will more animals be dumped 'cuz people won't want to spay or neuter them and then get fined does any other state have this law and if so did it help or hurt the animals in that state i read somewhere that the mixed breed animals will die out that means no more mutts in ca the california healthy pets act is modeled after a law in santa cruz county a recent study of this law a year after it was enacted reveals the following while euthanasia rates dropped in santa cruz county they dropped less than the state average meaning other places without this law put down fewer animals shelter costs actually increased despite the promises and intentions of the bill i think the bill is poorly written impossible to enforce and doesn't target the real problems at hand we'd be foolish to allow a bill this poorly done to pass  Dog Pet skunk Feral cat Cat Animal shelter Ferret Sterilization (surgical procedure) Domestic rabbit Animal euthanasia Eugenics Smoking ban Taxation in the United States The Price Is Right Compromise of 1850 Minimum wage Mixed-breed dog Food Stamp Program Vulgar Latin Legal research Kitten Guinea pig Free trade Rabies Santa Cruz, California University of California, Santa Cruz Divorce Pit bull 2003 California recall California Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Santa Cruz County, California Second Amendment to the United States Constitution San Francisco Bay Area Speed limit Castration Island Fox Act of Parliament California government and politics Medical cannabis California State Route 1 Public domain Theory of conduct Counties of the United States Trade union Bob Barker Santa Barbara, California Freedom of speech Rick Santorum Barbara Boxer Socialization Poker jargon Federal assault weapons ban Santa Cruz Politics of Ontario Housebreaking Santa Barbara County, California Alcoholics Anonymous Methamphetamine CPU cache Economy of Russia 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Domestication Social Security (United States) United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit EastEnders Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 Gay rights Restoring the Lost Constitution Balanced Budget Amendment Elections in the United States Medical malpractice Royal Assent Mexico No Child Left Behind Act People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Fox hunting Prisoner's dilemma Biodiesel Education in the United States COX-2 inhibitor Hamster History of the United States (1918-1945) Cruelty to animals Hunting Tennessee State Constitution Female genital cutting Home Rule Act 1914 Health insurance Atari 8-bit family European Rabbit Abortion in the United States Murder US and Canadian license plates Arguments for and against drug prohibition Contract with America Lawyer Keynesian economics Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Tiger Microchip implant (animal)

is baby more work than an adult if i buy a baby ferret will it be harder to take care of then an adult if i have a dog will it be a good idea to get a ferret i think that getting a baby ferret is better because you can train them to do what you need them to do if you get an adult from the pet store they aren't going to be accustomed to using the litter box if you get an adult from someone that has already trained it then that would be okay i have known a lot of people that have had both dogs and ferrets and they get along fine it will take them awhile to become friends and for the dog not to think it is food but eventually it will be fine  Ferret Pet skunk Dog Domestic rabbit Hamster Working animal Pet Hedgehog Housebreaking Hunting Ai Yori Aoshi Falconry Infantilism Microchip implant (animal) Discus (fish) Ren and Stimpy Stewie Griffin Humphrey Bogart Prairie dog Family Guy Socialization Fancy rat The Beach Boys Veterinarian Bulk vending Tick Good Vibrations Labrador Retriever Havanese Neighbours Puppy mill Little Snow Fairy Sugar Care Bears Dog training Our Gang Pig Lady and the Tramp The Pet Sounds Sessions Working dog Community emergency response team Flea Cat litter Scouting Black-footed Ferret Korea Jindo Dog Baby talk Golden Retriever 101 Dalmatians: The Series As Good as It Gets Kodocha Cigarette Rubeus Hagrid Social work Static Shock Rocko's Modern Life Vanilla Ice Canary Garfield Lisa the Vegetarian The Beatles discography Spotted Skunk Rabies RuneScape quests Krypto Badger Dog agility Pit bull German Shepherd Dog Unemployment Kevin Smith Peanuts Ranma __ characters Ralston Purina Company Tom Goes to the Mayor Breastfeeding Charmed About a Boy Diaper Kender American Eskimo Dog Chocolate Nintendogs Get Fuzzy Gray Wolf Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet store Hearing impairment Fecal incontinence Dog breed Dinosaurs (TV series) Police dog Mixed-breed dog Apex predator Cat Taboo food and drink Characters of Lost Iditarod AVN Awards

where can i buy a bunny i live in texarkana tx and our petsmart doesn't sell rabbits most petsmart stores don't sell rabbits for the same reason they don't sell dogs or cats all three species suffer from a serious overpopulation problem too many people buy rabbits without realizing how much time work and money are required for their care then dump them at animal shelters after a year or two in most parts of the country it's easy to adopt from a rabbit rescue group cities such as houston austin and little rock have rabbit rescue groups unfortunately as far as i can tell texarkana doesn't have one unwanted rabbits are probably taken to either the texarkana animal shelter or the texarkana humane society as far as i know neither the animal shelter nor the humane society has rabbits available right now but if you call and tell them you'd like to adopt a rabbit they may be able to put your name on a waiting list so that you would be contacted as soon as a rabbit became available by the way if you want to learn more about rabbits in preparation for adopting one a great list of articles is available at http www rabbit org care index html  Domestic rabbit Rabbit Rabies Livestock Dog Cat Microchip implant (animal) Guinea pig Domain Name System Kevin and Kell Animal testing Rescue group Feral cat Bugs Bunny Poker jargon Animal rights World Wide Web Animal shelter People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Overpopulation Who Framed Roger Rabbit Texarkana, Texas Hunting Introduced species Ferret Domestication Adoption Pet skunk Theory of conduct Animal euthanasia Fox hunting Hamster Cross site scripting Dairy A Canticle for Leibowitz HyperText Transfer Protocol Rabbits in Australia Gaia Online Pet Genealogy Economics Wal-Mart Mozilla Firefox Monster Rancher monsters Anthropomorphism Emergency preparedness Stone Age Sustainability European Rabbit Poverty Surveillance Socialization Warez Daffy Duck The Amazing Race Veterinarian Windows XP Cruelty to animals Grammatical mood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Animal Crossing Apollo 8 Neolithic Revolution Pitaten Monkey (zodiac) Philosophy of language Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Capitalism Chinese astrology Uniform Resource Locator Internet fraud Mammal Fancy rat International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Condom The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Critic Firefighter Indigenous peoples Wget Usagi Tsukino Jefferson Airplane D.N.

why do my horses have bumps my horses that stay in stalls during the day and get turn out at night have bumps they get fed scoops of sweet feed and flakes of alfalfa every day the bumps are on my show horses and i cant show them with the bumps what are they and what can i do depends what you mean by bumps do they share equipment or brushes with anyone if it's a fungus get some mtg and put on it my suspicion though is it's bug bites being out at night mosquitos and other bugs can leave bumps get a good fly spray like absorbine supershield and apply nightly before turn out also you might get a netting blanket or light sheet to put on them at night sounds like a lot of sweet feed tho' unless they're reining or other working horses  Mosquito Alfalfa Anopheles Equine conformation Cowboy Bedbug Biological pest control Professional wrestling throws Malaria R.

how would i be able to persuade my parents to let me have a rat i adore animals and recently had two hamsters which sadly passed away recently i know by wanting another pet im just not going to forget them because ill always love them and remember them its not like one after another i just hope to give animals a good life i told my parents this and they still said no i found out information on them they still said no they said they are too much hassle when we go away and the cats could get them i have female and male the male doesnt interest in other pets the female however loves to hunt and once caught one of my hamsters but me and my mum saved him however shortly after this i started closing the door to my bedroom at all times she could not get in isnt that all responsible however the thing with going away and the cats is still the main reason to not get a rat which btw has legswhich makes it even cuter and want to give it a good life anyway its impossible any ideas i would really appriaciate it it's great that you want to give animals a good home when you go away if you want to make sure that your cats don't get them you could bring your rat to somebody's house instead of them coming to the house they might leave your door open or let your cat get in keep taking care of your cats responsibly and don't beg constantly about getting a rat and your parents might decide that you are responsible enough to get one you can tell them that you took good care of your hamsters if this doesn't work find out why they don't want you to get one ask them if it is just because they are hassle when you leave or there are other reasons i hope this helps and i hope you get the rat  Hamster Social rule Pitaten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Friends Aladdin (1992 film) Garfield Miss Saigon Kodocha Avenue Q My Parents are Aliens Fancy rat Shaggy dog story The Secret of NIMH Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Animal communication Theory of conduct Pet The Young Ones (TV series) Sin City Jon Secada Ferret Phoebe Halliwell House Mouse Coming of Age (TNG episode) Transactional analysis Ron Weasley EastEnders Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tenchi Muyo!

cats vs dogs what's your say it depends on your personal preference and your home and lifestyle if you have a small home or apartment and spend most of your day at work cats are the way to go they require little maitenance and care and are ok with living in small apartments they also won't make much noise so your neighbours won't even notice you have a pet for the most part they do not mind being alone for most of the day dogs on the other hand require a lot more attention they are active busy and loud they're good for active people with larger homes that have a yard so they can excersize you have to have enough time in your day to at least walk them once a day if they are alone for too long they will chew things whine and become pretty upset i suppose you could have a small dog in an apartment but they still bark a lot and disturb neighbours just my opinion i love both animals though  Housebreaking Garfield Hamster Fancy rat Obedience training Dog Theory of conduct Ferret Philip J.

can i feed a bird crushed up worms or do they have to be regurgitated i found a baby bird you feed it nothing if the baby bird has most of its feathers it is a fledgling baby birds fledge leave the nest before they can fly they need a few days on the ground hopping around climbing low branches and exercising their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if this is a fledgling leave it where you found it and leave once the parents do not see you around their baby they will return and care for it if it does not yet have a lot of feathers it is a nestling if so try to put the baby bird back in the nest do not worry about touching the baby the mother will not reject it birds do not have an acute sense of smell she will not detect your scent on the baby if you can not get the baby bird back in the nest you need to contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Breastfeeding Kakapo Hamster Albatross Chicken Seabird Bird Falconry Bird migration Cat Capercaillie Mealy Parrot Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hunting Dinosaur Condor 613 mitzvot Bird ringing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an H5N1 Ant Guinea pig Fancy rat Elephant Peafowl Terri Schiavo Bat Platypus Livestock Species Insulin Acorn Foie gras Dog Trapping Red Squirrel Vegetarianism Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Ivory-billed Woodpecker Hedgehog Tetrapod Gliding Kashrut Comanche Hemp Orca Peanut RuneScape quests American Black Bear Airport Genetically modified food Ostrich Insect Extinction Animal testing Peregrine Falcon Pterosaur Saruman Ferret Gray Wolf Nurse Insurance Tasmanian Devil Heinkel He 112 Vermicompost Dodo Domesticated turkey Trademark Infantilism Life in the Freezer Agriculture Canary Fox hunting Archaeopteryx Hummingbird Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Vomiting Kagu Dog agility Weight training Childbirth Animal communication Baptism Shrimp farm Haibane Renmei Mountain Gorilla Avian influenza Cannabis cultivation Gas metal arc welding Public domain Professional wrestling attacks Fish farming Common cold Snake

becoming an animal foster 'parent' so i have been thinking i would love to become a foster 'parent' for animals i would love to help take them in teach them and nurse them and all the ups and downs that go along with that however i have no idea where i would even start and whether or not it is a long process such as i would have to start small like volunteering and then work my way up after many years or if i can just jump right in after being approved and start fostering animals i would love appreciate any advice or answers any of you have on these subjects thanks so much keeping in mind i would rather do this for cats over any other animals go to your local humane society and start there talk to someone there about what you want to do and they can lead you in the right direction you can start out volunteering there talking to other fosters learning about different rescue and fostering groups in your area and getting to know more fostering can be tricky if you have other animals in the house already not everyone always gets along but seeing an animal respond to you and grow and become available to go to a great home is very very rewarding even if it is hard to see them go sometimes  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Behaviorism Charles Darwin Milton H.

which pet would you prefer to have as a friend cats dogs birds fish or rabbit i prefer rabbit 'coz i've already have it once ago dogs i have always had lots of dogs and i luv them to pieces they are loyal smart most breeds lol they have great natures again most do but of course there is always the occasional grumpy dog' but if u bring them up in a loving and caring environment they won't be a grumpy dog when you get a dog make sure you make the right choice for your type of lifestyle e g if you aren't home a lot don't get a dog that needs lots of attention and exercise if you have kids don't get big aggressive dogs get loving kind natured breeds such as cockerspaniels or labradors be very careful and make sure you are making the right choice fish are boring don't get a fish rabbits are cool i have them too and i luv them heaps they are a less attention needing pet they are also a lot less expensive dogs are quite expensive to look after and will require a lot of attention and responsibility birds so so i find some breeds a bit boring but some are very smart and you can teach tricks too cats i used to have them but i am personally not that interested in them they don't really like to be touched much not as much as dogs so my final word is a dog they are the best friends you could ever have  Dog Hamster Domestic rabbit Ferret Garfield German Shepherd Dog Care Bears Pet RuneScape quests Border Collie Rocko's Modern Life Livestock Monster Rancher monsters Cat KaBlam!

what is needed to open and operate an animal rescue i love animals and i have always wanted to have my own animal rescue so i have decided to make it happen but i am unsure of what kind of permits and things of that nature to get also i've looked on google for the modular kennels used to hold dogs and can't find them anywhere any ideas i'm located in ga the best thing you can do to learn about the philosophy and mechanics of running your own animal rescue operation is to first volunteer for a well established rescue group you will learn how to avoid duplication of effort fund raising techniques equipment needed volunteer recruitment public relations cooperative efforts with local humane societies and animal control agencies legal issues and lots of ways to avoid unforeseen pitfalls that can create a lot of problems running an animal rescue group is not as easy as it may appear from the outside find a lawyer who is knowledgeable about animal rescue organizations area groups may be able to make some good recommendations create some achievable objectives and stick to them don't over reach select you board members and management team very carefully good luck  Anarchism and society Extreme Programming Theory of conduct CPU cache Education in the People's Republic of China Object-oriented programming Community emergency response team Expert system Goodness and value theory Intelligent design Civil Air Patrol Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Predestination MoveOn Synthesizer Theodicy Search and rescue Ethics Technology Pet skunk Pitaten Animism Consensus decision-making Richard Stallman Happiness Behaviorism Philosophy of language IBM PC compatible Logic Firefighter Obedience training X Window System Plame affair Friedrich Schleiermacher Teach the Controversy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Productive and unproductive labour W.

do humans urinate pheromones like dogs do dogs use their pheromones to mark their territory when they pee right right so can humans do the same thing i'm wondering because my dog is always a lil too interested when i'm making thanx your dog is interested in your urine because it contains the nitrogenous breakdown products of protein metabolism you eat meat your dog eats meat when you eat meat you pee out the waste products of the digestion of that meat there are enough similar chemicals in the meat coming in your body as the stuff going out that a dog with its highly sensitive nose probably thinks you are offering it a meat product some waste products of meat digestion also remain intact and leave the body through the feces which is why you sometimes see dogs eating other dog's poop it reminds them enough of meat to make them think they've found themselves a meal  Cat Nutrition Insulin Feces Urine Vegetarianism Protein Sewage treatment Dog Domestic rabbit Taboo food and drink Mass spectrometry Environmental vegetarianism Toilet humour Soybean Diabetes mellitus Insect Biochemistry Veganism Blood House Mouse Water Kashrut Plastic Healthy eating Metabolism Liver Coprophagia Phenylketonuria Crohn's disease Hypoglycemia Pork Spider Livestock Kangaroo Raw food diet Hamster Milk Gastrointestinal tract Growth hormone treatment Housebreaking Digestion Colorectal cancer Waste Urinary system Enzyme Vermicompost Flatulence Soy protein Renal physiology Escherichia coli Dieting Ammonia Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Fugu Cell (biology) Fecal incontinence Vomiting Meat Loaf Gray Wolf Cheese Sausage Hot dog Atkins Nutritional Approach Domestic goat Antiretroviral drug Circulatory system Toilet Brewery Tooth Lisa the Vegetarian Meat analogue Tobacco smoking Biology and sexual orientation Aztec Shit Brain Food preservation Uric acid Grasshopper Snake Zinc 613 mitzvot Nitrogen Glucokinase Anti-diabetic drug Dog food Kosher foods Schistosomiasis Domesticated turkey Chocolate Tofu Sinfest Bacteria Iron Honeybee

i keep getting reported have answered several 'cat' questions giving my opinion i have admitted i am not a cat lover yet have nothing against them however if someones young kitten goes missing as i said there is a great chance it is gone for good in another question i commented on eating cats not myself but i know of people who have and i know of a fast food shop near me that has been accused of skinning and eating them too i am giving an honest opinion maybe its not what people want to hear but surely people have better things to do than report people for suggesting cruelty to 'little kitties' as it happens i own birds and snakes which get a much rougher time from humans than cats ever will but i'm not reporting everyone who suggests to shoot a pigeon or kill a snake if you aren't happy with an opinion don't ask a question the question is why are people reported for an honest answer 'why are people reported for an honest answer' because some people don't like to hear the truth  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Theory of conduct Kitten RuneScape quests Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Garfield Bird Phoebe Buffay's songs Meaning of life Little Britain Feral Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Social rule Plame affair Species Cannibalism Lie Adam and Eve Socialization Taboo food and drink Snake Philosophical skepticism Schapelle Corby Meat Hello Kitty Stomach cancer U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Bernard Williams Ferret English grammar Fahrenheit 9/11 Schr__dinger's cat Ontological argument Feral cat Abortion debate Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Kill Bill Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Shannara creatures Timon and Pumbaa The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) David Hume Shaggy dog story Carnivore Trailer Park Boys Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Deluge (mythology) Philosophy of language Resurrection of Jesus Cats (musical) Rush Limbaugh Dog George Galloway Downing Street memo Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Pantera Lodge Committee Metaphysics Religion Guns, Germs, and Steel Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Internet troll Baldrick American Alligator Battle of Jenin 2002 Book of Isaiah Dodo Apology (Plato) American Psycho Simone Weil Game show The nature of God in Western theology Internet phenomenon Animal rights Sydney Riot of 1879 Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Cigarette Smoking Man Puma Slander and libel Theodicy Have I Got News For You Teach the Controversy The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Ethics SMTV Live Abduction Phenomenon The Strangerhood Media bias in the United States Current teachings of Prem Rawat Little Shop of Horrors 2005 United States Grand Prix Goodness and value theory Questionable Content Discordianism Salad Fingers Ron and Fez Aladdin (1992 film)

living outdoors why are cats better at this than dogs i see stray cats all the time rarey do i see stray dogs and when i do see a dog it's always hungry and in very poor health almost every stray cat i've run across looks healthy so are cats better at living outdoors because they are smaller and eat mice rats which are easy to find i considered this for a while though dogs are pack animals they are also successful hunters on their own if given the opportunity i think many of the strays were once owned by people and therefore stray dogs rely on people as their pack and are thusly not well fed when they're ignored on the streets cats tend not to rely on people though they will come and return if a particular person feeds them on a regular basis most dogs are larger and require more food than cats so as per food cats are more successful both dogs and cats can look much heavier or even much skinnier than they really are it is possible the cats are just as unhealthy as the dogs but their fur is covering this helpful for this is the fact that in my experience cats clean themselves more than dogs i think more people are more apt to feed cats than dogs because they more often view dogs as vicious especially street dogs and when the mutts look less healthy people are even less likely to give them food  Cat Hamster Domestic rabbit Dog Fancy rat Taboo food and drink Gray Wolf Kangaroo Hunting Guinea pig Rat Nutrition Garfield Raw food diet Obesity Mickey Mouse Rabies Animal rights Leopard Organic farming Russian space dogs Livestock Lady and the Tramp Breastfeeding Chocolate Feral cat Feral Fur Dairy People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Kashrut Veganism Animal testing Kakapo Alaskan Malamute Pet skunk Brown Rat Health insurance House Mouse Tyrannosaurus rex Brown Bear Kitten Ferret Internet troll Lion Manx (cat) Felis sapiens Pekingese Tobacco smoking Chicken Genetically modified food Island restoration The Secret of NIMH Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Laika Coyote Vitamin C Bat Atkins Nutritional Approach RuneScape quests Mid-levels Tooth enamel Pig Ren and Stimpy KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1982 Alley Cat Puma Toxoplasmosis Dog (zodiac) Animal Trailer Park Boys Omega-3 fatty acid Island Fox German Shepherd Dog Gal__pagos Islands Neighbours Spider Tick Mutts Unreal Tooth Socialization Trapping KaBlam!

my rabbit keeps biting me how can i stop her from biting me she bites when i feed her and hold her i know some rabbits don't like to be held but we only hold her when necasary any help here she is not spayed and about monthes old plz don't suggest eating her cause i love her it sounds like your rabbit is aggressive rabbits do not typically bite for the fun of it they have been known to bite if frightened or when attempting to defend either themselves or their belongings including their space rabbits prefer to be on the ground a rabbit that isn't being held correctly will become scared and could bite in order to get the handler's hands to release them this is why it is very important that small children do not handle or carry your rabbit around small children just do not have the dexterity to enable a rabbit to feel safe and secure and this could easily cause either or both to end up seriously hurt whatever the reason your rabbit is biting for there are several steps you should take consistently always give a loud 'eeeeep ' whenever they bite you this is how rabbits communicate to one another that they have been hurt follow quickly with a firm no bite once the behavior has stopped be as quick to offer a praise and love to reinforce their good behavior however as soon as your rabbit stops biting you from the point you try to hold her try to pet her slowly and calmly don't let her see your hand though or she'll find it a threat for a while other than petting her head pet her back until she is calm and does not think about biting you when approaching a rabbit that bites use a flat hand palm side down with fingers spread as wide as possible but as you consider your rabbit safe enough to pet on the head have the hand several inches above the head and bring it down gently onto the rabbit's forehead and nose from the front if possible never let anyone or even you poke their fingers at your rabbit's face they're very likely to bite even if the rabbit isn't a known biter depending on the intensity of your rabbit's bite and your experience you may want to use a pair of thick gloves at first to prevent any bites when you become more comfortable you can start practicing without the gloves in time the behavior will improve as the rabbit unlearns it with your help patience and love  Dog training Aerial (dance move) Guinea pig Dog Cat Volleyball Dog agility Fast bowling Ferret Drill bit Skateboarding trick Milton H.

why does my ferret only bite me i've just got a ferret about weeks ago she is weeks old when i first got her she bit anyone so me and my partner punished her the way we were told by scruffing saying no and pushing our finger in her mouth we both done it the same way now if my partner picks her up she is fine but when i do she attacks me and i'm desperate to get her to like me can u help contrary to what you and many others who've replied here are thinking your ferret may not be biting you because she doesn't like you but rather because she likes you best when ferrets play with each other they bite this is normal it's they way they interact with each other your ferrets biting may be her way of telling you that she accepts you as one of her own kind and wants to play with you as such personally i would and do when it happens with mine take this as a compliment from my experience the best way to deal with this kind of biting is to play back when she bites you gently flip her on her back and tickle the snot out of her when she starts to bite again stop tickling and hold perfectly still pulling away will only entice her to bite more and issue a command such as uh uh do easy if she doesn't ease up after giving the command twice get up and walk away from her give her a few moments then go back and try again eventually she will get the idea that you do want to play with her which is what she really wants but not if she's too rough with you it shouldn't take long for her to get the message it never has with any of mine well except for my darla who isn't quite right in the head lol stay calm and try to understand the messages your ferret gives you don't try to understand her from a human point of view you need to think like a ferret to understand a ferret oh and please pay no attention to the response you've received here from bill h who is clearly demented shaking head  Dog training Ferret Milton H.

about the movie flicka ive heard alot of rumor from multiple people that a or horses were worked to death playing flicka it sounds like a stupid rumor but does anyone kknow if this is true years ago movie standards regarding cruelty to animals were non existant several 'big' movies that featured real animal deaths called this problem to light and the current standards were set in place some of these titles were tom horn a horse is tripped into a full somersault while galloping and breaks its neck patton a bridge is blown up and mules fall over the side the mules were shot and their bodies used for effect apocalypse now a water buffalo is hacked to death with a machete to illustrate a native ritual modern movies must pass the standards set by the aspca and the aha that's why you see so many horses used to play one role they used to play cisco in dances with wolves one of those horses is retired and lives at a tourist attraction called 's town in south dakota the flicka incident was investigated and found to be terrible accidents the 'mis step' by the one horse was kind of like the bad step that barbaro took in the preakness stakes and was unforseeable i suppose the people who allowed the leadline to trip the other horse were being negligent but it was proven not to be intentional i despise any form of animal cruelty for entertainment and do my own investigating when i hear about it so i did look into this but rest assured the standards set for movies these days are sooooo much better than what used to happen now for laughs check out this old and famous clip http www youtube com watch v rkpgs vwm this is a trained 'falling horse ' play it again and watch the rider cue the horse by tugging the rein it's amazing what you can accomplish with animals when you train them properly and have a little consideration ps blazing saddles this movie was given an a ok rating by the aspca this movie features dozens of horses and not one was harmed including this fellow that got 'punched out' lol  Horse Equine conformation Horse gait Western (genre) Bullfighting Fox hunting Professional wrestling throws Cowboy Crazy Horse Martial art GunZ The Duel Paul Is Dead Life insurance AFI 100 Years series The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Unicorn Iditarod Whose Line Is It Anyway?

if i were to buy a pet what kind should i choose and why i'm thinking of buying a new pet and i was wondering if anyone can help me out well it depends on how much space you have as well as what kind of animal you have time for for example if you are extremely busy i wouldn't suggest getting a dog as they need lots of attention they get stir crazy easily and will get destructive or depressed if left alone for long periods if you are interested in a dog do your research on different breeds some like a border collie are better suited to extremly dedicated owners who are willing to spend a lot of time working with them they are pretty high strung where other breeds like a chihuahua are good for people without a lot of dog experience cats on the other hand are more self sufficient they can be left home alone for a few days at a time and will still be ok the downside is cleaning litter boxes but that only has to be done twice a week or so rodents are pretty easy too rats mice hamsters but they smell a lot and need to be changed often rabbits are social animals and get depressed if ignored plus they smell also whatever your choice is make sure you do your research beforehand that way you are prepared and can make the right decision for both of you  Hamster Dog Fancy rat Cat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Brown Rat Pet Rat House Mouse Alaskan husky Mickey Mouse Animal testing Working dog Housebreaking Feral cat Pet store Invader Zim Mixed-breed dog Social rule Garfield Microeconomics Dog training Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Herding dog Pet Sounds Dog agility Domestication Chinchilla Taboo food and drink Pig Trapping Obedience training Breed registry German Shepherd Dog Theory of conduct Monster Rancher monsters Rabbit Skunk Kim Possible Keeshond Trademark Gray Wolf European Rabbit Philosophy of language Labrador Retriever SpongeBob SquarePants Artificial selection Border Terrier Rodent Dog intelligence Socialization Dobermann Sesshomaru Livestock Animal communication Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Companion dog Extreme Programming Bugs Bunny The Contender (television series) Dog breed Sleep Tobacco smoking Time travel Shetland Sheepdog Ren and Stimpy Stoat Animal Liberation Front Falconry The Apprentice 2 Cloning Walt Disney Aspartame Fox hunting Minnie Mouse Poker jargon Seabird Havanese Password Doxepin People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Golden Retriever Nintendogs Capital accumulation Clinical depression Internet phenomenon Long-term potentiation Zoophilia Thermoregulation Manx (cat) Greyhound Alaskan Malamute Fruits Basket Kurt Cobain Traumatic brain injury

cat dog urine when my dog was a puppy he had a few accidents i cleaned these spots with soap and water then i used a carpet cleaner several times i recently purchased a black light and to my suprise these spots are still visible i tried urine gone but the spots are still visible under the black light they don't smell though i am getting a kitten on saturday and i am so afraid that it will try to pee on these places so my question is although these spots have been cleaned numerous times can the animals still smell them or is there anything else i can try more often than not when a carpet has been soiled only the top of the carpet is cleaned if it's possible lift up the carpet to clean the underside as well it's never a good idea to soak the carpet in anything including cleaners your chances of breeding mildew mold are much greater than if you were to dry clean it or use a light spray any time a pet soils on the rug immediately put a clean white absorbent towel and blot blot blot don't wipe or scrub it you only are working the soiled area further into the rug carpet powders don't do anything but mess up your vacuum and settle through to the bottom of your rug i always use my wet dry shop vac to get up most of the urine then i blot until the towel shows minimal signs of wetness and then i use a foam spray for pet accidents i put a towel on it and leave it overnight and then vacuum it up the next day there's not much you will be able to do to prevent another dog or cat from smelling it their sense of smell is far greater than humans but you shouldn't have to worry about the new kitten soiling over it  Upholstery Vacuum cleaner Cat Car washing techniques Dry cleaning Toilet humour Skunk Manicure Housebreaking Fancy rat Fire fighting Diseases of the honeybee Carpet Sento Ferret Soap Diaper Brewery Towel Vacuum Wok Urinary incontinence Chinchilla German Shepherd Dog Jam (TV series) Pet store Domestic rabbit Kitten Menstrual cup Hand washing Roomba Kakapo Rabbit Dog Coffee Dairy Puma Bedbug Wound Rabies Glossary of firefighting equipment Coconut crab Casting Pet skunk Dog training Phosphorus Western blot Flea Garden Strawberry Socialization Hemp Air pollution Water Textile manufacturing Burial Urinal House Mouse Penis Cannabis cultivation Urine Death Valley National Park Ron and Fez Opportunity rover Tattoo Hyperthermia Leopard Dialysis Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Wildfire Kimberly-Clark Corporation Idli Composting toilet Teacher's Pet (Disney) Richard Chase Labrador Retriever Livestock Social rule Working dog Animal communication Fecal incontinence Toilet Chair Laundry detergent Shaggy dog story The Hoover Company Pansy Thermal power station Hazing Polyethylene terephthalate Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Wheat Tag

is it bad for a rabbit to give it granola bars an elderly neighbor has been gone for a few days and had asked me to look in on her rabbit the rabbit is housed comfortably in an outdoor hutch with plenty of room to scamper about the only care required is to feed and water it looking at the rabbit's food i was rather nonplussed it looks like green pellets and has a strong smell i thought that the rabbit must get tired of eating this and wanted to give it a treat so i gave it a granola bar which it promptly consumed since it seemed to enjoy it so much i went and retrieved another and gave it to it my girlfriend noticed me going back and forth and inquired if all was well with the rabbit when i told her i was giving it granola bars she said that was a stupid thing to do that i probably had made it sick and should tell our neighbor when she returns as well as apologize i wasn't trying to hurt the rabbit just give it a treat are granola bars really harmful for rabbits should i apologize no matter how natural a granola bar might seem they're still processed and contain more sugar and sweeteners than a rabbit should have as boring as a rabbit's diet might be their pellets and hay contain all the nutrients they would need and are fortified with vitamins it's probably not going to hurt him unless that's all you've been feeding him lately but at the very least you should let the neighbor know just in case if you really want to spoil him share a piece of apple or go and guy him some wooden chew toys or goodie basket from the pet supply place  Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Nutrition Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Breastfeeding Chocolate Tea Tlingit Tocopherol Folic acid Rabbit Tooth Dog Cat Vitamin Japanese tea ceremony Sugar substitute One Piece minor characters Raw food diet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mealy Parrot Little Britain Granola Nutrient Honey Sea-Monkey Egg (food) Rice Food Garfield Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Chicken Vitamin C Milk Bread Dairy Snack food Cyanocobalamin Kevin and Kell One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Dietary fiber Microeconomics Care Bears Quaker Oats Company Alzheimer's disease Kodocha Ferret Organic farming The Inside Tofu Sin City Moe Szyslak Breakfast cereal Vegetarianism Fecal incontinence Natt__ Two Treatises of Government The Catcher in the Rye Tenshinhan Beavis and Butt-head Livestock Food preservation Foodborne illness Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Garlic The Shining (film) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Omega-3 fatty acid Unreal Homer Simpson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Foie gras W.I.T.C.H.

when is it time to put your dog to sleep i have a year old black lab mix who has a hard time getting up and around he has had many accidents in the house the vet has him on the strongiest pain medicine there is he cannot run around and chase squirrels anymore one day he will sleep all day and the next he is pacing stumbling around he has a good appetite but he has a hard time standing up to eat his food he will walk himself into corners that he can't get out of several times i have come home and found him in situations where i don't know how he got into and he has urinated all over himself i love him very much and it is very hard to see him this way i don't have any kids so he is like my child what do i do i feel your pain my dog was in very much the same state before i made the decision to put her to rest it was unfair to her keeping her alive in the state she was in just as it is unfair to your dog it was a very hard decision to make but i knew that when i had to literally carry her outside and hold her up to go to the bathroom and when i had to feed her food because she couldn't stand up to eat it herself when i had to pull her out from underneath tables and chair in which she got tangled up her time was much overdue can you imagine what it must be like for your dog living like this putting my pup to sleep was a very hard decision but i knew it was the best decision for her even though i didn't feel it was the right one for me i knew i wasn't ready for it but i also knew that she was i scheduled the appointment the day before and spent the entire night sleeping next to her in the morning as if she knew it was her last morning with me she had a burst of energy second wind as they call it she managed to stand up and run around as if she were a puppy again it broke my heart how could i put her down now when she was running around happy wagging her tail but i knew it wouldn't last long while she lived out her second wind i took her on our last walk before getting in the car to take her to the vet tears rolled down my face the entire drive as they do now she was so peaceful waiting at the vet to be taken out of my arms she seemed thankful thankful that she wouldn't have to suffer any longer thankful that she had her second wind and got to enjoy one last day with me it was hard leaving the vet office with a collar and leash but no dog i must've sat outside on the curb and cried for an hour but i knew it was the best thing i could've done for her from what you've described it seems to me that it's time for you to make the same decision make the decision for your dog to ease his pain and suffering not for yourself because you don't want to let go you can't be selfish any longer it's time for you little buddy to rest peacefully believe me you'll be glad you did it sometimes i regret not having done it sooner so that i may have spared my dear pup the misery of her last few weeks but i was selfish i wanted to keep her for myself a little longer despite the pain and suffering she was in i know it's hard but you're the only one who can decide unfortunately our four legged friends can't tell us their wishes nor can they execute them themselves we need to act in their best interest i hope this helps remember the wonderful memories you've had and don't make any more memories of your dog's final days it's unfair to you both  Shaggy dog story Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Blood on the Tracks The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Guinea pig The Contender (television series) Pitaten Sin City 2004 Republican National Convention Hal Trosky W.I.T.C.H.

how do you know if a raccoon has rabies there is a raccoon that comes to our backyard almost every night and eats all the leftovers from my cat's food we don't mind it because it's so cute but it eats straight from my cat's bowl and im worried that it might have rabies and contaminate the bowl how do you know if a raccoon has rabies or not and should i clean the bowl every time the raccoon eats from it the only definitive test for rabies involves a sampling of the animals brain tissue the animal has to be dead for that to occur some symptoms are a distinct and sudden change in behavior vicious animals become tamer and vice versa neurological symtoms such as staggering salivating or seeming to not know where one's feet limbs are prolapsed third eyelids you should not get close enough to any animal suspect of rabies to find this out and changes in sleep wake cycles nocturnal animals being active during the day i would not suggest continueing to feed this animal cat food is very high in taurine and giving it to an animal which may not need it may decrease the life of the animal and cause kidney failure having or encouraging this animal to stay can also cause your animals and you to have worms treatment is not pleasant and raccoons tend to harbor a lot of disease which could kill your cat and could make you sick if you are not afraid of the little microscopic germ consider what would happen to kitty if ever a turf war would occur between the two kitty would be in shreds raccoons have been known to be able to kill large dogs if you encourage this raccoon to stay around it may start up a family and invite more germs and more chances of killing your pet i highly suggest cutting off this animals food supply and have it move on away from you if you think the animal is cute go to the library and read books about them  Rabies Cat Pet skunk Dog Raccoon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Bat Stroke Hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep Urinary incontinence Ferret Cancer First aid Chagas disease Myxobolus cerebralis Vampire Decompression sickness Guinea pig Leptospirosis Heartworm Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Thermoregulation Stomach cancer Animal Hamster Fancy rat Toxoplasmosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Narcolepsy Virginia Opossum Common cold Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Diabetes mellitus Skunk Domestic rabbit Aortic dissection Resident Evil: Apocalypse Malignant melanoma Biological warfare Atherosclerosis Epilepsy Paget's disease of bone Schizophrenia Snake Vitamin C Kakapo Addiction Terri Schiavo Coeliac disease Kitten Taboo food and drink Cirrhosis Schistosomiasis Gray Wolf Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hematophagy Paracetamol Cephalic disorder Medicine Tasmanian Devil Tuberculosis Obesity Whale Multiple sclerosis Anorexia nervosa Fecal incontinence Maine Coon Brown Bear Animal testing Folic acid Tocopherol Nutrition Livestock Foodborne illness Diseases of the honeybee Glycogen storage disease type I Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kashrut Crohn's disease H5N1 Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Spanish flu Louis Pasteur Group A streptococcal infection Excel Saga Mesothelioma Milton H.

can animals cry i know this is random but i have always wondered about it tell me what you think while any animal with tear ducts can produce tears not all animals cry out of sadnes they can suffer and feel loneliess sure but most of them aren't capable of crying out of sadness like we do elephants are one of the few animals that produces tears out of sadness they're grieving after a member of the herd dies is quite obvious i'm sure you can get tons of documentaries online depicting the almost funeral like assembly which consist of literally crying burying the dead and staying for long hours sometimes even days next to the grave some elephants have also been seen crying after reuniting with a long lost family member it's also not unusual for some primates such as chimpanzees dying after losing a close family member because they lose the will to feed themselves etc or even developing aggressive behaviors towards other members of the family or even to completely disassociate itself from others of it's kind  Elephant Tears Burial Aquatic ape hypothesis Paul Is Dead Death Jewish bereavement Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Jade Emperor Time Out of Mind Dinosaur Autism Jam (TV series) Funeral Reaction to the assassination of John F.

turtule vs tortoise what is the difference between a turtle and a tortoise i never understood it turtles spend most of their time in the water but tortoises are mostly land dwellers turtles are more likely adapted to aquatic life and when it gets cold they find a warm ground in the ocean and dig their way down to make a hole for them to rest in their front feet are mostly fins and they have flatter backs than tortoises do tortoises though could drown in deep or swift current their feet are hard scaly and nubby so it can crawl across sharp rocks and sand tortoises often have claws to dig burrows which they occupy during hot sunny weather or during sleep tortoises are mostly herbivorous eating cactus shrubs and other plants that have a lot of moisture they rarely migrate their shell forms a rounded dome allowing the tortoise's limbs and head to withdraw for protection there you go  Coconut crab Desert Tortoise Reptile Tortoise Fauna of Australia Creatures in Bionicle Sea turtle Marine biology Turtle Ecology of Hong Kong Gal__pagos tortoise Diving suit Tetrapod Evidence of evolution Leatherback Sea Turtle Desert Opportunity rover The Legend of Zelda series enemies Atlantic Ocean Platypus Ecology Endangered species Carnivorous plant Swimming Comanche Volleyball Dinosaur American Alligator Anchor Water Geography of Japan Snake Drill bit An Duong Vuong Beach Paleocene Leaf Grand Teton National Park Death Valley National Park Goanna American lobster Quang Ninh Province Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Otter Bivalvia Turtles all the way down Tuatara Tooth Seabird Aardvark Minor Harry Potter Beasts Zeno's paradoxes Equine conformation Koopa Troopa Tea Gypsy moth Nile crocodile Shark Triassic Glacier Combine (Half-Life 2) Drowning Gastropoda Crane (bird) The Future is Wild Mars Exploration Rover Deluge (mythology) Precipitation (meteorology) Peruvian cuisine Florida Keys Wood carving Geography of Africa Thermoregulation Yosemite National Park Biology of the Sierra Nevada Energy development Dam The Great Race (Care Bears) Glossary of wildland fire terms Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Burning Man Brown Bear Solar cell Weather lore Global climate model Koala Bugs Bunny Geodesic dome D'ni wildlife Skateboarding trick Sea serpent Enceladus (moon) Tofu Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Kappa (mythical creature) Trace fossil

how can you stop a rabbit from biting you when approaching the rabbit do so slowly and make no sudden moves or loud noises without getting too close let it sniff your hand then slowly reach over the top of its head and gently rub it directly behind the ears once you have shown the rabbit that you do not intend to hurt it and have gained its trust this may take several attempts and require lots of patience you can then gently pick it up stroke it as long as you are calm and quiet at all times the rabbit should realise that you mean no harm and that you are not a threat  Domestic rabbit Diving Aerial (dance move) Breastfeeding Microphone Combine (Half-Life 2) Quake III Arena Cat Guinea pig Milton H.

if a man's best friend is a dog what is a woman's best friend we all know what a man's best friend is but i want to know what a woman's best friend is please help personally i think it's just a phrase in which when they use the term 'man ' a dog is both a man's and women's best friend silly it's just a saying and when they do say a dog is a man's best friend they mean to us humans in general long long time ago people would say a dog was a boy's best friend and that a cat was a women's best friend the reason for this was because a dog seemed like a man's pet because they used dogs in armies military firefighting police business and so forth people also thought a cat was a girl's best friend because cats are smooth independant and try not to get into trouble kind of pet and people thought that cats would fit into a girl's lifestyle as said from long time ago but this is not true anymore and it's just a saying for us  Shaggy dog story Internet phenomenon Ren and Stimpy Ranma __ characters Girly Azumanga Daioh Dog Cliff Richard Tenchi Muyo!

what would happen if you fed your dog or cat a small amount of magic mushrooms or acid would they trip about bones and digging or chasing other animals jesus christ im not gonna do it chill the fcuk out i was just wondering what effect it would have on them i'm not sure what would happen and of course i assume you would never do it but i would think if they had a small amount they would react like we do i mean if you think about it there are mushrooms and other substances wild animals can come across in their habitat and possibly eat which would not be healthy for them someone once told me that the trip is supposed freak you out and make you never want to touch that particular substance again but of course people are different from animals and use the trip to their advantage so i think something similar would happen to the animal but since they're mainly concerned with staying alive and healthy they wouldn't enjoy it and would never eat it again p s i can understand people wanting to be protective of animals but it's not like it's horrible to only discuss these things come on who are these people the thought police i honestly don't think you are the first person to ever have this thought and anyone who would be sick enough to actually do it doesn't need to look at yahoo answers to get ideas about how to be cruel to animals  Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog Psychedelic mushroom The nature of God in Western theology Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Cat One Piece minor characters Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theodicy Predestination Gray Wolf Lycanthropy Psilocybin Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hamster Sesshomaru Cyberspace Health insurance Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Soul Negima A Course In Miracles Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Guinea pig Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Veganism Biology Tiger Tooth enamel Trailer Park Boys Supernatural Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fancy rat Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Pok__mon Live!

if a bigger animal is 'bullying' you what is your response i am thinking in particular of a certain horse that i have she was abused and is very senstive but she is also very stubborn she will try biting pushing me into fences kicking etc if i raise my voice she gets very nervous and upset i would like a new way to let her know that she cannot push me around and yet keep everything calm and quiet at the same time any tips she fears you will bring her more misery try catering to her be nice selfless and gentle but stern she needs to know that she doesn't have to push you away  Horse breaking Milton H.

i am moving the pasture for my horses is part in the woods will the ferns hurt them i looked at the land i will have to use for pasture it can be cleared i want to leave a lot of trees because of heat but there are lots of ferns i plan to feed lots of hay as there is lots of sand in sc and grass does not like to grow but if they forage will the ferns hurt them some ferns are very poisonous to horses so yes i would consider fencing the wooded area off and not allowing the horses in there also because your soil is so sandy you need to start your horses on a regular regimen of sand clear once a month or so this will prevent the sand from accumulating in the horses' intestines and possibly causing a life threatening colic l live in central delaware and a few years ago my sister almost lost one of her prized geldings to colic caused by sand so take a lesson from what we went through with him he had to have surgery to remove the sand and was out of action for months afterwards if we had known about the relationship between sand and colic we would have been doing this all along and might have been able to prevent the colic we learned the hard way which is why i am warning you about this good luck with your move and i hope this helps  Horse colic Breastfeeding Deforestation Laminitis Weed control John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Prosopis cineraria Hay Livestock Equine conformation Desertification New Forest Pitaten Opportunity rover Golf Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Desert Dune Days of our Lives Lawn Plant Agriculture Rooibos Geology of the Grand Canyon area Horse Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Hamster Tenshinhan Kidney stone Derbyshire lead mining history Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Fire fighting Gypsy moth Woodworking Fern Naruto geography Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Florida Keys Milk Cider Wildfire Stomach cancer Elis Prefecture Kakapo Sorghum Glossary of wildland fire terms Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Palouse Scientology beliefs and practices Lead poisoning Akatsuki (Naruto) Geography of Chile Alfalfa Diseases of the honeybee Eldfell Erosion 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drill bit Shifting cultivation Flood geology Piccolo Junior Saga Crazy Horse Barbed wire Hern__n Cort__s Garth Brooks Flowering plant Goldenrod Fencing W.I.T.C.H.

peta says having a pet is cruel and they all should be free do you agree with them i believe you are mistaken peta stands for people for the ethical treatment of animals it is a group that cares passionately about animals they believe and i agree that it is cruel to keep animals in cages or capture wild animals and make pets or zoo exhibits out of them your small pet rodents like hamsters and gerbils are probably for the most part pretty content with the nice habitat you provide for them if their home is kept clean and they have plenty of fresh food and water i see nothing wrong with that caged egg laying hens however are another matter entirely that is probably the cruelest thing i can imagine i buy all my eggs from a local farm a few miles out of town way fresher than what's in the store cheaper cruelty free and i know where they came from i'm hoping to get a home out of town so i can keep a few hens of my own i really don't think peta actually encourages people to turn their pets loose into the streets can you imagine the chaos and accidents that would ensue plus dogs especially have been domesticated for thousands of years most breeds now aren't really adept hunters and they would have to resort to foraging to find food dogs rely on people to take care of them they crave companionship a dog kept on a chain out in the yard is a very sad thing cats could and do survive in the wild what happens to them is getting hit by cars or eating poison someone carelessly or intentionally in some cases left out man made hazards put them somewhere with no people and they would do fine however i have never had a well loved and well cared for cat that was miserable with it's lot in life cats are smart enough to know when they have it good having their food provided nice soft places to sleep being safe and getting lots of love and attention from their pet humans lol i envy my cats fish can have it good or bad depends on the fish keeper if he or she is someone who maintains a meticulously clean tank doesn't over crowd it feeds proper amounts of good food and provides an environment with structures to explore and plants to hide and sleep in then fish have a good chance to have an easy fulfilling life i feel sorry for pet birds especially when they never get out of their cages birds were meant to fly if you must keep birds and they are beautiful please consider screening in a covered porch or deck and creating an aviary the closer you can simulate their natural environment the better for them only adopt domestic bred and hand raised birds help stop the importing of wild caught birds if they can fly around perch on actual branches and have a birdbath they'll be much happer birds would you want to sit in a little cage all day every day year after year they don't want to either that's what peta wants people to understand just empathize with your pets treat them the way you would want to be treated if you were them pets with owners who know how to care for their pets and do so lovingly have a joyful life and make a wonderful companion pets who are mistreated or only given the bare necessities to stay alive are the saddest thing i've ever seen peta wants people to treat animals with compassion raising them solely for their fur cruelly slaughtering them for meat keeping them confined to little cages instead of letting them roam free as nature intended that's what peta protests those few zealots you hear about who throw buckets of paint on people wearing fur are the exception not the rule there's going to be a few nuts in every barrel most peta supporters are normal human beings who choose to not contribute to animal cruelty and to one degree or another do what they can to improve animal's lives and rights many times they are also environmentalists trying to do their part to bring back the balance on this planet that is what peta really is people who want all living things to work and live in harmony if you are going to adopt a pet learn all you can about it before you ever go and look at them buy a book or two from a pet store book store or borrow from your library find out what it takes not only to keep the creature alive but what it takes to make it a comfortable and satisfied pet realize that dogs cats and most birds live at least into their teens or twenties you are making a long term commitment to the animal pets aren't disposable if you don't want to make that commitment consider fostering pets adopting an older homeless pet or get something with a lot shorter life span like a hamster please get your pet vaccinated and spayed or neutered if it's a dog or cat it's the right thing to do it will make a better pet a better companion for you and it's better for the animal the shelters are full of puppies and kittens whose owners never intended to let their pet breed it just happened keep it from happening to your pet sorry my answer is so long this is an issue i feel very strongly about i support peta the aspca and the hsus i do my part and if this prompts one person to do their part or learn about a pet before adopting it or get their pet fixed i will feel it was well worth the time

pet owners with questions about sick dogs or cats i wonder why is it that a lot people would rather ask whats wrong with their pet online then call their vet as soon as they realize something is wrong why is it that no one seems to utilize their vets as soon as i sence something is wrong with my two dogs the first thing i do is call my vet and explain to them whats going on why would i care and more then that wait for random people who are not vets to answer my questions is it jsut me who is wondering that i mean if you were having a heart attack would you wait and post a question online and see who answers or would you call what i think is the best phone calls are fairly inexpensive and they dont charge for that i mean i call my vet first thing if i suspect something and may be i am just lucky to have a vet who is very willing to give up information and really never said i should come in unless he felt it was absolutelly important i mean just call the vet bekka sorry to say that but i would rather hear smth from a dumb vet with education then a smart person who knows nothing about being a vet and also you are not glued to your vet find a new one a lot of people have wondered this including myself i'm not sure why some post questions that should be answered by a vet i guess they are seeking validation that calling the vet is the right thing to do i always hope that maybe they have called the vet and are waiting for an answer or return call this morning i noticed that my dog was bleeding i took her to the emergency vet immediately didn't even think of asking why online but i've had pets before so maybe it is just experience or possibly common sense anyway my dog is fine urinary tract infection and i was able to get meds for her  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Password Guinea pig Ferret Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rabies Garfield Killian documents Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Cat Kim Possible Time Out of Mind Hip hop rivalries Past teachings of Prem Rawat Rent (musical) Philosophy of language Microchip implant (animal) Medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Plame affair timeline Avenue Q AFI 100 Years series Plame affair Dog Goodness and value theory Beetle in an Anthill Winter Soldier Investigation Joke Crossword The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Veterinarian Religious Society of Friends The Fairly OddParents Calvin and Hobbes Infantilism The Inside Prostate cancer Swift Vets and POWs for Truth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Fancy rat Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Current teachings of Prem Rawat Dilbert Piccolo Junior Saga Coming of Age (TNG episode) Strategic management Sexual orientation Oh My Goddess!

can u give rats city or distilled water wich is better well i have been giving my rats city water but people tell me give them distilled water what bshould i do distilled water is stripped of nutrients and minerals it's not good for anyone or anything to drink it's usually used for things like steam irons so that the water doesn't leave behind any calcium deposits or other minerals many health fanatics are surprised to hear me say that drinking distilled water on a regular daily basis is potentially dangerous paavo airola wrote about the dangers of distilled water in the 's when it first became a fad with the health food crowd distillation is the process in which water is boiled evaporated and the vapour condensed distilled water is free of dissolved minerals and because of this has the special property of being able to actively absorb toxic substances from the body and eliminate them studies validate the benefits of drinking distilled water when one is seeking to cleanse or detoxify the system for short periods of time a few weeks at a time fasting using distilled water can be dangerous because of the rapid loss of electrolytes sodium potassium chloride and trace minerals like magnesium deficiencies of which can cause heart beat irregularities and high blood pressure cooking foods in distilled water pulls the minerals out of them and lowers their nutrient value distilled water is an active absorber and when it comes into contact with air it absorbs carbon dioxide making it acidic the more distilled water a person drinks the higher the body acidity becomes according to the u s environmental protection agency distilled water being essentially mineral free is very aggressive in that it tends to dissolve substances with which it is in contact notably carbon dioxide from the air is rapidly absorbed making the water acidic and even more aggressive many metals are dissolved by distilled water  Carbon dioxide Edible salt Water purification Ammonia Sulfuric acid Acetic acid Titanium Water (molecule) Alcohol Carbon Mineral Hydrochloric acid Chlorine Soil pH Hard water Magnesium Water Phosphorus Sulfur Veganism Electrolyte Hydrogen peroxide Salt Aluminium Iron Explosive material Weathering Alum Manganese Nuclear power Alcoholic beverage Milk Lithium Folic acid Nutrient Carbon dioxide sink Corrosion Hydrogen Carnivorous plant Alcohol fuel Distillation Alkane Zinc Benzene Coffee Vitamin C Sodium carbonate Strontium Fluoride Nitrogen Tocopherol Fire extinguisher Omega-3 fatty acid Sewage treatment Rebreather Heat exchanger Blood Cyanide Solvent Haloalkane Microwave oven Ecology Welding Aspartame Iodine Chromium Tooth Creating chemical solutions Uranium Beryllium Motor oil Tofu Ocean thermal energy conversion Acid Vitamin Coal Dry cleaning Potassium chloride Desert Protein Copper extraction Hydrogen chloride Calcium Ultraviolet Water vapor Poison Base (chemistry) Plastic Ethanol Gas metal arc welding Industrial process Insulin Photosynthesis

why do some people value the life of animals over people they're just animals they're here for the pleasure and satisfaction of people on the other hand we're not alive to serve animals night and day unless it's on a platter seriously though animals are evolutionarily inferior to humans and we have the right to do whatever we want with them because who are we to provoke deevolution of all species therefore let us be on with cooking eating teasing beating and chastizing animals they'd do it to us if they could some people value the life of animals more than humans because human beings can choose their manner of living whilst animals can't people can choose wether or not they live in filth or live unhealthy lives animals are dependant upon humans for food and shelter and can't defend or provide for themselves the same way people can although animals may be evolutionarily inferior to humans it doesn't mean that they can't feel and understand pain and suffering why do you think dogs whimper when they have a broken leg or cats yowl if you accidently step on their tail it's because they feel pain just because they can't communicate it like humans do doesnt mean that the feelings don't exist they aren't here for the pleasure and satisfaction of people they are here because once they played an important part in the evolutionary cycle the fact that they have been domesticated and no longer play such an important role doesn't mean that their lives are worthless and shame to anyone who believes that they are  Cat Evolution Happiness Gray Wolf Dog The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Peter Singer Goodness and value theory Nicomachean Ethics Human Religion Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Theory of conduct Spanking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an S__ren Kierkegaard Domestic rabbit Addiction Animal rights Motivation Narcissism Kashrut Utilitarianism Hunting Species YuYu Hakusho Hell Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Vegetarianism Speciesism Fecal incontinence Social psychology Socialization Domestic violence Free will Animism Infantilism Life expectancy Japanese tea ceremony Sigmund Freud Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Zoophilia Domestication Livestock Abortion debate Eating Summa Theologiae Immortality Original sin Transactional analysis Sociobiology Emotion Meaning of life Dog training Evolutionarily stable strategy Hamster The Amber Spyglass Orgasm Taboo food and drink Coconut crab Mojave people Tasmanian Devil Chicken Michel Henry Inception of Darwin's theory Alignment (role-playing games) Sin City Theodicy Lycanthropy Extinction The Death Gate Cycle Sleep Tooth enamel Aquatic ape hypothesis Philosophy of language Guns, Germs, and Steel Empathy Tom and Jerry (MGM) Kangaroo Child sexuality Scientology beliefs and practices Spider Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Shark Person Sonic the Hedgehog Feral cat Brown Bear Cerebellum Equine conformation Simone Weil Human sexual behavior Animal testing Carnivore Bhajan

how do you disinfect the smell of rabbit's urine my indoor rabbits have been urinating on the floor and i don't know how to eliminate the smell you'll need to use an enzyme to neutralize the ammonia in the urine you can go to a pet store and find many to choose from however like others have said white vinegar works as well and it's cheaper dab up the urine as much as possible pour the vinegar over the spot then dab up the vinegar it will stink for a while but once the vinegar dries there will be no problem another good thing about using an enzyme reaction is that the rabbit wont be able to smell the urine either so if you've been having problems with your bunny peeing in the same spot this will likely stop good luck  Ammonia Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Urine Vinegar Rabbit Cat Sodium hypochlorite Toilet Toilet humour Fancy rat Urinal Guinea pig Acetic acid Skunk Urinary incontinence Hamster Japanese toilet Vermicompost Horseshoe Protein Hydrogen peroxide Salt Luck Disinfection The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Fish and chips Carbon tetrachloride Ketchup Water Drug test Cosmo Kramer Ultraviolet Clomipramine Gaia Online Barbecue Insulin Art Digital audio broadcasting Cuisine of Denmark Menstrual cycle Diabetes mellitus Food preservation Amine Tobacco smoking Minor characters in Morrowind World War Three (Doctor Who) Hydrogen economy Social aspects of clothing Phenylketonuria Easter Bunny Renal physiology Bugs Bunny Enzyme Japanese cuisine Transaminase Food science Biochemistry Hillsborough disaster Mass spectrometry Stoat Rabbit Seasoning Penis Monty Python and the Holy Grail Vitamin C Urea Ferret Urinary system Urination Tofu Sulfuric acid KaBlam!

what do to you do to 'punish' a horse i don't like the word 'punish' because it sounds controlling but when you have a horse that is pushing you around physically into fences or just to be rude biting you kicking you or just refusing to let you near it's feet to clean it or totally refusing to let you get the saddle blanket on i giver her lots of positive re enforcement but what to do when she is rude and a bully to me other horse 'punish' each other by pushing back by biting or kicking back obviously i won't do that i won't hit her or yell that would get her very upset as she was abused she is not always like this but she has her days how would you handle it she is not like the other horses i have had she is sensitive to me but won't give in she gets upset easily i understand your horse was abused but she's obviously past that stage now if she can get up the nerve to be bratty and enter into your space even bite and kick you she needs some serious discipline i'm no trainer so i can't tell you how to handle such a horse correctly but i'd say a lot of lunging and backing practice on her part when she gets in your space slap her if she has the nerve to bite you yes slap her if she can be rude enough to bite you you can be rude enough to bite her back a lot of yielding exercises for your safety for the most part though if you feel you cannot handle this i would get a trainer  Horse tack Equine conformation Spanking Dog training Horse Milton H.

are bunnys great pets my dad says no so we cant git one but i say yes what do you say it depends on what type of pet you're looking for rabbits shed a ton the cage will smell no matter how many times you clean it and as soon as it's clean there will be fifty more turds in it they love to gnaw on things so if you let it loose in the house you're gonna have some major probs until it's trained realllllly well i had a rabbit for ten yrs we got him when i was four yrs old my brother was seven and my sister three we have around cousins the rabbit was our only pet when we were younger now imagine what that poor rabbit went through when we had family parties at our house yeah poor clover he really was incredibly patient with us and allowed us to carry him all around passed from one little kid to the next the thing i think was good though is he wasn't afraid to bite if we crossed a limit he'd simply bite i've still got a scar on my hand worst animal bite i've ever experienced and that's saying something but looking back it was good for us to have a pet that would defend itself if we went too far now clover is the only rabbit i ever had he lived ten long yrs the vet was shocked when we brought him in he was like this rabbit isn't neutered i'm surprised at how calm he is i give him an 'a' in behavior this rabbit has cataracts i've never seen a rabbit with cataracts i've never seen a rabbit this old lol then he had some fellow nurses and such come in to pet and oogle at our old bun bun wistful sigh sadly old age took its toll and six months later we put clovey down rabbits generally like to wander around they won't play with you like cats or dogs do they each have unique attitudes take some of clover's we'd try to pet or pick him up and he'd kick and wiggle away from us after we'd give up and leave him alone he'd hop over and nudge our hands insistently demanding to be petted crazy rabbit as a household pet things can get messy he liked to hide behind the couch and chew the carpet chewed anything he could reach we usually only let him run around outside the smell and shedding are in my opinion the major downsides to rabbits respect your dad's decision if you can't sway him otherwise it's his house i can understand his view of not wanting rabbit hair all over the house  Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Hamster Shaggy dog story Ferret Garfield Dog training Ranma __ characters Care Bears One Piece minor characters Pet skunk KaBlam!

how do you know a hamster has fleas i found a flea a couple weeks ago and killed it but i am not sure if it was a flea it might have been a gnat but now i see her scratching herself sometimes how can you tell if your hamster has fleas it would be unlikely for a hamster to get fleas since hamsters are usually strictly indoor pets however i'm sure it is possible for your hamster to get fleas from your other pets if you have dogs or cats that are primarily outdoor pets is she scratching herself a lot is this a new behavior or is she doing it more than normal if so she might have fleas take a close look and see if you see any on her skin but if she's the only pet you have and she doesn't go outside i would think it was highly unlikely that she would have fleas if you do find fleas on her though you might want to consult a veterinarian or small animal expert to find out how to treat it since most flea treatments on the market are intended for much bigger pets  Hamster Cat Flea Pet skunk Ferret Domestic rabbit Bat Dog Pet Fancy rat Guinea pig Heartworm Flea market Microchip implant (animal) Bubonic plague Housebreaking Socialization Livestock Animal testing Garfield Veterinarian Pet store Greyhound Manx (cat) Rabies Chicken Phantom cat American Alligator Red Hot Chili Peppers Golden Hamster John Frusciante German Shepherd Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Leopard Puma Dilbert Dog collar Animal communication Chinchilla Dog training Internet phenomenon Cheetah Tuberculosis Hamtaro Tattoo Teacher's Pet (Disney) Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Dobermann Animal rights Cat food Siegfried & Roy Codename: Kids Next Door Sid Vicious Malignant melanoma Animal euthanasia Rat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Shampoo Tungiasis Monster Rancher monsters Tiger H5N1 Monkey Animal shelter Estrus cycle Mutts Kitten InuYasha 101 Dalmatians: The Series Mange Allergy Comparative psychology Exotic pet Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fur farming Raccoon Clothing Tiny Toon Adventures CatDog Aladdin (1992 film) Illegal drug trade Richard Chase Galaxy Angel Hello Kitty Keeshond Coprophagia Asthma Taboo food and drink The Hampster Dance Hair Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Kangaroo Pet Sematary The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Contredanse Carnivore Domestication Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder H2G2

how long do you wait until you stop using flea medicine i used about two months worth of flea medicine on my kitty which left me a lot of time to get rid of the fleas in my house so can i stop using the medicine or do i have to continue getting more i need to know asap because school is starting and i have to know how to manage my money thanks it depends on if your cat is indoor or outdoor if it's an indoor cat it's chances of getting fleas aren't as high but it can still happen especially if you still have fleas in your house the only way to guarantee you won't have flea problems is to use flea treatments however i had cats for about ten years and never used expensive flea medicines i bought special flea bath shampoo and gave them each a flea bath once or twice a month it worked well and you can get a bottle of the stuff for ten or twenty bucks if you only have one cat one bottle would probably last you a while  Flea Red Hot Chili Peppers Livestock Flea market Domestic rabbit Shampoo Swimming pool Poker jargon Social rule $ale of the Century Housebreaking Illegal drug trade Linked list Feral cat Publicly funded medicine John Frusciante Sento Okashina Okashi Hearts (game) Heartworm Jade Emperor Badly Drawn Kitties Stomach cancer Computed tomography The Joker's Wild Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Quackery 2005 World Series Paintball University of Bath Medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Michael Balzary Plagues of Egypt Shaggy dog story Ultimate (sport) Piccolo Junior Saga Chinchilla Mutual fund Ben Johnson (athlete) Mid-levels Fancy rat Bubonic plague Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Pitaten Education in the United States Garfield Black Books Health insurance Sheepshead RKO Pictures Breastfeeding Sprint (race) Volleyball Graduate school Winning Streak Diwali Grand Forks, North Dakota American football 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics Annuity Bill Frist Second Battle of the Atlantic Athletics Stroke Warren Buffett Hamster Saga (band) Education in Portugal Cranford, New Jersey Make money fast Game show CPU cache Alternative medicine Kakapo Prostate cancer Tiny Toon Adventures Decompression sickness Maneki Neko 2000 Australian Grand Prix Light-emitting diode Reading and Leeds Festivals Blood Sugar Sex Magik The Apprentice 1 Lacrosse The Book of Five Rings University of Arizona Andr__s Galarraga Patent medicine National Football League Lore Ferret Diabetes mellitus Sears Holdings Corporation Toronto Blue Jays The Contender (television series) Single malt Scotch

which pet should i choose for my avatar best answer included ok so i have pets that i take care of but i don't know which one a take a picture of and put as my avatar please if you could pick which pet you think that i should do for my avatar that would be great here are your choices male dwarf rabbit gray male guinea pig cream white and tan female dwarf hamster white female dwarf hamster brown and black female golden retriever female lhasa opsa tan black brown and white goldfish orange hermit crab with a petco shell on him hermit crab with a plan shell on her thank you so much for your help and for answering this whoever picks the pet that i go for gets best answer also if you could leave a message telling me why you choose the pet that would be great too thank you so much future vet i'd go for the female golden retriever because personally i think all dogs are wonderful animals i have two dogs and i love them very much no matter what breed a dog may be i think they are all adorible and affectionate rabbits hamsters guinea pigs lhasa opsa's fish and hermit crabs are all astounding creatures but the reason why i chose the golden retriever is because dogs aren't only a man's best friend but a girl's best friend too besides it sounds like you really love all your animals and that's the best thing an owner can give to his her pets overall the good choices you have pointed out the golden retriever caught my attention the most they are smart beautiful sturdy and well proportioned dogs and i think everybody should see that even if it was through a picture as everyone says pictures mean words but yours mean it would be an absolutely bright idea if you just took a picture of all your animals so everyone can see them but since that's not part of the question that's why i chose the golden retriever the picture of your dog will be very resourceful to other yahoo users and personally i think your other animal's pictures will too i never in my life had a golden retriever in my life because i already have a german pinscher and a yorkshire terrier but if i did have a golden retriever i think they'd all get along most importantly i'd even take a picture of them all together and set that as my avatar if i wanted to there are so many people out there who care less about the neglected and abused dogs and if these people saw how cute and innocent faced these creatures were they would start realizing a little more than just intelligence in these amazing dogs pictures show many emotion personality and affection and your dog will show more  Dog Hamster Dobermann Internet phenomenon Nintendogs Pet German Shepherd Dog Mixed-breed dog Avatar Garfield Domestic rabbit As Good as It Gets Theory of conduct Ferret The Ashlee Simpson Show Golden Retriever Avatar (virtual reality) Animal testing Our Gang Friends Who Framed Roger Rabbit Monster Rancher monsters Care Bears KaBlam!

wanna know the benefits of spaying or neutering your pet altering pets helps prevent the unwanted birth of animals that would be difficult to place into good homes sadly each year more than million dogs and cats are killed because of overpopulation the spaying and neutering of pets can also reduce their incidence of sex hormone related diseases will my dog or cat be a better pet after altering yes in addition to the benefits of not having heat periods and unwanted offspring the animal s tendency to roam is decreased most pets become less aggressive toward people and other animals what are some of the other known advantages of having my pet altered the neutered male cat has a decreased urine odor less of a tendency to fight and roam and it is far less inclined to mark its territory by spraying urine the neutered male dog is also less likely to roam mark territory and display aggression toward other dogs neutered dogs have fewer prostrate problems tumors around the anus and decreased urine odor the spayed female cat and dog do not have reproductive tract disease problems and both are troubled with significantly fewer cases of mammary cancer what is actually done in a spay or neuter procedure in both cases the animal is put under general anesthesia so that it cannot feel anything a spay surgery also called an ovariohysterectomy is performed on females while performed routinely an ovariohysterectomy is a major surgery in which the reproductive tract including the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus is removed neutering refers to the castration of a male animal it is a surgical procedure in which both testicles are removed neutering requires considerably less time and equipment than a spay surgery how old should my pet be before surgery the best way to decide on a timetable for your particular pet is to consult with your veterinarian current research has shown that in general it is safe to alter dogs and cats as early as eight weeks of age should the female have a heat period or a litter before being spayed if your pet is going to be a companion animal rather than a breeding animal then there are no benefits to allowing her to have a litter or to go through a heat period it is actually healthier for your dog or cat never to experience a heat as it lessen s the animal s chance of getting mammary cancer and decreases the animal s stress and risks due to pregnancy and delivery research indicates that dogs spayed prior to their first heat have less than a half of one percent chance of experiencing mammary cancer as compared to an eight percent chance after the second heat cats spayed after their first heat have a seven times greater chance of suffering from mammary cancer than cats spayed prior to their first heat is it safe for a dog or cat to be spayed when she is in heat or pregnant females in good health can have the surgery done when they are in heat or pregnant talk with your veterinarians as to what is best for your pet isn t it unnatural to deprive my pet of a sex life no dogs and cats have sex strictly to satisfy hormone induced instincts not for pleasure why shouldn t i just keep my female dog or cat confined while she is in heat you can do this of course but remember your unspayed dog will come into heat twice a year for its entire life a cat comes into heat once a month for its entire life also do not forget all of the health benefits to your pet by having it spayed will spaying or neutering my pet cause it to become fat and lazy no weight gain is due to being fed more calories than the animal uses watch the quantity of food you give your pet also older pets need fewer calories than younger ones because they tend to be less active and are no longer growing regular play and exercise along with diet are the keys to keeping your pet in shape thanks i'll read it later i love the questions and answers  Puberty Obesity Fancy rat Stomach cancer Birth control Kitten Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Colorectal cancer Pregnancy Transsexuality House Mouse Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Intersex surgery Animal testing Tocopherol Growth hormone treatment Medical analysis of circumcision Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Abortion debate Clinical depression In vitro fertilisation Sexual reproduction Acne Housebreaking Insulin Nutrition Infertility Medicine Hypoglycemia Childbirth Lung cancer Atkins Nutritional Approach Livestock History of intersex surgery Multiple sclerosis Vitamin C Oral sex Condom Intersexuality Herpes simplex virus Socialization Nuclear power Human sexual behavior Cryptorchidism Renal cell carcinoma Breast Divorce Sleep Circumcision Sex organ Crohn's disease Stroke Rabies Penis Ovarian cancer Adjustable gastric band Manx (cat) Psoriasis Mesothelioma Endometrial cancer Premature birth Tasmanian Devil Bipolar disorder Gynaecology Estrus cycle Orgasm Sexual intercourse Animal communication

whats the lifespan of a average rex rabbit and how big can they get here is all you need to know about a rex they are beautiful aren't they rex rabbit breed rex rabbit temperament quiet intelligent cost from for pets to lifespan years recommended for children over years older people maintenance low appearance the rex is classified as a medium sized rabbit weighing around kg lb it is unique because of the fur which is like plush velvet the fur is usually about mm long and stands almost at right angles to the skin the rex gene causes the very fine straight guard hairs to be shortened to the same length as the underhairs giving the animal the appearance of having been shorn the breed was named after the rex gene which has caused the rabbit's whiskers and eyebrows to be curly while the coat is generally too short to show curling some longer areas such as behind the head may be crimped the rex gene also occurs in cats it seems to make the hairs thin sparse and curly while the cat breeders still persist with near bald animals the rex rabbit breeders have thickened up the coat enormously and this is a classic example of intelligent breeding i e use of modifier genes colours include white black orange sooty fawn blue lilac chocolate sable chinchilla dark at base light middle dark tip marten white underbelly and tips castor agouti opal blue agouti lynx lilac agouti cinnamon chocolate agouti and himalayan there are other colours available overseas and breeders are working on developing more in australia a smaller version of the rex known as the mini rex is available but is not as affectionate as the rex temperament according to breeders most rex rabbits are easy to handle and are not as jumpy as the smaller breeds rex rabbits are claimed to be the most intelligent of all the rabbit breeds owners describe them as boisterous and playful although they can be nippy the male especially can become aggressive at mating age to avoid this it is necessary that rex rabbits be desexed before four months of age  German Shepherd Dog Dog Fancy rat Cat Domestic rabbit Fur Black panther Keeshond Dobermann Chinchilla Cheetah Manx (cat) Labrador Retriever Shetland Sheepdog Maine Coon Ferret Cornish Rex Tabby cat Hamster Horse Havanese Leopard Mixed-breed dog Meriones unguiculatus Turkish Van Stoat Rabbit European Rabbit Colours, standards and guidons Hair Tortoiseshell cat Red Fox Angora rabbit Domestic goat Tyrannosaurus rex Siberian Husky Skye Terrier Finnish Spitz Smooth Collie Poodle Sphynx (cat) Monster Rancher monsters Tasmanian Devil Baldness Roan (color) Livestock Maltese tiger Red Squirrel House Mouse Dachshund Rottweiler Equine conformation Haircut Great Dane Jack Russell Terrier Siamese (cat) White tiger Griffon Bruxellois Minor Harry Potter Beasts Seabird Pomeranian (dog) Tom and Jerry (MGM) Tibetan Terrier Human skin color Strap-on dildo Liger Knife Discus (fish) Weimaraner Basset Hound Drill bit Balinese (cat) Care Bears Leaf Miniature Fox Terrier Lion Tigon Androgen insensitivity syndrome Senescence Puma Alaskan Malamute Farthing (coin) Falconry Platypus Bird migration Staffordshire Bull Terrier Internal ballistics American Cocker Spaniel Academic dress of Oxford University Coat (dog)

would a guinea pig be good for me i get very emotionally attached to animals i have several cats and a dog i was looking at adding a guinea pig to my family and i want to know how long they live i had a teddybear hampster and i was devestated when she died at years old our vet said i should stay away from short lived animals and our animals tend to live a long time all of our cats and dogs we have had in the past have lived into their 's guinea pigs are wonderful animals a guinea pig is often thought of as a good pet for children and this is true but as with all pets parents must make sure the child is old enough to be gentle with the animal and mature enough to care for it properly a guinea pig is a sociable animal and needs a home where it will receive attention and affection being left in a cage and ignored is a harsh life for the guinea pig they are affectionate animals that love to be held and owners should be prepared for this a prospective owner should get a good book on guinea pig care and read it carefully a guinea pig s needs are not elaborate but include a roomy cage safe bedding a ceramic food bowl a water bottle with a sipper spout guinea pig pellets and timothy hay these are the basics some people put a little plastic or wooden shelter inside the cage but this is not recommended for the first week or so at home the guinea pig may retreat inside the shelter and refuse to come out except to eat a shelter should only be added after the guinea pig has become accustomed to its environment if you are wondering about the general lifespan of a guinea pig an average lifespan is years but they can live longer sometimes years when properly cared for the basic equipment you'll need for a guinea pig are cage food dish water bottle guinea pig pellets vitamins timothy hay salt spool and pine bedding only guinea pigs can be kept as singles or in groups of two or more two females are good but two males will fight remember that guinea pigs are prolific animals and a male and female kept together will most likely result in babies at some point many people say that more than one guinea pig will be better for both of them because guinea pigs are social animals and when the owner doesn't have enough time to give one of the guinea pigs attention the two or more guinea pigs can give eachother amusement guinea pigs are very popular pets because of their availability docile temperaments tendency not to bite or scratch when handled and relatively clean habits they are not long lived which can be disconcerting to owners especially children many parents however believe that having their children experience the relatively short period of companionship and subsequent death is a meaningful way to expose children to the ups and downs of life overall guinea pigs are wonderful pets and are easy to care for if you have the time if you think about it carefully guinea pigs can live pretty long with the proper care p s i read the answers at the top and please don't get your guinea pig a plastic ball to run in  Pet skunk Cat Fancy rat Dog Garfield Socialization Dog training Pig Chinchilla Pet Social rule Taboo food and drink Japanese tea ceremony Strap-on dildo Domestication Ferret Breastfeeding Narcissism Animal rights Fecal incontinence Coprophagia Kosher foods Vitamin C Drill bit Golden Retriever RuneScape quests Peruvian cuisine Ranma __ characters Happiness Animal testing Stuttering Pottery Food Guns, Germs, and Steel Theory of conduct Life expectancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Animal Farm Lisa the Vegetarian Team Rocket Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sea-Monkey Livestock Sento Sinfest Tooth enamel Chicken Animal shelter Pitaten Professional wrestling match types Tarantula People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Housebreaking Veganism Maison Ikkoku Monster Rancher monsters Unclean animals Chopsticks Textile manufacturing Kodocha Floppy disk Vampire The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kashrut Animal Liberation Front Equine conformation Menstrual cup The Amber Spyglass Russian space dogs Olduwan Anorexia nervosa Knife Semen Ramen Tea German Shepherd Dog Infantilism The Secret of NIMH Bipolar disorder Whaling Electrophysiology Abortion debate Sewage treatment Pit bull South Park The Death Gate Cycle Labrador Retriever Little Britain Mojave people Customs and etiquette of Japan M16 (rifle)

hamster and mouse together one thing that has bothered me for a while now is i have a hamster which murdered his friend not nice but they did come from pets at home and a mouse who's friend died around a month ago they come out and play in their own roll around balls and often smash into each other sniffing each other as they do so i feel it is a real shame they could never occupy the same cage anyone else have such odd thoughts on matters like this one it may be tempting to try and get them in the same cage they may seem lonely but considering its a mouse and a hamster i see chaos they would most likely fight i mean there have been those weird coincidences where the strangest of animals have become best friends snakes and mice cats and mice cats and deer but i just don't know if i'd take the chance you can try it just be ready to grab one if they start to fight maybe you could try getting another mouse friend for it and another hamster friend for your hamster good luck  Shaggy dog story House Mouse The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Garfield Saga (band) Internet phenomenon Pet 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ferret RuneScape quests Characters of Naruto Cat Sub-Zero Pet store The Amber Spyglass Pok__mon Live!

does my rabbit have a health problem what can i do to help today in the morning he was fine he ate his normal pellets and some cilantro and carrots the usual now his whole rear is covered with his own diarrhea and so is his face from trying to clean it i tried to clean it too but it's still there he is also thin compared to my other rabbit who is the same age as he i got her a day before i got him plus when i first got him he was extremely spazzy and hyper but now he just sits in one spot for hours my other rabbit eats the same thing and she's fine she's almost double the size of him though and is very active compared to him http i photobucket com albums q rixilol hai jpg here's a picture of him this was when he was fine though i don't have that much money at all but should i bring him to a vet thankyou all for the answers sadly this morning he died shortly after i had a few answers sob there are many reasons your rabbit's stool could have gone soft not all mean you have to rush off to a vet however diahrea or enteritis can be a very serious problem for baby bunnies and they can die from it quickly that said when people tell me that the new pet store bunny they just bought died the reason always seems to be that they are not being fed properly and or they have been taken away from their mothers before they were old enough to be weaned typically bunnies are weaned between weeks old they should not be taken away from mom before weeks is better weaning is a very stressful on their digestive systems how old are your rabbits if they are younger than months old stop giving them greens i do not give baby rabbits any greens until they are months old in order to prevent them from getting enteritis it is such a big killer of young bunnies here are some guidelines for feeding make sure your rabbit has plenty of fresh water and a small handful of hay timothy orchard oat or fetch daily keep your rabbit on a pellet based diet of quality feed no treats for now i free feed babies under months meaning they get all they can finish in a day rule of thumb on feeding pellets your rabbit should finish all its pellets before the next day if not you're feeding to much if they dive in head first into the pellets feed them more give a tablespoon or two of uncooked old fashioned oatmeal not the quick oats or instant daily this is perfectly okay to give your bunny it will help firm up its stools after four months of age slowly work the greens in but keep it down to times a week or once a day max a serving is one dark green lettuce leaf one apple slice one inch of bannana or a few cheerious but not all of these in one day here's how to clean up your bunny's messy bum clean off what you can with a dry paper towel or moist baby wipe without spreading it in other words pick it off as much as possible while it is still moist sprinkle on and rub in a good amount of corn starch find it at the grocery store rub it in to the point that is kind of balls up and the poop slides off the fur when it is combed if the poop is dried on then spritz it with a water bottle and let it remoisten before putting on the corn starch get out as much of the powder as you can with a come or a powerful hairdryer set to cool i use corn starch because it is edible and fragrance free it won't hurt or bother your rabbit if your rabbit's poo does not firm up after a few days after following these instructions or it seems listless acts out of the ordinary or you are just too worried about it then take it to see a veterinarian that specializes in rabbits immediately rabbit vets are also called exotics vets in the u s a regular vet won't know anything about rabbits at all also where i am from veterinarians often offer free office visits to first time clients  Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Dairy Tofu Japanese tea ceremony Bread Sento Poker jargon Mattress Drill bit Shaggy dog story Cat Textile manufacturing Tea Potato Pet skunk Foie gras Shotgun Kitten Brewery Bong Stomach cancer Cuisine of Denmark Dietary fiber CPU cache Beer Dog Knife Strap-on dildo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Thermal power station Menstrual cup Diarrhea Domestic goat Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hypoglycemia Rice Tattoo Floppy disk Ham Tooth Hamburger Koala Milk Feces Diseases of the honeybee Maize Casting Equine conformation Jewish cuisine Plastic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Upholstery Theory of conduct Wood Volleyball Chicken Ramen Rabbit Food Social rule Mango Oat Sin City Apple Flax Professional wrestling match types Vegetarianism Botulism Taboo food and drink Radiation therapy Livestock Childbirth Garfield Peruvian cuisine Bengali cuisine Vermicompost New York Giants Porridge Medical prescription Airsoft Cantonese cuisine M16 (rifle) Shrimp farm Dialysis Wheel of Fortune Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005

has anyone ever had a sugar glider or a flying squirrel for a pet if so what are they like i've been thinking about getting one but i've never had a pet other than dogs cats and a rabbit i have seen sugar gliders at the flea market and they are the cutest little things what do they eat what can you do with them do they play will they play with toys do they use the bathroom on shavings or will they use a small litter box sounds crazy sorry tell me about them please hey there i own a family of sugar gliders mom dad and twin boys they really are a lot of work they need alot of socialization but they aren't as easy to socialize with as cats and dogs they are timid for the most part and completely nocturnal they need to have a very balanced diet to stay healthy mine get a blend of baby food egg honey vitamins and a bunch of other things that's all blended together and frozen called bml and a serving of fruits and veggies with the occaisional treat like mealworms or yogurt drops there are quite a few diets out there but they can be expensive the vitamins are over a jar and if they aren't kept on a complete diet they can die get sick smell horrible normally gliders on a balanced diet have very little odor these guys definitely play mine get lots of toys made of fleece and a bunch of infant toys too they're very inquisitive and hyper when they're awake and absolutely love feather teasers one bad thing about that is catnip and all related herbs are lethal to them so you have to be sure to get toys that have not been treated with catnip most feather teasers and other cat toys have been treated they can't be litter trained they go to the bathroom when and where they want including on you they usually wont go where they sleep but everywhere else is fair game many gliders are bred by mill breeders prime example is the ones you see at flea markets these guys are usually not handled much causing them to be terrified of you pulled from the parents too early making illness more likely and kept in poor conditions many others have been rehomed so many times they have no trust left for humans this doesn't mean they can't make great pets and companions they'll just take x more work and patience well again they're alot of work but if you have the time effort and money to put into them they can be a very rewarding pet i have one of my babies sleeping in my bra right now he loves chin rubs and will roll over on his back to wait for one he knows i can't resist  Domestic rabbit Hamster Dog Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Ferret Garfield Kakapo RuneScape quests Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Livestock Hedgehog Food Canary Chinchilla Flea Friends Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Palindrome Nutrition Chicken Vegetarianism Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Codename: Kids Next Door Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Malaysia Milk Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City Ron and Fez Sugar Glider Yoghurt KaBlam!

how do you trim a pot bellied pigs hooves my gals are due for their first trim and i have made an appointment with our vet however i'm wondering what the usual way to have it done is there is no way that my pigs will let anyone trim on them while they are awake is it normal for a trimmer to sedate a pig before trimming i called a bunch of farriers about this but none will deal with cloven hoof animals what do other pig owners do can you train a pig to be calm when getting trimmed ok you shouldnt sedate a pig just to trim them but the way you do it is to get two or more people because you have to flip them onto their back they'll scream a lot but you have to do it so wear ear plugs if you're not used to the noise if you live anywhere near pennsylvania you could call my aunt for an appointment but if not you could call just for advice i'll leave the website  Horseshoe Domestic rabbit Taboo food and drink Guinea pig Pig Sin City Poker jargon Bookbinding Mickey Mouse Animal Farm Bacon Mad Money Betting (poker) Ferret Spirited Away Equine conformation Three Little Pigs RuneScape economy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Charles Darwin Pet skunk Kosher foods Cobra Commander The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Pottery Nu people Stud poker Ford Crown Victoria Extreme Championship Wrestling Foot-and-mouth disease Horse Invader Zim Haircut Cat Coin flipping Unclean animals Pink Floyd Gal__pagos Islands Comanche Ear Microchip implant (animal) Coprophagia Horse gait Livestock Show hunter Texas hold 'em Porky Pig Recurring South Park characters Gag (BDSM) Diving Flight controls The Legend of Zelda series enemies Ford Explorer The Inside Star Trek: The Original Series Insomnia Gramophone record Looney Tunes: Back In Action Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stairway Treehouse of Horror V Garfield Sarmatians Animals (album) Cardiac arrhythmia Warrant Officer Tex Avery Stereoscopy Stoat Some Enchanted Evening (Simpsons episode) Oldsmobile Pitaten Suplex Protective clothing Laminitis Havanese Antipsychotic Ainu people Snooker Computer animation Out-of-body experience Armoured personnel carrier Lisa the Vegetarian Howard Hughes Tiny Toon Adventures Veterans Stadium Diazepam Pig (zodiac) Animal testing Strap-on dildo Scream (film) Oakland Athletics Pet Hearing aid Earring Mooney M20 Book of Isaiah Social rule Housebreaking Mammal

who or how do i report a land owner with really bony and skinny cows like he's gotta ranch or something but his cows look sickly and they don't get fed like they said if it is a dairy cow it is likely that their looks is due to the fact they are being milked but they should not be skin and bones if they are the owner needs to supplement i would call your local humane society or animal control and have them investigate it is not worth the risk of the animals health if something is wrong  Milk Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Cattle Veganism Dairy cattle Dairy farming Bovine somatotropin Vegetarianism Factory farming Cat Vitamin D Breastfeeding Sacred cow Domestication Osteoporosis Dairy product Cattle mutilation Taboo food and drink Organic farming Guinea pig Cancer Soybean Kashrut Growth hormone treatment Domestic goat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fancy rat Mickey Mouse Infant formula Raw milk Vitamin C Butter Vegetarian nutrition Elephant Dioxin Genetically modified food Breast milk Agriculture Vitasoy Steller's Sea Cow Bone Protein Kosher foods Trans fat Gelatin Pasteurization Nutrition Food Foot-and-mouth disease Omega-3 fatty acid Shark Cheese Herpes simplex virus Brain Animal husbandry Animal Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hematophagy Tooth Dog Abstraction (computer science) Animal rights New Mexico Medical analysis of circumcision Acne Crohn's disease Pet skunk Kangaroo Raw food diet Joke Mammal Crocodilia Equine conformation Vegetarianism and religion Animal testing Inuit Ownership Tocopherol Whaling Fecal incontinence Goat Leather Ferret Swimming Soy milk Neolithic Revolution Guns, Germs, and Steel Beef Ear Neolithic Wealth Vaccine Agricultural science Cowboy History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Hunting Ralph Klein Childbirth

how do you get a bat out of your house ahh there's one in my house and its downstairs so we can't shut it into a room we have the doors in the living room kitchen and one right near the dining room open our windows have screens that won't come out my dad was chasing it with a broom stick hit it really hard twice and it wouldn't go out our door and then it just attatched itself to one of our textured walls great it's in a place where we can't get to it my dad was throwing tootsie rolls lol at it to try to get it down but it just kind of curls up more how can we get it out we also have two dogs and cats although they're shut up in rooms for the time being so we can get the bat so we can't really just wait until morning while it's sleeping and scoop it up to outside the pets need out what do i do uh bc fan idk if you have cats but they'll chase anything that moves they have rabies shots but still well funny story we tried to knock him into a box but he landed behind the piano a very old cast iron filled piano impossible to move seriously we tried to get him out but we made it worse and kept pushing him farther back and every time my dad would try to kind of pull the little guy out he would kick and was chirping we thought he was badly injured and felt absolutey horrible i mean absolutely reallllllly horrible we were gonna wait until the next morning to get him out and end his misery if he wasn't better but then this morning my dad was watching the news and he came flying in lol then he started flying around the dining room my dad opened that door and then went to open another door and when he came back the bat was gone so chances are he left i guess bats are kind of like teenagers when they're asleep they don't want to wake up for anything and ya think theyre dead punk rock girl shut up you're not making anything better by criticizing one of the best ways to do this is to use a large sheet from your bed have one person hold one end and someone else hold the other the sheet will be a barracade and then just guide him to an open door sometimes they will attach themselves to the sheet which also works to wrap them up and get them outside the other way i've done this is to take a brown paper bag and put it over the bat while it's still move the bag a little and it will usually fly into the bag close it and then just open it outside and leave it good luck  Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City EastEnders Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Poker jargon The Catcher in the Rye Columbine High School massacre Russian joke The Brady Bunch Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Reservoir Dogs Professional wrestling match types Curling Blonde on Blonde The Phantom Manor Grandview, U.S.A.

how would i be able to aquire a tiger as a pet i really want a tiger and i'm sure there is a good reason i'm not supposed to have one and i really don't plan on getting one but if i was dead serious about going out and getting a tiger what would i have to do to get one no or at least not without proper training licensing and habitat of course it also depends on where you live and what you plan to do with the animal in general though wild animal permits are far less for pets than for rescue and show like a zoo even the people who train animals for circuses and movies don't consider them a pet as no matter how tame a creature might seem to the owner they are still a wild animal as sigfried and roy learned a few years ago if you're serious about becoming involved with them however look into animal handling and wildlife rescue programs or work for your local zoo  Tiger Pet skunk Siegfried & Roy Elephant Working dog Domestic rabbit Ferret Liger Gerald Durrell Cat Domestication Lion German Shepherd Dog Panthera hybrid Wombat Circus Cheetah Tigon Extinction Issaquah, Washington Feral cat White tiger Phantom cat Steve Irwin Bat Dog Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus Giant Panda Brown Bear Dog training Dr. Seuss Auburn University Jack Hanna Exotic pet Hung Gar Lisa the Vegetarian Monster Rancher monsters American Bison Hybrid Nintendo DS San Diego Zoo Public domain Tenchi Muyo!

aggressive hamster my brother used to have a hamster when he was a kid i remember they were cudly little things and maybe in its years of life he got bit once or twice i also had one for a few months now we decided to have one as a pet for our girls years old and y o we brought it home and it is very aggressive in the first hour it has already bitten my husband twice my y o is terrified from the screaching sounds it makes i am no longer comfortable to handle it we are thinking of taking it back to exchange it for another with a much softer character i have never seen or heard a hamster do this as much as i know it needs time to get used to us after a day it shows aggressivenes it gets very nervous and stands up on its legs immediately to defend itself i don't want my daughter around it because i don't want her bit is this actually normal maybe we should go for a ferret but those are pretty expensive has anyone seen a hamster that screaches and bites this much we went last week to the pet store and they didn't have any they said during the week so we think this is a small young hamster but my husband isn't so convinced as it is not as small as a baby but not as big he thinks it has been previously handled too he already has a bad impression with it and i doubt we will take the time to train it most likely we want to go with one that is cudly for a small child we want one that will enjoy being handled it might not have been properly handled when younger and isn't used to humans where did you get the hamster there's also a possibility that it's sick so i'd keep an eye on it to make sure it's behaving normally when in the cage hamsters are more likely than other rodents to develop behavioral problems but it's strange for one to behave abnormally on the first day let alone that aggressively if you do decide to get another hamster be sure to handle it first to make sure it reacts normally and doesn't bite  Hamster Social rule Ferret The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Shaggy dog story Dog training Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind EastEnders Rabies Pet skunk Butters Stotch Kodocha Neighbours Friends Poker jargon Fancy rat Characters in the Smurfs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stuttering Dog Childbirth Guinea pig Breastfeeding The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Debugging Pitaten Hey Jude The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kim Possible Timmy Turner Humphrey Bogart Salad Fingers Floppy disk Garfield Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents The Catcher in the Rye Oasis (band) Cephalic disorder The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sin City Golden Hamster Phoebe Halliwell Joy Division (band) Cat Spidey Super Stories Empire Burlesque Haven (TNG episode) Pet Sounds Vegeta Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.

is this illegal is it illegal to adopt a baby monkey and keep it in your house also do you know any places where you can get a baby monkey it depends on where you live there's a couple of countries and states that do allow monkeys as pets and some that don't they appear so sweet and helpless and seem so much like a human infant in many ways however those sweet babies grow up into difficult adults and as a general rule adult monkeys do not make good pets their intelligence makes them special but ultimately makes them a very challenging pet taking on a pet monkey is a long term commitment and a pet monkey cannot do without your attention when life gets busy or circumstances change this is true too monkeys are expensive to house and feed and some require specialized diets that can be time consuming to prepare a significant commitment of time is needed just for routine care and cleaning up after a pet monkey but more importantly a monkey needs a large amount of social interaction and attention from the owner overall monkeys are illegal to keep as pets at some areas if you want a pet monkey you should check locally as province wide to see where they give away monkeys i wouldn't suggest getting a monkey as a pet anyway because you'll have trouble finding one for starters monkeys are also wild animals and they may seem cute and affectionate as they are babies but some monkeys grow to be aggressive because of their natural instinct don't get one please just a warning but just don't they're more difficult to take care of more than a dog  Monkey Hamster Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Ferret Fancy rat Infantilism Adoption Hypoglycemia Guinea pig Domestication Cat Sea-Monkey Abortion debate Infant Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Care Bears Divorce Neighbours Insurance Pet Housebreaking Elephant Garfield Infant baptism Zoo Dairy Kodocha Animal rights Cytomegalovirus Attachment theory Kashrut Abortion in the United States Tooth Grief Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Aladdin (1992 film) Illegal drug trade Microchip implant (animal) Socialization Second language acquisition Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cuteness Identity theft Dog agility Working dog Supergirl Expert system KaBlam!

why the horse keep standing everytimes horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down they are able to doze and enter light sleep while standing an adaptation from life as a prey animal in the wild lying down makes an animal more vulnerable to predators horses are able to sleep standing up because a stay apparatus in their legs allows them to relax their muscles and doze without collapsing unlike humans horses do not need a solid unbroken period of sleep time they obtain needed sleep by means of many short periods of rest horses may spend anywhere from four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest and from a few minutes to several hours lying down however not all this time is the horse actually asleep total sleep time in a day may range from several minutes to a couple of hours horses require approximately two and a half hours of sleep on average in a hour period most of this sleep occurs in many short intervals of about minutes each horses need to lie down occasionally and prefer soft ground for a nap horses must lie down to reach rem sleep they only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum rem sleep requirements however if a horse is never allowed to lie down after several days it will become sleep deprived and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into rem sleep while still standing this condition differs from narcolepsy though horses may also suffer from that disorder horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators a horse kept entirely alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger source wikipedia  Sleep Cat Insomnia Apollo 8 Dog Gray Wolf Rapid eye movement Polyphasic sleep Dream Sleep apnea Eye Spider Urinary incontinence Sumo Sleep disorder Lucid dreaming Horse Brown Bear Sleep paralysis Out-of-body experience Siesta Tide 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Thermoregulation Epilepsy Capercaillie Drowning Time Diazepam Involuntary commitment The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amazing Race STS-62 First aid Bipolar disorder Hypoglycemia Daylight saving time Ionizing radiation Fast bowling Caffeine Gamma ray burst Gypsy moth Electroencephalography Weight training Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Traumatic brain injury Battles of Lexington and Concord Muscle Fox hunting Leatherback Sea Turtle Bodybuilding Iditarod Albinism Childbirth Evidence of evolution Tyrannosaurus rex Hypnagogia Human height Bottlenose Dolphin Radiation poisoning Elephant Human adaptation to space Shark Mountain Gorilla Pikmin Orgasm Child sexuality Whale Sleeping sickness Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Electroconvulsive therapy Speed of light Shaggy dog story Tsetse fly Technetium Hipparchus (astronomer) Guinea pig Nile crocodile Minor Harry Potter Beasts Duchenne muscular dystrophy Animal communication Myocardial infarction Dairy Day Euthanasia Hypnosis Koala Clinical depression Decompression sickness Human Horse gait Domestication Dieting

how do you train a rabbit to use its litter box i gonna get a rabbit and some toys for it i want to learn to how to train it to go to the bathroom in its litter box rabbits are extremely neat animals and thus will normally use one certain area of the cage as their toilet once you have identified that area usually a corner place the litter box you plan to use in that spot i find that corner litter boxes work best as compared to square litter pans if your rabbit chews or pulls on the litter box use wire to attatch it firmly from the back of the cage to the wire around it usually the bunny will begin going in the litter box automatically but sometimes they need a little hint what you can do for that is use a litter scoop to place your rabbits waste into the litter box they'll recognize their own scent and will go in the litter box as far as litter goes i find that yesterdays news cat litter works best it's made of recycled newspaper compressed into pellets so its safe for the bunny and its a lot cheaper than litter made especially for bunnies the lb bags you can find at pick n' save are a lot cheaper than you'll find at a pet store too  Domestic rabbit Hamster Fancy rat Dog Ferret Cat litter Pet skunk Trapping Cat Chinchilla Bugs Bunny European Rabbit Magic (illusion) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography The Inside Fox hunting Mel Blanc Dog training Professional wrestling match types Dustbin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Gaia Online Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Animal communication Hydrogen economy Tick Modern animation of the United States Kevin and Kell Waste management KaBlam!

how can i tell if my bunny likes me do they make a noise or wut he likes you if he comes up to you while you're just sitting or laying on the floor doing your own thing don't reach for him or try to pick him up and he'll be more comfortable and will probably start hopping all over you and may nudge you with his nose if he likes to be petted he may make a soft purring sound with his teeth when you pet him and that means he's really happy not all of them do this though if he grunts or growls he's telling you he doesn't like something if he scratches or even bites when you try to pick him up or reach into the cage it doesn't really mean he doesn't like you it has more to do with a fear of being picked up or not wanting his cage invaded the link below is a neat site that tells all about bunny language and what it means when bunnies do certain things  Cat Guinea pig Dog training Salad Fingers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Hamster RuneScape quests Kender Domestic rabbit Milton H.

human stuff used on horses what are some really good human stuff that u can use on horses for example you can use sun screen on your horses nose in hot weather so it dont burn you could probably use human brushes and shampoo on them hair accessories can be used on horses hair mild toothpaste could also be used so long as its a child's brand that is specially formulated to be ok to ingest i guess that you could use bug spray on your horse so long as there were no open sores on the horse  Toothpaste Shampoo Hair Hair coloring Dandruff Clothing Tooth enamel Comanche Mouth ulcer Pepper spray Riot control Show hunter Smoke-screen Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sento Fire Common cold Psoriasis Hay fever Chagas disease Glossitis What's My Line?

is having rabbits much more difficult than does anyone have i have one rabbit simon and he is really not hard to take care of because i have the time for him does anyone think it would be alot more difficult to get another or not really i would most likely get a female and have them both neutered lol no baby bunnies for them good for you for having them both fixed it does double the work and you need to spend the same amount of time with one as you do with the other so if you have the extra time for cage cleaning and bonding with two then go for it but don't expect two to keep each other company so you can go off and do other things because they still need to spend their time with you have fun with your bunnies  Domestic rabbit Bugs Bunny Guinea pig Who Framed Roger Rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Social rule The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Poker jargon RuneScape economy The Cure Easter Bunny Tiny Toon Adventures Brandy and Mr. Whiskers Bond Rabbit The Sims Hyperinflation Babs and Buster Bunny Care Bears Pure Pwnage Feral cat Strap-on dildo Chuck Jones Beatrix Potter Ty Cobb Rabbit Fire The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll European Rabbit Hazing Anya Jenkins Debugging Pulp Fiction The Damned Wile E.

cats or dogs which do you like better cats or dogs i like dogs better some would argue that dogs make better pets but i have a few defenses for cats for one you will never have to worry about cats smelling foul they clean themselves constantly and thus emanate no odor no matter how many times you wash dogs they will inevitably end up smelling within hours for another dogs are much more high maitenance bigger dogs require food around the clocks while smaller dogs will bark until your ears bleed cats though they will beg for your love require food water and a litterbox nothing more they make toys out of anything and cats beg for love only to be accepted by the master those who say cats only want to be loved and will not love back are sadly corrupt the purr of a cat means it is contented that you have made it happy when you make it happy it knows that you care for it this leads to sleeping on the edge of your bed at night a generally happy disposition and a greeting at the front door when you come home from work sleeping on the bed means the cat will protect you from any creepy crawlies and that it trusts you enough to sleep near you a door greeting means that it has been lonely and missed you for it loves you but all in all both cats and dogs have their ups and downs they are both wonderful creatures and fill this world with enough love to get us through the day  Cat Shaggy dog story Dog Sin City Hamster Care Bears RuneScape quests Ferret Guinea pig The Fairly OddParents One Piece minor characters Garfield Domestic rabbit Catscratch Animal communication Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Felis sapiens Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dean Koontz Toilet humour Keeshond Ren and Stimpy The Amber Spyglass The Time Machine Housebreaking Skunk The Family from One End Street Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Doraemon Miss Saigon USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Invader Zim Dog training Pet skunk Taikyoku shogi Gray Wolf Characters of Naruto Futurama (TV series - season 5) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart The Death Gate Cycle The Star Wars Holiday Special The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Salad Fingers Brian Griffin Golden Retriever Kodocha Manos: The Hands of Fate The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Rent (musical) Upholstery Morphology (linguistics) The Jazz Singer W.I.T.C.H.

how do i care for a bunny i live in new your and i am thinking a getting a bunny but really don't know what they eat what kinda cage i need i am thinking of getting a mini lop or an angora bunny but i don't know anything about them please tell me a list of what they need of a good cage i'm thinking of getting it by a breeder but i don't know any please tell me some o angoras take a lot of work they have a lot of fur that needs to be brushed everyday to prevent tangles they also get a lot bigger therefore needing a bigger cage mini lops are cute and make great pets also if you are not set on one of those two the mini rex and netherland drawf are great pets the mini rex has fur like velvet and the netherland drawf is one of the smallest rabbits they weigh around pounds where you live plays a big role in which kind you should get if you live in an apartment i would go with a mini or drawf rabbit if you live in an apartment you would need a cage if you have a yard you could buy or build a hutch if you have a yard then you could get a bigger rabbit make sure to feed your rabbit a steady pellet diet but you also need to feed it vegetables to keep it healthy some rabbits like the salt blocks that you can get at a pet store my suggestion on where to get the rabbit is from an ad in either a vet's office pet store or in the paper breeders often charge a lot for their rabbits and they are often show material i am guessing you just want a pet pet shops are good too as long as they are clean ask a lot of questions to be sure that they are knowledgeable of their animals as for a cage you can either get a cage or a hutch if you get a cage you need to clean out the litter pan everyday and the cage about twice a week if you get a hutch it doesn't need much cleaning only once or twice a month a good cage has lots of room for your rabbit to move around you can put toys in it such as bells balls and toliet paper tubes put a corner litter pan in the cage and fill it with aspen shavings the rabbit will litter train itself rabbits are really smart animals and you can train them and teach them to walk on a rabbit halter i would definately recommend getting one i have four and love them to death if you need anymore help just email me i love to teach people about rabbits  Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Rabbit Dog European Rabbit Cat Garfield Chinchilla Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Friends Keeshond Trapping Livestock Blood on the Tracks Labrador Retriever Shotgun Upholstery People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Kodocha Textile manufacturing SpongeBob SquarePants Havanese RuneScape quests Domestic goat Dog training Maine Coon Dobermann Tyrannosaurus rex Canary Bugs Bunny Plastic Humphrey Bogart Ai Yori Aoshi Internet phenomenon Sluggy Freelance Professional wrestling match types Japanese tea ceremony Tiny Toon Adventures Pekingese One Piece minor characters Wal-Mart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toy Story 2 Tooth MapleStory Clothing Happy Tree Friends Password Social rule Docking Weight training Poodle Cro EastEnders Little Britain Babe Ruth Chicken Pet Care Bears House Mouse Sesame Street Who Framed Roger Rabbit Veganism Theory of conduct Chihuahua (dog) Hunting Tiger Monkey Wheel of Fortune Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Inside John Cage Mealy Parrot House Mel Blanc Pet store Animal rights Textile manufacturing terminology Mid-levels Russian joke The Velvet Underground Brandy and Mr. Whiskers Meat Loaf Equine conformation Discus (fish)

gerbil help my dad wants me to wait till school starts to get a gerbil but i want one today ive been doing extra chores and im gonna buy it with my own money my dads at work so how can i convince my mom to take me i have been waiting and a half years for this i have gerbils maybe you should tell your parents some facts like thisinteresting facts about gerbils origins the common pet gerbil originated in mongolia they became so numerous there that the mongolian people could no longer sleep at night because the gerbils were constantly running on their squeaky little exercise wheels taking heed of p t barnum's advice the mongolians shipped all of the gerbils to the united states where gullible consumers bought them as pets mongolia is now one of the richest and quietest countries in the world gnawing like all rodents a gerbil's front teeth are constantly growing so it must chew on things to keep them filed down to sharp points they can chew through metal with ease sort of like if you or i were to chew on a steel girder in fact the word rodent is latin for ouch that must really hurt ecological impact gerbils originally lived in the desert and can cause great harm if released in warm climates california and new mexico have laws against importing gerbils despite these laws some gerbils have escaped into the wild where they have bred like rabbits in the southwestern united states it is now very common to see roving packs of feral gerbils taking down full grown cattle suitable cages since gerbils are so good at chewing care must be taken in selecting an appropriate cage so that your pets will not be able to escape wood and plastic cages will not last very long the best type of cage is a glass aquarium with a tightfitting lid many first time gerbil owners forget to drain the water out of the aquarium and soon discover that gerbils being desert animals are not very good swimmers luckily gerbils are very inexpensive to replace bedding material many pet stores sell cedar and pine shavings for small animal bedding while these may be sufficient for a mere hamster or guinea pig gerbils prefer shredded dollar bills this bedding should be changed daily nesting material gerbils build nests to provide shelter and to keep warm while sleeping many people give their gerbils bits of burlap or cotton fabric which are quickly shredded into a warm fluffy nest however researchers have found that gerbils prefer angora sweaters and silk dresses for nesting material feeding habits pet gerbils are usually fed a mixture of seeds grains and rabbit pellets in the wild however gerbils prefer steak caviar lobster thermidor and p t de foie gras gout is very common among wild gerbils communication gerbils rarely squeak usually you can only hear them if they are fighting or frightened scientists have discovered that gerbils actually communicate quite frequently but since it is ultrasonic we cannot hear it using sophisticated recording instruments these scientists have been able to slow these sounds so that they fall within the normal range of human hearing they have reported that gerbils spend most of their time saying turn me on dead man and i buried paul recreational facilities many gerbil owners provide their pets with playwheels and mistakenly believe that they have satisfied their gerbils' exercise needs nothing could be further from the truth an adult gerbil requires a bare minimum of a treadmill stair climber exercise bike and free weights an occasional round of golf is also quite beneficial  Cat Chinchilla Textile manufacturing Dog Mattress Foie gras Livestock Plastic Meriones unguiculatus Ferret Recurring South Park characters Tooth Falconry Animal communication House Mouse Milk Pet skunk Futurama (TV series - season 5) Gramophone record Energy development Illegal drug trade Terminal ballistics Capercaillie Welding Drill bit Seabird Japanese tea ceremony Chicken Shaggy dog story Horse Tyrannosaurus rex Domestication Mouse (computing) Gray Wolf Dog training Taboo food and drink Rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) STS-62 Gerbil Agriculture Poker jargon Organic farming Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Professional wrestling match types Strap-on dildo Internal ballistics Rodent The Amber Spyglass Calvin and Hobbes Introduced species Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Breastfeeding European Rabbit Kim Possible Jute Fish farming Vermicompost Kangaroo Fishing Alcoholic beverage Explosive material Bulk vending Kosher foods Money Biodiversity Mojave people Infantilism Undergarment Coffee RuneScape quests Conker's Bad Fur Day Olduwan Shrimp farm Thermoregulation Capitalism Tarantula Tobacco Autonomous building Bird Sento Casting Tooth enamel Stock car (rail) Brown Rat Goldfish Nuclear reactor E85 Trapping

i need support advice please well while driving by i saw a near by vet clinic is looking for volunteers to work there i have horrible people skills but i really want to do this just nervous because i've never done anything outside a school related activity i'm so meh say i have a sheltered life so my questions are should i call them or just walk in and ask about volunteering what do i say exactly is this a good idea what do you think will be expected of me do i ask about it today or is there like a special day that's better for asking about this stuff like it's better to do it on weekends i know that just sounded silly but i want to know it is a great idea i would say definitely go for it i had horrible people skills as a teenager myself but what helped me was being put in situations where i had to deal with people such as working and volunteering during the week is probably better to ask about being a volunteer since there are probably more people there that can answer your questions and let you know what exactly you will be doing what i would do is call first and ask them and if they do have a need for volunteers ask them when a good time would be to stop in most organizations i have found are very grateful to have volunteers and are very flexible in regards to things like scheduling how many hours you want and if you need a day off here and there even though you are only it is most likely something that will look good toward your future whether or not you choose to pursue the veterinary field it looks good to put volunteer work on a college application a resume etc job duties could include anything maybe they need someone to take the dogs who are boarding there outside to use the bathroom it could be office duties like stuffing envelopes and such it could possibly be cleaning up these are questions i would ask the clinic  Pet skunk George W.

how come there are so many people in this q a that can not take constructive critism when some one asks a controversial question then attacks an answers credibility or doesnt like a answer he gets why do they become so offended they delete or block someone people of the world dont ask if you dont want to hear it get some cahonies sheeh you jnow yhis is directed at heart of glass but open for disscusion from anyone sunshine i said constructive not rude critism and i was answering a very controversial question to being with i was not rude in the begining i only became more mater of fact in my additions because he was attacking me in the additional info but if you read most of the answers in this one are people out there trying to stop the dog meat and fur trade and puppy mills i am not alone in this view though he didnt like it i dont mind being told if i am rude what i dont like is that i am reported for abuse when there wasnt any to being with also if you look to my profile you can see that half the questions i answer become best answer i dont vote for myself and i dont beg people to vote for me if you see the ones i dont win on its becauce i am telling them they are wrong and they dont like it i can take people who dont like me though this is my first abuse report in a thousand questions and wow i am not taking that well some people are used to answerers who suck up to them for points and when they hear the truth once in a while they can't believe that someone dares to be that brutal and honest i for one believe in constructive criticism but it is a sad fact that it takes some intelligence to be able to recognise it for what is is and it takes more intelligence to be able to do something with it instead of getting all indignant i do not support criticism and sarcasm in cases where people need some serious advice or answers but there is a thin line between constructive and destructive criticism and it takes a little insight to see it and it is even worse to go blocking people for no reason i wish there was a way to get rid of that i often catch myself thinking 'now you are on dangerous ground rather go to a different question' when i have some constructive criticism or an honest answer for someone you are absolutely right some people can't take it then maybe they should add the words sensitive to criticism only liars and kissers please with their questions  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Plame affair Discordianism Philosophical skepticism Downing Street memo Avenue Q Sydney Riot of 1879 Cult Ethics John R.

advice on giving up my pet when i transfer to dream college pet owners only please ok so i've got a pet rabbit and a decision on whether or not to attend this college that sounds like one of the best opportunities i could possibly hope for unfortuantely this college will not house pets and i doubt i would be able to get an apartment with all the biting she does and work i would have to do to pay for it no time to play with her this includes schoolwork too i have a deep love for my rabbit and i take care of her to the very best of my abilities i feel like if i give her up for adoption just so i could selfishly fulfill my dreams it would be like trading my soul to the devil basically lol it's just an incredibly tough decision nobody in my family is capable of taking care of her in the way i think she deserves i think if i were gone for a few weeks they would make a rabbit stew out of her i have also tried thinking of any friends who might house her while i m away none will and mostly never will i'm in a twist really i ask for help from caring pet owners smiles grimly honey i feel you i'm just beginning my second year at college and own three pets a ball python a bearded dragon and a corn snake i'm about to give up at least one of them due to the lack of time i'll have come fall i still live at home because i've been saving up to study abroad in a year or two i've been taking arabic classes and really enjoy it they have a great program in egypt that would have me living there for six months my problem in egypt they only have pet cats and occasionally dogs there are no pet shops no vets for pet reptiles nobody sells mice and they sure as hell won't allow my babies in any dorm or apartment my egyptian friends couldn't even fathom the idea of having a pet snake my family sure as hell won't care for them in my absence nor will any relatives or friends so do i give up the dream or my babies i'm looking into candidates for new homes for the beardie and corn snake right now planning to keep one of the two the python stays hands down it's possible people are gonna bitch you in their answers saying how dumb you were for buying an animal when you knew all along you'd be heading off to college someday don't listen to them you didn't forsee this particular turn of events this isn't what you wanted feel free to email me if you need to talk or want to continue this further i haven't had a chance to confide in someone who actually understands everyone i talk to just rolls their eyes and go it's not like you're giving up your dog or something it's just a snake who the hell wouldn't go to egypt just because they have a pet snake get rid of him this is the chance of a lifetime just remember my six months in egypt is six months six months is not a lifetime four yrs of college that's not a lifetime they could both be extraordinary opportunities to a whole new life but it'll be a life without our pets with us i still haven't decided  Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Dog Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Theory of conduct Pet skunk Cat Humphrey Bogart Pet Characters of Naruto College Roomies from Hell!!!

how can i get my horse to go everytime i try to go for a ride outside of the barn or the roundpen with my horse he always refuses to go he will go but i have to kick very hard or whip him and i really hate resulting to this and i have tried just taking him up the driveway and then comng back or waiting for him to calm down maybe or think about what i am asking but the most he will ever walk forward though leaving is or steps and i try to stay positive but i can't seem to think of anything i can do whenever he stops he tries to eat and alls he ever does is eat and so i think that is why he doesn't want to go but i can't think of anything to do please help i had a mare that would refuse to move on occasion you'll want to check your horses legs back and hooves for any type of injuries swelling or strains also check your saddle blanket and cinch for any rough areas or pieces of burs make sure your saddle fits your horse well it shouldn't pinch him or rub him in any place look for any worn patches of hair on your horse that's a sure sign you need a new saddle if you have been riding a lot horses will get sore after a work out like we do if this is the case you'll want to scale back on the hour trail rides and let him have some simple riderless unstructured time in the corral a little rest and a gentle ease into his workout will freshen him up also consider he may be hungry no it's not good to eat and run but if a stabled horse has had his breakfast at am and you are ready for a ride at pm he's missed his lunch schedule at least or feedings a day for a stabled horse if you find that he is fine there is a little trick that does not involve corporal punishment every time your horse refuses to budge turn him around and gently back him up about or paces praise him turn him around and proceed if he refuses to go forward again turn him around very gently and slowly back him up or paces praise him again do not punish him through your reins or legs you'll want to keep your horse sensitive to your cues repeat these steps until your horse happily walks forward  Horse Equine conformation Horse gait Horse tack Seabiscuit Comanche Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Dressage Weight training Dog training Swingout The Amazing Race Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bicycle The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Milton H.

cats and pregnancy i am wondering if pregnant cats get morning sickness or experience similar symptoms to humans my cat is about months old and last night we saw my friends and neighbours cat trying to mate with her we want to get her desexed but i am scared she may already be pregnant will the vet check to make sure she isnt pregnant before removing her uterus i know its a lot of questions hehe thanks for your help you can still get your cat spayed it will abort any kittens she may be pregnant with though you won't be able to tell if she's pregnant unless your vet checks her out for weeks if you take the cat in now the vet will spay her anyway whether or not she's pregnant because the pregnancy is so early and at this point it poses no risk to her health a month old cat is pretty young to be having kittens if you don't decide to spay her now and wait to see if she's pregnant and she is make sure you keep a very close eye on her throughout her pregnancy and especially during labor after she has the kittens and she's properly healed make sure to get her spayed asap or keep her indoors away from males it's still wise to get her spayed even if she is an indoor cat as this will reduce her risk of some cancers good luck  Cat Pregnancy Abortion Guinea pig Ferret Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Dog Socialization Kitten Obstetrics Feral cat Abortion debate Tobacco smoking Premature birth Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Tocopherol Prostate cancer Sterilization (surgical procedure) EastEnders Endometriosis Manx (cat) Oral contraceptive Folic acid Toxoplasmosis Spina bifida Prenatal diagnosis Diabetes mellitus Condom Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Endometrial cancer Haloperidol Cats (musical) Coeliac disease Partial-birth abortion Friends Cervical cancer Ectopic pregnancy Sharon Tate Morning sickness Castration Prolactinoma Breastfeeding Sexual intercourse Vitamin C Lion Coffee Turner syndrome Cancer Tooth enamel Infertility Cytomegalovirus Kangaroo Abortion in the United States Fertility awareness Housebreaking Cephalic disorder Pregnancy test The Joker's Wild Stomach cancer Diethylstilbestrol Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medicine Breech birth Gonorrhoea Herpes simplex virus Sex education Schapelle Corby Marilyn Monroe Chemical abortion Ionizing radiation Phoebe Buffay's songs Estrus cycle Elephant Feminists for Life Vampire Twin Isotretinoin Colorectal cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Big Brother UK series 5 Hypertension Garfield Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Delta Goodrem Intact dilation and extraction Maprotiline Malaria Doxepin Roe v.

how long do hamsters normally live you can usually expect a syrian hamster to live years i have known hamsters to live as long as years but this is highly unusual since hamsters do not have long life spans it's a very good idea to buy from a breeder so you know the age of the animal and can guarantee it's young when you buy from a pet store you have no way of being sure of the age of the animal large scale breeding facilities will often send retired breeders to pet stores so you might be buying an older animal  Hamster Pet store Golden Hamster Domestic rabbit Mouse-like hamster Pet Puppy mill Monster Rancher monsters Pet skunk Animal husbandry Koi Discus (fish) Life expectancy Guinea pig Dobermann Rabbit Budgerigar Animal testing Hoarding Show cat The Hampster Dance European Rabbit Ferret Animal Liberation Front German Shepherd Dog Cat Hello Kitty Monster Rancher Dachshund Docking Canary Dog breeding Internet phenomenon Dog Alaskan husky Estrus cycle Selective breeding Life insurance Irish Wolfhound Mixed-breed dog Nuclear power Fast breeder Breed registry Puma Domestication House Mouse Rat The Origin of Species Chihuahua (dog) Chocobo Pok__mon (video games) Animal communication Tarantula Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Ecology The Young Ones (TV series) Hamtaro Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Border Terrier Breeders' Cup Labrador Retriever English Springer Spaniel Dog breed Nuclear reactor Taboo food and drink Obedience training Plant breeders' rights Zoo Mountain Gorilla Alternative fuel Hybrid Monogamy Havanese Domestication of the horse Future energy development Cheetah Greyhound Animal euthanasia Serval Agriculture Balinese (cat) Animal Crossing Keeshond Poodle German Shorthaired Pointer Clydesdale (breed) Golden Retriever Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Jack Russell Terrier Annuity Fur farming Wealth Cattle Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus Ageing Neopets Computer Commodore International

what kind of chemcial can i spray around chickens ducks rabbitts that won't hurt them for flies we are having a big problem with flies around all our outdoor animals which are ducks chickens rabbits i have used lime in a chicken coop to help with flies but the best control i have found for my chicken coop is actually a trap rescue disposable fly trap it cost at walmart the only issue i have had with it is that it works so well that after about a week the smell of dead flies in it gets unbearable and i have to replace it of course the more flies get in it and cause it to stink the better it seems to work it definitely catches and kills the flies and it's very easy to use i have been more pleased with it than with any spray or other treatment i have used  Trapping Chicken West Nile virus Domestic rabbit H5N1 AFI 100 Years series Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Diseases of the honeybee Who Framed Roger Rabbit Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Cube (film) DDT Egg (food) Fancy rat Prisoner's dilemma Metal Gear (video game) Barbecue Common cold Joke Unreal People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Monty Python's Flying Circus Tyrannosaurus rex Chicken Run Halitosis Tiny Toon Adventures Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Organic farming Cat Space Shuttle program RuneScape quests Quake III Arena Sin City Vermicompost The Legend of Zelda series enemies Guinea pig Megas XLR Wal-Mart Spidey Super Stories Agricultural wastewater treatment Skunk National Kidney Foundation Singapore Timon and Pumbaa Piccolo Junior Saga Livestock Ben Johnson (athlete) Aladdin (1992 film) Cooperative Bugs Bunny Duck!

what game can me and my rabbit play find the food game hide some of your rabbits favorite treats about your person let the bunny have some idea that there is food to be had and let bunny find it this can be a good way to build trust between you and your rabbit and is a great way to start with timid or handling shy rabbits obstacle jump game make up some rabbit sized obstacles and use the rabbits favorite treat to lure it over jumps through tunnels and around objects hide and seek this old children's game can be easily tailored to playing with rabbits but will require you to get down to their level once on the floor hide behind something whether it be a couch or a bed or chair peek out a little and let your bunny see you doing it then hide again chances are that the bunny will hop over to investigate what strange thing you are doing you can run away or jump out a little at the bunny not in a loud threatening screaming fashion more like a playful hop depending on what the bunny does it might be your turn to run away and hide again or maybe you can seek your bunny teaching tricks though this isn't technically a game you can spend some time teaching your rabbit tricks most rabbits learn to recognize their name and to come to it if they associate it with positive things you can also try teaching your rabbit to beg by holding the food above its head and making it stand for it variations such as getting the rabbit to spin to get the food are also possible  Domestic rabbit Rabbit Skateboarding trick Guinea pig Dog agility Volleyball Hun-Apu Professional wrestling aerial techniques Parkour The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Taikyoku shogi Tiny Toon Adventures Parachuting The Legend of Zelda series enemies Super Mario 64 European Rabbit Falconry Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban BMX Super Metroid Swingout Mario Professor Milton H.

adoption of a puppy well i am getting a dog or puppy depending on what's available when i get one and i was taking a bike ride today and my neighbor has week old puppies that he's fostering until they're weeks old for out local shelter why is it that they have to be weeks before adoptable and also what are some things i can expect from a puppy i know most i was just seeing if theres anything i don't thanks in advance weeks is usually the minimum age that a young pup should be able to be taken away from mum in cases where pups are abandoned and for some reason may not have mum i am pretty sure that not allowing them to go to homes before weeks allows for them to have their first shots worming etc puppies are more work initially as they have a habit of getting into everything and chewing anything they can find puppies dont come trained so you have to teach everything from scratch which can sometimes be better as you know exactly how the dog has been trained techniques hand signals commands etc adults often come already trained in basic commands posibly already house trained both are equally in need of homes hope all goes well with your adoption  Dog training Dog Housebreaking Socialization 101 Dalmatians: The Series Beethoven (film) Golden Retriever Obedience training Hamster James Bulger Puppy mill Docking Dog agility Vehicular cycling Modem Skinny Puppy Fair use Education in the People's Republic of China The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Majin Buu Saga Chinese martial arts Guinea pig About a Boy Labrador Retriever Social rule Social work Pet skunk Alexander Technique Mixed-breed dog Nintendogs Crate training Gun dog American Eskimo Dog Graduate school Sick Puppy Livestock Ron and Fez Animal shelter Juris Doctor Education in Japan Coyote Infantilism Bike lane debate Guide dog Trigonometric function Blackjack Football (soccer) Fancy rat Korea Jindo Dog Heartworm Martial art Double Dragon Animal Farm EastEnders Bill Clinton Jennifer Lopez Scooby-Doo Professor American Pit Bull Terrier Theory of conduct Prisoner (TV series) Younger versions of cartoon characters Gray Wolf Pete the Pup Human animal roleplay (BDSM) 2005 Iditarod Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Laserdisc Maison Ikkoku Gerald Durrell Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Our Gang Taikyoku shogi Compact audio cassette Ranma __ characters Adoption Marilyn Monroe Structure of the British Army Contract Animal testing The Fairly OddParents Pet store Contract bridge Paranoia Agent Domestic rabbit Altruism Garfield Boy Scouts of America Education in Germany Stolen Generation Hip dysplasia Eddie Guerrero Special Air Service Recruit training Milton H.

which is more affectionate towards humans rats or ferrets or budgies i had a rat and i really liked him but he died years ago at age i am going to get another animal and dont know which one to pick since you asked which is more affectionate i'd say either budgies or rats ferrets are adorable and soft but it's not like they'll nuzzle up to you as they're more independent rats are little attention seekers and love to be pet budgies can be too ferrets require a fair amount of maintenance and the vet bills can run high they're cute to watch at play though bouncing around rats have the shortest lifespan and that can be hard for some but you have experience with rats budgies maybe it's me but birds are just very messy and it takes some effort to clean up after them but they usually have a nice temperament when raised from a young age if you're asking my advice i'd say rat since you know and like them  Ferret Fancy rat Rat Guinea pig Hamster Dog Pet Kakapo Rabies Brown Rat Exotic pet Budgerigar Kim Possible RuneScape quests Cat Sin City Holocene extinction event Nutrition Expert system Microchip implant (animal) The Secret of NIMH Azumanga Daioh Aspartame Sleep Cockatiel Domestic rabbit Rabbit Budgie (band) Life extension Veterinarian Ron Weasley House Mouse Garfield Gerald Durrell Hedgehog Violin Piano Lady and the Tramp Bish__jo game Sarah, Duchess of York Animal cognition Tom Goes to the Mayor Island restoration Ai Yori Aoshi Extreme Programming Animal testing Introduced species Chicken Domestication Kevin and Kell Housebreaking Aladdin (1992 film) Mina Mongoose Senescence Eye Kangaroo Rat Park Behaviorism The Drifters Vitamin C Fruits Basket Hearing impairment Golf Calorie restriction Flea Whaling Tooth enamel Pet Sounds Tooth Rat (zodiac) Feral cat Siouxsie Sioux Taboo food and drink Avenue Q H5N1 Chinchilla Dairy Mustelidae Creatures in Bionicle Degu Kitten Life expectancy German Shepherd Dog Human Bill Peet Garfield (film) Brian Close Strap-on dildo Kylie Minogue Batsman Sant Thakar Singh Anime Meaning of life Theory of conduct Falconry Mattress What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

how good of a pet is a ferrett are farretts are good pets for teenagers yrs are they friendly loyal fun and playful how long do they live for ferrets are very good pets i have two of them two girls that i rescued from a local shelter they are clean and quiet animals nap a lot but always willing to wake up and play depending on the ferret you have you might end up with a cuddly ferret they are highly inquisitive and friendly creatures and very very very entertaining i wish i had enough room to describe some of their antics ferrets live about seven to nine years as far as them being good pets for teenagers i would say that it depends more on your teenager are they responsible because ferret cages require daily cleaning and the ferrets themselves need daily ferret fun time out of the cage and time to bond with their owners as well ferrets should also be bathed no more than every other week to help keep that musky scent less noticeable they are definately better for teenagers then they are young children because ferrets will inevitably play bite especially your feet if they are in socks ferrets also work well together in pairs as they keep each other entertained and company while you are away plus it's really funny to watch two ferrets wrestle and hop after each other good luck keep shiny objects and crinkly papers out of their reach or they will develop a cache of hidden objects under your beds  Ferret Pet skunk Fancy rat Hamster Cat Domestic rabbit Dog Pet Have I Got News For You Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hunting Garfield Rabies Rabbit Ren and Stimpy Spidey Super Stories Microchip implant (animal) Static Shock Professional wrestling match types Sumo Hedgehog Full House Chinchilla Emergency preparedness Social rule SpongeBob SquarePants Housebreaking Professional wrestling slang Animal communication Dragon Booster Working dog Saki Ai Yori Aoshi Fast bowling RuneScape quests Mickie James The Fairly OddParents Skunk Adam West Rabbits in Australia Pinky and the Brain FoxTrot Bat Boy Dilbert Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Salad Fingers Customs and etiquette of Japan American Black Bear Hip hop rivalries Monkey Kodocha Golden Retriever Obedience training Stuffed animal Gaia Online Kim Possible Hermione Granger One Piece minor characters Rais massacre GoldenEye 007 Calvin and Hobbes John Cage Milton H.

hamster meets dog we inherited a hamster last night my dog was immediately obsessed with it and while i was in the shower the dog knocked the hamster and cage off of a dresser when i got there the dog was laying on my roommate's bed and the hamster was next to her soaking wet eyes closed and not moving we noticed that it's poor little heart was still beating and it was breathing it started moving around in the next minutes or so and now a couple hours later it seems to be okay my question is do you think the dog swallowed and then spit up the hamster or the hamster was licked neurotically there was no sign of trauma other than unconsciousness and being very wet needless to say the hamster is now in a room with a dog gate the dog is a shepherd who indeed has high prey drive however at her rescue home she was known to lick baby kittens while supervised maybe the dog thought the hamster was dirty and decided to give it a bath  Cat The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Sin City Hyperthermia Dog Milton H.

animal lovers please click here hi i only got one anwser te last time i asked this i was thinking about getting a skinny pig but i want to know how much it would all cost for the skinny pig bedding food cage etc it would be so nice if you helped me thanks a decent cage will cost at least i would say for it to have enough room to move around then there's the accesories like a water bottle food dish food dollars bedding for a large pack they'll also need a nice cozy igloo or something to cozy up in since they're bald and need to use more energy to keep warm as far as the cost of a skinny pig i'm not too sure they don't ever really sell them around here surprising since the guy that started the mutation for them was from here in rochester ny but the few i have seen were around it might be cheaper if you have more of them in your area i also know they usually go through food and water faster than a regular guinea pig since they use a little more energy to maintain body temp and that some because of the mutation that causes the baldness being produced initially from being inbred have lower immune system and are prone to respiratory infections but alot of people have been working to breed healthier pigs  Hamster Obesity Fancy rat Chinchilla Dog Cat Vitamin C Nutrition Taboo food and drink Domestication Fugu Chicken Brewery Livestock Fish farming Equine conformation Baldness Milk Animal testing Extinction Factory farming Thermoregulation Kitchen Ecology Common cold House Mouse Gray Wolf Warm-blooded The Apprentice 2 Energy H5N1 Ramen Solar power Veganism Breastfeeding Energy development Care Bears Influenza Dairy Hydrogen economy Pig (zodiac) Hiking Autonomous building Anorexia nervosa Future energy development Iron Island Fox Semen Sewage treatment Cancer Apple Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rat Bon Jovi Pneumonia AIDS Bovine spongiform encephalopathy DDT Little Britain Pork Piccolo Junior Saga Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Spider Peruvian cuisine Malaria Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lisa the Vegetarian Tsunami Cheetah Vermicompost Tea Galactic Civilizations Agriculture in Australia Nuclear power Hybrid vehicle Tsetse fly Mattress Sugar Antigenic shift Swimming International response to Hurricane Katrina Team Fortress Classic Pebble bed reactor Domesticated turkey Insulin Labrador Retriever Industrial engineering Foodborne illness Shaggy dog story Discus (fish) Blood Chlorophyta Tooth enamel Cystic fibrosis Poliomyelitis Dobermann

question on duckling food i'm getting a week old duckling in a few days and i went to a feed store and asked for a non medicated starter food i bought what they gave me first of all it isn't mashed or crumbled its pellets and on the tag it says layer pellets is a complete food for commercial egg production it is not necessary to feed scratch grain if i crumble it up and make it small enough is it okay for my duckling to eat oh and it has protein and i'm pretty sure ducklings need about but i heard i can also feed them little chopped hard boiled eggs which are full of protein would that be okay this food should be suitable for a duckling although i would have preferred a game bird food i doubt you will need to crush the pellets unless they are of unusual size  Tofu Chicken Vegetarianism Maize Hamster Chili con carne Cheese Milk Duck Rice Peanut Fancy rat Jewish cuisine Shotgun Bread Brewing Hamburger Egg (food) Cuisine of the Philippines Food preservation Japanese cuisine Mallard Soybean Soy milk Bengali cuisine Moonshine American lobster Capercaillie Healthy eating Ice cream Flour Insulin Cocaine Kosher foods Cuisine of Denmark Veganism Honeybee Potato Ant The Ugly Duckling Dieting Factory farming Homebrewing Fasting Diseases of the honeybee Sea-Monkey Spider Dairy Roman eating and drinking Cereal Organic food Bodybuilding Rice pudding Foie gras Tilapia Hemp Organic farming Meat analogue Food storage Pizza Liver FoxTrot Airsoft Fusion power Soul food Ramen Kodocha Quorn Chicken soup Couscous Quinoa Star Trek Customizable Card Game Peruvian cuisine Hot dog Porridge Cream (food) Beer Single malt Scotch Ethanol Stomach cancer Common bean Genetically modified food Soap Breakfast Natt__ Tea Livestock Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hunting Acorn Ecology Falconry Protein Bird Ham Mosquito Botulism

help a friend well see i have this friend who has this horse and she is leaving for college soon in providence but she lives in michigan and there is no way that she can aford to take her horse with her to keep her in the stables near her school i was wondering if anyone knew where she could get a sponser to pay for her to take her horse with her if she can't afford it herself and has no friends or relatives able and or willing to pay the next place would be an animal advocacy organization i'd stat with the aspca they probably don't have funds allotted that way but they know the names of any who do it's probably unrealistic for her to find a sponsor to pay all costs so she should begin looking for a new home for the horse ideally someone who'd let her visit horses are looked upon as luxuries so unless your friend or her horse have done something like participate in a rescue it's going to be difficult maybe she could find someone to board the horse at cost then at least he'd be hers when she came home for vacations  ASPCA Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Escape of Charles II Swedish allotment system Education in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics U.S. 1st Cavalry Division Social Security (United States) Amtrak The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Socrates Pension Food Stamp Program John McDouall Stuart Education in Japan University of Michigan Baron Munchhausen Cryonics Supply and demand Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Wyatt Earp Open access Education in England Education in the United States Housing cooperative Professor Medicare (Canada) One Tree Hill (TV series) Medicare (United States) Tourism Pitaten Firefighter Public transport Salad Fingers Legal aid Rosa Parks Citigroup Horse gait Roush Racing The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Students' union Ferrari Horse Tram Economy of Africa Evidence of evolution Student loan Public education Amway Neopets Board of Cooperative Educational Services Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Chariot racing The New School at West Heath No Child Left Behind Act Walt Disney Minimum wage Education in Australia Avenue Q World Vision Organic farming School choice Carl G.

since when are animal shelter coordinators allowed to yell at ppl interested in adopting an animal i have been working with various animal shelters over the years i saw a post on craigslist for these two dogs that needed to be adopted out i was interested so i called the number i did not have the time to ask any questions or to even tell the woman that i was interested before she asked me whether or not i knew everything there was to know about that particular breed of dog when i responded that no i did not know everything about that breed but that i volunteer at the sh boom i was completely cut off as the lady decided to yell and scream at me that i should grow up and that i need to educate myself her screaming rant continued so long that a friend of mine heard it from across the room since i am obviously ignorant i would like some sort of explanation on why it is permissible to yell at someone who is interested in helping out with homeless animals i have never dealt with any vicious adoption coordinators before this phone call and wouldnt have believed they exist unfortunately i believe it was the cell phone number of this volunteer or that she was the head of the department shelter in the first place part of me really does want to call her again and ask her nicely why she spoke to me so cruelly yesterday i guess that there are just ppl in life that are not worth ruining your day over but unfortunately she did ruin part of my day yesterday thank you all for your answers you made me feel much better about the whole situation yes i know some of those shelter workers think they are the only ones that know or care about animals they give people who are interested in adopting additudes and act like no one is good enough to adopt no wonder why many people still purchase animals from breeders it is often easier and you don't have some pompous idiot judging you  Theory of conduct Pet skunk Social rule Plame affair timeline Plame affair Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Socrates The Apprentice 2 Kodocha Dog Russian joke Shaggy dog story United Airlines Flight 93 Community emergency response team Animal shelter The Jim Rome Show Homelessness Kill Bill Sharon Tate Social work Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jon Secada Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Empty Child Sin City Singlish Animal testing Domestic rabbit Transactional analysis Rescue group Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Francis of Assisi Mach kernel I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Avenue Q The Marshall Mathers LP Animal rights Goodness and value theory Breed registry Prank flash Anarchism and society PANICS Pitaten Poker jargon Highway 61 Revisited Leo Frank Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina SMTV Live Golden Retriever John Kerr The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Fathers' rights Seinfeld Milton H.

do you know something about join up method used to make friendship with horse i used to use the join up method a lot when i would help break my cousins horses it helps to have a decent sized round pen the just take the horse in the pen and start to chase it around the pen in circles the horse may kick or rear but as long as you are in the middle of the pen and the horse isnt actually trying to hurt you personally you should be ok while you are chasing the horse make sure you make eye contact it shows the horse that you are the boss and you arent scared of it sometimes you can put your arms in the air as well as a sign of dominance have the horse run around the pen about to times one way and the chase the horse in the other direction to show the horse that you have the power to make it go in the direction you want it to keep chasing it around untill you start to see signs that the horse is starting to trust you the first sign is the horse lowers its head as the horse does this you know its starting to understand whats going on make sure you still keep eye contact with the horse while it dropps its head the next sign is when the horse begins licking and chewing with its houth its sort of looks like the horse has a bit in its mouth and it doesnt like it make sure the horse does these signs a few times and then slow down and dont make eye contact any more to let the horse know you are its friend walk slowly toward the horse still not making eye contact dont walk too close to the horse but close enough and put your shoulder towards the horse and walk forward not looking back at the horse if you do it right the horse will follow you around the pen if not just keep redewing this process and the horse will soon trust you this is a great way to earn your horses trust and bond you can do this every day untill the horse follows you areound every where it really is an amazing process  Swingout Equine conformation Tag Horse Dressage Teen Girl Squad Atomic Kitten Taikyoku shogi Professional wrestling throws Diving Social rule Horse gait Backstroke Dog training Sin City Contredanse Breaststroke Doom enemies Internal ballistics Butterfly stroke Horse tack Glossary of partner dance terms Lindy Basic Milton H.

incorrigible and mean dangerous horses or afford the vet bills etc he has hispanic cowboys ride the better horses to test their ability to be ridden trained and or resold the old sick incorrigible broken down horses go to slaughter for meat he used to rent horses out but the liability insurance was exorbitantly high he got sued because someone got hurt and that was it he quit renting horses out having rental horses is a huge responsibility and liability think twice there are people out there that will give older horses away to a good home most have leg or foot problems and come with huge vet bills for maintenance also you have to factor in the farrier horse shoer costs every weeks and averages and up x's the number of horses not cheap anymore call some farriers in your area and find out the cost for trims shoes on just the front or all around there are ranch prices if you have several horses and they are on the same weekly schedule plus vaccines every months routine wormings weeks supplements each horse needs tack and maintenance costs grooming supplies and equipment cleaning and feeding costs etc you must do you homework if you are going to get into this make your list and find out the costs involved each horse will have to be fed flakes of hay a day every hours a must bales of hay come with anywhere from flakes figure the cost of hay in your area feeding flakes a day average some will need more and add up x's the number of horses some horses can't tolerate alfalfa hay some will need oat or grass hay oat hay is more expensive horses off the track can be purchased rather inexpensively also there are rescues that have horses that need homes you can find them on the web in your area the rescues will know if a horse is green ranch broke trained for disciplines etc this is probably your best option they don't ask a lot of money for these horses unless they come with papers etc then they are very reasonable the bureau of land management has mustangs for adoption for you must keep them one year and sign a contract some are well broke they know which ones geldings are the best for trail riding safely although no horse is safe they are a large animal and can easily hurt injure or kill someone local animal shelters seize horses as well as the spca they ask nominal fees for adoption all come with the above costs involved in keeping horses you will never make money breeding horses unless you have awesome bloodlines that everyone wants race horses and arabs have some of the most expensive bloodlines stud fees can also be steep you have to show to get a name for yourself and your horse also expensive the vet bills for the mare and foal are very expensive if something goes wrong it can cost you a fortune in lay up costs rehab surgery etc one million won't be enough i can guarantee you that better stick with one horse hope this helps if you decide to go forward all i can say is good luck  Livestock Equine conformation Cowboy Insurance Domestic

people for the ethical treatment of animals is it necessary to be a total vegan to belong to peta i don't believe they require it however before joining an organization you should do research on them peta has a long history of contradicting the very things they supposedly stand for if they had it their way it would be illegal to have any kind of pet they are also a bit radical at times in once instance they released dogs at a dog show so they could be free a very lovely dog was hit by a car and they said he was better off dead than being in captivity  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Animal rights Veganism Peter Singer Zoophilia Punk ideology Pet skunk Animal Liberation Front Animal testing Rabies Domestication Fiona Apple Behaviorism Animal liberation movement Dog Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Anti-Defamation League Working dog Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine Eco-terrorism Kashrut Ferret Morrissey PETCO Park Dog training Hard-line Dominique Swain Experimental animal Dobermann Belinda Carlisle Cruelty to animals Hamster Monkey Billboard Hot 100 Center for Consumer Freedom Garfield German Shepherd Dog Speciesism Obedience training Vegetarianism Naive set theory Fur farming Tom Regan Pet Contract Cat Puma Transactional analysis Queen (band) Paul McCartney Time Out of Mind Huntingdon Life Sciences Domestic rabbit Bill Maher Cloning Pet Sounds They Might Be Giants Moby Software engineering Pit bull Animal welfare Dog fighting Scientology Nicomachean Ethics Taboo food and drink Veterinarian Animal Farm Lie Heartworm Nikita Philosophy of language Guantanamo Bay Sabretooth (comics) Supernatural Brian Griffin Dead Prez Neighbours Game show Betty White Sesshomaru Cryonics Christina Aguilera Coercion Animal cognition Scientology controversy Exotic pet Housebreaking Ten Commandments Ethical consumerism Opus Dei Greyhound Prostitution Sonic the Hedgehog Medicine Fancy rat Raw food diet Excel Saga The Beatles bootlegs Jennifer Lopez Parrot

can guinea pig lice live on humans and rabbits i've just discovered my guinea pig has lice i inherited him a week ago and he's full grown but had been a bit unloved i thought his skin was flaky so took him to the vets last week the vet said he was fine and not to worry but i was stroking him today in an attempt to tame him and i can definitely see lice and have discovered a few bloody scabs i've made an appointment to go back to the vets tomorrow but in the meantime i'm wondering if i could get attacked by the lice from handling him or worse if i could transfer the lice from the guinea pig onto my rabbit as the rabbit lives indoors and the piggy outdoors he couldn't catch them directly just wondering if it's safe to handle my bunny tonight yes i agree the vet should have seen the lice but all that will happen to humans is the lice will bit you then jump off as they dont live on anything other than animales  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Fiddler on the Roof Daffy Duck Invader Zim Ferret Fancy rat Animal testing Garfield Rabbit Livestock A Simple Plan Taboo food and drink DDT Bugs Bunny Volleyball EastEnders Whaling Coprophagia Head louse Unreal The Amber Spyglass Crab louse The Golden Age of Hollywood animation Australasia ecozone Microchip implant (animal) Clancy Wiggum Bat Boy Pet skunk Tiny Toon Adventures Housebreaking Domestication Cat Hamster Mickey Mouse Lou Reed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle Johnny 5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ben Johnson (athlete) Fox hunting Moe Berg God Emperor of Dune Rabies Psychedelic music The Shining (film) Roswell UFO incident Kevin and Kell Beatrix Potter Veterinarian Piccolo Junior Saga Chinese astrology Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Taken Pok__mon Live!

hey a quick question i bought my horse from an auction house but not during an actual auction no one was there but the manager of the horses the horse i bought after a trot before he goes into a canter my guy sort of hops and and then slows back to a walk ok here is my actual question do western pleasure horses have lead changes or problems starting off on the wrong lead heres something else i learned after i bought him apparently he was an some kind of english competior i think your new horse is doing flying changes and he is doing them incompletely which is part of the reason he keeps dropping back to the walk instead of moving up into the canter like he should i think that when he starts off he changes leads in the front from habit but doesn't change behind which is why he appears to hop as you put it you are going to have to be very patient if you want to get past this situation and very definite with your aids when you want to canter so that he isn't tempted to keep dropping out of the gait before you ask for a canter make sure that your horse is on your aids and listening to you and that you are in or approaching a corner of the arena it's easier for horses to strike off correctly if they are moving through a corner because it helps both them and you to position the horse's head and body correctly when i ask my mare justice to canter i use my outside leg behind the girth and my inside leg at the girth i use my hands to position her head slightly to the inside of the circle and squeeze strongly with my outside leg justice has a tendency to race up into the canter at times so i make sure that i am very definite about signalling her so that she actually canters and doesn't just speed up at the trot sitting up straight and looking where i am going also helps try not to stare at your horse's ears this will throw your balance and his balance off some his ears aren't going anywhere another thing that i found that is useful is if i limit the time i canter to only about half the length of the arena at least at first once the horse is cantering you need to continue to support him by keeping your legs on him if you relax them too much he will drop back to the trot that's what happens with justice if i don't keep my legs on her work on the transitions up and down until you and your horse are comfortable with them and be patient because it will take time for him to understand that you want him to canter immediately and not change leads right away as he does he needs to learn to stay on one lead for a consistent period hence the reason for doing this in short spurts until he gets the hang of things and to change only when he changes direction or you ask him to do this the first few times you ask this way your horse is going to be like what does she want this is a mighty strange thing to ask me or i don't know what she wants so i will try it my own way just be patient and keep asking and supporting him eventually he will figure it out as for your question about lead changes in western riding the only place i can think of where this is expected is in the sport of reining for obvious reasons pleasure horses usually don't do flying lead changes because that is something which is not typically expected of a pleasure horse they are expected to be on the correct lead when asked to canter however and to remain on it until they are asked to stop or slow down by the rider try the method i mentioned above it works for me good luck i hope this helps  Horse tack Fast bowling Swingout Milton H.
