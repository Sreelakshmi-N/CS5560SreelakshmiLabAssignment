question for comic book collectors i have just bought some copies of 'fantastic four' the white bar code box in the bottom corner gives the price in us and can and bears the words 'direct edition' can anyone tell me what 'direct edition' means and whether it has any significance from a collector's point of view thanks direct edition simply refers to the means in which the comics are distributed direct edition refers to comics that come directly from the publishers ie marvel and are typically sold only at comic book stores and other comic specialty places the non direct editions newsstand editions are found in retail stores drug stores toy stores and what not and come from newsstand distribution companies instead of the publishers themselves the difference between the two types affects the retailers more direct editions cannot be returned by the retailers if they are unable to sell all of their inventory while the newsstand editions can and direct editions can also be purchased by retailers at a bigger discount since the distributors do not have to worry about giving them credit for returned items direct editions and newsstand editions are printed at the exact same time and have nothing to do with being first or second prints like some of the other answerers think second prints and beyond are identified in the indicia the fine print stuff usually at the bottom of the first page of each comic and recently publishers like marvel started using variant covers to identify second printings and beyond collectors do prefer direct editions mainly because they are treated better by comic shops and what not than the newsstand editions direct editions are placed on shelves designed for comics and typically don't get manhandled and bent up by stockers and other people that don't know anything about them while newsstand editions are just the opposite the direct editions first came out in the s after the comic market at newsstands started to drop drastically compared to comic shops specialty stores so the publishers began to allow retailers to buy directly from them instead of their newsstand distribution companies the earlier direct editions can be identified by the pictures on the cover where a barcode would normally be and i believe even earlier editions could be identified by whether the issue number was printed inside of a diamond or just a plain square although i'm not sure about that check out the cover images for issues and to see the differences that i'm talking about in this link http comicspriceguide com p issues asp t id p i know that later diamond covers had the picture in the barcode area while square covers had barcodes so that is why i think that is an identifier check out the covers for issue and on the next page of the same link in fact some of the super serious comic collectors will collect both the diamond covers and square covers or only a specific one of the two  American comic book Comic book Wal-Mart DVD Comics G.I.

why are there naruto shippuden episodes if the regular naruto isnt done yet im confused the shippuden naruto episodes are what happens after the two year jump after suaskue runs away the regular episodes is every thing that happens in between that two year jump in the naruto manga the original naruto they don't tell what happens in that two year jump as for why they decided to show what happened in between the two year jump i really don't know just know it is not necessary to know what happened or to even watch the regular episode on the account of it doesn't really involve itself with the naruto two years later the regular episode tell what how every body trained and the missions they went on to get a few secret moves that they use when trying to hunt down sauske short story you don't have to watch the regular naruto episodes to enjoy the greatness of naruto the regular naruto is like an extra or something  Naruto (manga) Naruto geography Uzumaki Naruto Naruto ninja ranks Hyuga Hinata Akatsuki (Naruto) Hyuga Neji Rock Lee Uchiha Sasuke Naruto jutsu Jiraiya (Naruto) Characters of Naruto Naruto kekkei genkai Haruno Sakura Naruto the Movie Fanon (fiction) Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 VIZ Media Ninja Nara Shikamaru Friends Manga Gantz Whose Line Is It Anyway?

hey anime lovers can i ask is there a second season for ouran highschool host club thanks thanks for answering ouran h s season had already been debated and sadly there wouldn't be a season partly because the anime already gave a socalled ending compared to the manga secondly the producer doesn't give any sign of producing a second season maybe when the manga is already finished and there is already a conclusion to whether to whom haruhi would be paired with will there be a second season but many says that it wouldn't have a season anymore  Chuang Yi Major League Baseball television contracts Tenjho Tenge Oh My Goddess!

how can i create an animated tv series i'm only but i want to have one in the future i don't want to be the animator but i want to be the god of it ya' know the producer the director the creator kinda like the ceo of it anyway how can i start now thanks a billion i don't want to do it all i know i'll need a lot of emplyees it's not about generating ideas for your stories as well when you say creator you must put yourself as well in the shoes of the creator authors your employees animators and peers it all started from the bottom until you should understand the situation more better than your employees and peers and lead them well to success i would say go to that field of interest and study about it more animation knowing the process and applying them correctly gives you the advantage to create the stuff and finish it in time because those who command with a high post without understanding the hardship of their peers and employees will not gain respect and voluntary compliance from the people below him her in worst case it can result to early disbandment if the future of studio company would lead to loss rather than profit one of the examples of consequences for not doing so is the son of hayao miyazaki he's an it based graduate yet he strayed to become an animation director to take over his father's place his outcome of the show received alot more complaints and criticism than compliments from movie critiques and reviewers alike it somehow tarnished the good name and reputation that hayao miyazaki built for his studio that it guy is kind of like a stranger to the animation world for he had no background of animation movie making field and just barged in to his father's studio to become a director i say it again put yourself into understanding how people work to produce animations and movies work along with them and you can hope to see a future in those higher post you mentioned yeah i agree with the guy above you need portfolio's of your work to prove yourself a capable person  Hayao Miyazaki Theory of conduct Microeconomics Extreme Programming Plame affair Pretty Good Privacy Machinima Corporate governance Hideaki Anno Supply and demand Modern animation of the United States Peer review Spirited Away Capitalism Ra (board game) Empire Burlesque Mamoru Oshii Pixar Anarchism and capitalism Joe Hisaishi Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Theodicy Labor theory of value Software engineering Pok__mon (anime) Copyright Mutual fund Computer animation Prisoner's dilemma Unemployment Goodness and value theory Isao Takahata Family Guy Strategic management Electronic Arts Determinism The Origin of Species Fair use Infantilism Mediation Cold fusion Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Free will Inflation Mo__ Open source culture She Loves You Scientific method Humphrey Bogart Prices of production Intelligent design Studio Ghibli Citigroup Nausica__ of the Valley of the Wind Justification (theology) Poker jargon Productive and unproductive labour W.

proof ish tobi is not obito spoilerish hahaha ive been tellin people for ever that he is not obito and kinda randomly i was rereading manga chapters and in chapter kisame and itachi are talking and its raining and kisame tells itachi that it looks like he's crying and that its a shame that about his little brother then read here bottom pannel http www onemanga com naruto hahaha kisame says you're the sole member of the uchiha clan tho itachi says he knows sasuke is still alive but they are in the akatsuki with tobi which means they would know what he does and all therefore in my logic tobi is not part of the uchiha clan most likely meaning that he took uchiha madara's power and is not madara or obito muahahahahaha anyways i suppose that there is a slight possiblity that im wrong and the leader and unknown member are the only ones that know he's part of it but im betting that it isnt that way cuz it'd be pretty hard to hide it from the whole organization especially his partner hahaha well i dunno if we should trust kisame but doncha think that someone in the orginization would tell them or at least itachi would know and kisame would find out also i was just thinking do you think pein can like control weather or somfin i know its kinda random but at the end of that chapter pein's talking to the unknown member and tobi and it started raining again and the unknown member said pein you and he is from the rain village its really random but ya maybe maybe not  Hatake Kakashi Naruto jutsu Uchiha Sasuke Naruto geography Naruto kekkei genkai Uzumaki Naruto Naruto (manga) Naruto ninja ranks Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Hyuga Hinata Naruto: Narutimate Hero 2 Revenge Rock Lee Hyuga Neji Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Nara Shikamaru Haruno Sakura Negima Randomness Gaara Samurai Deeper Kyo Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Akimichi Choji One Piece minor characters Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Craps YuYu Hakusho Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Naruto: Narutimate Hero Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Outlaw Star Jiraiya (Naruto) The Da Vinci Code Cardcaptor Sakura Tao Te Ching Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gaia Online Pitaten Inuzuka Kiba Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Transformers: Cybertron Toby Keith Roswell UFO incident Combine (Half-Life 2) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Wolf's Rain Seiy__ Poker jargon Saint Seiya V.F.D.

what is some good gay hentai either for free online or books i'd like whole episodes not just images ahhh you've asked at the right time aka when i'm online lol let's see if you want yaoi manga then download mirc read it and learn it even if it seems complicated it's really not this is the only way to build a great collection of yaoi yumminess go to popular scanlation channels like yaoirulez and nakama for your downloading needs oh and some of my suggestions for manga downloads are actually licensed so don't use the find command on mirc to search for them because most scanlation groups have issues with serving licensed manga just find them by searching through various fservs to download because if you use the find command then whatever you're searching for is visible to the public and someone can get on your case for searching for licensed stuff don't worry we all do it shhh if you just want some yaoi manga to pass the time not necessarily a gb collection like mine then just go download some manga directly off of scanlation sites like hochuuami http www hochuuami com and liquid passion http www hackthemainstream com some manga ka last name first name suggestions include kano shiuko sadahiro mika minase masara yamane ayano nitta youka takakura row higashino yuu ougi yuzuha yoshinaga fumi minami haruka sakurai shushushu kotobuki tarako chitose piyoko oh the glorious smut of it all hehe by the way i'm sure i haven't listed all the ones that deserve to be listed but i don't have the time to list them all some of my favorite scanlation groups include nakama obsession liquid passion attractive fascinante dangerous pleasure and hochuuami i love 'em all though if you want some of my favorite yaoi manga then under grand hotel sadahiro mika must have haru wo daite ita nitta youka the best couple ever stepping stone kano shiuko gerard and jacques yoshinaga fumi viewfinder series yamane ayano crimson spell yamane ayano gokujou no koibito available via direct download off of hochuuami's site minase masara unbalanced heat minase masara brother ougi yuzuha abiru junjou ougi yuzuha sex pistols kotobuki tarako this work along with ugh and haru make some of the best yaoi manga ever love mode shimizu yuki map of tokyo savage a passage from servant boy dr ten just smut i don't even get the storyline lol mukizu ja irarenee sadahiro mika most of these aforemetioned artists also do a lot of hot oneshots or they specialize in oneshots like minami haruka but kano shiuko and sadahiro mika are my favorite currently though i'm really into minase masara's stuff by the way if you're really into just some dirty raunchy yaoi sex with no plotline then try the gravitation remixes and megamixes gravitation itself is waaaaay too mainstream and not enough action but the remixes are hoooooot and extremely x rated if you want yaoi anime then i suggest you download ares or azureus and find some torrents to download ares is probably easier to use because azureus requires you to download java which takes a lot of space however azureus is the better torrent downloading program because it's designed specifically to download torrents unlike ares whichever you feel comfortable with you can even download them both anyway most yaoi torrents are provided by aarinfantasy i have almost all of them so i suggest the following to download ai no kusabi and a must have for any yaoi fan papa to kiss in the dark ova and the legend of the four horsemen boku no pico pico to chico the second installment of boku no pico enzai and sensitive pornograph haru wo daite ita ova and yaoi with some action yaoi with a little more action explicit yaoi mmm if you're too lazy to download all of them yourself and would rather forsake quality for time then try to find these animes online on video sites like youtube and dailymotion i guarantee you that it's much better to download these animes yourself though it looks waaaay better if you want mainstream crap though go ask someone else because i'm not into all that sweet and innocent shounen ai stuff like loveless by the way a lot of the stuff i've mentioned contains shota incest rape non con and semi con and other delicious fetishes so if you're not into that stuff shrugs then again you're the one asking for some good gay hentai so whatever  BitTorrent Gravitation (manga) Yu-Gi-Oh!

where do i get comic book issues do you get them at book stores like barnes and noble or something or comic book stores or somewhere else please help if you have a comic book store in your area support it check the yellow pages under comic books or gaming stores the hobby shops that carry dungeons dragons types of games a poor second is any bookstore that carries them the reason i say this is a poor second choice is because most retailers do not have the floor space to dedicate to comic books even if they did chances are they would miss a lot of the smaller publishers if you don't have anyone in your town carrying comic books talk to local small businesses about getting comic books in for sale they should to talk to diamond distributors which is the nation's largest comic book distributor last resort would be direct subscriptions from the publisher the problem with this is the postal service constantly mutilates comic books there are a few comic book stores that provide subscription services for the advance payment of a year's worth of a comic preferably several comics and a small service fee they will collect your titles and ship them out to you at least once a month these will be shipped in boxes which protect your books  Marvel Comics Publishing Barnes & Noble Comic book British small press comics Shopping mall Image Comics American comic book Laserdisc TOKYOPOP Amazon.com Video game crash of 1983 MMORPG Book Manga Gary Gygax Newspaper Pok__mon (video games) MapleStory Fantastic Four D20 System TurboGrafx 16 Computer and video games Atlas Comics (1950s) United States Postal Service Trade paperback (comics) DC Comics Miniature wargaming Internet fraud Online shop Poker jargon G.I.

whats so special about naruto i give up theres 's of questions about this show daily the one episode i saw i couldn't really get into because i hate anime i watched it for minutes and got sick is it violent funny you only watched five minutes of one episode you need to give it more time than that the storyline moves extremely slow in the series which is one major drawback but if you watch enough episodes you'll like it especially after seeing some of the fights in that show the fights are awesome and intelligently done even though most of them go at a slow pace they once spent like six or seven episodes in that series just fighting one bad guy and most of the time was taken up by each of the characters having flashbacks about their childhood so you should probably only watch it if you have nothing better to do  Beavis and Butt-head Jumping the shark Clip show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Family Guy Teen Girl Squad Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teen Titans (animated series) Fictional crossover Star Trek Undergrads The Fairly OddParents Meta-reference Bob and George Negima The Young Ones (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Mike Alfonso The Simpsons Whose Line Is It Anyway?

whats with the sudden spike in jl questions is it on tv again as mentioned above there are rumors of a justice league movie in production while there are no new episodes of justice league or justice league unlimited being produced cartoon network's boomerang channel has reruns of justice league unlimited on at pm est pst also a justice league dvd justice league the new frontier is scheduled for release later this year but it's not connected to the former justice league cartoon i think the spike in questions is due to the opinion of many fans that justice league was probably cartoon network's best written show and a perfect example of what a superhero team show should be  Justice League Unlimited Justice League Toonami Teen Titans (animated series) Cartoon Network Pok__mon (anime) Super Friends Dexter's Laboratory Ren and Stimpy Family Guy Star Trek Television in the United States Adult Swim Toonami (UK) Rerun Flash (comics) Tom and Jerry (MGM) DC Animated Universe Identity Crisis (comics) Aquaman Boomerang (TV channel) Godzilla Saturday morning cartoon Star Trek: Enterprise Spider-Man: The Animated Series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Jonny Quest Scooby-Doo The Tick Six Feet Under Animated television series Space Ghost Coast to Coast Green Arrow DC Comics Cartoon Network Studios Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Modern animation of the United States SpongeBob SquarePants Batman Spike TV Turner Network Television Batman Beyond Star Wars: Clone Wars Avengers (comics) Transformers: The Movie Neon Genesis Evangelion Major League Baseball Justice Society of America Supergirl Robotech Josie and the Pussycats (cartoon) The Flintstones Entertainment Weekly Rugrats Fantastic Four Wonder Twins Batman: The Animated Series Hawkgirl Green Lantern TOKYOPOP TBS (TV network) Superhero Wonder Woman Solomon Grundy (comics) Cardcaptor Sakura Cowboy Bebop Batman: Mask of the Phantasm FUNimation Boba Fett The Land Before Time Double Dare Television syndication Darkwing Duck Human League Hawk and Dove Alvin and the Chipmunks Canon (fiction) Anime Match Game The Facts of Life CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Fleischer Studios Paul Dini Sailor Moon Static Shock Walt Disney anthology series They Might Be Giants National Football League Yu-Gi-Oh!

why do spock and mccoy wear blue shirts and scottie a red and kirk a yellow shirt as has been stated in the past the jobs usually determined the color worn however i believe some of this was also somewhat subjective here's some samples of who wore what command helm navigation routinely wore yellow kirk sulu chekov are some examples science medical routinely wore blue spock mccoy nurse chapel are some examples engineering security communications virtually anyone else wore red including many a killed crewman scotty uhura yeoman rand all donned red confused yet it gets better originally star trek had tan shirts instead of gold refer to the cage some of these were still used by personnel once the series took off this was originally worn by command operations science even engineering personnel here's another bit of trivia uhura wore a gold outfit just like her red one in at least one episode this would add further confusion to the significance of the colors it should also be noted that commodores admirals didn't always wear gold often they wore red uniforms so they also added to the confusion also of note there was actually a green shirt which seemed to be reserved for captain kirk this green wraparound shirt was first used when a transporter accident split kirk into good kirk bad kirk the producers used a different shirt to help viewers differentiate between which kirk was which in scenes where the two kirks were together it wasn't until star trek ii the wrath of khan that definitive colors were used to separate departments without any confusion at this point numerous colors were assigned to the officers turtleneck undershirts to indicate their department the producers of the movies did well in assigning the different colors sticking to them should someone change departments examples of changes include kirk when demoted from admiral to captain lost the gold trim on his jacket pants that indicates a flag officer since he was returned to a line officer but kept his white command shirt sulu originally wore the gold turtleneck for command but gained a white turtleneck when he became captain of the excelsior scotty originally wore a gold turtleneck when in engineering but when promoted to the rank of captain he gained a white turtleneck anyway i hope this helped check out the links below for more information  James T.

why are anime fans so sensitive you'd think with all of the violence they watch in their anime that they would be a little desensitized and be able to handle a little joke at the expense of anime i understand that you love what you love i am a cartoon geek since birth but i at least have a sense of humor about it yes i know fred flintstone passed that same boulder three times already yes i know wile e coyote could have easily bought a turkey dinner for the price of all of that acme stuff yes scooby and shaggy were probably smoking weed in the back of the mystery machine lighten up people it's animation learn to take a joke i'm going to pick on anime you can take some shots at cartoons it could be a lot of fun if you could gain a sense of humor about it all king exactly what i'm talking about lighten up francis there is a deep love of anime people who watch it tend to read the manga and dress up as their favorite characters they someones devote websites and fanmade storylines to the anime they like unlike old time cartoons anime characters are better developed and the plot lines make you feel for the characters i think some people just get so caught up with it that they can't stand to have people make fun of what they're devoted to it's pretty scary i love anime too but i'm not gonna start the next world war over who someone's opinions  Looney Tunes: Back In Action Wile E.

what do you think of my character well she's about as tall as sasuke she is she has purple eyes perfectly tanned skin and long lack hair as for race she's egyption she's a natural leader and will be willling to give up her life in order to save her friends but she has no family her father was killed in front of her on her birthday and she is now an avenger sasuke moment people only recognize her as her fathers daughter and not by her name so do you like it i put her in all my stories but i haven't put them on fanfiction yet cause i'm still working on them alright for the fellow who wants more sadness i'll add on she's cursed with an evil deamon inside of her it threatens to come out every day she now uses the deamon to her advanatage by using it's powers to kill her oponent when in battle she can't luv no one cause her mother put a spell on her that would make every guy she liked hate her the reason she did that was cause she didn't get the son that she wanted and she only got a girl so she took out all her anger on her as a child but the father never found out about the beatings they both died when she was a year old there is that good enough now i can't come up with a good name for her could anyone suggest one to me but i want one in japanese just tell me what it means in englsih cause i'm still working on my japanese skills what i couldn't think of anything else that's the only part that's like sasuke if you read my stories which i won't let you her attitude is nothing like sasuke she's happy most of the time and she's pure at heart i don't know about the name though geez no one likes my character can't anybody say something nice about it alot of hard work went in to making this character seeing people critisize it makes me sorta upset i'm tempted to delate her from all my stories i've written about and make a new character so that all you people will be happy geez no one likes my ideas fine be that way thank you to the person who said they liked my ideas for the last fckin time i did not make this character so that she could be the female version of sasuke she doesn't know who the man is she only got a glimsp of his face under his hood he had red eyes and white skin his voice was very cold and quiet the reason the man killed her father was cause he had lost to him once and he wanted to get back at him she is royalty one of my stories has to do with her taking place of father as the ruler in that same story her people did have lots of respect for her well i wanted to make a character that would over come the evil deep inside her you know a good vs evil kind of story thank you for your comments your deffinently going to get best answer if there is no one else who has a good answer i hope it makes sense there is no details about the murderer could the father killed in front of her by a mysterious figure that would be the only way she did not know who exactly the mystery identity of the murderer what is the motive of the murderer why target the father don't tell me the father died protecting the gal because the murderer wants a piece of the gal that will be totally like naruto where is the location and time i tell you some facts ancient egyptians are polygamous one husband a few wives hardly there's orphan cases but suppose to have step mothers maybe some are kind but some are unkind to her if she's a female in the royal bloodline she is well respected by the citizens for being the future queen due to her special status one day to bear the next generation pharaoh how come demons are in this aren't it suppose to be some mummy's curse or something they believe and worship seth and anubis the keeper of the underworld and they are gods of war and destruction demons are mainly mythological beings in christian muslim religions a natural leader and selfless person willing to give up her life for others doesn't match well being a vengeful person a good leader is unprofessional to be driven by personal feelings and motives of vengence that will be selfish contradicts with the selfless personality don't make her an avenger but perhaps she can hope to make the sinner murderer to regret his her sins and willing to repent perhaps you can refer to a main hero lazlo character in suikoden iv where he had been embeded with the rune of punishment a powerful destructive force that can tear down fleets of ships but it gradually consumes the life of the user your character is very similar to that hero  Characters of Naruto Uchiha Sasuke Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Theory of conduct Ten Commandments Evil Uzumaki

what naruto pairing do you like better naruto and sakura or sasuke and sasuke naruto and sakura me and my sister are always argueing about which pairing will end up in the end she always says sasuke and sakura because they're the most popular pairing even though i agree with that sometimes i still like naruto and sakura together better which pairing do you like better i can't see sakura ever seeing naruto in that way she always saw him as a nuisance but over time has come to tolerate and respect him sakura is head over heels about sasuke unfortunately until sasuke gets revenge on his brother i don't think he will be able to find love and happiness as he is always striving to surpass his brother and that mean every spare minute is devoted to that purpose if he can get passed that then maybe he will find the ability to love and commit to someone hopefully sakura will still be there waiting for him naruto i think will end up with hinata hinata is madly in love with naruto and he likes her not in the same way right now but he does like her as a person he's shown that by defending her sticking up for her after neji kept putting her down and saying that he liked her despite having a crush on sakura naruto genuinely like hinata and i think that will just get stronger until she is the only one he sees  Naruto (manga) Uchiha Sasuke Uzumaki Naruto Characters of Naruto Hyuga Hinata Hatake Kakashi Naruto jutsu Hyuga Neji Haruno Sakura Naruto kekkei genkai Rock Lee Akatsuki (Naruto) Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Cardcaptor Sakura Nara Shikamaru Inuzuka Kiba Love Hina main characters Naruto: Narutimate Hero 2 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Samurai Deeper Kyo Naruto: Narutimate Hero Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Gaara Naruto geography GetBackers Naruto ninja ranks Naruto the Movie Death Note Seiy__ Ninpu Sentai Hurricanger Please Save My Earth Side Characters (Xenosaga) Ninja Sentai Kaku Ranger Masanori Murakawa One Piece minor characters Kitsune Cosmic Era list of characters Pok__mon Chronicles Love Hina minor characters Revenge My-HiME Ramen Maison Ikkoku Pitaten Ed, Edd n Eddy Love Sgt.

why are there no anime featuring kaiju at least none i've seen in the us i mean there are the two godzilla cartoon series and i guess that the angels in evangelion are technically kaiju and some of the demons in inuyasha are kaijulike but with the genre so popular worldwide why not more kaiju anime in my opinion monster animal type animes are less appealing in the us because they suck they're ugly to look at their fight scenes are boring they're not funny and the people who control the tv networks target animes for children children in the us likes to fantasize about being the character everyone wants to be a ninja so they watch naruto who wants to become an insect like humanoid creature  Godzilla Kaiju Alien races from the Godzilla films Tokusatsu Science fiction on television Anime Manga InuYasha Cartoon Network Mazinger Z Monsterland / Monster Island Naruto (manga) Hedorah, the Smog Monster Godzilla vs. Gigan Rodan Demon Adult Swim United Productions of America Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Godzilla vs. Megaguirus Uzumaki Naruto Zilla Bambi Meets Godzilla Mechagodzilla Ultraman Jet Jaguar Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee Gainax Funny animal Orochi Godzilla vs. Destoroyah Godzilla (1998 film) Godzilla: Final Wars Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack Godzilla (1954 film) Power Rangers Gorosaurus Terror of Mechagodzilla Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster All Monsters Attack Gamera Orga Furry fandom Godzilla Raids Again Kemono Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla Evangelion (mecha) Mothra vs. Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Mecha Monster Rancher monsters Biollante Pok__mon (anime) Kamacuras Baragon King Ghidorah Invasion of Astro-Monster Fictional crossover Godzilla vs Biollante War of the Worlds (2005 film) Destoroyah Scooby-Doo Hyuga Hinata Animated cartoon Ishiro Honda Naruto jutsu Mothra Ultra Q Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Yu-Gi-Oh!
