high school football experts please answer my son is a freshman and is playing football for the st time he is ' and weighs not flabby fat he's really stocky anyway why did the coach make him starting center i think he should have been a tackle considering the fact he's outrun just about everybody on the team as well as his build don't coaches take stuff like that into consideration it's just weird to me that he gave him center seems like a waste here are some of the considerations taken when placing an oline together one your center is usually the leader of your lineman he has to be able to command the guys to his right and left he sets the tone for them second you have to have the physical and mental ability to block in the middle very rarely is there someone lined up right in front of your center so he has to be smart enough to read and pick up a blitz or to shift down and help one of the guards typically your tackles are taller you would want the shorter men in the middle so that they dont interfer with the qb vision downfield and so that they can stay low when firing off the line and attacking down field tackles are almost upright in pass blocking and de's are usually tall as well his speed will actually serve him better at center there is more going on and he will have to move from one spot to the next in a hurry to be effective  Glossary of American football American football American football strategy Offensive team Lineman (football) Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Lore New York Giants Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXVII Volleyball New England Patriots Quarterback National Football League Wide receiver Canadian football Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXVI Defensive team Rugby union Kansas City Chiefs Carolina Panthers Football (soccer) Super Bowl XIII San Francisco 49ers Ultimate (sport) New York Jets Official (American football) Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXIV Water polo Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl X Marching band Super Bowl XIX Miami Dolphins Oakland Raiders Equine conformation Pittsburgh Steelers Yao Ming Super Bowl XVII Tank Combine (Half-Life 2) St. Louis Rams Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XII Ted Hendricks Super Bowl III Super Bowl V Football (soccer) positions TGV Sid Gillman Rugby football Field hockey Baseball Randy Moss Philadelphia Eagles Tight end Rugby union positions Super Bowl XXXIII Badminton Tag Aerial (dance move) Australian rules football Rigging Running back Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl I Tennessee Titans Universal Century Technology Georgia Institute of Technology World Football League Fast bowling Iron Bowl Steve Nash Tom Landry Norway national football team Toronto Raptors Clemson University Second Battle of the Atlantic Speed of light NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Minnesota Vikings Leeds United F.C.

your nfl power rankings rank all nfl teams or just the top if u want on how good they are going into the season colts patriots ravens chargers eagles bears saints bengals panthers seahawks ers cowboys the colts won the championship so i out them number one as long as their defense holds and i think it will closely behind are the patriots due to their ability to win aswell as their key offseason moves next was hard for me between the ravens and chargers i put the ravens here because they had the best defense in the nfl and with this years schedule baltimore has an easy schedule to run on and wont have to pass the ball that much and can rely on willis mcgahee to run the ball next is san diego because they've proven they can win lt was a monster for them last year and im expecting him to do similar to last year i picked the eagles instead of the bears here because the bears had the easiest schedule last year in the nfl and im not convinced that chicago has what it takes they played or teams that finished or better last year not a hard schedule dont get me wrong chicago made it to the super bowl but im expecting mcnabb to stay healthy and lead this team before his injury mcnabb was on pase for about yards and over tds  Carolina Panthers Donovan McNabb Professional American football championship games Indianapolis Colts American Football League September 2005 in sports St. Louis Rams Buffalo Bills Running back New York Jets Baltimore Ravens Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVII Terrell Owens NFL playoffs, 2004-05 October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Super Bowl V January 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports Kansas City Chiefs San Diego Chargers Monday Night Football Jim Harbaugh Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl XXXIX 2005 NFL season Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXI Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl X Washington Redskins Cris Carter Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl I Pro Football Hall of Fame Michael Vick Super Bowl XIV Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XIX Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXXVIII NFL playoffs Super Bowl XVIII Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl VII NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Denver Broncos Madden NFL Super Bowl VI NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Rodney Harrison 1978 NFL season Super Bowl XX Detroit Lions Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXII NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XII National Football League championships September 2004 in sports Joe Gibbs Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXXVII Atlanta Falcons Brett Favre NFL playoffs, 1994-95 Super Bowl IX Chicago Cubs Ryan Leaf Choke (sports) NFL playoffs, 1996-97

how can i become a better hitter tackler i want to stand out tomorrow because it is our first day of practice with pads any tips theres no perfect way to tackle some one and dish out a huge hit everytime since i am a linebacker i can probably tell you a few tips st eye the ball carrier its kind of a lock down you see whos got the ball then you kind of lock in on him be aware of blockers but make sure you stay on him you can not lose him nd shed all blockers before pursuiting the ball carrier you have be aware of blockers in front of you too concentrated on the ball carrier can lead to a pancake some guy knocking you straight down onto the ground if you are on defense you will have to use a swim or juke or wtv to get through to the carrier you shouldnt take more than seconds to shed a block any time longer means the ball carrier is up and away rd pursue the carrier by that i mean catch up to him and find the best angle on him for example if a running back is running along the sidelines make sure you close in on him but make sure you have the correct angle to him or he can just do a cut and you will be burned if the rb is in the back field try to get in front of him as possible so you can make the best out of the tackle if you are chasing a rb make sure you have his legs in diving range if you cant get his legs chances are you cant get him th tackle him if there isnt a lot of space between the ball carrier and you you should always hit him in the midsection lower your shoulders and just push your shoulders into him do not vision a huge hit before the tackle most of the time you will miss if you try too hard just lower your shoulder and drive it in the only exception is when you are trying to force a fumble in which case you will usually lower your helmet and kind of head butt the space where theres the ball if a carrier has the ball in his arms you will try to hit him in the arm the hardest you can if you are trying to force a fumble for the qb go for his hands as he will likely be trying to throw if his hands are throwing forward you will try to hit the hand backwards so the ball will come loose inevitablely you will have to make a what we call a shoe string tackle which means a tackle where you are just usually diving and grabbing a piece of the carrier the important thing when diving is to dive at the right time as you know when running the legs goes up and down when looked from behind so when diving for a guys legs you have to make sure you make contact when the legs are up its easier to hold on than if the legs are swing down therefore you have to time it correctly sometimes you will have caught just a smal part of the carrier the important thing is to hold on obviously he will try to break free so its important that you get a firm hold and wait for help if theres one thing about tackling its not every tackle is perfect but as long as the guys down the jobs done hope that helps and good luck  Aerial (dance move) American football strategy Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling aerial techniques National Football League Lore Diving Suplex New York Giants Rugby union positions Cincinnati Bengals Baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Field hockey Softball Rugby union Super Bowl XXV Tag Cleveland Browns Lineman (football) Swingout Equine conformation Batting (cricket) Water polo Super Bowl IX Super Bowl V Knife Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXXIV Backstroke Boxing DDT (professional wrestling) Super Bowl XXVII Rugby league positions Australian rules football Carolina Panthers Cricket New England Patriots Billiards Super Bowl XIII Powerbomb Super Bowl XII Fielding (cricket) English cricket team Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon Defensive team Piledriver (professional wrestling) Glossary of climbing terms 1957 World Series Swimming Parade (military) Super Bowl XXI Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Baseball Stars Tank Offensive team Super Bowl XXXVI Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Mixed martial arts San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXIII Shaggy dog story Armored Core Butterfly stroke Archery Peter Shilton Combine (Half-Life 2) Terminal ballistics Side pass (dance move) Blitzball Super Bowl XVII Rugby league Neckbreaker Sandy Koufax

can you honestly tell me that jerry rice isn't the greatest football player ever i challenge you to objectively explain how anyone was better here's my rationale ask a thousand hardcore football fans who the greatest qb is and you'll get an argument montana elway marino unitas etc running back same thing sanders brown e smith payton etc ask that same question about wide receivers and there is no legitimate argument it's jerry rice he is the only player whose superiority at his position is without dispute i await your feedback i see a lot of valid arguments i don't necessarily agree with them but some are valid nonetheless it's easy to say a wideout needs a qb to get him the ball but you can also say a qb needs a wideout to catch it and a running back needs linemen to block for him my basic rationale is this all those other guys were great but how can you say they're the best ever when you can't even necessarily say they were the best at their position yes i can he is undoubtedly the best wr by statistics in nfl history that does not make him ultimately the best player ever he played a team game on a very good team with hof teammates barry sanders played on a crappy team with almost no great talent around him walter payton played on a team that varied from horrible to sb champs some years he had great teammates others not so much jim brown played a very short time in the nfl and yet is one of the best ever so comparing players that have such differing supporting casts is really faulty to find a true best player overall comparing nfl players of different positions is very difficult what makes a great wr is different than rb qb ol or any defensive player what each position is required to do differs greatly the best player could easily be an o lineman but since they don't get highlight reels make sportscenter or endorsements you wouldn't know so to claim rice or any other player as the definitive best ever is really not a claim to be backed up is he a top player in nfl history hell yes best period maybe but not a definite yes  American football Wide receiver San Francisco 49ers New York Giants National Football League Lore Running back Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXVII Pittsburgh Steelers Walter Payton Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl III Super Bowl I Miami Dolphins Barry Sanders Jerry Rice NFL Most Valuable Player Award Super Bowl XXI Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXV Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XIV American football strategy Buffalo Bills Quarterback Pro Football Hall of Fame Offensive team Super Bowl XVIII Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXVI Dallas Cowboys Theory of conduct Super Bowl XXVIII Canadian football Super Bowl IX John Elway Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl V Michael Vick Super Bowl X Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl VII Terrell Owens Randy Moss Baseball Super Bowl XVII Indianapolis Colts Rugby union Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XVI College football Super Bowl XXX The NFL Today Jacksonville Jaguars Norway national football team Ontological argument Super Bowl XII Michael Jordan Madden NFL Jim Rice Oakland Raiders Football Team Fortress Classic Super Bowl XXXI Boomer Esiason Steve Nash Ty Cobb Brett Favre Football (soccer) Super Bowl XXXIV Deion Sanders Dan Marino Chicago Bears Ultimate (sport) Joe Paterno 2005 NFL season Water polo Table tennis Defensive team Super Bowl XV Theodicy

should the vikings trade jackson and their pick next year to the raiders for jamarcus russell this would solve problems for both teams i think the vikings need a true number qb and the raiders need to get rid of a signing problem the raiders have culpepper and i don't think he is going to let go of the starting job for a couple of years it would be trading an unproven for another unproven but the talent swing is huge between them never would happen raiders 'eaned' the number one pick in the draft and out of all the players they picked russel he's a rookie and probably not expected to do much the first year he'll ride the bench and most likely take over next year culpepper signed a year deal he wants to show he's still got it in an effort to sign with another team next year if he starts this season which isn't a given but very likely he'll be gone at the end of the year for russel why would the vikings want to give up their qb they picked him last year and will start him this year they have a good rb which will take the pressure off the young qb and who's to say he would be easy to sign with the vikes many picks hold out that's why oakland went ahead and signed culpepper to a year deal  Oakland Raiders Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Daunte Culpepper New England Patriots New York Knicks Super Bowl IX Cincinnati Bengals Buffalo Bills Oakland Athletics Chicago Bulls Cleveland Browns New York Jets Randy Moss Reggie Jackson San Francisco 49ers Utah Jazz Minnesota Vikings AFL-NFL Merger Super Bowl XXVII Boston Bruins Jeff George Baltimore Ravens Cris Carter Canberra Raiders American Football League National Football League Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XI Carolina Panthers St. Louis Rams Dallas Cowboys Los Angeles Clippers National Football League Lore January 2005 in sports Madden NFL NFL playoffs, 2004-05 New York Mets NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Houston Rockets Miami Dolphins Indiana Pacers Seattle Mariners Minor league baseball Toronto Blue Jays 1957 World Series Pittsburgh Penguins Detroit Red Wings Super Bowl XXVI Tampa Bay Buccaneers Brett Favre Wayne Gretzky Los Angeles Kings NFL Draft New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Sammy Sosa Monday Night Football Ted Hendricks NBA Draft NBA Finals Super Bowl X Super Bowl XV Yao Ming Boston Red Sox Alex Rodriguez Wilt Chamberlain Hendrick Motorsports Orlando Magic Cleveland Cavaliers Atlanta Flames Babe Ruth Kerry Collins Cincinnati Reds Willie Brown (football player) September 2005 in sports Detroit Tigers Florida Marlins WNBA Draft Super Bowl New Jersey Nets Draft (sports) Super Bowl XIX Penske Racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kansas City Royals Portland Trail Blazers LeBron James October 2004 in sports Super Bowl XII Philadelphia Flyers Jon Gruden December 2004 in sports Joe Gibbs Donovan McNabb Robin Ventura Norway national football team

who is the greatest nfl player of all time that's like asking which one of your children is your favorite there have honestly been so many great players that the mindset is too hard to imagine personally i've always admired brett favre for his guts and the fact that he plays to have fun as well as admiring joe montana for being easily the most level headed individual to play the game walter payton ranks high on that list because he was the classiest individual and the nicest guy to ever put on a helmet and pads on the defensive side reggie white sticks out because of two things those wild looking eyes and swinging arms struck fear into anyone who played quarterback even phil simms was nervous about interviewing him after his retirement and secondly for the fact that he was one of the biggest reasons the light shone on green bay in the nineties other names that stick out in my mind for defense would be mean joe greene sticks out because he was part of the steelers' saving force in the ' season when bradshaw went down helping them to super bowl x i could go on forever but those were the ones that suck out first in my mind  Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League Lore Cleveland Browns New York Giants Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl X New England Patriots Super Bowl XXXII Cincinnati Bengals NFL Most Valuable Player Award Dallas Cowboys Baltimore Ravens Brett Favre Minnesota Vikings Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XIII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXIV Green Bay Packers Kansas City Chiefs Reggie White Miami Dolphins Carolina Panthers Monday Night Football Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXIII Steve Young (athlete) Super Bowl XIV New York Jets Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl San Francisco 49ers Dan Marino San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 2001-02 NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Indianapolis Colts Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XIX Kurt Warner NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXV Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl I Super Bowl IV World Series English cricket team Super Bowl XI Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXVII Chicago Bears Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXIV Reggie Jackson Super Bowl VII Walter Payton NFL playoffs, 1993-94 Donovan McNabb NFL playoffs, 1995-96 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XVII September 2005 in sports Terrell Owens Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Detroit Lions Running back Terry Bradshaw Boomer Esiason Atlanta Falcons NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award Ted Hendricks Oakland Raiders Ravi Shastri Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl V Joe Gibbs October 2005 in sports Professional American football championship games Joe Paterno Detroit Tigers Ty Cobb

why don't rookie quarterbacks realize it's detrimental for them to holdout since their position is the most important in football the agents are the ones with all the power look for that the rookie pool to change in when the league has the option to open up their collective bargining agreement the owners coaches and players and fans are sick and tired of the holdout complaining about money and so on and so on my guess is the league will put a cap on rookie salaries thus ending some of the enormous contracts floating around for kids who haven't accomplished anything in the nfl yet i know the league wants some of the money go to the established veterns and i'd like to see some changes watch they'll open up the cba next year to discuss but blame the agents  National Football League Salary cap New England Patriots NFL Draft Cleveland Browns American Football League Cincinnati Bengals National Hockey League Pittsburgh Steelers Baltimore Ravens Continental Basketball Association AFL-NFL Merger New York Giants Kansas City Chiefs Reserve clause 2004-05 NHL lockout Buffalo Bills Tennessee Titans Carolina Panthers Washington Redskins Jacksonville Jaguars American football Major League Baseball Dallas Cowboys St. Louis Rams Boston Red Sox Chicago Bulls Major League Baseball television contracts Miami Dolphins San Diego Chargers Terrell Owens New York Jets National Football League Lore San Francisco 49ers 1994 baseball strike Minor league baseball National Football League Players' Association Minnesota Vikings Glossary of American football Ty Cobb Toronto Raptors Major League Soccer Kurt Warner Super Bowl Super Bowl XXV Yao Ming New York Yankees Dan Marino Los Angeles Dodgers Drew Rosenhaus Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers Chicago White Sox International League Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XXIV Troy Aikman Super Bowl XXVII Oakland Raiders Denver Broncos Ricky Ray Baltimore Orioles Super Bowl XXIII Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl III Satchel Paige Super Bowl XXVI Pete Rose Wide receiver November 4 in baseball Joe Gibbs Super Bowl XI Boston Bruins United States Football League Toronto Argonauts Michael Jordan New York Knicks Indoor football Florida Marlins Super Bowl IX Houston Astros Orlando Magic Seattle Mariners Champ Car Doug Flutie Topps Super Bowl XXXI National Hockey League All-Star Game XFL Comparison of Canadian and American football Philadelphia Eagles Detroit Red Wings Donovan McNabb Match fixing American football strategy New York Mets Coach (sport) Green Bay Packers

do you think michael vick should lose his career in football and spend some time in jail if you support him pleeeease explain why dog fighting is the most cruelist thing you can do to an animal i personally believe he should be put in a dog fighting ring with a couple of these fighting dogs and let him see how it feels to be ripped apart by a dog i mean he actually killed some of his dogs when they didn't perform well how could you support him and if it was like peyton manning or cullpepper that got busted would you support them as well yes kd i think michael vick should lose his career in football i for one never want to look upon his face again i don't believe if by some bizarre miracle oj jury if he is found innocent any nfl team will sign him the outcry of the fans would be disastrous for any team who attempted to associate their franchise with the monster i do hope he does serve jail time but as with oj it's hard to predict what the outcome of the trial will be the evidence i have seen and read is enough for me i am capable of forming an opinion on my own one of his team mates ray buchanan has even said that michael vick is involved in dogfigting heavily and has been for a very long time ray said that vick tried to get his other team mates involved in it as well there are witnesses plus a co defendent willing to testify against him and i don't believe we know about all of the evidence they have against him i believe it is very likely that they have visual evidence as well i e cell phone pictures of him at a dog fight i agree with you anybody who could do this to an animal has to be a sadistic despicable human being dogs only want to love and please their owners how michael vick and his posse could betray this love by starving abusing torturing and murdering these poor dogs is beyond belief i am sure you have heard this but in case you haven't these guys didn't only abuse their own animals it is the practice of training pitbulls for fighting that they steal dogs out of neighborhoods out of back yards from 'free to a good home' ads to use as 'bait' for the training of the dogs they will throw a domesticated loved animal into a cage with the pitbull and let him tear the pet to shreds all of this is much too much for most of us to fathom it sickens me as michael vick at this juncture sickens me nike reebok the sports cards companies rawlings and sports authority here in atlanta have lawyers that work for them why do you think these companies decided to drop michael vick obviously because their attorneys have read the indictment and looked into the charges and feel that is it likely that michael vick will be convicted even the sclc who had announced that they would be 'honoring' vick at their next convention to show their support has changed their stance within one day of the announcement they cancelled the 'honor' event for him yes if peyton manning or cullpepper was busted for animal abuse i would condemn them as well contrary to what one of the posters said here white people do not generally determine a person's guilt or innocence due to skin color i was a fan of michael vick before this happened i am still a falcons fan i don't care if michael vick was purple if i didn't think the evidence against him was overwhelming i would have continued to support him anyone who doesn't see how the evidence has stacked up against him to determine his guilt is obviously delusional  Plame affair Michael Vick Mumia Abu-Jamal New York Giants Glen Jacobs 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Atlanta Falcons Dog O.

if vick get ban from the nfl do you think he will still be involved with dog fighting i hope not if he is guilty he should be ban from having or being near any animals what a sicko i don't think this is a stupid question kobe this has been my main concern in this entire ordeal to see to it that michael vick will never have the ability to do this to another animal money is the answer i hope his attorneys deplete his funds and the falcons find a clause where they can end his contract and not have to pay him another cent also there is a chance they may be able to force michael vick to repay some of the money they have already paid him i am hoping that arizona as it has been reported will charge him as well mostly for the purpose of forcing him to pay more attorney fees i hope he does some jail time but i believe it is essentially more important to get the money out of his hands if he doesn't have the funds he surely cannot run a dogfighting ring and also he wouldn't have the funds for betting on other dogfights i am with you on another point as well i hope part of his sentence is that he is never allowed to own another dog again  2005 trial of Michael Jackson Blackjack Evan Mecham Michael Vick NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Poker jargon Contract Plame affair Katelyn Faber Schabir Shaik Trial Match fixing Philadelphia Eagles George W.

how does college football work i don't understand how college football works how come last year ohio state played florida in the championship shouldn't they have played boise state and what are all the different divisions like pac and big east and stuff what do they have to do with anything i understand nfl and their playoffs and stuff but for some reason i can't quite understand college sadly it's all based on the opinions of sports writers and coaches and stats entered into bcs computers it considers things like strength of schedule that's why boise got robbed most schools are aligned with conferences and play a majority of their games against fellow conference members every year there are more conferences than there are divisions in the nfl because there are a lot more college teams than pro teams usually conference alignment is loosely based on geographic location more and more it's based on revenue for the schools conferences are expanding because ncaa rules state that a certain minimum of schools must belong to a conference in order for them to have a championship game the championship game of course brings extra to the conf which all teams share to some extent there are many who have advocated a playoff system in college but it hasn't happened yet mostly because the traditional powerhouse programs are against it  National Football League College football Playoff Big East Conference Atlantic Coast Conference College basketball Cincinnati Bengals Kansas City Chiefs Southeastern Conference Joe Paterno St. Louis Rams New York Giants Buffalo Bills University of Texas at Austin Miami Dolphins NFL playoffs American football Super Bowl American Football League San Francisco 49ers Jacksonville Jaguars Minnesota Vikings Cleveland Browns Arizona Cardinals Auburn University Detroit Lions Playoff format Carolina Panthers Dallas Cowboys NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Pacific Ten Conference Green Bay Packers National Football League Lore National Basketball Association San Diego Chargers NCAA Division I-A national football champions Indianapolis Colts Canadian Football League University of Florida Super Bowl XXVI Tulane University Sudden death Oakland Raiders Tennessee Titans Clemson University The Football League Atlanta Falcons Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXVI Big Ten Conference Super Bowl XXV Middle Tennessee State University National Football League championships USC Trojans Football Tampa Bay Buccaneers Philadelphia Eagles Arizona State University National Collegiate Athletic Association Rose Bowl (game) Boston College Athletics Super Bowl V World Football League Georgia Institute of Technology Super Bowl XXVII Monday Night Football New England Patriots Boise State University New Mexico Lobo Basketball Super Bowl III Florida State University BCS title game 2005 NFL season University of Houston West Virginia University University of Notre Dame Super Bowl IX AFL-NFL Merger Miami University Donovan McNabb Los Angeles Kings Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University University of Connecticut Houston Nutt Chicago Cubs Super Bowl XXIV University of San Francisco Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XIII Ben Roethlisberger

steelers fans what do you think about the new coach how do you think we will do this year and remember steelers rule i think he will do great he will also win coach of the year they will go and will make the playoffs this year if you consider everything that went wrong for them last year they only missed the playoffs by one game last year the steelers lost a few games just because of muffed punts but this year i expect them to have one of the best returners in the league with willie reid being healthy i also think several of their players will have a better year i expect ike taylor to have a breakout season i think he has talent and is becoming more skilled at the corner position i also expect lawernce timmons to play a big part in the steelers defensive with joey porter gone timmons will fill the role of a pass rushing linebacker very well ben roethlisberger is going to be better a quarterback this year he has had a full year to recover from his motorcycle accident ben also said that he usually takes months off in the off season but this year he said he only took weeks off this year this will make him a better quarterback and more resistant to injury the steelers second year players will really shine too santonio holmes will do great last year he showed flashes of greatness i also believe anthony smith will have a good year last year i did not think bill cowher did a good job coaching in all the years i could remember the steelers were always coached very well by cohwer they were always motivated and got very few penalties however last year was different they seemed sloppy and not very well coached however i am not saying that the new coach mike tomlin will be a big improvement his first year but he will not be a big drop off from what cowher was last year however one problem the steelers will have is their secondary there is no doubt that troy polamalu will have another pro bowl season but the other cornerbacks and safeties will have to make a big improvement i think tomlin will help these defensive backs tomlin was the defensive backs coach with the tampa bay buccaneers so my prediction for the steelers this year is this may be a very generous prediction if they make the playoffs anything can happen  National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVII Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXIV Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXVI Buffalo Bills Kansas City Chiefs September 2005 in sports National Football League Super Bowl XXIII San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XVIII American football Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl V American football strategy NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl III Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XII Jacksonville Jaguars Indianapolis Colts Glossary of American football Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXII Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XXXIX November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXI Brett Favre Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl I October 2005 in sports Tony Dungy Super Bowl XVII December 2004 in sports January 2005 in sports Super Bowl VI New York Knicks Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXVII Donovan McNabb San Diego Chargers Joe Gibbs Super Bowl XIX NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXXIII Boston Bruins NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Dan Marino Denver Broncos Running back NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Tampa Bay Lightning XFL Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl II Houston Rockets Super Bowl XXXII Indiana Pacers NFL playoffs, 1997-98 Green Bay Packers Monday Night Football Troy Aikman Terrell Owens Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXXVIII Defensive team American Football League Mario Lemieux

why do african american quaterbacks just get labled as running quaterback my point of view is that people like skip bayless on cold pizza cant accept that black qb's are multitalented and that they can throw but since that doesnt fall into the typical dropback passer mode that they are criticized i didnt know that in order to be looked at as a good qb you have to play the same as everyone else you know if whites had the ability to run ex i peyton manning could run whenever he is getting pressured he would do dat instead of running out of bounds i think its the stereotypes the owner's and gms who draft the quarterbacks have look at who owns all the nfl teams old white men coincidence i got this idea from the players who don't fit the stereotypes look at mike mcmahon he's faster than any qb except mike vick look it up but because he's white no one will give him credit he's always talked about as being surprisingly fast the surprise isn't like he got fast over the offseason all of a sudden because he's always been a great athlete the surprise is always that omg he's white any black qb with mcmahon's amount of talent would be given time to grow look at tarvaris jackson but since gms and owners see white quarterback they expect to see pocket passer quarterback so when guys like mcmahon fail to meet that stereotype they'll bounce around the league because they won't meet what gms imagine those players to be conversely look at a black qb byron leftwich who is a classic pocket passer no one will admit to him being a pocket passer however because he is black i've noticed that announcers scouts and others always note his lack of mobility when discussing him and they discount his game because of it what they don't admit is that leftwich runs about as well as any pocket qb and can scramble if need be sort of like tom brady's speed instead of focusing on his positives as a pocket qb they bemoan his inability to fit to their personal stereotypes of being a typical black qb i e your running qb i think its a few old idiots like skip bayless and others around his age like of the nfl owners and some of the gms again coincidence who keep these stereotypes going and now they've gotten into the collective unconscious of mainstream football fans so now its a common thing that all black qbs are supposed to be runners and all white qbs are supposed to be immobile personally i think if you can ball you can ball white black or green just bring your a game and lets stop the stereotypes  American football New England Patriots Quarterback Canadian football San Francisco 49ers National Football League Glossary of American football Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns Michael Vick Jacksonville Jaguars Tom Brady New York Giants Super Bowl I National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXXVI Passer rating Buffalo Bills American football strategy Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXXIV Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXVII Dan Marino Kansas City Chiefs Carolina Panthers Toronto Blue Jays Miami Dolphins Super Bowl V Super Bowl III Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Super Bowl IX Brett Favre American Football League Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XXIV Dallas Cowboys Peyton Manning Oakland Raiders September 2005 in sports Negro league baseball Reggie Jackson Super Bowl XIII Defensive team ESPN Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXII Vince McMahon Indianapolis Colts Kasparov versus The World Salary cap Volleyball Super Bowl XII Official (American football) Super Bowl XX Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl X Theory of conduct Super Bowl XVIII Major League Soccer Australian rules football Fast bowling Terrell Owens XFL Glen Jacobs Joe Namath New York Jets Tris Speaker Satchel Paige NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Minnesota Vikings Oakland Athletics Toronto Argonauts NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Paintball Detroit Tigers Billiards Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XVII Basketball Poker jargon January 2005 in sports French Defence Super Bowl VI Arena football

why is there no playoffs system for college football like they have in college basketball but college basketball seedings rankings are kinda weird too with the ncaa tournament considered the strength of schedule or whatever why can't both of these sports especially college football have a normal playoff system because the ncaa has not decided to put one in place the bcs was intended to at least help but it's turned out to be mainly a joke i think the real problem with a football playoff system is that it would add too many weeks to the season even if it was just the top teams you're talking about more weeks of games and if you did start a playoff with the top teams how do you select which teams go is it simply a matter of taking in the coach's poll or some other poll also i think a true playoff system would minimize all the bowl games and those bowl games are major money generators  Bowl Championship Series National Football League Playoff NCAA Division I-A national football champions Playoff format Texas Longhorn Athletics College basketball National Basketball Association College football Atlantic Coast Conference New York Giants Mack Brown Big East Conference Georgia Institute of Technology NFL playoffs Pittsburgh Steelers Tulane University Super Bowl Carolina Panthers USC Trojans Football New England Patriots University of Maryland, College Park Cleveland Browns John Calipari NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Major League Baseball television contracts Super Bowl XXVII Joe Paterno Sam Barry New Mexico Lobo Basketball Southeastern Conference World Football League Syracuse University Orange February 2005 in sports Sudden death University of Texas at Austin Minnesota Vikings University of Houston Arkansas Razorbacks December 2004 in sports Stanley Cup National Hockey League Oklahoma Sooners American Football League Norway national football team March 2005 in sports NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 University of Connecticut Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXI Kansas City Chiefs Football World Cup Women's National Basketball Association University of Arizona Michigan Wolverines Basketball BCS title game Cincinnati Bengals Arizona State University Auburn University American football Yao Ming National Football League championships Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Monday Night Football Match fixing New York Knicks Baseball Michael Jordan San Antonio Spurs Orlando Magic Single-elimination tournament Miami Dolphins Toronto Raptors Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium Luther Head Dan Marino Houston Nutt Boise State University Super Bowl V Chinese Basketball Association New Jersey Nets New York Jets Memorial Stadium, Clemson Washington State University Oakland Raiders University of Texas at Dallas Donovan McNabb Canadian Football League Indianapolis Colts Tournament January 2005 in sports NBA Finals August 2005 in sports June 2004 in sports

anyone else sick of the sec is the toughest football conference bs my theory is that since all the sec schools are so terrible at academics apparently all you need is middle school education to get in the football players do not have anything to study for and all they do is practice football yet the sec teams lose to usc all the time sick of it naaah i think it is entertaining how a majority of the fans of sec teams need some type of validation as if there is some magic formula to say so and so is the best conference or the toughest if you are a real college football fan you know there is no best conference like i said if they need to feel valid by saying such things go right ahead while the rest of the country enjoys the game of football for what it is  Southeastern Conference Bowl Championship Series National Football League Atlantic Coast Conference College basketball University of South Carolina Auburn University Pacific Ten Conference American football Second Houston Nutt Joe Paterno University of Alabama University of Notre Dame University of Arkansas USC Trojans Football Nick Saban University of Kentucky St. Louis Rams Big East Conference University of Southern California College football Orlando Magic Texas Longhorn Athletics Tulane University Buffalo Bills Georgia Institute of Technology Ivy League July 2005 in sports Sam Barry New York Giants New England Patriots Mack Brown Culture of the United States University of Florida The Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Miami Dolphins AFL-NFL Merger Pennsylvania State University Arkansas Razorbacks University of Mississippi Carolina Panthers New York Jets Newcastle United F.C.

why are football people so radical i like football but i don't understand why coaches and parents are so ultra serious when it's not that way with baseball basketball soccer and hockey my son is years old and he has to practice every day m f for hours each evening apparently if he chooses to play next year it's two times a day which amounts to about four to five hours of practice for a month before school starts i'm not putting down football i enjoy it our child loves it i just want to understand why it's so time consuming compared to other sports thanks football fans for taking the time to answer conditioning is the best way to avoid injury if your child wants to play a sport where collisions happen with regularity you shouldn't object to the practice time because it will actually make it less likely for your child to be hurt later  National Football League Playoff Baseball National Hockey League All-Star Game American football Football (soccer) Ultimate (sport) Sport Syracuse University Orange Sudden death Playoff format Overtime (sport) EA Sports World Football League National Basketball Association Los Angeles Clippers Culture of the United States Southeastern Conference Arkansas Razorbacks Ultras Rugby league in Australia Coach (sport) Topps Cranford, New Jersey Sports timeline Fox Broadcasting Company National pastime April 2005 in sports Football Texas Longhorn Athletics Breastfeeding University of Houston Cincinnati Bengals Salary cap Major League Baseball television contracts Big East Conference Canadian Football League University of Maryland, College Park Arena football Miami University University of Minnesota University of Notre Dame Theory of conduct Australian rules football Texas A&M University Major professional sports league Violence in sports WFAN (AM) Sports in Puerto Rico Mickey Mantle Toronto Argonauts Daylight saving time Sandy Koufax Associated Press Athlete of the Year November 2004 in sports Terrell Owens Ice hockey Social rule Draft (sports) Sport in Ireland The Sporting News Hockey Night in Canada Hooliganism Middle Tennessee State University Atlantic Coast Conference Field hockey Sports betting July 2005 in sports Cleveland Browns University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Boston College Athletics West Virginia University Gaelic football National Hockey League Major League Soccer University of Miami Gambling Ball Baltimore, Maryland Stanley Cup Norway national football team Relegation Canadian Interuniversity Sport Ben Johnson (athlete) Marathon (sport) Tulane University Sam Barry Michael Jordan Gaelic Athletic Association Georgia Institute of Technology Stadium Baylor University Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Indiana State University Dorama Los Angeles Kings College football Sports Illustrated

mike tomlin do you think he can bring the steelers back to the super bowl i think he can they will go and will make the playoffs this year if you consider everything that went wrong for them last year they only missed the playoffs by one game last year the steelers lost a few games just because of muffed punts but this year i expect them to have one of the best returners in the league with willie reid being healthy i also think several of their players will have a better year i expect ike taylor to have a breakout season i think he has talent and is becoming more skilled at the corner position i also expect lawernce timmons to play a big part in the steelers defensive with joey porter gone timmons will fill the role of a pass rushing linebacker very well ben roethlisberger is going to be better a quarterback this year he has had a full year to recover from his motorcycle accident ben also said that he usually takes months off in the off season but this year he said he only took weeks off this year this will make him a better quarterback and more resistant to injury the steelers second year players will really shine too santonio holmes will do great last year he showed flashes of greatness i also believe anthony smith will have a good year last year i did not think bill cowher did a good job coaching in all the years i could remember the steelers were always coached very well by cohwer they were always motivated and got very few penalties however last year was different they seemed sloppy and not very well coached however i am not saying that the new coach mike tomlin will be a big improvement his first year but he will not be a big drop off from what cowher was last year however one problem the steelers will have is their secondary there is no doubt that troy polamalu will have another pro bowl season but the other cornerbacks and safeties will have to make a big improvement i think tomlin will help these defensive backs tomlin was the defensive backs coach with the tampa bay buccaneers so my prediction for the steelers this year is this may be a very generous prediction if they make the playoffs anything can happen  Super Bowl XXIV Miami Dolphins National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXV St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XI National Football League Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl V September 2005 in sports Super Bowl III Minnesota Vikings Philadelphia Eagles American football strategy Super Bowl VII American football Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XII Jacksonville Jaguars Indianapolis Colts NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Bill Cowher Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl I Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XVII Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XXX Brett Favre Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXXVII October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XIX Tony Dungy Super Bowl XXXIII November 2004 in sports Joe Gibbs December 2004 in sports Toronto Raptors January 2005 in sports Dan Marino Donovan McNabb Tennessee Titans NFL playoffs, 2003-04 San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXXII Denver Broncos NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl II NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXXVIII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Running back Monday Night Football New York Knicks Boston Bruins Green Bay Packers Washington Redskins NFL playoffs, 1997-98 XFL Terrell Owens Houston Rockets Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl IV American Football League Warren Sapp Troy Aikman Defensive team Tampa Bay Lightning

cleveland finally signs brady quinn what are your thoughts i'm actually glad to see it happen i know a lot of people bash brady but i think he will turn out to be a very good qb in college he had his ups and downs but seems like a hard worker and is a smart dude i didn't actually agree with the holdout i think if you get drafted that low you should take the money and prove yourself to get more but hey he's in at least so tell me your thoughts on the mighty quinn good or bad everybody has their own opinion i like the fella actually he has a chip on his shoulder and a lot to prove what do you think they signed him for years million dollars mill gauranteed it could turn into mill over time i'm not saying brady by himself will save the browns but they do have winslow at te and baylor at wr plus joe thomas if jamal lewis can somewhat resemble himself they will be decent but it will take time first of all a player without a contract cannot be a holdout that tag is reserved for players refusing to report with a deal in place that misnomer just bugs me because it represents him as something he is not let's not forget you can't pick the team that drafts you so why not get the best deal possible at least we normal folk can shop ourselves around if we have something to offer i think that it is a good thing for both team and player the browns have someone who they can now build around and brady is happy and can get down to business how good will he be who knows but i am looking forward to finding out  Los Angeles Clippers New York Knicks New York Giants American Football League Detroit Red Wings Buffalo Bills Aston Villa F.C.

bears offense part the addition of hester and olsen two of the fastest players at their respective positions in the nfl gives the bears offense quick strike capability they have speed everywhere said safety mike brown that s the one thing that jumps out at me the receiving corps has a lot of speed and greg olsen and devin hester add a new dimension to our offense they cause match up problems that s the biggest thing hester has electrified the crowd in training camp displaying great hands blazing speed and a knack for making big plays he s a special player everyone knows that brown said the goal is to score points and whenever he has the ball in his hands there s a good opportunity he s going to score you want to have the ball in his hands as many times as possible because he s the type of guy who can score whenever he gets it it really does hlp our team and hester can score whenever he gets his hands on the ball but we need offensive consistancy and i think this unit is going to give us consistancy lsuballs shut up last time i checked it was sexy rexy in the big game plus at least my secondary doesn't let receivers catch td's in the endzone while rolling with defenders right in front of them watch us humilate your team this season again trying to be optimistic  Volleyball American football strategy American football National Football League Lore Norway national football team New York Giants Super Bowl IX Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXI Water polo Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXVI Table tennis Softball Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XIII Carolina Panthers St. Louis Rams National Football League San Francisco 49ers Paintball Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXVI Comparison of Canadian and American football Fast bowling Football (soccer) Baseball Canadian football Super Bowl XXIV Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl III Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl V Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XX Offensive team Team Fortress Classic Billiards Rugby union 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXXVIII Snooker Cricket Rugby league Running back Indianapolis Colts Wide receiver Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Super Bowl XXXIII Australian rules football Ice hockey Super Bowl XI Pinball Super Bowl XXXIX Batting (cricket) Fielding (cricket) Super Bowl VII Laws of cricket Super Bowl XII Ravi Shastri Super Bowl XVI Tennessee Titans Minnesota Vikings Tennis Dog agility Super Bowl XIX English cricket team 2005 NFL season Baseball statistics Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XV Shogi Satchel Paige Super Bowl XXXI Poker jargon Hurling NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Extreme Programming Ty Cobb Super Bowl XXXII Quarterback Iron Bowl World Series Philadelphia Eagles Blitzball

who is going to win the super bowl this year and why i dont think the patriots have a chance this year i reserve the right to change my opinion once i actually see some preseason games i like the cowboys to win this year if their defense hadn't decided to crumble down the stretch they easily could have had home field through the playoffs and been the nfc's super bowl representative and they already beat indy once so i do believe they could have done so again they didn't add many great pieces but they didn't need to they addressed the glaring safety need they had and they signed a good backup qb they had a very productive draft where they essentially traded a couple of second round picks for next years browns st round pick and they got a very good pass rusher to compliment their already stacked linebacker core  Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII New England Patriots Dallas Cowboys Cleveland Browns Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXI San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl V Super Bowl VII Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl XXV Miami Dolphins National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XIII New York Jets Super Bowl XV Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XVII Cincinnati Bengals St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl I Cris Carter Super Bowl XIX Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XVIII NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XX Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXXIX Washington Redskins NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Brett Favre Super Bowl XXX Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs Super Bowl XXVIII Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXIII Robert F.

why do you think vick came out saying he was innocent didn't he think all the evidence would eventually come out because if he pleas guilty or accepts a plea deal he knows his nfl career would be over i suspect he and his attorneys are counting on getting an 'oj' jury whereas the evidence won't matter they will find him innocent regardless this may happen but i do believe that he is done in the nfl whether he is found guilty or not if any nfl team puts him on the field he will be boo'd so loudly that he won't be able to handle the pressure look how he handled a few boo's in atlanta the finger i doubt seriously that michael vick has the moral or mental fortitude to perform well under that kind of pressure  Plea bargain Michael Vick 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Atlanta Falcons New York Giants Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Burden of proof Jury trial National Football League Adversarial system NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Randy Moss Passer rating Insanity defense Madden NFL January 2005 in sports Jury Quarterback American Football League Plame affair timeline Washington Redskins Cincinnati Bengals Plame affair Chicago Cubs Gary Ridgway New England Patriots Darrell Waltrip Baltimore Ravens San Francisco 49ers United States Football League Ronnie Earle Brett Favre December 2004 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Capital punishment Guilt Presumption of innocence Super Bowl XXXIX Charles Graner Glen Jacobs O.

why is football american called football they rarely use there feet why do they called football and why did they steal it from football soccer the real football american football or football as we know it in america is a made up sport like any other i think partly they appropiated the word because it would be easier to sell the sport to people when the league had barely begun they called it american football because the game in several ways resembles rugby which is an english and australian sport so they wanted to differentiate themselves from those images while at the same time borrowing and exploiting the similarities of american football to rugby it was smart marketing the game itself is perfect for marketing purposes there are several well timed breaks for tv commercials every quarter also i like that one explanation where we learn that football was a name given to any sport that involved the use of foot and feet however that makes no sense when it comes to gaelic football since gaelic football is played with a tiny ball being carried on a flat paddle like stick it is almost like lacrosse except that the ball is smaller and the area where you rest it on the paddle like stick is flat and much smaller so the rationale that all sports involving feet and ball are called football doesnt apply to the gaelic football example it does bring up the possibility that football is really a name that has been freely used to name a lot of sports for a variety of reasons  American football Football Football (soccer) Australian rules football Gaelic football Rugby football Rugby league Baseball Rugby union Canadian football Hurling Lacrosse Gaelic Athletic Association Football (ball) Rugby union positions Sport Table tennis National pastime Playoff Major League Soccer Softball Scotland Glossary of American football Water polo Rugby league in Australia Professional sports Tennis Mouse (computing) New Zealand English Marching band History of rugby league Arena football Indoor football All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Major professional sports league The Football League Melbourne Cricket Ground Ball Canadian Football League Hat-trick Sport in the United Kingdom EA Sports Origins of baseball Sydney Football in the United Kingdom Whitewater Cheerleading History of rugby union Fast bowling Snooker International rules football Spanking Football culture Hazing Sudden death Sport in Ireland Billiards Super League (Australia) National Rugby League Atlantic Coast Conference Super Bowl Bobby Charlton Poker jargon State of Origin Rugby league in England IBM PC compatible Football (soccer) positions History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) New York Giants Roller hockey Drop kick Ultimate (sport) Goalkeeper Scrum (rugby) Theodicy Croke Park Paintball Manual transmission Tackle (football) Eskrima Badminton Equine conformation Ulster Kayak

what did terrel owens do why do some people hate him so much i think the biggest reason is because of what happened in phily he demanded a new contract and phily said 'no way ' phily never renegotiates contracts and never will the whole reason to wanted out of sf was to get more money he produced great stats his first year at phily and wanted to be paid for what he did so there was tension to instead of holding out did the opposite he showed up he promised that he'd be trouble for them all year if they didn't give him a new contract if he would have held out he would have lost money i think he stayed out of camp for a little while doing situps for the press or that might have been after phily suspended him anyways all year he was a distraction and picked on mcnabb and reid and kind of did his own thing eventually phily had enough and suspended him and then eventually traded him i must admit that i'm suprised that it was the cowboys who picked him up and that cowboy fans love him i guess they easily forget the spiking of the star years ago  Terrell Owens New England Patriots EastEnders Philadelphia Eagles San Francisco 49ers Dallas Cowboys The Emancipation of Mimi Cowboy Bebop Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XXXIX Donovan McNabb Satchel Paige Montreal Screwjob Wheel of Fortune New York Knicks Los Angeles Kings Marilyn Monroe Drew Rosenhaus Big Brother (USA TV series) TLC Rush Limbaugh Los Angeles Clippers The Supremes Game show Poker jargon Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) Contract Marcus Licinius Crassus Major League Baseball television contracts Denis Law StarCraft Episode VI Marvin Gaye Pitaten Characters of Lost Fox Broadcasting Company World Championship Wrestling The Contender (television series) Money Andy Reid Toronto Raptors Wyatt Earp Houston Rockets Eddie Guerrero Waylon Jennings Deflation (economics) Leon White Pittsburgh Steelers Babe Ruth Fancy Crane Reserve clause Tris Speaker Inflation Minnesota Timberwolves Rugrats Humphrey Bogart Negima History of baseball in the United States American individualist anarchism Howard Stern Leeds United F.C.

will the ravens be real super bowl contenders if it wasnt for their offense sucking last year in the playoffs i think they had it all for another super bowl now with a running back that can get a little better than yards a carry do you think the offense can at least give a little bit of support i think they have what you need to win so lets hear it ravens fans i think mcgahee will make the ravens better offensively he should be more effective than jamal lewis was last season all though at times he did still help the ravens my only worry is that how often will mcnair go deep that seems to have hindered the ravens offensive attack at points during last season they had limited times where they stretched the feild on the deep ball and i don't think that forced as much respect out of opposing defenses as it could have mcnair tourched kc on a deep pass to mark clayton that in turn went to the house in kc otherwise he's very effective i think for the ravens to succeed they are going to have to create a real balance on the offensive ball like new england has and guess what so does indy effective enough guess what the ravens where the first road team in kansas city that won in december since i believe rk i disagree the ravens may have mouthed off at the steelers after their superbowl season and i admit that it came back to haunt them however i fail to see where the raevns since then have taken any cheap shots at the steelers since then the ravens last season beat the steelers to the likes of what is highly unlikely for any team vs any divisional rival to the likes of a combined score amongst the two games of you don't hear any animosity from the steelers about the way the ravens played during the games do you and ray lewis the first name to come to minds of all most any fan when you mention the world ravens shook the hand of steelers coach bill cohwer out of respect so where is the disrepect there where where the ravens boasting about their victories in the press after the game the ravens showed no ill will towards the colts even after getting beaten in their own house the persona of someone who is stuck up is likely to whine after getting beaten  Super Bowl XIV Buffalo Bills Super Bowl IX Miami Dolphins New York Jets Super Bowl XXXV New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl X Super Bowl XIII Indianapolis Colts Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XIX San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl V Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXIX NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXVI Tennessee Titans Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXVIII NFL playoffs, 2002-03 American Football League September 2005 in sports American football strategy Donovan McNabb Super Bowl VII American football Super Bowl XVII Tom Brady National Football League Super Bowl XXXIII January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXI Running back November 2004 in sports December 2004 in sports Washington Redskins October 2004 in sports Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl II New York Knicks Dan Marino Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XX Ben Roethlisberger San Diego Chargers Baseball Super Bowl XV Minnesota Vikings Los Angeles Kings Joe Gibbs Oakland Raiders Iron Bowl Super Bowl XXX Glossary of American football Terrell Owens Cricket Super Bowl XXXVII Brett Favre Super Bowl IV Chicago White Sox Cris Carter Professional American football championship games Super Bowl XXXII NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Super Bowl VIII 2005 English cricket season World Series Green Bay Packers AFC Central Brian Billick Reggie Jackson

why is this scalping why is it that selling tickets on line through stubhub and ticketsnow is legitimate but someone selling tickets at the stadium that would otherwise go unused is scalping according to wikipedia's gnu licensed text individuals who genuinely wish to attend a popular event may find themselves unable to get tickets as they have already been sold to ticket resellers this practice enables the ticket resellers to sell the tickets at market value with no effective loss because they had no intention of attending the event in the first place resellers argue that there is a fine line between the individuals who genuinely wish to attend a popular event and decide to sell on their tickets later and those that buy tickets in large quantities in order to resell their tickets for a hefty profit the practice of reselling tickets may be defended on free market principles although some countries have outlawed the unauthorized resale of tickets usually with exceptions where the reseller doesn't profit from the transaction  Microeconomics Price discrimination Arbitrage Copyright Scalping Copyright infringement of software Capitalism Day trading Digital rights management Grey market Fair use Islamic banking Privatization Surveillance Live 8 SCO v.

took a hit to the chest while playing football still feeling the injury about a year ago i took a hit to the chest during football practice it did not hurt then but it hurts when i bench press do push ups and even when i sneeze what is it and what do i do to rehab it i can't really answer your question but i can relate a personal experience to you that might shed some light on your situation years ago i was doing some demolition on an old house and i accidentally whacked myself in the chest with a pry bar i had been working for a long while and i was tired and frustrated and levered the pry bar towards myself even though i knew it was a bad idea as it broke free it came back and bashed my body apparently i ended up with a hairline fracture in a rib this injury hurt me for at least two years like you said every time i would do something that would put stress on the area even something as seemingly innocuous as sneezing i would experience pain whenever i would begin to think it was finally healed something else would set it off again you have probably injured a rib possibly near the attachment point where ligaments attach your ribs to your sternum there is nothing you can do to speed the healing process except to try to avoid re injuring the area eventually the area will heal and the pain will be a thing of the past as i said it hurt me for at least years and i was young and healthy with a good ability to recover from injuries a physician told me that i constantly reawakened the pain because i was continually reinjuring the area he said that the only prescription for a rib injury other than ice and a pressure bandage in the first week or so immediately following the initial injury was rest  Equine conformation Sternum Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Leon White Weight training Rib Carpal tunnel syndrome Traumatic brain injury First aid Professional wrestling holds Anterior cruciate ligament Spanking Crash test dummy Breastfeeding Brian Close Dead Like Me Alexander Technique Hip fracture Kain (Legacy of Kain) Wound Babe Ruth Scientology beliefs and practices Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Aerial (dance move) Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan Bruise Reflexology The Death Gate Cycle Eddie Guerrero Wild ARMs 2 A Course In Miracles EastEnders The Contender (television series) Narcissism Transactional analysis Football (soccer) Orthopedic surgery Drowning Massage Rei Ayanami Triage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Green Goblin Knife Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Socrates 1957 World Series One Tree Hill (TV series) Simone Weil Marathon (sport) Traditional Chinese medicine Common cold Stuttering Milton H.

who is the highest nfl draft pick to never sign a contract i was looking at a number of the hold outs on contracts and many of the players have waited until the start of the season but the first round picks always seem to eventually sign i was wondering if there were any st rounder picks that did not sign if they don't sign with the team that drafted them what does the team get in compensation can the player be drafted again by another team i think to need to clarify a bit bo jackson's and charlie ward would both qualify drafted but did not sign that year eli manning does not since he did sign that year with his rights being traded and the team he was drafted by being compensated i just checked ward was not drafted in the first round which is why he chose to go into the nba instead of play for the nfl bo jackson as pick overall appears to be the best answer bo jackson was selected overall in by the tampa bay buccaneers he never signed with the bucs instead chosing to play baseball for the royals he did go back into the draft in where the raiders got him in the th round  Oakland Raiders National Football League New York Knicks New England Patriots New York Jets Reggie Jackson New York Giants NFL Draft San Francisco 49ers Ryan Leaf Reserve clause Chicago Bulls Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Raptors NBA Draft NFL playoffs, 2002-03 American Football League Jon Gruden Baltimore Ravens Brett Favre Los Angeles Clippers Steve Young (athlete) Minor league baseball World Series San Antonio Spurs Continental Basketball Association Portland Trail Blazers Jerry Rice Cleveland Browns Orlando Magic Super Bowl National Basketball Association St. Louis Rams Steve Nash Warren Sapp United States Football League Salary cap January 2005 in sports National Football League Lore Minnesota Vikings Detroit Lions Minnesota Timberwolves 2004-05 NHL lockout Super Bowl XXXVII Chicago White Sox Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXVII Vinny Testaverde Carnell Williams Trent Dilfer Major League Baseball Bo Jackson June 2004 in sports September 2005 in sports Dallas Cowboys Eli Manning Jacksonville Jaguars Damon Allen Los Angeles Kings AFL-NFL Merger December 2004 in sports Kansas City Chiefs Peyton Manning Utah Jazz Houston Rockets San Francisco Giants Cleveland Cavaliers Warrick Dunn John Elway Yao Ming Miami Dolphins LeBron James Major League Baseball television contracts NBA Draft Lottery Washington Redskins Illinois Fighting Illini Troy Glaus NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Randy Moss Memphis Grizzlies Satchel Paige Rich Gannon Wheel of Fortune

challenges in preseason i honetly think the challenges shouldnt be done in the first preseason games just wanted some input from others preseason doesnt matter in wins or losses i just feel that the challenges drag on forever in a meaningless game where do you stand on this i disagree challenges since they are a part of the game need to be practiced as well the clock ticks the same way in preseason just as it does in regular season the referees officiate the games the coaches call plays and the players play everyone involved needs the work practice everyone needs to be sharp as far as the challenges go coaches and refs alike need to get use to the challenge system regardless of the role practice or procedure they all can be improved upon provided they are practiced rehearsed again and again another reason coaches need to practice challenges is so that they are familiar with the system in regards to the proper time and plays to challenge and how to manage their challenges properly how many times have we either seen the coach fail to make the challenge in time how many times have the guys upstairs fail to advise the coach to make the challenge how many times has it taken the ref mins to make a determination after going to the video how many times have we seen the calls blown trust me they need to practice this  New England Patriots Stanley Cup National Football League Ice hockey Baseball Appeal Cleveland Browns Instant replay St. Louis Rams Bowl Championship Series Jacksonville Jaguars 2005 NFL season Judicial functions of the House of Lords Game programmer Exhibition game New York Giants Los Angeles Kings Dance Dance Revolution Overclocking Wayne Gretzky USC Trojans Football Judicial review American football Alex Ferguson West Bromwich Albion F.C.

what is the toughest conference in college football i would say the sec it has some of the best defenses in the game and great offenses too i like the university of south carolina they finished fourth in the sec east last year and look at the game against florida they lost by one point then florida goes and blows out the next best team so by scores the fourth best team in the sec east could have won the national championship that is what i say tell me who you think has the toughtest conference and give me your argument to all of you who say that the sec hasnt won many national titles this is why the sec has the hardest teams to play inside of it it is hard to win every single game like the other conferences can because they only have one or two good teams even the small teams like vanderbilt and kentucky have pontential to be florida lsu arkansas and others this is a tough one but i agree with the sec statement the league usually has six or seven teams every year who can win the sec title with two or three of those having national title potential the road schedule can be brutal lsu had to go on the road to arkansas tennesee auburn and florida in the same year not too many people have whole schedules that difficult and you can't take a week off even against lightweights like vanderbilt and miss st sec has claimed nat titles in years had a record in bowl games last year and leads the nation in attendance the only complaint that i have is that they barely travel to play top teams in the other leauges out of conference acc  Bowl Championship Series Atlantic Coast Conference NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Arkansas Razorbacks Iron Bowl Houston Nutt Big East Conference Cincinnati Bengals College football National Football League New York Giants Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXXVI Playoff Auburn University Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXIV 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Super Bowl XXV New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns International League Super Bowl XXI NBA Finals Boston College Athletics Bear Bryant Super Bowl V Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XVIII Buffalo Bills Nick Saban New York Jets Super Bowl XXXVIII Florida Marlins University of Florida College rivalry USC Trojans Football Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XI Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXVI College basketball Super Bowl XIV Steve Spurrier Tennessee Titans The Football League Joe Paterno Chicago Bulls Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XXXV Kansas City Chiefs Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXII American Football League Super Bowl IX January 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports Indiana Pacers St. Louis Rams Super Bowl Donovan McNabb 2005 NBA Finals Super Bowl XIX October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XVII American football Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXVIII Detroit Tigers Water polo Jacksonville Jaguars Mario Lemieux Baltimore Ravens Miami Hurricanes Football Tennessee Pete Sampras Bundesliga (football) University of Kentucky University of Alabama Joe Gibbs Alex Ferguson Hayden Fry University of Arkansas Pete Rose Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Playoff format

dolphins fans how do you feel about losing a home game to london this year i'm not a dolphins fan i'm an eagles fan but i'm curious how you guys feel i mean as taxpayers the whole country i mean we rightfully have paid for those home games to be possible because that money has gone into building the stadiums so when a home game gets canned for an overseas game i wouldn't be happy about that if it were my team which is why i'm not huge on trying to make overseas games every year what are your thoughts london should have an american style football team they should make a new division in the nfl i guess two one for eatch conference they would be named the london woodpigeons ha ha  Super Bowl National Football League Kansas City Chiefs Pittsburgh Steelers Minnesota Vikings New Orleans Saints Cleveland Browns Baltimore Ravens San Diego Chargers Buffalo Bills Carolina Panthers New York Jets Cincinnati Bengals New York Giants Atlanta Falcons New England Patriots Indianapolis Colts Jacksonville Jaguars NFL on television Dallas Cowboys National Football League Lore Philadelphia Eagles Tennessee Titans Arizona Cardinals St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIX Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXVII Tampa Bay Buccaneers Major League Soccer Dolphins Stadium NFL playoffs 2005 NFL season San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXXIX Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXVI AFL-NFL Merger Super Bowl VIII Super Bowl XXXI Washington Redskins Major League Baseball television contracts Super Bowl XXIV Canadian Football League Super Bowl VII Green Bay Packers College football Hubert H.

im looking for a favorite nfl team to root for in the nfl i live in ny but i dont like the giants but maybe the jets im a football fan but i dont know what team to root for i used to love the falcons b c of m vick but the dogfightin thing really got me away i really like chad johnson and the bengals and the baltimore ravens can u please help me with this decision perhaps what you should do is look at each division and see if there are any teams that you like based on what their outlook is for this season or the near future and go from there not to knock anyone here but if you start looking for opinions on who to root for most people are going to tell you to root for who they like which may lead to getting some biased opinions vs reviewing the teams for yourself with an unbiased perspective example walk in a sports bar in baltimore and ask which team should i root for what answer do you expect walk into a sports bar in denver ask the same question and what answer do you expect most people are going to tell you to root for whoever they like i would tell you to root for the baltimore ravens but i think you are better off revising what you all ready know about the teams in the league and make up your own mind all though since you seem to be luke warm to the jets i wonder why not just go with one of the ny hometeams that will give you at least opportunities a season attend a live game  New York Jets New York Giants Super Bowl Baltimore Ravens Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers New England Patriots Buffalo Bills National Football League Philadelphia Eagles Michael Vick September 2005 in sports Indianapolis Colts Miami Dolphins San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers Professional American football championship games Jacksonville Jaguars Kansas City Chiefs Madden NFL Super Bowl XXXV January 2005 in sports Super Bowl V Terrell Owens Canadian Football League Washington Redskins Atlanta Falcons NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl III New Orleans Saints Brett Favre November 2004 in sports AFL-NFL Merger Monday Night Football St. Louis Rams NFL playoffs Pro Football Hall of Fame Super Bowl XII United States Football League Denver Broncos Dallas Cowboys Cris Carter New York Mets National Football League championships NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXI Running back Joe Namath Super Bowl XXV World Series Super Bowl XXVII Montreal Alouettes Sandy Koufax AFC Central Super Bowl XIX New York Yankees Tampa Bay Buccaneers Major League Baseball television contracts Detroit Lions Playoff Super Bowl IV Super Bowl XIV John Elway Minnesota Vikings Oakland Raiders San Antonio Spurs College football American football Super Bowl XXXI International League Super Bowl XIII Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox Satchel Paige San Diego Chargers The NFL Today Ricky Ray National Basketball Association Super Bowl XXIV Baltimore Orioles Chad Johnson Detroit Tigers World Football League Atlanta Braves Negro league baseball

if i play saftey what are my responsibilitys i have played there before but just breifly can you explain to me what i have to do now not to knock you or anything but how exactly did you play the safety spot before yet somehow not remeber what your job is i used to play line backer years ago and i still know my job and yours yet never played safety if you really want to do your job well you need to know what everyone elses job is in addition to what yours is a safety in general is the last line of defense against the offese so they need to be better tacklers than a cb needs to be often times fs and ss are known for being big hitters ed reed roy williams ronnie lott ken houston larry wilson etc as far as what your job is it depends on the play calling and formations you could be double covering a wr with your cb the whole game if the te shifts to your side and your in man you may have to cover him if your expecting a run you might cheat up some to help with run cover support etc sometimes instead of the safeties dividing up their jobs in terms of run support and pass support the safeties will divide up the field into a left half and a right half and each will be responsible for anything that comes into his half of the field we call that a cover as far as a free safety is concerned his job tends to be to stay back a bit watch the play unfold and follow the ball and not get caught cheating up the number one reason yard pass plays happen is because the fs got caught cheating up or too much to one side a good qb will read this real quick and torch you for on pass plays the free safety is supposed to close near the receiver by the time the ball gets to him offenses tend to call play action passes specifically to draw the free safety closer to the line to stop a long run if the offense puts a receiver in the slot then the free safety may be called upon to cover that receiver as far as a strong safety is concerned he is tasked to handle the strong side of the offense the side where the tight end lines up the strong safety tends to play closer to the line and assist in stopping the run he may also be responsible for covering a player such as a running back or fullback or h back who goes in motion in the backfield and then out for a pass strong safeties occasionally blitz as well so the cliffs notes know how to hit wrap and tackle dont get caught cheating up or to one side too much because a good qb will spot it and use it know everyone elses job it makes yours easier  Rugby union positions Volleyball Pittsburgh Steelers Running back Offensive team Defensive team Baseball New York Giants Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl IX Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XVI National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XIV Football (soccer) positions Quarterback Wide receiver San Francisco 49ers Lineman (football) Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXIII Rugby league positions Snooker New England Patriots Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XIX Softball Poker jargon Fast bowling Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XII Rugby union Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVIII Field hockey Football (soccer) Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXIII Cricket Buffalo Bills 1957 World Series Rugby league Fielding (cricket) Batting (cricket) Glossary of partner dance terms National Football League Super Bowl XXXVIII Table tennis Paintball Tris Speaker Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fullback Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl VIII New York Jets Iron Bowl Super Bowl VII NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Ultimate (sport) History of Test cricket (to 1883) Swingout Baseball scorekeeping Tight end 2005 World Series Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXVIII GunBound Arena football Chess terminology Laws of cricket Contract bridge Official (American football) Boston Red Sox Snap (American football) World Series Super Bowl II

jersey numbers did they just allow the nfl wr's to wear single didget 's on their jersey well all u guys r sayin no but how come the browns and the cheifs both have recievers that have single digit jerseys wrs are required to wear or the reason some wrs are currently wearing single digit numbers is because it is the preseason and they are able to wear them since there are limited numbers available until their correct numbers become available after other players are cut assuming they aren't the ones that are cut currently randy moss is wearing but he will have to switch once the rosters are reduced down to players here are all the required number combinations for each position quarterbacks placekickers and punters wide receivers and running backs and defensive backs offensive linemen linebackers and defensive linemen and tight ends or if all are taken all numbers are based on a player's primary position and they can move to another other position during the game if a player wearing comes into the game as an eligible receiver they must inform the referee that they are going to be an ineligible number playing an eligible position so that they don't get flagged for illegal touching if they are given the ball during the play some players have tried to petition to have different numbers usually their college numbers but nobody has been successful last year reggie bush tried to get but his petition was refused  Glossary of American football American football Super Bowl X Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Wide receiver National Football League Lore Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVI Offensive team New England Patriots American football strategy Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl IX Defensive team Super Bowl XXIII Canadian football Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XIII Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIX Lineman (football) Super Bowl XII San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XVIII Quarterback Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XI Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl VII Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXXVIII Randy Moss Super Bowl XXXI American Football League All-Time Team Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl I Running back 2005 NFL season Official (American football) Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XX Volleyball Comparison of Canadian and American football Miami Hurricanes Football Jacksonville Jaguars St. Louis Rams New York Jets Buffalo Bills Baseball NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXV Oakland Raiders Clemson University Michael Vick Softball Tight end Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl Baltimore Ravens Snooker Arena football Tony Dungy Joe Paterno San Diego Chargers Punt (football) Rugby union positions Basketball Super Bowl XXXIX American Football League NFL Draft Philadelphia Eagles Table tennis Jerry Rice Terrell Owens NFL Most Valuable Player Award Joe Gibbs Water polo 1973 NFL season Washington Redskins Madden NFL Denver Broncos

college football vs cfl who do you think would win in a game one of the best college team michigan usc florida etc or the worst cfl team i dunno normally i would say pros like in any ncaa team vs nfl team however the cfl is a different situation the cfl has a mandatory roster requirement for canadians players that did not play college football in america they may have played football in canada but honestly canada is not known as a hotbed of football talent true they do have american players on cfl teams but they are all players who weren't good enough for the nfl i think an ncaa team vs cfl team would be a lot closer matchup than ncaa team vs nfl team would be but a lot of that would depend on whose rules you play by if you play using cfl rules obviously the cfl team has a distinct advantage its their game however if you played ncaa rules i don't know if a cfl team would have the same overall skill advantage an nfl team would have i think a game played under ncaa football rules might tip the scales in favor of a really good ncaa team because of the inexperience of the canadian players in the american college football style for example canadian players most likely have never had to play against the option for instance and wouldn't be sure how to defend it properly while an nfl player that played in college might have  Canadian Football League Comparison of Canadian and American football Canadian football National Football League Major professional sports league American Football League Salary cap Doug Flutie College football Damon Allen Toronto Argonauts Ricky Ray Glossary of American football Kansas City Chiefs Playoff Cincinnati Bengals Montreal Alouettes Joe Paterno Rugby football Jacksonville Jaguars Tennessee Titans World Football League New York Giants Cleveland Browns Passer rating Pittsburgh Steelers Basketball Warren Moon NFL Draft Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXVII 2005 NFL season Football (soccer) Exhibition game Super Bowl XXIII American football strategy Sudden death Lacrosse Denver Broncos Indianapolis Colts Ice hockey XFL Super Bowl Canadian Football League West Division Major League Soccer Detroit Lions Nick Saban West Virginia University New York Jets Arizona State University Volleyball St. Louis Rams United States Football League Dallas Cowboys History of American football Jerry Rice National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXIII Oakland Raiders Steve Nash Tampa Bay Buccaneers Arena football Syracuse University Orange Grey Cup Mack Brown Playoff format Pro Bowl Clemson University 2002 CFL season Baltimore Ravens Minor league baseball Deion Sanders Marv Levy Randy Moss Arizona Cardinals Hubert H.

cleveland browns i would like to hear some opinions on this team they have some sound weapons on offense in braylon edwards and winslow i think jamal lewis has had it and quinn wont be ready to run the offense though i am a lifelong browns fan i dont see them winning more then or games this year is brady quinn finally the qb of the future for this team injuries are starting to hurt them again this year amidst some more bad luck what are your thoughts you sir are a fair minded realistic browns fan and that seems to be fairly rare judging from what other people write about the browns on here i agree with your assessments of lewis edwards and winslow i also agree with your prediction for their record this season i think it's too early to judge about quinn so i'm not even going to try the browns gave up a lot to get him seeing as that pick they gave to the cowboys is going to be a top pick so i hope for their sake that he pans out the browns have the misfortune of playing in the toughest division in the league right now i think they are at least seasons away from putting together a team that has a shot at a playoff spot they have some good young talent on offense that could turn them into an offensive power soon once they pick up some talent on defense and some more talent at rb they could be looking at a good playoff run but i don't think this will happen for at least years also i think they'll have to lose crennel as coach because he just doesn't seem to have the smarts to put together a decent gameplan whenever i see the browns on tv they always look like they are getting outcoached this year i think they'll be battling with the falcons for the honor of having the worst record in the nfl  New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Miami Dolphins San Francisco 49ers Buffalo Bills New York Knicks Baltimore Ravens Dallas Cowboys New York Jets Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII Kansas City Chiefs National Football League Minnesota Vikings St. Louis Rams 1957 World Series Los Angeles Clippers American Football League Toronto Raptors Chicago Bulls Super Bowl XIV Atlanta Falcons Utah Jazz Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl IX Donovan McNabb Indiana Pacers Playoff Philadelphia Eagles Cris Carter Super Bowl V Orlando Magic Indianapolis Colts San Diego Chargers San Antonio Spurs Super Bowl XIX New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Detroit Red Wings Toronto Blue Jays Boston Bruins Super Bowl I Seattle Mariners Oakland Raiders Baltimore Orioles Super Bowl XXIV NFL playoffs Cleveland Indians Houston Rockets Joe Gibbs International League Washington Redskins NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl X Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXI September 2005 in sports Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Jacksonville Jaguars Brett Favre NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXXVI Mario Lemieux New Orleans Saints San Francisco Giants Florida Marlins Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXV Yao Ming World Series St. Louis Cardinals National Basketball Association Pittsburgh Penguins Chicago White Sox Super Bowl VII Chicago Cubs Detroit Tigers Super Bowl XXI National Football League championships NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Norway national football team Tennessee Titans Boston Red Sox Celtic F.C.

why does everyone say tom brady is overrated the guy has rings superbowl mvp's and is one of the best clutch players of all time becuase one he was drafted real late and people can't accept that people get better and he has become the best in the league when most people are drafted like eli manning and are expected to be the best the nd reason is just like barry bonds in a way bonds is as good as it seems and people cant accept that he is still innocent until proven guilty so as far as we know those are amazing records by barry bonds so people have a hard to time in our generation accepting the best because it does not happen very often as in early years with greats like montana unitas starr etc so basically its our generation and them not being able to accept a winner they are always looking for the stats the underdog and just because he has good looks doesn't mean he is overrated like kournikova and derek jeter are  Tom Brady Barry Bonds Derek Jeter New England Patriots San Antonio Spurs St. Louis Rams San Francisco 49ers November 1 in baseball World Series Pittsburgh Steelers Houston Rockets Alex Rodriguez Chicago Bulls National Football League Oakland Athletics Wayne Gretzky Super Bowl New York Yankees Dallas Cowboys Michael Jordan Manny Ram__rez ESPN25 Troy Glaus 1990s Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXIX Brady Anderson Babe Ruth Los Angeles Clippers San Diego Padres Cleveland Browns 1981 baseball strike New York Knicks Kansas City Chiefs San Francisco Giants 2003 World Series 24 Hours of Le Mans Pete Rose Golden State Warriors Hank Aaron Eisner Award Days of our Lives NFL Most Valuable Player Award 2004 World Series New York Giants Donovan McNabb Super Bowl I Toronto Blue Jays National Basketball Association Major League Baseball Super Bowl XXXVI Rickey Henderson St. Louis Cardinals Yao Ming 1981 World Series Indiana Pacers Norway national football team December 2004 in sports Super Bowl III Sports betting Troms__ I.L.

should the pacman be allowed to wrestle the tennessee titans petitioned for a court order to prevent pacman jones from participating with tna at an upcomming event since he has been suspended for a year should he be allowed to seek employment elsewhere one one hand the titans have a sizable amount of money invested in pacman jones and possibly have a right to protect that investment the majority of nfl players have contract stipulations which prevent them from participating in dangerous activities i know wrestling is scripted but there are a number of professional wrestlers who are seriously injured every year so i think that the titans do have a right to try and stop jones from injuring himself however kevin green and brian urlacher have both participated in professional wrestling and since pacman has been suspended for a year i don't know how much his contract with the titans really stands for right now i think it's pretty darn hypocritical of the nfl to keep him from earning a living while they have decided not to pay him pacman jones definitly should be allowed to perform in a wrestling ring if that is what he decides to do  Professional wrestling slang Professional wrestling National Football League Professional wrestling match types World Wrestling Entertainment A.J.

who will have a better carrer reggie bush or vince young so i think it's a lot easier for a rb to have a good career than it is for a qb a guy like barry sanders had a phenomenal career playing for a mostly mediocre lions team the reason they were able to be mediocre was barry sanders without him they would have just been bad barry sanders is in the hall of fame and never really came close to a super bowl on the other hand every time a qb is talked about they bring up the question of winning how many super bowls has he won the only qb who seems to have gotten past that talk is dan marino he is still credited as one of the greats but he never won a super bowl though unlike barry he played in one so i think vince young is going to have to win games to have his career considered great while reggie bush will just have to accumulate stats so my answer to your question is that reggie bush's career will be labeled the better career  Pittsburgh Steelers Barry Sanders Brett Favre Green Bay Packers Dan Marino Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXVI Reggie White Miami Dolphins Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs 2004 World Series Super Bowl I Reggie Miller New York Giants Indianapolis Colts Deion Sanders National Football League Super Bowl Super Bowl XIV Washington Redskins Pro Football Hall of Fame Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XIX Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl X Super Bowl IX Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Vikings Detroit Lions Reggie Bush National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXI Sam Barry Joe Gibbs Norway national football team Hank Stram Super Bowl XXV New York Mets Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXIX December 2004 in sports Babe Ruth Peyton Manning Super Bowl XVII October 2005 in sports Barry Bonds Fast bowling Don Shula Super Bowl VI English cricket team Scott Hall Super Bowl XV Madden NFL Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXXV Iron Bowl New York Knicks Home run Super Bowl XX Bee Gees Super Bowl XVI Vince Lombardi Super Bowl XXXIX Al Michaels Super Bowl XXI October 20 in baseball Tom Brady Baltimore Ravens The NFL Today Kurt Warner Game show Super Bowl XVIII Steve Young (athlete) Paul Hornung St. Louis Rams Nolan Ryan Indiana Pacers The Joker's Wild Super Bowl XXIII Major League Baseball television contracts Stanley Cup Super Bowl XXXIII San Diego Chargers Jacksonville Jaguars Dream Team New England Patriots Arkansas Razorbacks Super Bowl VII October 12 in baseball Oakland Athletics

its almost here football here are some opinion questions good afternoon football fans what team do you think will be the most improved over last season what division do you think is going to be the most fun to watch and what team do you think is the most over rated hey pumped for football most improved team has got to be the arizona cardinals a lot of answers i hear to this question are the jets and ers but they both finished in the middle of the pack last year so if they don't make the playoffs how are they improving the cards however finished th to last so there is a lot of room to improve new coach whisenhunt brings a lot of promising attitude to the team leinart will get his first full season edge should get more carries with new system and revamped o line and they have one of the top three wide receiver duos in fitzy and boldin and on the defensive side adrisn wilson antrell rolle bertrand berry karlos dansby and calvin pace are some of the better players in the nfl at their respective positions don't be surprised if this is a top defense on special teams they also have one of the top tier kickers in neil rackers and since they play in a dome no wind always helps and they have a dangerous return threat in j j arrington nfc west will probably be the division most fun to watch i think this it is the only division where any team can win it also could've been the nfc south if it weren't for the falcons and vick but now they have harrington they're screwed if the seahawks stay healthy and the ers can prove young guys can get the job done it should be a great way race for most of the season every team's offense should be exciting to watch the rams are stacked at every offensive position the seahawks are also stacked at every position the ers have frank gore one of the most exciting in the game today and the cardinals are also stacked as long as leinart can stay efficient and get the ball to fitzy and boldin very exciting division that should be competitive all year long most overrated team in my mind is the saints they have arguably the worst defense in the nfl and everyone is picking them to win the nfc with the post katrina comeback and all the emotions i just think they were riding a fluke into the playoffs and the lockdown bears d showed them that their run was a fluke brees had that huge year years ago in san diego then had a rough start and got injured years ago now i think it's same story new setting huge year st year in new orleans and now will come back to earth i'm not saying he'll be the worse qb in the league he'll still be top a top qb but he won't be behind peyton again deuce is getting rusty as well which could limit running game production i think they will be lucky to go i see them going eliminated st round of playoffs  Atlanta Falcons Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XVIII Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XIX San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXII Cris Carter Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXI January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXIV Tampa Bay Buccaneers St. Louis Cardinals Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XIII American Football League Super Bowl XXXIII Arizona Cardinals Super Bowl III Super Bowl VI Joe Gibbs December 2004 in sports Monday Night Football Playoff Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXI NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl X Super Bowl XII Boston Red Sox October 2005 in sports World Series International League Super Bowl XXVIII Los Angeles Kings NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XV Super Bowl VII Brett Favre American football Super Bowl XVI Oakland Athletics New York Knicks Chicago Bulls San Francisco Giants Running back Randy Moss NFL playoffs, 2001-02 1994 NFL season Super Bowl XXXII Jacksonville Jaguars Toronto Blue Jays NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 NFL playoffs Super Bowl I Oakland Raiders Super Bowl II Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXV Detroit Tigers Norway national football team

how funny would it be if usc went undefeated and got left out of the championship game i think i'd still be laughing next july personally the point of this is simple it can happen it has happened and as long as we have the bcs it will happen again auburn is sorta what brought it to mind but more the folks saying usc has the greatest team ever according to anyone who actually saw a game in auburns team was the best team the south has produced in the last years they dated back to the miami teams of the 's the system is flawed everyone knows it it's a media based thing picked by people who for the most part have never even played football so large market teams and media darlings get early nods also look at last years michigan team lost game just like florida but florida got the shot at the title but i personally would laugh harder if usc got probation so they weren't even elidgable and went undefeated and couldn't win the title that my friends is a definate possibility and what if usc has a bum run wins games they should easily by like points or so gets jumped and left and to loveholio why's it so different that it happens to usc and not anyone else say boise st why would that make the bcs any more bogus because usc is the in team right now to be for and to pick for the title how about usc gets to share the title and they were not in the title game so does that not argue against the bcs system can't have it both ways so if the system is flawed in your favor then it's still flawed trust me i'm all for a playoff and have been for years even before and no one on the planet is going to convince me usc would have beaten auburn like they did that overrated oklahoma team btw to you usc fans look at who is laughing auburn fans michigan fans because if those two can get hosed anyone can auburn and michigan are two of the traditional powers in the country and play in bigtime bcs conferences not comparing conferences here just plainly stating that no one is immune the rivals one looks more truthful honestly notre dame will hurt usc because i see them losing at least maybe even games and the lower tier pac teams as well and nebraska will give a team like usc fits but over the long haul of the season will lose at least maybe games overall the only team what might threaten a bcs bowl that usc will play is cal with ucla getting at least a new years day bowl most of their vaunted schedule won't even make a bowl game though and everyone read km 's post and ask yourself why everyone hates on usc and usc has no history compared to those teams listed am i to understand that you think usc has a greater history than alabama and michigan i mean usc even tries to claim tailback u which is the most retarded thing ever only clean usc back in history was marcus allen otherwise you got a cheater and a killer on your resume now that is tradition running back u how about carnell williams starter tb ronnie brown starter miami brandon jacobs starter ny giants rudi johnson starter cincy bengals kenny irons recently injured last night on depth chart cincy heath evans starter fb ne patriots stephen davis legend washington redskins brent fullwood cf hof earl campbell cf hof who am i forgetting someone hmm oh yea bo jackson nuff said so ya'll boast back ups in the nfl solid rb marcus allen murderer oj is still paying off that civil suit and had to hock his heisman and reggie bush was bought and paid for and i'll compare depth at rb with ya and we can have this talk at the end of the season once espn shows clips of lester tate davis and fannin the next gen hmm davis is the only recruit out of that lot even rest are oh darn and enrique davis is coming next year and he was what the recruit behind devine last year running back u is au dude hey sok c actually no they do not have the number toughest schedule they have the number according to the espn power rankings as you've suggested http sports espn go com ncf columns story columnist schlabach mark id go look for yourself oh and that is totally relative because rivals puts them at number there are a lot of teams out there that could be cal and nebraska this year so that doesn't say much notre dame will be lucky to win or games this year so that doesn't help either http collegefootball rivals com content asp sid cid basic fact is though it won't happen if you start the season number and win all your games i don't see one let alone two teams jump over you to make it but it's possible if usc has a couple of close calls and lsu and texas blow out their opponents going undefeated well then it's up to the computers not the voters just another reason for a playoff i would find it funny actually yes  Monday Night Football American Football League New York Knicks Dallas Cowboys

peyton manning or carson palmer i'm not asking whose better i imagine the response will overwhelmingly be manning if you are building a team now who do you take the main thing to take into consideration is that palmer is years younger if you're building your team for the future the clear choice is carson palmer as far as numbers go they're already equivalent and that includes a season when palmer only had of his offensive line and was coming off of major knee surgery for a potentially career ending injury they both have the arm although palmer throws a better spiral and is slightly more accurate with his throws as well as being a little bit more mobile manning has better timing with his receivers but also has four years experience on palmer which factors into his slight advantage in intangibles and it is very slight so if i were building a team to win for the next years i'd go with the elite quarterback who will still be in the league and playing at a high level for that length of time and that's carson palmer  Quarterback New England Patriots New York Giants Cleveland Browns American football Carson Palmer Volleyball San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl V Cincinnati Bengals American football strategy PGA Tour Glossary of American football Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXV Daunte Culpepper Ryan Leaf Super Bowl XXXIV Carolina Panthers Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XIV Baseball National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXII Michael Vick Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVI Miami Dolphins Canadian football Water polo Super Bowl X Softball USC Trojans Football Super Bowl VI Al Michaels New York Jets Arnold Palmer Matt Leinart Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl III Mario Lemieux Super Bowl XXVI 1957 World Series Super Bowl XV Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXIV Alex Rodriguez Super Bowl IV Football (soccer) Passer rating Troy Glaus San Diego Chargers National Football League Super Bowl XIX Steve Young (athlete) Yao Ming Dan Marino Notts County F.C.

dallas cowboys odds to go all the way in my opinion the cowboys have the potential to go all the way and not only that win the super bowl they are loaded with talent and if they can play consistent through out the year you might as well punch their ticket not only that they play in the nfc so to think they dont have a shot is crazy if you putting your money on the saints eagles or bears your odds are not much better especially the saints cowboys will win it all write it down i honestly think we are witnessing the beginning of the next cowboys dynasty romo is already an pro bowler meaning he's one of top quarterbacks in the league they have the best tandem in runningbacks and they are really young too to is a beast and probably will get at least tds this year if he stays healthy plus the defense is the best in the league i would be surprised if the boys lose more than one game this year  Super Bowl XXVII Dallas Cowboys New York Giants Super Bowl Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League Super Bowl VI Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XIII National Football League Lore St. Louis Rams Donovan McNabb Super Bowl X San Francisco 49ers Troy Aikman Professional American football championship games Indianapolis Colts Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XII New England Patriots Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXVI American Football League Joe Gibbs Philadelphia Eagles Denver Broncos Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl I Cris Carter Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XVII Monday Night Football Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XXI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXXI Miami Dolphins Atlanta Falcons Buffalo Bills Terrell Owens Pro Bowl Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXII NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXV 2005 NFL season Baltimore Ravens Washington Redskins Robert F.

thoughts and views on the dallas cowboys pre season win over the colts i was personally impressed i really like how romo realsed the ball so quickly and efficently i enjoyed watching them eat time on the clock by nickle and dimeing the colts d julius jones really impressed me with his speed and how he hit the whole yes barber iii had more yards but he also had more carries and he dances around to much for me as far as the defense goes i was please but not as impressed as i hoped to be but i also think that is becuase it is still so early and they have to work alot of kinks out such as i personally noticed they were showing the blitz to early and not sitting back until the end and there were to many arm tackles the middle of the field seemded to be wide open for the majority of the night also on the plus side i really liked seeing how they were communicating with everyone and they all seemed to know was was going on anyway what do ya'll think please dont answer if your just going to put its still preseason dont get excited a if you're not exicted your not a real fan and b i know that this is a question to discuss what you like disliked about the game last night romo seemed to be getting out from under center faster new coach or experience don't know i'll tell you who really impressed me was the rookie competing for the third qb spot matt moore hadn't paid any attention to the guy until last night but he was cool under pressure and seemed to grasp the offensive scheme he looked pretty good you're right about there appearing to be holes in the middle of the defense st game it's fixable i'm expecting great things from this defense this year demarcus ware getting some support form the other side and roy williams playing closer to the line could be fun to watch fasano looked great they say that garrett likes to run a two tight end set that should complicate the lives of defensive coordinators the offense as a whole seemed a little more opened up with the receiving tandem of owens glenn and crayton that should be fun  New York Giants Dallas Cowboys Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII National Football League Lore Super Bowl V American football strategy National Football League San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals Glossary of American football Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl X Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXV New York Jets Super Bowl XII St. Louis Rams American football Super Bowl XIX Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XIV Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl VI Defensive team Buffalo Bills 1957 World Series Super Bowl IX Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XVII Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XI Super Bowl Offensive team Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl VII Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXV Wide receiver Water polo Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl I Volleyball Running back NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Quarterback American Football League Tight end Houston Astros Rugby union positions Super Bowl XXXVIII International League Terrell Owens Toronto Raptors Lineman (football) 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XXXIII Canadian football Major League Baseball television contracts October 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports Aerial (dance move) Donovan McNabb Comparison of Canadian and American football Steve Nash Super Bowl XXXII Tom Landry Cris Carter Toronto Blue Jays Poker jargon Yao Ming Boston Red Sox Minnesota Vikings Babe Ruth's Called Shot Rugby league positions Baseball Joe Gibbs Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl VIII Super Bowl XX Atlanta Falcons Los Angeles Dodgers

detroit lions the lion's looked alright yesterday but if u ask me i think kitna is horrible and that j t osullivan was pretty good what do u think about kitna being the qb for the lions do you people remember the j kitna that i'm talking about that had td's and int's i don't care how many yards u throw for if u give the ball back it dosent mean hit kitna looks like he only has about more years in him so one of those guys will be the future qb sure would it be smart to put kitna at number qb sure it would because sullivan was awesome however you seemed to have forgotten about dan orlosky he actually had a better qb rating than sullivan does and brought the lions to a big comeback also along with that dan knows the offense better because he has sat on the sideline and studied it for two years so if you are going to bench kitna i say you should look at dan first before you look at sullivan but i highly doubt the lions will bench kitna because rod marinelli quote un quote likes kitna so really the only reason why kitna would get benched is if he really stinked or if he got injured however dan sullivan or stanton are the future qb's of the team expect to have one of them be a franchise qb for years to come if i would have to say any of them i would say dan because he seems very calm and i had the feeling he could be a future starter when we drafted him  Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cleveland Browns New England Patriots New York Jets San Francisco 49ers 1957 World Series Carolina Panthers Marvin Lewis Dan Marino Brett Favre Cliff Richard Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXVII Toronto Raptors Montreal Canadiens Super Bowl XXV Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers National Football League Lore Carson Palmer World Series National Football League Super Bowl IX Tris Speaker Miami Dolphins Super Bowl V Super Bowl XIX St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXVI Detroit Lions NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Indiana Pacers 2005 World Series Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl X Cincinnati Bengals Chicago Bulls Damon Allen Major League Baseball television contracts Iron Bowl Super Bowl XXXVI Kurt Warner Quarterback Boston Red Sox 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Glossary of American football Florida Marlins Shaggy dog story Ryan Leaf EastEnders Detroit Red Wings Leeds United F.C.

how do offensive linemen go to the hall of fame does the nfl count pan cake blocks do they look at the holes the linemen make the years active the pro bowls they super bowls it mainly stems from observation in lieu of stats unfortunately sometimes it's hard to tell on tv since the camera follows whoever's holding the ball but even then you can see stuff like a lineman controlling his d lineman not letting him near the qb on passing downs or just shoving him around to open up a hole on running downs in some cases you can use stats like every running back on such and such team did better then after they got traded elsewhere though that would indicate the line as a whole is great but they do accumulate pro bowls super bowls games and the stats of who they blocked for and that sort of thing does get presented as stats when it comes time to induct new hof ers  Super Bowl IX Super Bowl X National Football League Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XIV American football strategy National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVII Kansas City Chiefs New York Giants Glossary of American football Buffalo Bills American football Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXVIII Offensive team Super Bowl XII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl V Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXXVI Carolina Panthers St. Louis Rams Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXIV Pro Bowl Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XVII Miami Dolphins Lineman (football) Super Bowl XXII New England Patriots John Elway Ted Hendricks Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl Super Bowl VIII Quarterback Dave Casper Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXIV Wide receiver Tommy Nobis Super Bowl XXXV William Perry (football player) Super Bowl XXX Volleyball New York Jets Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXII Joe Gibbs Minnesota Vikings Dan Marino Bart Starr Super Bowl XVI Sid Gillman Al Michaels Tom Landry Super Bowl II Warren Moon Indianapolis Colts Ryan Leaf College football Reggie White Boomer Esiason Defensive team Dallas Cowboys American Football League San Diego Chargers Philadelphia Eagles Joe Namath Steve Young (athlete) Walter Payton Joe Montana Mike Ditka Hank Stram Monday Night Football Jacksonville Jaguars 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XXXVII Cris Carter

football help okay i am mexican american and brought up in a mexican culture so we watched soccer and boxing instead of football my boyfriend and i plan on watching some games together he loves football and i love him i just want to share this with him from a not so ignorant stance and have fun where can i find info on understanding football here are two posts i made before on the topic the first is about the positions and the second is an overview of the basic gameplay positions offense quarterback of the time takes the snaps and throws to receivers runs with it or hands it off to a halfback fullback halfback the team's priority running back can also take passes fullback the team's secondary running back he doesn't get the ball as often offensive line center and guards blocks for the quarterback and running backs tight end an extension of the offensive line only they are allowed to receive passes wide receiver catch passes from the quarterback defense defensive line in front of the offensive line rush the quarterback usually depending on the play linebackers either blitz cover a receiver runningback or cover the middle of the field in zone defenses safety strong weak basically the last line of the defense they make sure no one gets by them on the pass and the run cornerback the receivers of the defense in man coverage they cover the wide receivers general gameplay basics you get plays st down nd down rd down th down to move yards if you move yards in plays you get a first down another plays to try to get yards this repeats until any of five things happen you score a touchdown by running or passing the ball into the end zone points after a touchdown you can kick an extra point point or go for a point conversion points you kick a field goal points you punt the ball to the other team this is done on th down if it is say th down and yards to go when you punt it the other team catches it and wherever they are tackled is where they get the ball the point is you are giving them worse field position putting them further away from scoring if you don't punt on th down and say you don't get the yards i just mentioned the other team gets the ball where it is at the end of that play the last thing that can happen is you can turn the ball over fumbles happen when someone carrying the ball drops it if they recover it play resumes as if there was no fumble if the other team recovers the ball it is their first down wherever the ball is an interception occurs when the defense catches a pass from the offense and possession who is trying to score changes finally a safety can occur when you are trying to move the ball upfield but are tackled in the end zone behind you the one you're not trying to make it to this gives your opponent points and then they get the ball too during the game there are a number of penalties that can be called here are a couple basics offsides defense is past the line of scrimmage an imaginary line from sideline to sideline going through the ball when the ball is snapped when the play begins yards forward for the offense false start can be anything from a flinch to a jump its the same as offsides only the offense does it yards back for the offense holding while blocking the blocker holds whoever they are trying to block either holding the jersey or wrapping their arms around the blockee in a loving embrace pass interference offense or defense can do this while the ball is being thrown either the defense hits the receiver before he catches the ball or the offense hits the defense before that ball is caught in college this is a yard penalty and an automatic first down however as long as either player is making an attempt at catching the ball and is not trying just to stop the other person from catching it there is no pass interference so there's football in a nutshell hope it helps back to work for me  Philadelphia Eagles Basketball World Football League Super Bowl XXIX Donovan McNabb Super Bowl IV Snap (American football) Super Bowl XXXVII Indianapolis Colts Baltimore Ravens Harrow Football Field hockey NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Play from scrimmage Fielding (cricket)

why the lions will win a superbowl within the next three years not really a question i know but head coach rod marinelli won a superbowl as d line coach and asst head coach with the tampa bay buccaneers offensive coordinator mike martz won a superbowl as o coordinator with the st louis rams defensive coordinator joe barry won a superbowl as linebackers coach with the tampa bay buccaneers martz' offense martz was the orchestrator of one of the most productive offenses in nfl history with the rams he turned kurt warner from a guy working at a grocery store to a time league mvp his offense is arguably the most complex in the league and takes at least a year to get fully comfortable with but with the offensive talent the lions have there is no reason they can't become a reincarnation of the rams' offense tampa defense two teams bucs colts have won superbowls with the tampa in the past years with the bears also reaching the superbowl last year running the same defense calvin johnson your thoughts with so many assistant coaches now everybody has at least ring somewhere in there yeah how many teams have a head coach and both coordinators with rings it was vermeil's offense that won the superbowl lol what that's just asinine it was martz's offense everything about it was martz's offense he was the offensive coordinator and he designed the plays the terminology and the schemes and he called the plays how come martz's ram offense fell apart actually he went to the superbowl with the rams his first year as head coach they lost on a last second fg to the patriots and the lions coincidentally haven't done with him there well he's only been there one year and they were actually th in the nfl in passing yds last year despite being sacked more times than the colts saints and packers combined also williams and rogers had shitty attitudes calvin johnson does not and he's twice as good as either of them marinelli is doing the drafting now anyway man it's amazing how little you people know it's like all you know is the lions suck and therefore assume that everyone on the team sucks and that they have no talent the dre bly deal was a great trade dre bly is exactly the type of player rod marinelli is trying to get rid of he's a selfish player who didn't even want to be there he's way overrated too like someone said kitna is plenty good enough brad johnson and trent dilfer won superbowls and neither were as good as kitna i just don't think you guys understand the game of football coaching is more important in football than any other sport one great player cannot win games in the nfl there are guys that all have to work together so if you have just one guy not on the same page you will fail i'm telling you marinelli is one of the best coaches in the nfl there are just not many like him anymore why do you think the bucs refused to let him talk to any teams for years he'll be coach of the year this year simeon rice when talking about rod marinelli you are talking about a man a myth and a legend he evokes thoughts of those who have come before us in the game of coaching there s nothing like him he s definitely one of a kind he s a michelangelo an aristotle a socrates he s a great philosopher he changes coaching to an art form he understands the psyche of man and how to motivate men he understands how to speak to men and how to lead men what he has done for me and my life what he has brought to me and my life words can t describe it by me meeting this man and him being a part of my life for the short time he was he s been able to change my perspectives and my ideas about life the lions are getting much more than a coach they are getting much more than a man they say legends aren t born everyday but the detroit lions are getting one and i salute them if one more of you idiots say anything about the lions not having a quarterback i'm going to report you for stupidity did you not notice jon kitna threw for over yards did you not noticed that he took the bengals to before he was benched for carson plamer if you give this guy time he will rip a secondary in half just look at these stats from last year att comp pct yards tds ints sacked you tell what type of quaterback can put up these numbers gettings sacked a avg of times a game that is not mention all the time he was pressured get that man a line and its all over look at the las season with the bengals when he started i predict the loins make it to the playoff at least twice in the next for years w kitna or whoever it was they drafted as qb i actually a bengals fan so i don't know much except that kitna is a decent qb  January 2005 in sports Super Bowl VII Joe Gibbs New York Knicks Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl VI Toronto Argonauts Steve Young

who is the sleeper team this year i think i know who do you think will be the team that goes that no one thought was going to be a legit contender this year i think that it's going to be the steelers with bruce arians as their new offensive coordinator they are going to spread the field that creates space for a smallish back such as fast willie parker to gain chunks of yards without having to run between the tackles i e edgerin james as a colt as opposed to bettis as a steeler plus the steelers finished in the top in total offense and total defense last year i don't think more than teams did that i think last years was an anomoly and the steelers will be playing late into january and don't answer with the patriots or the chargers or the bears i'm talking about sleepers not pre season favorites answer intelligently please the reason i select the steelers is because i can't find an online expert who picks them above rd in their own division everyone is so in love with the ravens d and the bengals o i personally think that the bengals are a joke and the ravens are too old on offense ok let me define this better any team that made the playoff last year is out and as for the ers fans frank gore has a broken hand that could linger all year i think you are overlooking how huge that injury actually is any helmet on that hand could lose him for a month think portis last year for the 'skins portis is a much more proven back than gore but that early training camp injury plagued him all season the broncos maybe who picked up dre bly danial graham brandon stokley and travis henry champ bailey and dre bly will be very difficult to throw against while jarvis moss elvis dumervil and courtney brown will be hard to run against if brandon stokley's injury doesn't hurt him too much he javon walker brandon marshall and danial graham will all have good receiving yards travis henry fits very nicely into the broncos blocking schemes the only problem i see is an old o line that could get injured a lot and a middle backer dilemma john kitna and the lions think they will win games but they are smoking something strong  September 2005 in sports Denver Broncos Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXIV Running back Super Bowl XXVII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXI Dallas Cowboys Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl X Super Bowl V NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XI Jacksonville Jaguars December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXV Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXII National Football League San Diego Chargers American football Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XII Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXXIII Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XVIII Philadelphia Eagles Minnesota Vikings November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XVI January 2005 in sports American football strategy Toronto Raptors October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2001-02 New Jersey Nets Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl III Cris Carter Professional American football championship games Super Bowl I New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXII NFL playoffs, 1996-97 Super Bowl XXXVIII Donovan McNabb Detroit Tigers St. Louis Cardinals Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XX Glossary of American football Cleveland Indians Chicago Bulls Miami Hurricanes Football NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 2005 Pro Bowl October 2004 in sports Ben Roethlisberger NFL playoffs, 1994-95 Super Bowl VII Madden NFL Boston Bruins Indiana Pacers Brett Favre Robin Ventura Marvin Lewis Joe Gibbs Los Angeles Kings Terrell Owens NFL playoffs, 1997-98

fantasy football plz help on yahoo i saw the projected ranking of players the think that confusing me is that last year p manning had fan pts but he is projected at th overall and players like wille parker rudi johnson and joseph addia are front of him even thought they have less fan pts than p manning why is that can u tell me please running backs are definitely more importants than qbs mostly because the difference between the best running backs and the not as good running backs is so large many of the lesser known quarterbacks will give a fantasy team production almost as good as the top tier quarterbacks but there is a much bigger gap between the top running backs and the middle level rbs if your fantasy team has a middle tier quarterback and one or two top tier rbs and one or two top wrs it will do much better than if it has a top tier qb but no good rbs or wrs a good draft strategy is to wait until the rd or th round to draft a qb and draft a rb in the st round this is what i have done in my drafts years ago i won my league championship and went i had middle tier qbs brad johnson and mark brunell but top tier rbs like larry johnson and thomas jones and top tier wrs like santana moss and chris chambers last year i went losing in the championship with middle tier qbs in eli manning and rex grossman but with top tier rb in brian westbrook and top tier wrs in steve smith javon walker and donald driver combined record in years with top tier rbs and wrs and middle tier qbs obviously though the players who are top tier and middle tier change but the strategy stays the same tips for this year whatever you do dont draft eli manning my opinion he is not as good as advertised there are better qbs out there available at the same time also grab donald driver if you can maybe in round or later if he's still there he is so underrated but so good  Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXVII Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers New York Jets Miami Dolphins Dallas Cowboys Carolina Panthers September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XIII New England Patriots Super Bowl XXI Donovan McNabb Kansas City Chiefs Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns Tennessee Titans American football Chicago Bulls Jacksonville Jaguars San Antonio Spurs V8 Supercar Indiana Pacers Green Bay Packers St. Louis Rams New York Mets Super Bowl XXVIII Houston Rockets Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIV University of Florida United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics Super Bowl XXXVI Oakland Athletics Crystal Palace F.C.

wtf is asante samuel still with the patriots is he still with the pats wats happening with him explain plz yes he is still a member of the patriots currently he is a hold out looking for a big payday the patriots however are not known to 'renegotiate' contracts especially when said player has only had one good season thus far at the moment samuel has been placed as a franchise player which gives him an increase in pay this year and for any year there after should the pats continue to franchise him much like they did with vinateri however samuel feels he is worth more then the tag 'franchise player' gives him and has decided to hold out the last report i heard on the news was he was going to hold out for the first games this year although samuel tied all pro corner champ bailey with interceptions last year i personally think samuel is being a fool and should play this year and hopefully get a ring then see what he gets next year one good year doesn't make you an elite player however i do agree that his is underpaid but the amount he wants is ridiculous to compare him to a champ bailey would be wrong bailey has had a number of good seasons as a corner and samuel had hands made of stone until last season so yes he is a pat but is holding out for more expect to see him in week or perhaps traded should there be any key injuries  New England Patriots Cincinnati Bengals International League National Football League New York Giants St. Louis Rams Poker jargon Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXXVI Jeopardy!

will any college football team go undefeated this year i just have the feeling this year that there is really no dominate team that will run the table and go undefeated there are a lot of question marks for the contenders like usc booty really hasn't impressed me much we will find out if he's for real when he has unestablished wr's to work with and really no running game and a brutal final game schedule to end the year lsu a lot of uncertainty on the offensive side of the ball and they play in the sec although most of their tough conf games will be at home michigan defense is really going to struggle and i don't see the offense being able to carry the team throughout the year wisconsin solid players on both sides of the ball but really no superstar players who can give them the spark they need in crucial situations texas mccoy will struggle a but and i'm not so sure he will be able to take the team to where they wanna go and whoever else u wanna put up there all have some holes to fill usc was much better last season and didn't dominate half as much as u r saying they will this year i'm not saying they're a bad team i'm just saying that they are coming into this season with really an unestablished running and passing game it's decent but it's not blow away good like u r all making it out to be and last games go nd oregon oregon st cal arizona st ucla someone honestly can't see at least loss in any of the final i'm not sure any team in college football would run the table through that schedule it is much like florida's schedule last year and we all saw that even the eventual national champions couldn't make it through such a brutal schedule hawaii won't run the table either they have no defense whatsoever and i like boise st and nevada maybe even sj st to beat them first of all how can anyone say that usc's defense is better then have of the nfl you've got to be kidding me any nfl team would have there way with usc the nfl takes all the best college kids and usc's entire defense isn't nfl caliber so that right there is just a ridiculous comment but anyway i think michigan has a great chance to go undefeated this year they play of there games at home yes some of there defense is a bit shaky but they have a ton of talent every year just because they are young they wont be good that doesnt make much sense shawn crable is a great linebacker for uofm and they also have soph brandon graham who was the number one linebacker coming out of highschool last year they will also be returning jamar adams the starting strong saftey last year and terrance taylor who was also a full time starter last year the only spot they are semi weak is corner and they have some really talented young guys to fill in for the likes of leon hall morgan trent is a returning starter for them at corner and besides ron english is a good defensive cord who will do a good job for them again and you guys already know about the offense so i dont need to go into detail about them  Cincinnati Bengals Pittsburgh Steelers NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 National Football League Super Bowl XXVII St. Louis Rams Miami Dolphins New York Jets Buffalo Bills American football Baltimore Ravens San Francisco 49ers National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXVI Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXXVI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIII USC Trojans Football Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl I American Football League Iron Bowl Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl VII Super Bowl V International League Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XII Norway national football team October 2005 in sports Mack Brown Indianapolis Colts Sam Barry Super Bowl III World Series College football 1957 World Series 2005 World Series American football strategy Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XI Jacksonville Jaguars Dallas Cowboys Playoff Canadian football Defensive team Baseball Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl VI Houston Nutt Toronto Blue Jays January 2005 in sports Donovan McNabb Poker jargon Super Bowl XXXV Leeds United F.C.

who would you rather have this coming season reggie bush or devin hester both play offense and special teams hester switched from defense to offense during the offseason reggie bush's tendency to dance around instead of making up his mind and using his speed and agility to get around people i don't like that notice he had like a yards per carry he just can't do what he did in college don't get me wrong i think bush will be a great player in time but it's going to take a little development to get going he needs the power rushing ability of deuce mcallister if he's going to be considered a great rb in the league dancing is for tv reality shows power and speed is for the nfl now devin hester the guy's got skills there's no denying that he's going to be a good deep threat this year and certainly a weapon on chicago's offense that will make defenses play them differently even if they don't give him the ball just like when carolina uses julius peppers on offense a ' lbs monster athlete lining up in the slot is not something defenses want to see and devin hester can bring that same factor it doesn't matter who you pick to be honest both will force defensive respect but bush has the possibility of scoring more tds than hester being that hester is likely going to only play wr bush will play all over the place  Carolina Panthers American football San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of American football Cincinnati Bengals Deuce McAllister Super Bowl XXXVI American football strategy New York Giants Super Bowl XXVI Volleyball Running back Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl III New England Patriots Super Bowl XXV Table tennis Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XIV Quarterback Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XI Super Bowl X Super Bowl XX Chicago Bulls Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl I Yao Ming National Football League Lore Indiana Pacers Canadian football Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXIV Minnesota Vikings Team Fortress Classic Super Bowl XXIII Baseball Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XII Miami Dolphins St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXV NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXVIII Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XV American Football League Jacksonville Jaguars World Series Buffalo Bills Iron Bowl Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Comparison of Canadian and American football Reggie Jackson Water polo Rugby league Super Bowl VI Super Bowl V Dallas Cowboys Arena football Michael Jordan Wide receiver Rugby union positions Utah Jazz Steve Young (athlete) January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXIII Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl VIII Seattle Mariners Cris Carter Randy Moss 2004 World Series Ultimate (sport) USC Trojans Football Punt (football) Julius Peppers Terrell Owens Toronto Blue Jays

the j e t s jets jets jets i got the new yawk jets finishing the season this season and making the playoffs possibly making the super bowl the jets offense is hella good with the addition of rb thomas jones the jets have a good ground attack which should help exploit chad pennington's play action pennington has the best pa in the nfl by the way plus the jets have arguably the best offensive line in the afc east and a good set of receivers the defense is already taken care of with head coach eric mangenius and the jets special team is dangerous with pro bowl kr pr justin miller the new yawk jets will do some damage i have been a jets fan for years now and i share your enthusiasm a note of caution however the jets offense received an upgrade with thomas jones and jericho cotchery has given the team a legitimate nd threat at wide receiver but the jets still do not have a pass catching tight end and the qb situation is shaky when you look past chad pennington the jets do not have a veteran back up and therefore are one big hit away from having to use duane clemens unproven or marques tuaisospa proven to suck furthermore the defense still has holes especially in terms of run defense which was terrible last year add in the fact that the jets had a soft schedule last year i am happy that the jets went and went to the playoffs but the jets were lucky to have been playing a lot teams down the stretch that had basically given up detroit minnesota oakland this year's schedule is really tough two games against ne games against pittsburgh superbowl champions two seaons ago baltimore best defense cleveland couldn't beat last year and cincinatti emerging powerhouse plus tough games involving the giants cowboys and eagles i think a more realistic prediction and this assumes no catastrophic injuries would be or  Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl X Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXXV Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl VI American Football League Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XI Minnesota Vikings NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl IX Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXI Tennessee Titans NFL playoffs, 2004-05 September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XVI Los Angeles Kings Oakland Raiders Monday Night Football Super Bowl XV Professional American football championship games Cris Carter American football Super Bowl VII Super Bowl IV Super Bowl XVIII Indiana Pacers Super Bowl VIII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Jacksonville Jaguars December 2004 in sports Running back Boston Red Sox Super Bowl II Super Bowl XXXIII Toronto Raptors NFL playoffs National Football League championships Major League Baseball television contracts Joe Gibbs January 2005 in sports World Series Randy Moss American football strategy Super Bowl XXXVIII 1978 NFL season Washington Redskins October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXIX International League NFL playoffs, 2003-04 November 2004 in sports Tom Brady New Orleans Saints Denver Broncos Glossary of American football New York Knicks Bernie Kosar Cleveland Indians Terrell Owens National Hockey League

will the steelers make the playoffs in the afc is extremely tough and deep but the steelers could be a sleeper i think yes they will they will go and will make the playoffs this year if you consider everything that went wrong for them last year they only missed the playoffs by one game last year the steelers lost a few games just because of muffed punts but this year i expect them to have one of the best returners in the league with willie reid being healthy i also think several of their players will have a better year i expect ike taylor to have a breakout season i think he has talent and is becoming more skilled at the corner position i also expect lawernce timmons to play a big part in the steelers defensive with joey porter gone timmons will fill the role of a pass rushing linebacker very well ben roethlisberger is going to be better a quarterback this year he has had a full year to recover from his motorcycle accident ben also said that he usually takes months off in the off season but this year he said he only took weeks off this year this will make him a better quarterback and more resistant to injury the steelers second year players will really shine too santonio holmes will do great last year he showed flashes of greatness i also believe anthony smith will have a good year last year i did not think bill cowher did a good job coaching in all the years i could remember the steelers were always coached very well by cohwer they were always motivated and got very few penalties however last year was different they seemed sloppy and not very well coached however i am not saying that the new coach mike tomlin will be a big improvement his first year but he will not be a big drop off from what cowher was last year however one problem the steelers will have is their secondary there is no doubt that troy polamalu will have another pro bowl season but the other cornerbacks and safeties will have to make a big improvement i think tomlin will help these defensive backs tomlin was the defensive backs coach with the tampa bay buccaneers so my prediction for the steelers this year is this may be a very generous prediction if they make the playoffs anything can happen  Super Bowl XXIV Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXVI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXV St. Louis Rams National Football League Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XI September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXIV San Francisco 49ers NFL playoffs, 2002-03 American football strategy Ben Roethlisberger American football Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl III Super Bowl Philadelphia Eagles Indianapolis Colts NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XII Bill Cowher Oakland Raiders Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXI Tony Dungy Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXX Toronto Raptors Super Bowl VI December 2004 in sports NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Super Bowl XIX January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXVII October 2005 in sports Brett Favre Super Bowl I NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Tennessee Titans November 2004 in sports San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Dan Marino NFL playoffs, 1997-98 Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXIII Donovan McNabb Running back NFL playoffs, 1995-96 Joe Gibbs New York Knicks NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XVI XFL 2005 Pro Bowl Los Angeles Kings Boston Bruins Defensive team Houston Rockets NFL playoffs, 1979-80 Super Bowl II Super Bowl XXXVIII Tampa Bay Lightning Indiana Pacers Monday Night Football Warren Sapp NFL playoffs, 1999-2000

should big ten wait to start season you think they should start weeks after they do currently its my belief that this is a major issue of why they dont do well in bowl games big ten is down with their season by nov ish when the pac isnt done till beginning of dec the sec isnt done till end of nov and if they go to the championship game dec same with big for those of you who think it doesnt matter trust me it does the more weeks you are away from your last game played the more inefficient your going to become the polls isnt the big issue here they can make the bcs games its just that whoever they played has played alot more recently then they have thats the issue as for more games they already play some conferences play so they are maxing out and the playoff thing i have heard nothing of but i hope it is true a bye week or two during the season would be a better idea they get the rest when they need it the most and still don't finish too early chicago fan is way off they won't have a playoff if they added another team they would have a championship game  Bowl Championship Series Playoff Playoff format Pittsburgh Steelers BCS title game Cleveland Browns Baltimore Ravens Miami Dolphins Buffalo Bills College basketball NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 New York Knicks Super Bowl Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII Atlantic Coast Conference Super Bowl XXXVI Texas Longhorn Athletics College football Mack Brown New England Patriots Indianapolis Colts Jacksonville Jaguars New York Jets National Football League Lore NFL playoffs Super Bowl XXXIV Stanley Cup Minnesota Vikings NBA Finals Rose Bowl (game) Philadelphia 76ers International League Carolina Panthers San Francisco 49ers Boston Red Sox Super Bowl XIV 2005 World Series St. Louis Rams Oakland Athletics American Football League Donovan McNabb Baseball Stars Philadelphia Eagles Mario Lemieux Kansas City Chiefs USC Trojans Football Fiesta Bowl Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.

can someone tell me if the nfl has a rule that says players can only wear reebok shoes a co worker of mine contends that players have been fined for wearing their ownn shoe per their contract this sounds absurd to me can anyone verify this what the hell are shoe contracts for more or less since the nfl has limited to some extent what shoes a player can wear since reebok has a billion dollar decade long contract the shoes are generally reebok also nike does have an agreement with the nfl allowing players to wear the shoes other companies don't so the logos must be covered now reggie bush has an adidas contract adidas does not have an nfl agreement so if adidas logo shoes are seen that will prompt a fine this is ironic since adidas and reebok have merged in the last year  Adidas Reebok Adidas-Salomon Nike, Inc.

how impressive did the steelers look in their first preseason game people will say it's only the preseason but it was bigger than that it was the first game with coach tomlin it was the kind of dominating performance that could really get those skeptical veterans to get behind their new coach saints' coach sean payton was so disgusted with his team that he made them practice in full pads tuesday because they were physically bullied burnt some of the veterans didn't want tomlin to be their coach therefore i think tomlin made a statement in that game and may have won over the lockerroom team chemistry is really important to be successful in the nfl the saints did play horrible and their secondary is disgusting but i don't think it takes away from tomlin's message he's here to win it probably helps that they've practiced more than anyone i just hope they don't get tired at the end of the season thing is most starters only played the first position its hard to really say it was impressive based on that no team is locked in yet theres still lots of kinks to work out but it was a good sign that tomlin can get it done and im sure the locker room felt better about their situation  Cleveland Browns National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Dallas Cowboys New York Jets New England Patriots Minnesota Vikings St. Louis Rams Jacksonville Jaguars Carolina Panthers Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXVII San Antonio Spurs National Football League Lore Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XIII New Orleans Saints Kurt Warner Super Bowl X Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXVI Ty Cobb Ice hockey Buffalo Bills Steve Nash Baseball San Francisco 49ers National Basketball Association Super Bowl XIV Yao Ming Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium Kobe Bryant New York Knicks American Football League Poker jargon Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXIII Georgia Institute of Technology 1957 World Series Washington Redskins Bowl Championship Series The Kinks 2004 NBA Finals Super Bowl XXXIV 2005 NFL season Baltimore Ravens Jake Delhomme Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XXIV Orlando Magic USC Trojans Football Los Angeles Clippers Columbine High School massacre Sandy Koufax Cris Carter Chicago Bears Indianapolis Colts XFL Randy Moss Oakland Raiders American football strategy Norway national football team Philadelphia Eagles Japan national rugby union team Lily Tomlin Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl III Ryan Leaf Super Bowl V Super Bowl XI Super Bowl Don Shula Leeds United F.C.

how do i find out which nfl games will be broadcast in my area i just moved to new hampshire and i am not a patriots fan i can't figure out how to look up what games will be shown in my area tru blu i was expecting to have to pay any way but i cant for the life of me find any information about which packages will show my steelers games no package is worth it if i have to leave the house to find a sports bar because im shelling out extra a month to still not see my games woe is me since you are a steelers fan you really look into getting a diectv satelite system and getting the sunday ticket package it will cost you like for the season in addition to the monthly costs but you will get to see every steeler game that way unless a game is moved to friday or saturday due to a weather problem due to a law that nfl games can't be televised on fridays or saturdays if there are regularly scheduled high school or college games played in the area otherwise this is the answer unfortunately the cbs and fox affiliates in local areas don't really tell what games they will show in advance now if your cbs affiliate is in new hampshire you will get more games on tv than you would if were stuck with boston affiliates you can probably check the websites on your local affilates a few days ahead of schedule here is my guess on what your sunday games will be week patroits jets cbs pm eagles packers pm fox bears chargers fox pm week buffalo steelers cbs pm cowboys dolphins fox jets baltimore cbs pm patrioits are on nbc night game week buffalo patriots cbs pm ers steelers fox pm giants redskins fox pm week rams dallas fox pm either raiders dolphins or jets buffalo cbs broncos colts pm cbs patriots are monday night game week browns patriots cbs pm seatlle steelers fox pm chargers broncos cbs pm week dolphins browns or bengals chiefs cbs eagles jets fox pm patriots cowboys cbs pm week patriots dolphins cbs pm ers giants fox pm bears eagles fox pm week giants vs dolphins in england fox pm colts panthers cbs pm redskins patriots fox pm week redskins jets fox pm bengals buffalo or jaguars saints cbs pm patriots colts cbs pm week eagles redskins fox pm either buffalo dolphins cbs pm or bengals ravens cbs pm cowboys giants fox pm patriots off week patriots buffalo cbs pm redskins dallas fox pm either giants detroit fox or rams ers fox if redskins cowboys moved to then the fox game will be panthers packers week broncos bears cbs pm either saints panthers or vikings giants fox pm ravens chargers cbs pm patriots nbc sunday night week jets dolphins cbs pm seattle eagles fox pm giants bears fox pm patroits on monday night week steelers patriots cbs pm giants eagles fox pm browns jets cbs pm if steelers patriots switched to pm then dolphins buffalo will be the cbs pm game week jets patriots cbs pm seattle panthers or packers rams fox pm eagles dallas fox pm week dolphins patriots cbs pm giants buffalo fox pm baltimore seattle fox pm week since the patriots play on saturday both affiliates will have games on fox pm game will be saints bears the cowboys redskins game likely gets moved to pm for cbs steelers baltimore likely pm and either tennessee colts or bengals dolphins gets moved to or possibly to nbc at night depending on playoff situations  Super Bowl XXVII Super League (Australia) Super Bowl XXVIII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Major League Baseball television contracts Super Bowl XXXV Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XVII Cris Carter Super Bowl XIV NFL playoffs, 1996-97 Brett Favre NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award Super Bowl XXXI Terrell Owens Robert F.

why do lsu fans hate usc so much while usc fans don't give a s t about lsu i just think it is funny how the lsu coaches and fans complain and whine about everything from the shared championship to the rankings to how much tougher their conference is has the whining really gotten them anywhere fight on this isnt math class you can't use the transitive property of equality to determnie who is the better team football is a game of matchups and because of this it is inevitable that the scores will not always reflect the overall tallent of a particular team anyways moving on lsu fans do not hate usc they are jealous and not because usc is better they havent played head to head in recent history so as far as i see nobody is better they are jealous because usc is always making it to a bcs game i think it is fair to say that lsu and usc possess equal amounts of skill and tallent and thusly lsu knows if they got to play usc's schedule they could be in the same situation as usc winning multiple conference titles and playing bcs games every year that said college football moves in cycles and right now the sec is the most dominant conference in football so the sec teams are all going to feel like they have it harder than everyone else but at one point in time the pac was tough and the big was tough or the acc and so on eventually the power will shift and usc may have the tough schedule and lsu gets a few cup cake games its all about taking advantage of your turn to shine  NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Nick Saban BCS title game Texas Longhorn Athletics USC Trojans Football Mack Brown Southeastern Conference College basketball Big East Conference 2004 College World Series New York Giants Tulane University Playoff National Football League Arkansas Razorbacks NCAA Division I-A national football champions Auburn University Atlantic Coast Conference American Football League University of Southern California Pittsburgh Steelers NBA Finals December 2004 in sports Louisiana State University Minnesota Vikings Pacific Ten Conference Houston Nutt Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Leeds United F.C.

what are some good techniques as a defensive lineman to get past a offensive lineman there is the spin technique to use this just spin the one side or the other pivoting on the foot that is in the direction of the spin at the same time hold your arm that is opposite of the direction of the spin straight out to keep the blocker from staying in front of you next is the swim technique use your outside arm to push the blocker to the inside and at the same time move your inside arm in a swimming motion over the blocker once you are behind the blocker follow through with your inside arm with a swift elbow to the back of the blocker for added effect if you are strong enough you can use the straight bull rush hit straight into the blocker with everything you have once his momentum is going backward grab him by the shoulder pads and throw him to either side a more unorthodox and illegal technique is the cup check give your blocker a quick uppercut punch to the groin we all know what that does beware this will be a yard penalty and possible ejection if you get caught but in the heat of battle in the middle of the line you can probably get away with it a few times  Glossary of American football Volleyball Professional wrestling attacks Swingout Boxing Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) American football strategy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fast bowling Offensive team Professional wrestling aerial techniques Suplex New York Giants Skateboarding trick Swimming Backstroke Lineman (football) Defensive team Billiards American football Canoe Lindy Basic Side pass (dance move) Butterfly stroke Charleston (dance move) Powerbomb Rugby union Super Bowl X Glossary of partner dance terms Table tennis Batting (cricket) Horizontal bar Super Bowl XXXIV Front crawl Aikido Field hockey DDT (professional wrestling) Super Bowl XXXVI Mixed martial arts Cleveland Browns Penalty (ice hockey) Circle (dance move) Super Bowl XIII Internal ballistics Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl IX Neckbreaker Manual transmission Super Bowl XXVI St. Louis Rams San Francisco 49ers Piledriver (professional wrestling) Softball Glossary of climbing terms Tag Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XVIII National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVII Canadian football Personal foul Diving Archery Pittsburgh Steelers Lightsaber combat Super Bowl XXV Fielding (cricket) Contredanse Super Bowl XXIII Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Super Bowl XXXI Marching band Running back Figure skating Kansas City Chiefs January 2005 in sports Parade (military) New England Patriots Shogi Backbreaker Wide receiver Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl I Muay Thai Yari shogi Tai shogi Super Bowl XIX Rugby union positions

why do no teams in the nfl run an option offense with so many teams in the ncaa running it why none in the nfl the true reason is because of the risk involved to the qb no coach in the nfl is going to intentionally put his qb typically the highest paid most valuable player in a position to take unnecessary hits especially since the talent gap between the starting qb and the backup is usually much greater in the nfl than in college the idea that it's because the defensive players are better and faster just doesn't hold water the offensive players in the nfl are just as fast and just as talented and they spend just as much time watching game film  National Football League American football Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII Baseball 2005 NFL season New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers NFL Draft Super Bowl I Super Bowl III Comparison of Canadian and American football Quarterback American Football League Miami Dolphins Volleyball Cleveland Browns St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXI Buffalo Bills Super Bowl IX Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXVI Kansas City Chiefs Carolina Panthers Philadelphia Eagles American football strategy Pro Bowl Super Bowl XXIV New England Patriots Super Bowl VII Salary cap Super Bowl XXI Madden NFL Dallas Cowboys National Football League Lore AFL-NFL Merger Clemson University Joe Paterno Super Bowl IV Super Bowl VI Indianapolis Colts Minnesota Vikings Ricky Ray Jacksonville Jaguars Wide receiver Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXIII Canadian football Doug Flutie Joe Gibbs Super Bowl XII Green Bay Packers Official (American football) Jake Delhomme Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl V Randy Moss Water polo Brett Favre Poker jargon New York Jets XFL Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXVI Arizona State University Lacrosse Softball Kurt Warner Table tennis Larry Johnson (football) Passer rating Vince Lombardi Deion Sanders NFL Most Valuable Player Award Terrell Owens Jevon Kearse Lineman (football) Super Bowl XV Offensive team Basketball Team Fortress Classic Ra (board game) Major professional sports league John Elway Blackjack San Diego Chargers Baseball Stars Toronto Raptors Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXXV Oakland Raiders Cris Carter

what team do you think has the best shot at winning the national championchip this year in ncaa football the three teams that stand out to me are usc lsu and michigan usc's lineup is stacked from top to bottom plus i think that they have a better chance of going undefeated than either lsu or michigan lsu has a great defense but they can't lose more than games in the sec without making the bcs championship game if they get into too many shootouts with in conference teams i don't see them making it michigan is a veteran team that's solid all around they have a strong o line and top level qb rb and wr their defense is also pretty good at the line and defensive back positions i think it wouldn't be out of the question to suggest a michigan usc championship but right now i'll take usc over lsu in the final game  NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Nick Saban USC Trojans Football BCS title game Mack Brown Texas Longhorn Athletics NCAA Division I-A national football champions 2004 College World Series Tulane University Cleveland Browns Auburn University College basketball Houston Nutt NBA Finals 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Arkansas Razorbacks University of Michigan Big East Conference NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship January 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports New York Jets Norway national football team University of Southern California Cincinnati Bengals New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets College football New York Giants Boston College Athletics Buffalo Bills Playoff Michigan Wolverines Miami Dolphins Joe Paterno Rose Bowl (game) Louisiana State University New York Knicks Brazil national football team National Football League Lore October 2005 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers National Basketball Association FA Cup March 2005 in sports Larry Bird Volleyball Bear Bryant Super Bowl I Atlantic Coast Conference Iron Bowl All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Indiana Pacers Dallas Cowboys Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII Baseball The Football League College rivalry Super Bowl XXXIV Penalty shootout (football) Ice hockey San Francisco 49ers Italy national football team Troms__ I.L.

could the nfl be rigged this question isnt an easy answer and through cases i will explain why case the patriots win the super bowl after the attack on our country would make sense nfl trying to unite our country even the logo was patriotic picture of an america with red white and blue across it the pats started before and after they went on to win the super bowl completly out of the blue they went the year before case the texans have the first pick in the draft and look clear on taking the best player the draft as seen in years reggie bush hurricane katrina happens they pick williams and the saints whadu know get thier savior reggie bush the go onto have a great season again kind of out of the blue and unite the devestated city these are just a few scenarios but all seem too coincidental to me let me know what you think anything's possible but rigging anything in the nfl would be very difficult it would be possible that a team could intentionally choketo satisfy gamblers ala baseball's black sox but the huge salaries in the nfl and playoff super bowl money make that highly unlikely in addition any such conspiracy theory would require the involvement of dozens if not hundreds of individuals who would have to be absolutely silent to their involvement something i find to be absolutely impossible in today's modern age as to your specific case scenarios case the patriots sometimes the team gets a boost when they substitute in a new qb like the pats did when bledsoe got injured i don't think anyone particulary afc defensive co ordinators knew how good brady was also you have to take into account the fact that the pats upgraded their defense and there really was not a dominant afc team in the post elway afc you are also ignoring the fact that bill bellichek figured out that you shut down kurt warner and the ram's offense by flooding the backfield with db's rather than blitzing all the time case you have to remember that there was a degree of controvery swirling around reggie bush at the time of the draft yahoo news had broken the story that bush received payments from an individual who was going to be his agent the texans must have looked at the situation and decided that there were risks to drafting a player with legal and ethical baggage also there may be a dispute over commissions that the texans would not want to be dragged into  St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns Carolina Panthers New York Jets National Football League Lore Cincinnati Bengals American Football League Dallas Cowboys Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXXI Indianapolis Colts Miami Dolphins Super Bowl Super Bowl XXVII Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXIV September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXVI Denver Broncos San Francisco 49ers Tennessee Titans John Elway Super Bowl XXI 2005 NFL season Super Bowl IX Kurt Warner Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl X Tom Brady Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXV NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Drew Bledsoe World Series Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XIV Boston Red Sox Super Bowl XXXVIII October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXIII San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 American football New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXV New Orleans Saints Toronto Blue Jays Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XI Philadelphia Eagles Brett Favre Major League Baseball television contracts Houston Texans NFL playoffs, 2004-05 January 2005 in sports Super Bowl V Peyton Manning Salary cap Super Bowl XIII Dan Marino Plame affair Washington Redskins Super Bowl XVI NFL Draft Super Bowl XVIII Minnesota Vikings 1919 World Series Super Bowl XVII Monday Night Football Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XX Super Bowl I Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl II Professional American football championship games International League Match fixing Super Bowl XXIII Bud Adams Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl VII Reggie Jackson NFL playoffs Super Bowl XII Chicago White Sox Madden NFL Ben Roethlisberger Cris Carter
