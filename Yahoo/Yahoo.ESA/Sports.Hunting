mule deer i live in indiana where we only have whitetail and wanted to know the difference between it and a mule deer is it an actually different species or simply a geological divide bettween two populations mule deer as you have already been told are a liitle bigger in body size and their coats are a tad darker almost gray many states out your way have mixed populations of both whitetail and mulies the mule deer seem to like hanging out in rocky hills and mountain sides and the valleys and plains where most whitetails seem to prefer woods forests and more natural cover area's the biggest difference i notice immediately is the whitetail runs and leaps pretty far and fast mule deer look like they are bouncing as they run off once you see that it will be easy to spot the difference even at a distance  Mule Deer Red Deer Deer Species Yosemite Valley Bryce Canyon National Park Rocky Mountains Grand Teton National Park Glacier National Park (US) Tick Geography of India Sierra Nevada (US) Shenandoah National Park Yellowstone National Park Zion National Park White-tailed Deer Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Yosemite National Park Montana Fast bowling Mule Mountains California black oak Table tennis Geography of the United States Hampshire County, West Virginia Colorado Geography of Canada Lewis and Clark National Forest Guadalupe Mountains National Park Geography of China Erie Canal Europe Great Basin St. Louis County, Missouri Professional wrestling attacks Puma Appalachian Mountains Gray Wolf Biology of the Sierra Nevada Death Valley National Park Alberta Mount St. Helens Comanche Adirondack Mountains Unicorn Capercaillie Mule Horse Lake District Wood Western United States Geology of the Moon New Forest A151 road Tyrannosaurus rex Black Hills Pennsylvania Modoc County, California Piney Woods Geography of Russia Chevrotain Equine conformation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir Island Fox Wind River Range Henry W.

what is more human a bo n arrow or gage i'm not into hunting i like guns but not to do any harm to animals if you are not wasting the animal then i understand i was curious though which is a quicker kill and or less painful i know my uncle prefres a bo lol my bad i ment humane do you know how exactly a bow or a shotgun kill animals an arrows point will start cutting vessels and if you hit the heart lungs it suts them wide open and they pretty much die from blood loss and the split lungs heart doesnt help it live either a shotgun kills by brute force in which when it hits the animal it sends them into shock because its a big chunk of lead that hits very hard they die from that and the blood loss too some say shotguns are more humane than rifles and bows but i cant possibly see that i think bows are the most humane and the most challenging  Shotgun Terminal ballistics Rifle Archery Unreal Weapon Team Fortress Classic Marathon (computer game) Firearm Fox hunting Shotgun shell English longbow Heart Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stopping power Tenshinhan Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RuneScape quests Battles of Lexington and Concord Quake III Arena Doom enemies Blood (computer game) The Covenant Circulatory system Perfect Dark GunZ The Duel Bow (weapon) Shooting sports Punisher Shock First Battle of the Atlantic BloodRayne Trench warfare Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Bong Jet Force Gemini Theory of conduct YuYu Hakusho Equine conformation Lung cancer Kashrut Pulmonary embolism The Cure Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape weapons Yusuke Urameshi Half-Life: Opposing Force Hunting Electroshock gun Final Fantasy XI Diablo II SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Naval mine Gibs Turok: Rage Wars Cancer Cocaine Bioinformatics Poker jargon Technology in the Stargate universe Wolfrider Beryllium Computer chess Stroke Lung Directed-energy weapon Combine (Half-Life 2) Manhunt (video game) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Trapping Reptile Battlefield 2 Rod Stewart Kammerlader Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening RuneScape skills Hitman (computer game) Dehydration The Suffering (game) Cobra Commander Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Medicine .22 Long Rifle Battle of Jutland Suicide methods Kryptonite Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ammunition USS Washington (BB-56) War of the Pacific Pitaten Blood Naruto jutsu Organ transplant

at which velocity is an airgun pellet gun fatal to a human just wanna make sure i dont buy one thats too powerful humans are funny sometimes we are very hard to kill cent other times it is abnormally easy a normal pellet gun is going to shoot between fps that is enough to penetrate the skin normally that wouldn't be fatal the bullet does not have enough mass to cause tissue damage from impact you will bleed and it will hurt extremely bad but a shot anywhere on the body wouldn't kill you however it is possible to shoot someone in the head and kill them it would be very unlikely to get a hit in the temple or whatever place is most vulnerable plus even if you did it is not likely going to kill anyone i would say children are most susceptible to major injury occurring since they are smaller however unlikely it is i am quite certain it is possible to kill someone when something is moving that fast i mean i have heard of people who die from getting hit in the head from a baseball you'd think you would end up with just a welt but to some it can be fatal always be careful and know where that pellet is going to go  Terminal ballistics Airsoft Shotgun Blood (computer game) Traumatic brain injury Railgun Carbine Motorcycle helmet Internal ballistics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Quake III Arena Pellet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Pain Rifle Hand grenade First aid Doom enemies Project Orion Paintball Natural Selection (computer game) Counter-Strike GunZ The Duel Domestic rabbit Gun safety Tribes 2 Handloading Fast bowling Trench warfare Domestic violence Shell (projectile) Cephalic disorder Intracranial pressure Diving Non-lethal force Cancer John F.

should i mount a big deer head in my house i think it would be good to hunt a deer and mount it its a great idea and it doesn't have to be a trophy deer either i mount all the animals i hunt cos its a way of keeping the memory alive of the the hunt itself and more importantly of the animal you hunted just dont hunt the deer only for the mount cos huntings about alot more than that and if you do go hunting and get the mount hang the mount in a place its gonna be safe cos wives and girlfriends tend to get very unreasonable around these things you might just come home one day only to find a family portrait in its place  Fox hunting Hunting Game (food) Trigonometric function Deer Key Deer White-tailed Deer Fallow Deer Hampshire County, West Virginia Poaching Yellowstone National Park Medieval hunting Red Deer Trigonometric identity Pentagram Unicorn Southeast Asia Cheetah Mushroom hunting The Deer Hunter Prehistoric Britain Paragliding Terminal ballistics American Bison Transformation problem Olduwan Brown Bear EastEnders Mandan Windsor Great Park Tyrannosaurus rex Mountaineering Animal rights David Hume Whaling Leopard Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising Jackalope Working animal Mount Sinai, New York Ostrich Sir Gawain and the Green Knight Conker's Bad Fur Day Pitaten Mount Everest Trapping Cat Northern Michigan Taiwanese aborigines Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Monpa Reindeer Battle of Britain Irish Elk Theodore Roosevelt Sika Deer Kodocha General Grievous Puma Gray Wolf Archery Natufian culture Wildlife Triad Billboard (advertising) AFI 100 Years series Jennifer Lopez Inuit Friends Livestock Atomic Kitten Advance Wars: Dual Strike Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 1957 World Series Animism Tiger .44 Magnum Ten Commandments Sonic the Hedgehog Stag hunt Park Firearm Mars Exploration Rover A-ha Breaker Morant Hogwarts Houses Fairfax County Public Schools All Good Things...

whats the best load for the remington skeet i just purchased a remington and she's a guage with a inch barrel i have read for a few months how some people have problems with it cycling shells and also how the rings go bad i know they are easy to replace but how often do you realistically have to do it and im wondering what shells have the most success i shoot mostly skeet but sometimes light bird any ideas what loads work i'm a gunsmith and remington repair tech the is a fine gun and despite what you have heard the majority of ejection problems are from poorly reloaded shotshells and not so much gun issues the was manufactured as an upgrade to the older remington model semi auto yes in fact the seals go bad but not often and not because of use per sea the gas seals are permiable rubber and rubber has a tendency to dry out combine this with the gases that the shells produce as the gun cycles as it's fired and the occasionally lose their seal i say occasionally because it will usually take several thousand rounds of shells to be fired before this even will be an issue i see more guns come into my shop because they are put away and not fired for years and the seals dry out from lack of use then from being fired regularly the seals are quite easy to replace and at the same time you change them you clean the built up carbon and powder residue and you're good to go for another year or so as far as shells go the remington will shoot pretty much any factory made shell with peak performance the shell choice as well as shot size is of course up to you to decide i shoot trap and i use winchester aa's for that and hunting dove hope this answers your question feel free to ask should you have any more concerns  Shotgun Cartridge (firearms) M16 (rifle) Krag-J__rgensen Firearm Internal ballistics Wildcat cartridge Handloading 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Bullet Revolver Jarmann M1884 Airsoft Beretta 92F/FS Ammunition Suppressor Air gun Rifle Machine gun Gun barrel Remington Arms .44 Magnum M60 machine gun Shell (projectile) .22 Long Rifle Kammerlader Tire Thermal power station 88 mm gun 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Mini-14 Tank M4 Carbine Lee-Enfield Carbine Rimfire Skeet shooting Bayonet Punisher Dry cleaning Sniper rifle Mauser Trap shooting Repeating rifle GLOCK Carburetor Diving suit Terminal ballistics Messerschmitt Bf 109 Artillery Mortar (weapon) Spark plug XM8 rifle Dairy FN FAL U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance First Battle of the Atlantic E85 Bofors 40 mm gun Anti-aircraft warfare Coal Remington M1867 Typewriter Heinkel He 112 Remington 870 Teen Girl Squad Remington model 7600 rifle Colt Commando Terran (StarCraft) SA80 Gauge (bore diameter) AK-47 Explosive material Colt Single Action Army handgun M40 (rifle) Remington 700 Flintlock M1 Carbine Ashton-Tate M61 Vulcan Scientology beliefs and practices Hydrogen economy Floppy disk M1911 T-64 Fossil fuel power plant Steyr Mannlicher M1894 MS-06 Zaku II Carbon dioxide

what should i get a glock or a mm rem mag what are your reasons it depends on what you want to do if you just want to target shoot a glock would be better however i wouldn't suggest buying a glock i'm just not a fan of them if you ever want to hunt the mm would be the better option the glock although i suggest buying a springfield xd would be cheaper in the long run because of the cheap well cheaper these days pistol ammo if you just want something to shoot at the range whenever don't buy a high caliber rifle because the cost of cartridges will seriously dent your wallet a pistol would be easier to use for a beginning shooter i assume and more practical overall  Carbine Rifle Cartridge (firearms) .22 Long Rifle Air gun .45 ACP .357 SIG Internal ballistics Firearm Concealed carry (USA) Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Shotgun Krag-J__rgensen 10 mm Auto Counter-Strike .44 Magnum Machine gun Suppressor Ammunition Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Terminal ballistics Pistol .40 S&W Revolver Sniper rifle Kammerlader ISSF shooting events Desert Eagle M16 (rifle) Shooting sports Submachine gun 5.56 x 45 mm NATO M1911 Mini-14 GLOCK 23 Springfield 1903 rifle M82 (rifle) Wildcat cartridge Varmint rifle Airsoft Rimfire Shotgun shell Smith & Wesson SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Mauser .30-06 Springfield .45 GAP Assault rifle Half-Life M1 Carbine GLOCK 19 Handloading 9 mm Luger Cowboy action shooting Beretta 92F/FS SKS Punisher Sniper Medium machine gun External ballistics Heckler & Koch G3 Quake III Arena Heckler & Koch MP5 25 m Rapid Fire Pistol Half-Life: Opposing Force M60 machine gun Rifling Makarov PM Flintlock Bullet Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Mossberg 500 Team Fortress Classic Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics Saturday night special Deus Ex: Invisible War Turok: Rage Wars Heckler & Koch USP T-72 Personal weapon AR-15 Webley and Scott Caliber SA80 Halo 2 Tribes 2 Marathon (computer game) Lee-Enfield Accuracy International AWM Jet Force Gemini Firearm action Armored Core Poker jargon 7.62 x 39 mm Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Star Wars: Battlefront II Star Wars: Battlefront National Rifle Association

how does the loading and firing mechanism of an ar work i recently came upon a video of the systema training weapon system which uses airsoft technology to simulate real weaponry unlike most airsoft guns however these weapons are modified to be as realistic as possible by doing things other airsoft guns cannot such as lock the trigger upon running out of ammunition which brings me to my point when loading in a fresh magazine is there a button or catch on the side of the ar series rifles that one can press to chamber in a round without pulling back the cocking handle i ask this because this is a requirement on the systema ptw yes the gas operated firearm locks its bolt back on an empty magazine upon firing the last shot there is a button a mechanical lever on the left hand side of the gun that releases the bolt under spring pressure shoving a bullet from another mag into the chamber eugene stoner is the man  Airsoft Firearm M16 (rifle) Machine gun Heckler & Koch G3 Internal ballistics Air gun Revolver M60 machine gun Cartridge (firearms) Krag-J__rgensen M4 Carbine AK-47 Heckler & Koch MP5 AK-74 Pump-action Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Ammunition M1 Garand GLOCK Gun safety Mauser Springfield 1903 rifle Firearm action Bolt action Jarmann M1884 Beretta 92F/FS M82 (rifle) Handloading MG42 Carbine FN F2000 Crossbow Suppressor Concealed carry (USA) Kammerlader FN FAL Lee-Enfield Sniper rifle Paintball Sniper Speedloader Paintball marker Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Combine (Half-Life 2) Terminal ballistics Marathon (computer game) Personal weapon Pistol Punisher Heckler & Koch G11 SKS Heckler & Koch PSG1 Recoil operation Saiga-12 .44 Magnum Makarov PM M1 Carbine Rocket propelled grenade Archery AR-10 Colt Single Action Army handgun QBZ-95 Lewis Gun Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver Artillery Weapon Heckler & Koch G36 MP18 M1911 Steyr Mannlicher M1901 M249 Cowboy action shooting Game controller Perfect Dark La France M16K Tank .303 British .22 Long Rifle Columbine High School massacre Assault rifle Browning Model 1919 machine gun Wildcat cartridge .30-06 Springfield M3 Grease Gun Bubble Bobble SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Submachine gun 5.56 x 45 mm NATO

has anyone hunted bear whats it like i've hunted black and brown bears for many years in central and northern canada i'm from maryland the group i go with hunts with bows and arrows as well as firearms modern rifles and black powder in canada the majority of hunters hunt over garbage piles that include renderings from meat processing plants animal organs fat bones stale bread regular household garbage the garbage is thrown onto the ground in a pile and then flattened cardboard boxes are laid down on top to cover the piles of garbage the guides usually have a number of these piles that they check on a regular basis to see if any bears have been eating the garbage the bears knock the cardboard off the tops of these piles to get to the stuff underneath it stinks pretty bad and the flies are horrible but it works all of the time we usually hunt from tree stands above these gut piles and wait for the bears to come into the baits to feed usually late afternoon bears have excellent hearing and sense of smell so you must be quiet and limit your movement in the tree stand bears are amazing creatures because they can run through the thickest brush you can imagine and not make a noise if it wasn't for their size and color it would be difficult to spot them i've had many experiences where i heard and saw nothing only to suddenly look up and a bear is there and only ' away on the bait pile you have to take your time and make the best shot possible bears are hundreds of pounds of freight train moving muscle and you have to hit them well to put them down quickly or be ready for a real hike trying to find it once wounded it's a real adrenneline rush to climb down from your stand to ground level knowing you are about to go looking for these creatures with big teeth and the obvious danger that you face just being there i have killed to date the biggest was a lb grizzley in british columbia in and i shot him with a smith wesson model magnum barrel handgun at yards away i remember that trip like it was yesterday just to let you know bear meat is quite good actually you must trime off all of the fat and slow cook it but it's delicious and i've eaten it many times still have some in my freezer here at home if you get the chance to go bear hunting go you will never forget the experience or the rush  Internal ballistics Shotgun American Black Bear Terminal ballistics Gray Wolf Archery Poker jargon Sin City Punisher Mario series enemies Firearm Teen Girl Squad The Legend of Zelda series enemies .44 Magnum Blood (computer game) RuneScape skills Rifle Mountaineering RuneScape quests Combine (Half-Life 2) Equine conformation Tank Tag Comanche Revolver Dog English longbow Richard Chase Compost Happy Tree Friends Jackass: The Movie American Bison Tobacco Shotgun shell Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day Cleveland Browns Battleship 2000 Australian Grand Prix Trapping .22 Long Rifle Mach kernel Escape from New York Krag-J__rgensen Columbine High School massacre 1957 World Series Conker's Bad Fur Day Naruto jutsu Pistol One Piece minor characters Professional wrestling throws Horse Diseases of the honeybee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mixed martial arts Hamster Perfect Dark Vermicompost Professional wrestling slang Kakapo Ammunition Handloading New York Giants Lee-Enfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Unreal Battles of Lexington and Concord Drizzt Do'Urden Leopard Norway national football team Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cuisine of Denmark P-38 Lightning Manhunt (video game) Trench warfare Guilty Gear Hey Jude Skunk Pittsburgh Steelers Syphon Filter M16 (rifle) Volleyball Piccolo Junior Saga Bread Kangaroo USS West Virginia (BB-48) Whaling Semi-automatic self-loading pistol RuneScape Random Events Pikmin Bow (weapon) Diablo II USS Tunny (SS-282)

registering a pistol whenever i've bought a gun in the past it's been from a dealer store so they register it then i just bought a pistol from my friend so how where do i get it registered it's illegal to carry an unregistered weapon even with a cc permit correct i live in georgia what state do you live in chances are you don't have to register anything a private sale is a private sale it's just like him selling you candy or a video game gun stores are ffl federal firearms license permit holders and they don't register a gun to you per se they just make you fill out the paperwork to make sure you're elgible to buy it but in a private sale no such paperwork is needed i don't believe except in gun unfriendly states like california illinoise etc guns need to be registered although technically a record is kept of the sale and maybe thats what you mean by registered it's legal in most states to carry openly on person open carry or in a vehicle however once you conceal the gun you need a concealed firearms permit that's why it's called a concealed permit i recommend signing a piece of paper stating he's transferring the gun to you with the serial make model caliber etc on it so if something happens eg it gets stolen or used in a crime it wont come back registered to him  Gun politics in the United States Gun politics Firearm Airsoft Beltway sniper attacks Gun control in the United States (by state) Federal assault weapons ban Pistol Machine gun Gun Control Act of 1968 Carbine Trademark GLOCK Firearm case law Cartridge (firearms) Submachine gun Grand Theft Auto III National Firearms Act Ammunition National Rifle Association Vehicle registration plate M1911 Shotgun Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Assault rifle Warez Security (finance) Copyright infringement of software Digital rights management Heckler & Koch MP5 Sawn-off shotgun Copyright SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Moonshine Medical prescription Prohibition (drugs) Technology in the Stargate universe Air gun Murder Police California government and politics M60 machine gun Illegal drug trade Taxation in the United States Punisher Counter-Strike Copy protection Prohibition M1 Carbine Assault weapon Public domain Revolver Video game controversy John Browning Sten Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Webley and Scott Berkshire Hathaway GoldenEye Columbine High School massacre Suppressor Desert Eagle Notary public Identity theft Artillery Mumia Abu-Jamal M82 (rifle) FairTax Telephone tapping Pornography Israeli Military Industries Medium machine gun German car number plates UK Singles Chart DVD Terminal ballistics Rifle Confidence trick Poker jargon Microeconomics Caliber Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Let's Make a Deal Atari 8-bit family .22 Long Rifle Alcoholic beverage Rules of the road Internal ballistics .357 SIG Democratic Party (United States) Sears Holdings Corporation ITunes Music Store Apple Computer Battlefield 2 US and Canadian license plates

why all the debate over what guns are better yes i know i love them too and can spend hours looking over the fine points of this or that but it seems that many of the questioners are more obsessed by a specific thing than the ability to shoot at something every and i mean every firearm i have owned has worked flawlessly not always as accuratly as i would prefer but certainly as well as to be expected so when someone asks what is the best this or the best that i have to wonder unless you need a very specific thing the main thing is how well you shoot it any gun in well practiced hands is deadly any round can kill the real question is back to basics can you put it in the ring when you need to anyone agree i think you make an excellent point i also think people on here don't want to research and decide for themselves they just want an answer that sums it all up so many guns and so many rounds along with all the countless options make for a lot of variables and therefore a lot of questions i think its the american way bigger means better etc what we are going to end up with is a bunch of tank owners shooting paper targets at yards  Archery Ammunition Gun politics Columbine High School massacre Firearm Social rule Cartridge (firearms) Gun politics in the United States Bowling for Columbine Theory of conduct Sin City Shotgun Microeconomics Terminal ballistics Beltway sniper attacks Sexual orientation M16 (rifle) Heinkel He 112 Quake III Arena Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Gun control in the United States (by state) Terran (StarCraft) Paintball Knots Landing Handloading America's Army Krag-J__rgensen Tri-Stat dX EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Tank Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sniper Gun safety Poker jargon Bad Wolf Counter-Strike The nature of God in Western theology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside YuYu Hakusho M60 machine gun Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Battle of the Bulge Tag Economics T-72 American football strategy Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Machine gun Objective-C God Emperor of Dune Gunsmith Cats Transformation problem GLOCK Economic inequality Jennifer Lopez Bullet Escape from New York Carbine ALGOL 68 Betting (poker) Global Liberation Army American Psycho U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Surplus value Concealed carry (USA) Avenue Q 88 mm gun Armoured warfare The Amber Spyglass Contract Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Prices of production Species The Apprentice 2 Science Epistemology Syphon Filter Time Out of Mind Cannon Software engineering Craps Human Normal distribution Gun barrel John Lott Seventh Sea (collectible card game) BZFlag Mathematics Taxi Driver M242 Grand Theft Auto (game) Fahrenheit 9/11 Extreme Championship Wrestling Friends The Usual Suspects Internal ballistics

finally proof that not hunting makes you gay http www worldnetdaily com news article asp article id in this article the writer who is actually a health food pinko go figure speaks against soy based products of any kind and seeks to ensure real protein is a consistant part of everones diet since soy is one of the primary ways that the health food types get their protein does that mean that eventually all vegans become gay really i'm going huntin' actually i really want to hear from people who are all the above concerning this issue i will get some very nasty replies but i want to see what people think of the article my apologies if i offend you but i am not afraid to speak or act as necessary cheers you know other than zeebya the gays and vegans had far more intellectual responses to this question i think it is legitimite though the words may have been poorly chosen initially for this forum as we have had several discussions on the value of protein and hunting to deliver it boker i wont even waste words on your enlightened smirk intellect this question was designed clearly to outline the dumbassery of the author and his right wing approach to encapsulate all things misunderstood i like soy i have been having sex with women for over years now this article wont change any of that zeebya in response to your edit also when it comes to my position on gays i could give a shi i place my value on the human and not their sexual preferences frankly i think the guy is a complete quack and deserves the ridicule he has recieved from these questions i used the entry question to pis people off and get them to respond it worked my real reason for generating the question was that my son is months old and due to unfortunate circumstances can only drink soy formula i would really like to know the truth about the impact of estrogen on a male infant thanks for the feedback folks i will leave it open for a while if you want to continue snapper head is that the best you can do that was just a cheap shot with no substance or thought at least think about it and get back to me trust me my son is the most normal person in my family good at least we know where you stand if not how yeah i added hotsauce to my crow too thanks for all the input good bad indifferent hey i'm gay and i'm not a vegan and i enjoy hunting and fishing i am also pro gun possession and i'm fully capable of beating the crap out of bigoted homophobes any other stupid questions you'd like to post and in response to your further edit you sound like you're talking out of both sides of your mouth what's your point are you for this article or against it are you pro gay or anti gay by the way i read the article and i think the author is a jerk soy causes males to be homosexual sh it i've been gay all my life yes from the time i was i knew and i've never touched any soy products other than the occasional soy sauce on my chinese food where does this idiot get his facts from i also know plenty of men who consume large amounts of soy products that are perfectly heterosexual as to hunting being the playground of males look at african lions it's almost always the female who brings down a kill i don't think the author is a pinko but rather another homophobe i am living proof that gay men can be very macho a lot of people think i remind them of indiana jones i'd say that's pretty macho and to shon below you wanna take a shot at me it better be a good one the first time because if it ain't i'll handle you like the coward you are sir i'm sorry to hear of your son's health issues but at least you have a handle on his needs i make no claims to know about whether overdoses of estrogen can somehow cause a tendency toward homosexuality i would say it's not terribly likely but again i'm not a biologist i will say that just as it's possible for me to be openly gay while not using soy products it should be just as possible for someone using soy products to be heterosexual maybe this is racist but look at how many asians use soy as a basic staple in their diet i don't think they have any higher or lower instance of homosexuality than any other racial or cultural group sorry if i seemed snappish but you said it yourself you posted the question the way you did in order to get a rise out of people well i rose to the bait guess i should look before i leap huh besides i

is it legal if i shoot a air rifle when im far away from any houses or public walkways i live by chicago i would suggest you call a non emergency police number in your city and ask a law enforcement officer different cities have different rules but i would think most would consider a pellet or bb or shot a projectile if it is being propelled by air so it probably would be considered a firearm do a search online just for kicks on the brady campaign and they list some firearm related info by state i don't think they get into city laws chicago is by far one of the most restrictive as far as gun laws are concerned so you can get yourself into trouble very quickly and without knowing it if you don't know the rules if someone in the general public population sees you out with an air rifle from any kind of distance it is very difficult for them to tell whether its a toy air rifle real rifle etc and some people get shot by law enforcement for what ends up being a toy gun i would personally avoid carrying one around and shooting one but thats a personal choice  Airsoft Gun politics National Rifle Association Air gun Shotgun Terminal ballistics Internal ballistics Rifle Gun politics in the United States Police Concealed carry (USA) Cartridge (firearms) Assault rifle Gun control in the United States (by state) Pistol Ammunition Electroshock gun Sniper rifle Civil disturbances and military action in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Lee-Enfield M16 (rifle) Weapon Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Shotgun shell Federal assault weapons ban Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Israeli police Gun safety Stopping power North Hollywood shootout Sniper Gun barrel .357 SIG Beltway sniper attacks Bulletproof vest Punisher M1 Carbine Road-rule enforcement camera Counter-Strike Projectile AK-47 Krag-J__rgensen Gun Control Act of 1968 Directed-energy weapon Bullet Railgun Tribes 2 Saturday night special Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Sarah Brady John Allen Muhammad National Firearms Act 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory New Zealand Police Democratic Party (United States) Firearm case law Rifling SWAT Suppressor Pellet Football (soccer) Mossberg 500 Assault weapon Tank Archery Murder Trench warfare Coilgun Smoothbore New York City Police Department National Police Agency (Republic of China) Plame affair Muzzleloader Columbine High School massacre Technology in the Stargate universe External ballistics Coercion Copyleft Team Fortress Classic Combine (Half-Life 2) M82 (rifle) Policing in the United Kingdom Weathermen John Lott Citizens' band radio Webley and Scott Personal weapon International law Easement Law Varmint rifle Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Leonard Peltier Quake III Arena

air rifle power upgrade i want to get a logun gladi or and the power will be below ft lbs limit what i want to know is if it can be upgraded to the higher ft lbs mark also would it be possible to do it very easily myself or would i have to take it to a gunsmith and finally if i did take it to a gunsmith to get it done about how much will it cost to get it upgraded p s i know i will need an fac for an upgrade according to the specs on this rifle i don't know how either is possible a at fps is going to have nowhere near ft lbs not unless it can push a gr pellet at fps and i highly doubt that air gun manufacturers are in the habit of using light er weight pellets so that they can exaggerate the fps of their air guns gr fps ft lbs would be more like it logan gladi or http www pyramydair com cgi bin model pl model id referer it's a pcp not a sp air rilfe http www pyramydair com  Pound Cartridge (firearms) First-person shooter Krag-J__rgensen Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Natural Selection (computer game) M16 (rifle) Internal ballistics Tribes 2 Battlefield 2 Counter-Strike A-10 Thunderbolt II Browning Model 1919 machine gun Rifle Frame rate Shotgun Firearm .357 SIG Mitsubishi 3000GT Helicopter Marilyn Monroe Machine gun RX-78 mobile suit series Laptop Gunsmith Carbine OV-10 Bronco AK-47 MS-06 Zaku II Cessna T-37 Pagani Sniper rifle Sound Blaster Web server F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Mouse (computing) Assault rifle Railgun Turbocharger Laser applications .303 British Computer and video game genres ZGMF-XX09T DOM Trooper Team Fortress Classic Tank Airbus A320 Bullet Beretta 92F/FS Ruger 10/22 M14 (rifle) MSA-0011 S Gundam E85 Mega Man X (character) Nuclear fuel cycle Sturmgewehr 44 Video F-16 Fighting Falcon Colt Commando Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Porsche 911 SA80 F/A-18 Hornet GunZ The Duel M4 Carbine Star Trek: First Contact Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk Apple Macintosh Lee-Enfield Gunsmith Cats Terminal ballistics Bren Mercury Cougar M1 Carbine Cannon Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Armored Core Remington Arms Medium machine gun Beretta Varmint rifle Panzer I B-26 Marauder ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Sega CD Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Quake 4 ZGMF-X12 Gundam Astray Out Frame Webley and Scott Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Indian Army M60 machine gun Wildcat cartridge F-15 Eagle Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Nintendo 64 Hard disk Sport utility vehicle Messerschmitt Bf 109

is the henry acu bolt lr a good med range coyote hunting rifle by med range i mean from yrds and nothing over yards as a gunsmith and a gun shop owner and year varmint hunter i can tell you without any doubt that the henry in standard long rifle caliber is a waste of money if you intend to take coyote at yards or further however if you bought the same rifle in hmr caliber costs the same thats a whole different story the lr lacks stopping power and unless you make a good head shot the coyote is going to disappear as in run away under his own power the hmr on the other hand is a smaller bullet but it's loaded into a necked down magnum case and shoots with much more muzzle velocity and shoots much flatter with reduced bullet drop and incredible energy and impact i have killed coyotes with my hmr custom remington at yards without difficulty there is just no comparison between the lr and the hmr the ammunition for the hmr is somewhat expensive but what would you rather do put them down or spend hours searching for wounded coyotes shot with a lr or spend a few dollars more for ammunition that will do the job i have sold over new hmr caliber rifles in my shop already this year and i can't manage to keep them in stock that should tell you something  .22 Long Rifle .17 HMR Shotgun Rimfire Krag-J__rgensen Carbine 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Varmint rifle Rifle Terminal ballistics Firearm Wildcat cartridge Cartridge (firearms) Assault rifle Ammunition M16 (rifle) Sniper rifle .44 Magnum Jarmann M1884 .22 WMR Sniper Machine gun .17 HM2 Airsoft Suppressor .357 SIG Mini-14 Kammerlader Stopping power Air gun Bullet M60 machine gun Mauser M82 (rifle) .30-06 Springfield AK-74 Handloading External ballistics M1 Carbine Railgun .30 Carbine 10 mm Auto 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Punisher Accuracy International AWM Marathon (computer game) M40 (rifle) Heckler & Koch MP5 .303 British Field Artillery in the American Civil War Shell (projectile) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Repeating rifle SKS Beltway sniper attacks Shotgun shell Turok: Rage Wars M4 Carbine .45 ACP Gun safety Mossberg 500 Krag-Petersson Desert Eagle Remington Arms Doom enemies Trench warfare Personal weapon Remington M1867 Heckler & Koch G36 SA80 Cannon Tracer ammunition Lee-Enfield 7.62 x 39 mm Colt Commando Paintball Beretta 92F/FS Winchester Model 70 Archery .22 Long Wal-Mart The Inside Flintlock Sturmgewehr 44 United States Navy Mark 12 Mod X Special Purpose Rifle Directed-energy weapon .22 CB Equine conformation .45 GAP Long gun

does anyone hunt deer with a pistol if so what caliber and how succesful have you been at plus meters i am thinking about s w mag i recently shot this and liked the feel of the weapon would it be considered overkill for a deer though centerfire rifles are not legal for deer where i live indiana and scopes aren't legal for all hunting i've gone boar hunting with my s w magnum i can tell you that you probably need something bigger than magnuma and the s w magnum should do the job handgun rounds are generally less powerful than rifle rounds the moves at a relatively low velocity so i would not consider it overkill a well place shot at the spine or the vitals will guarantee a takedown  .44 Magnum Firearm Shotgun .22 Long Rifle Carbine Internal ballistics Cartridge (firearms) Terminal ballistics Rifle Assault rifle Desert Eagle 10 mm Auto Revolver Gun control in the United States (by state) Mini-14 Pistol Rimfire Varmint rifle Stopping power Bulletproof vest 7.62 x 39 mm Concealed carry (USA) Mauser Shotgun shell .38 Special Airsoft 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Krag-J__rgensen M1 Carbine Marathon (computer game) Air gun .22 WMR 9 mm Luger Punisher M82 (rifle) M60 machine gun Suppressor National Rifle Association Ammunition .40 S&W Fox hunting SKS Sniper Springfield 1903 rifle .500 S&W Professional wrestling throws Accuracy International AWM .30 Carbine Flintlock Heckler & Koch G3 North Hollywood shootout Machine gun M16 (rifle) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Jarmann M1884 ISSF shooting events Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Hunting Federal assault weapons ban .45 ACP Kammerlader Bullet Beretta 92F/FS M40 (rifle) Day of Defeat Caliber Archery Webley and Scott M240 .30-06 Springfield John Browning Personal weapon Lee-Enfield .50 Action Express AR-15 Jericho 941 Railgun Heckler & Koch MP5 Derringer Mortar (weapon) Paintball Shooting sports Gun barrel M4 Carbine Heckler & Koch USP Remington 870 Mossberg 500 Overkill (band) Sturmgewehr 44 Armour Bolt action Medium machine gun Israel Defense Forces Handloading Submachine gun AK-47

how does the gap compare to the acp the glock automatic pistol round was created to duplicate the performance of the acp in a mm pistol platform in other words a for smaller hands the gap is a higher pressure round than the acp it has to be to catch up to the acp some people believe it is actually a better stopper but that remains to be seen ballistically at least on paper they do compare favorably but the gap is harder to find it is more expensive only a few companies load it it doesn't interchange with the acp if you've got one cool if you have money to burn you might want to buy one of each and compare for yourself otherwise i'd stick with the acp unless i wanted something more powerful then i'd go with the mm or sig best h  GLOCK .45 ACP .45 GAP Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Terminal ballistics 10 mm Auto Internal ballistics M1911 .357 SIG Carbine Firearm Jericho 941 Smith & Wesson Machine gun Pistol Wildcat cartridge Suppressor Submachine gun Airsoft Concealed carry (USA) Heckler & Koch USP Cartridge (firearms) Revolver Assault rifle Heckler & Koch MP5 Derringer Shotgun Bullet Rifle Poker jargon Colt Single Action Army handgun U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Browning Hi-Power Makarov PM 401(k) Fountain pen Floppy disk M4 Carbine M16 (rifle) .22 Long Rifle Springfield 1903 rifle Punisher Thermal power station Hard disk Spark plug SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs .40 S&W Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver Counter-Strike 5.56 x 45 mm NATO HK P7 Krag-J__rgensen Thompson submachine gun John Browning Carburetor M60 machine gun Five-seveN London Underground Heckler & Koch G3 Shotgun shell Bluetooth Blackjack Transformer Air gun Welrod Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Speedloader Hydrogen economy MAC-10 Webley and Scott Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory M1 Carbine Bulletproof vest IBM PC compatible Bulk vending Mutual fund Computer virus Welding Tank Drill bit Uzi submachine gun Parachute Metal Slug Battlefield 2 Game controller .30 Carbine Personal weapon Nambu pistol Rolling-element bearing Fuel injection Half-Life: Opposing Force Overclocking Abortion Automatic teller machine JPEG Money .38 Super Walther PPK Grand Theft Auto (game)

best scope for a i live in australia and the shots are usually long so what magnifaction to you recommend i dont really need to know any brands or models yet just what zoom magnification will depend on the type of hunting the game you are pursuing and the distance at which you will be engaging generally a or will be a good all around scope i caution you on higher powered optics unless you are going to be using a bipod or some type of shooting platform they can be frustrating when shooting from a unsupported position but that said if you are using a bipod or other means a or will work they excel for shooting small targets at great range from a solid platform i have two scopes for my one is a power and the other is a power the power is my hunting scope and stays with the rifle of the time i have the only for testing my reloaded ammo for accuracy and i use a table with the front and rear of the rifle stock supported with sand bags to keep those crosshairs stationary just keep in mind the higher the power the more concentration it takes to steady the gun when shooting unsupported  Sniper rifle Sniper Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory M16 (rifle) Shotgun Internal ballistics M60 machine gun Ammunition Rifle Star Wars: Battlefront Firearm Team Fortress Classic Quake III Arena Tank Carbine Heckler & Koch G3 Cartridge (firearms) Day of Defeat Air gun M82 (rifle) Unreal Tournament 2004 United States Navy Mark 12 Mod X Special Purpose Rifle Assault rifle Bow (weapon) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Varmint rifle 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Binoculars Archery Half-Life Krag-J__rgensen Tribes 2 Medium machine gun Springfield 1903 rifle Revolver SKS Lee-Enfield Anchor T-72 Bullet Armored Core FN FAL Kb ppanc wz.35 Starsiege: Tribes Mini-14 SA80 Remington 700 Half-Life: Opposing Force Carl Gustav recoilless rifle Stopping power Tribes Aerial Assault Natural Selection (computer game) Rocket propelled grenade Kammerlader Bicycle lighting Jarmann M1884 SIG 550 Punisher .22 Long Rifle Combine (Half-Life 2) M14 (rifle) XM8 rifle Long gun External ballistics Accuracy International AWM Equine conformation Light gun Browning Automatic Rifle Modern equipment and uniform of the British Army Fire-control system Crossbow M67 recoilless rifle Heavy machine gun Lens (optics) Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando Battlefield 2 Marathon (computer game) Flintlock Diemaco C7 Jet Force Gemini Shooting sports GunBound Artillery Mauser General purpose machine gun Cheating in Counter-Strike Dragunov Golf club (equipment) Cannon Blood (computer game)

when shooting rifled deer slugs out of a smooth bore barrel should you use a choke if so what size full or do you just remove the choke altogether as a gunsmith you need to know that you can only shoot rifled slugs thru a modified or improved cylinder choke shotgun from your description you already made it clear that you have a choke on your barrel to be honest some slugs can cause barrel bulge as well as choke damage if fired thru a full choke too if your choke isn't adjustable for the modified or improved cylinder settings this is rarely the case i would avoid shooting slugs out of your adjustable choke gun all together if you wish to hunt with a full choke i reccomend you shoot sabot slugs thru your full choked gun these consist of a hardened lead or lead alloy slug that is molded inside a plastic piece sleeve as the projectile clears the muzzle of your shotgun barrel the plastic jacket sleeve falls away harmlessly and the smaller diameter projectile continues towards your intended target these are more expensive but at the same time they are more accurate than conventional rifled slugs and safer to shoot out of full choked shotguns i have had many customers who literally shot the choke completely off of the end of their shotgun barrels trying to shoot conventional regular slugs thru improperly choked shotguns if this is still a concern consider using another shotgun in place of the shotgun you want to use now better safe than sorry  Shotgun shell Bullet Internal ballistics Firearm Rifle M16 (rifle) Terminal ballistics Gun barrel Shotgun slug Mossberg 500 Sabot Gauge (bore diameter) Shell (projectile) Cartridge (firearms) Air gun Drill bit .22 Long Rifle Revolver Carbine Tank Artillery .44 Magnum Krag-J__rgensen Suppressor Jarmann M1884 Machine gun Assault rifle M60 machine gun Springfield 1903 rifle Kinetic energy penetrator Double-barreled shotgun Gunsmith Sniper Combine (Half-Life 2) Cowboy action shooting Handloading Wildcat cartridge Sawn-off shotgun Bong Gun safety Stopping power 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Flintlock Combat shotgun Field Artillery in the American Civil War Lee-Enfield Long gun High explosive anti-tank Kammerlader Metal Slug AK-47 Railgun GunBound Quake III Arena Gramophone record Shooting sports Remington 870 ISSF shooting events Pellet Heckler & Koch G3 Saiga-12 M4 Carbine Trench warfare Doom enemies Caliber External ballistics Sniper rifle AK-74 Beretta 92F/FS Explosive material Paintball marker Rifling Directed-energy weapon Casting Fox hunting Team Fortress Classic Blood (computer game) Punisher Tank gun Carburetor M1 Carbine Jet Force Gemini Sturmgewehr 44 XM8 rifle Heckler & Koch USP Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Bofors 40 mm gun Blood II: The Chosen Gerald Bull Archery Advanced Combat Rifle Sten .45 ACP

do you believe in overkill personally i don't believe there is such a thing you can never kill something too much am i saying you should use a bmg for squirl hunting no but if you do i don't really care and no one else should care either your not a very efficent hunter if you do but its a humane kill lets face it if someone was using a lot for deer hunting most people would say that it is overkill but so what if someone wants to use a lot for deer hunting nobody should give him her any greif if someone walks into a store and asks what should i use for deer hunting someone should say you might want to look into a or sir you probably don't need a i'm just saying nobody should get mad at anybody for using a larger than proficent cal if that makes any sense i do agree with the damaging of the meat i just hate it when people use a lr on coyots if anything is going to give peata more things to use against hunters its shooting animals with an unsuficent cal i do agree with the damaging of the meat i just hate it when people use a lr on coyots if anything is going to give peata more things to use against hunters its shooting animals with an unsufficent cal if some one wants to get the living he kicked out of them for the giggles that one thing so what if he wants to shoot prairie dogs with a win magnum i ve been known to shoot armadillos with my for giggles but there is items that will set me off quick using a monster magnum to make up for poor shot placement when the old boy cant kill a deer with a thanks well maybe if i use a win magnum i ll kill that deer this year those who wont the magnums so they can shoot deer at yards when they cant hit a bulls eye at yard using semi auto with high capacity magazines to make up for poor shot placement because they might need more then shots to kill that deer those who wont to under gun for anything like you said about the lr and coyotes i cant count how many times i have read questions on this forum can a caliber be used for deer because i m recoil sensitive i have bumped in to fools like this it is these people note i did not say hunters that are giving you and i a bad reputation if they cant kill a deer or other animal with a humane one shot kill they need to stay out of the woods if they are so recoil sensitive that they cant use a sufficient caliber weapon to do the job they need to stay out of the wood if they cant hit the bulls eye at yards don t shoot yards hunting and ethics go hand in hand true hunters respect the game they hunt and don t intentionally allow it to suffer if someone has the skill and wants to use a to shoot the heads off squirrel that his or her business i use a lr to save money and do the same job and giggle on how much money i saved over the person using the i cant help but wonder if we should not make everyone qualify each year with their weapons before being allowed to get a hunting license you don t get a drivers license or pilots license until you prove you can drive or fly granted nuts drunks and drug addicts still get to driver or flying but maybe it would stop some of them for the sake of our sport and the wildlife d hunting with rifle pistol muzzle loader and bow for over decades reloading rifle pistol and shotgun for over decades  Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Carbine Rifle Hunting Archery .44 Magnum Air gun M16 (rifle) .22 Long Rifle Revolver Marathon (computer game) Concealed carry (USA) Fox hunting Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Doom enemies Varmint rifle Gray Wolf Beretta 92F/FS Krag-J__rgensen Railgun Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sniper Mini-14 Sniper rifle M1 Carbine Sin City Grand Theft Auto (game) The Invisibles Stopping power Cat Red Deer Airsoft Unreal Counter-Strike Mauser Bow (weapon) Battlefield 2 Comanche Whaling Shotgun shell Handloading Punisher Theory of conduct .357 SIG 10 mm Auto Hitman (computer game) Dog YuYu Hakusho Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Suppressor GunBound Resident Evil (video game) Technology in the Stargate universe GunZ The Duel Ammunition Cartridge (firearms) Wildcat cartridge Trapping Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Tag Columbine High School massacre Paintball Trench warfare Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an M82 (rifle) Day of Defeat Wyatt Earp Bullet Equine conformation Sly Cooper M2 machine gun ISSF shooting events RuneScape skills Half-Life: Opposing Force Cheating in Counter-Strike Cincinnati Bengals The Covenant Shen Gong Wu Conker's Bad Fur Day

i dare you to answer this gun question i have asked this question before but no one seems to know i have spent so much time looking for the answer online i am ashamed to post it online i am trying to find the trigger pull for a standered factory double action colt annaconda i would like to know what the weight of the trigger pull is in double action mode pulling the trigger to fire and what it is in single action mode pulling the trigger to fire with hammer already up i would like the answer in pounds i do not have a device to measure it and it has been driving me crazy also i have noticed in a few gun articles that writers will sometimes refer to a weapon's trigger pull as smooth what does that mean if two different weapons are the exact same weight size caliber action with the exact same trigger pull weight would the feel of pulling the trigger be different for one than the other if it is different is it better to be smooth or not what does a smooth trigger pull mean dj if you claim that you can find it out online why didn't you furnish an answer i will tell you why i have looked through several search engines for over and a half hours and i can't find it and you couldn't either dj thanks for the other info though it was fairly helpful i love a challenge but this one is made simple by my work i am a gunsmith and i am colt trained and certified as a colt factory armorer tech the factory specifications for the colt anaconda are factory set at lbs or for double action and lbs or for single action respectfully the plus or minus addition to the poundage allows for quality control variables that occur during production manufacture colt had seven independant quality control points during the manufacturing phase to insure these control statndards are the same start to finish these quality control accuracy production tests cannot be duplicated simply by purchasing a trigger weight gauge and doing it at home for yourself we are talking lab controlled conditions here not guess work i personally prefer smith wessons but i also own more than a few colt wheelguns as well as a few semi automatics anyone who implicates the colt is sub standard or a problem gun must also be clueless to the incredible heritage and quality of colt handguns the tradition and the history lives on we have a saying in gunsmithing that goes anyone who doesn't appreciate the quality of colt and smith wesson handguns needs to have the nut on the grip replaced lol the rest of your questions regarding trigger smoothness have already been addressed here hope this answers your question finally  Revolver Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Firearm Cartridge (firearms) Shotgun M1911 Colt's Manufacturing Company Internal ballistics GLOCK Pistol Beretta 92F/FS Colt Single Action Army handgun M4 Carbine Machine gun Mouse (computing) Krag-J__rgensen Heckler & Koch USP M60 machine gun Concealed carry (USA) Browning Model 1919 machine gun Punisher Airsoft Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Heckler & Koch G3 Colt Python Carburetor Smith & Wesson XM8 rifle Ammunition Colt Commando Five-seveN .44 Magnum B-47 Stratojet Elevator Handloading Plame affair AK-47 Expert system Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Oscilloscope Heinkel He 112 Explosive material Personal weapon Mumia Abu-Jamal Carbine Syphon Filter Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Pound Poker jargon Kammerlader Quake III Arena Heinkel He 100 Enfield revolver John Browning Gravity Theory of conduct Gradius Submachine gun M240 Extreme Programming Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Game controller CPU cache Software testing Drill bit StarCraft: Uprising SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Professional wrestling throws Microeconomics Blackjack The Cure MS-06 Zaku II T-64 Mattress Perfect Dark Lee-Enfield Terminal ballistics Caliber Robert Adams of London Gun politics Natural Selection (computer game) Bass guitar Modem Stopping power M2 machine gun Nuclear weapon design Battlefield 2 New York Giants Computer virus Gunsmith Cats Cleveland Browns

best type of inexpensive hunting rifle what would be a good choice in a hunting rifle for a year old female i'm pretty strong and athletic so it's not the kickback i'm so concerned about as the size length because i'm pretty short around ' and need something that won't be too awkward to carry around through trees and brush i'd like to buy it or have my parents purchase it rather so it'd be nice if it were in a medium low price range but i don't have much experience with how much guns should cost also i plan to do mostly deer hunting any suggestions would be much appreciated i agree that a marlin model or model in wcf or remington will be a great choice another great inexpensive hunting rifle is the h r handi rifle it is available in hornet not suitable for deer hunting wcf remmag gov't and s w and at times there are other caliber choices available another good point for the handi rifle is that if you buy the rifle you can get other barrels fitted giving you a choice of calibers using the same stock and action there are also youth length stocks available a friend uses one in magnum for his truck gun i am very happy to see another young lady who is interested in hunting regards doc  Shotgun Sniper rifle .22 Long Rifle Internal ballistics Varmint rifle Terminal ballistics Krag-J__rgensen M16 (rifle) Rifle Cartridge (firearms) Mini-14 Kammerlader M40 (rifle) Mauser SKS M4 Carbine Lee-Enfield Remington 870 Springfield 1903 rifle 5.56 x 45 mm NATO M60 machine gun Suppressor Remington model 7600 rifle Winchester Model 70 Mossberg 500 M1 Carbine FN FAL Air gun Machine gun Assault rifle Shotgun shell .357 SIG Ammunition 10 mm Auto Accuracy International AWM Beretta 92F/FS Revolver Wildcat cartridge Rimfire 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Desert Eagle Caliber Remington M1867 Microeconomics Winchester rifle Jarmann M1884 Punisher Artillery .17 HMR Airsoft Mortar (weapon) Economics Equine conformation Anti-tank M2 machine gun Remington Arms Tank Eyepiece American Motors Flintlock AR-15 Battlefield 2 7.62 x 39 mm Carcano United States Navy Mark 12 Mod X Special Purpose Rifle Cowboy action shooting M14 (rifle) Sniper RuneScape quests Medium machine gun Repeating rifle Heckler & Koch G3 Gun control in the United States (by state) Bullet Krag-Petersson SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs M249 Strap-on dildo AR-18 AK-47 Handloading Heckler & Koch MP7 Saturday night special Archery Recoilless rifle Supply and demand John Browning Remington 700 Concealed carry (USA) GoldenEye Bicycle lighting Federal assault weapons ban Bolt action Karabiner 98k F-35 Joint Strike Fighter

shot gun for a women what would be a good shotgun for a women for just general shooting i am wanting a pump shotgun i know you have said you want a pump but shotgun recoil is excessive you haven't said what your body size is or the body size of the woman this shotgun is going to be for so i am going to recommend a lighter kicking shotgun a semi auto shotgun will absorb much of the recoil of the round you will need a good recoil pad from limbsaver and possibly something to cushion the top of the comb against the cheek also most women's collar bones are angled differently than men's and the normal cant to the stock does not fit well on a women's shoulder you can find stocks that can be fitted to a shotgun that are adjustable for cant drop comb height and so on that will fit her better if you want her to be truly happy shooting a shotgun consider these options have her go to a skeet and trap range with you or go yourself if you are the woman it is for and ask to try out some guns my wife tried an gauge and end up sorely bruised i warned her she pulled it in tight and still after rounds god i love her was severly bruised heavier guns will lessen recoil get a good recoil pad and consider a semi auto as it will reduce recoil gauge is a lighter round but in a light gun it can kick almost as badly as gauge you can get a gauge but make sure the gun is not light  Shotgun M16 (rifle) Firearm Equine conformation Trap shooting Rifle Shotgun shell .22 Long Rifle Remington 870 M4 Carbine Cannon Gauge (bore diameter) Saiga-12 Artillery SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Franchi SPAS-12 Air gun Weight training Double-barreled shotgun Bicycle Breastfeeding Skeet shooting Suppressor Cartridge (firearms) Columbine High School massacre ISSF shooting events Trench warfare Archery M60 machine gun Armored Core Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Terminal ballistics Heckler & Koch G3 Diving Table saw Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Revolver M82 (rifle) Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Mouse (computing) Benelli M4 Super 90 Cowboy action shooting Long gun Rail terminology Marathon (computer game) Professional wrestling throws Upholstery Boxing Ammunition Body piercing Bong Corset Team Fortress Classic Handloading Recoilless rifle Beretta 92F/FS Sniper Thermal power station Day of Defeat Airsoft .357 SIG Combine (Half-Life 2) The Suffering (game) Coupling (railway) Brassiere Swingout Stryker Carburetor Railgun Lee-Enfield Donald Neilson Anchor Lewis Gun Glossary of American football GunZ The Duel Tank Siphon Recoil operation Strap-on dildo Spark plug FN FAL NASCAR Panzer I Mixed martial arts Bicycle frame Professional wrestling holds Manhunt (video game)

which handgun round is comparable to a gauge shell hey i worked at a local swat like team in here and i carry a remington marine magnum shell stack loaded and pistol grip shot gun as a primary gun my commander once told me to use a hkusp as a secondary pistol and told its good but when it nearly killed me when i needed more than five shots into the torso of my slightly armored shooter that shot me once and i shot him eight or so since i was nervous and clearly my commander had rather failed to protect me any ways do any of you know about a pistol or a handgun round that can do the same as my remington marine magnum tactical shot gun and which gun would shot it the best particularly i say it should be able to kill a those type and armored targets in one shot in almost all directions carry a decent amount of ammo per clip although those twenty round pistols that need not even kill three from the whole clip are useless larger capacity would mean i could use it as a primary gun as well as a secondary and it should not give high recoil case the shot i took is for my right arm it is very important for me to know it and you can answer by emailing me or at yahoo answering buttons give all sources wow dude this whole question smacks of wannabe but hey whatever first off don't call the magazine of a pistol a clip its a magazine and only a magazine check out this website http www lifelibertyetc com rangebag video lle clips magazines large wmv for some explanation on the whole clip vs magazine thing anyways if you want something in a handgun that would be effective against body armor i would try the fn five seven http world guns ru handguns hg e htm the five seven is able to penetrate a pagst vest at meters and crisat armor at m the ap ammo for the five seven is only available to the military and police agencies so this is a valid choice only if you really are on a swat like team if your not really a swat team member then i would recommend a pair of desert eagles hard chromed and chambered in ae everyone knows all the real bubba's and operators out there carry desert eagles because they can shoot through tank armor so body armor is no problem  Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Ammunition M1911 Cartridge (firearms) Pistol Carbine Revolver .44 Magnum .357 SIG M16 (rifle) Desert Eagle GLOCK SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Machine gun Airsoft Punisher SWAT Battlefield 2 MS-06 Zaku II Columbine High School massacre Shotgun shell Beretta 92F/FS Stopping power M60 machine gun .22 Long Rifle Day of Defeat Tank Five-seveN Heckler & Koch USP Star Wars: Battlefront North Hollywood shootout Bullet Starsiege: Tribes Bulletproof vest Counter-Strike Sniper rifle T-72 Manhunt (video game) Suppressor Personal weapon Resident Evil (video game) Concealed carry (USA) Armored Core FN P90 Remington 870 Krag-J__rgensen Gun control in the United States (by state) Quake III Arena Railgun Trap shooting Combine (Half-Life 2) Natural Selection (computer game) Blood (computer game) Doom enemies Wildcat cartridge Gun politics Rifle .45 ACP Springfield 1903 rifle Half-Life Air gun Shell (projectile) GunZ The Duel Shooting sports Syphon Filter Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Israel Defense Forces Artillery Halo: Combat Evolved Sin City M4 Sherman Smith & Wesson Half-Life: Opposing Force Rocket propelled grenade Armour Heckler & Koch MP5 Sniper Unreal Anti-tank RX-78 mobile suit series M82 (rifle) High explosive anti-tank Armoured warfare M1 Abrams Jet Force Gemini Speedloader Steyr Mannlicher M1894

pepper spray has anyone ever had to use pepper spray on a dog i was told it is not effective because dogs do not have tear ducts i know there a sprays available especially for dogs but i want to know of any first hand experiences with regular pepper spray years in law enforcement and i can tell you from personal experience that you are the exception to the rule if you are able to find out of dogs that pepper spray will work on it seems the bigger the dog breed the less likely the pepper spray will work i have had extensive experience with dog trainers that illegally teach pit bulls to fight and most of these a use pepper spray on their dogs as a training aid to train them to be more vicious and fight my experience has been that it works on a few slows down a few more but really pisses off the majority that are left the newer sprays supposedly attack the mucous membranes in the dogs eyes and mouth my friends still in k think that's a joke too in other words don't bet your life or health on it working  Pepper spray Pit bull CS gas Dog Capsaicin Cockfight Poodle American Pit Bull Terrier Fire fighting Chile pepper Police dog Working dog Dog fighting Oral sex Riot control agent One Piece minor characters Contract Paul Is Dead German Shepherd Dog Rabies Tenshinhan Dog training Eric Cartman Pet skunk Non-lethal force Common cold Martial art Sgt.

can you hunt coyote year round in minnesota and what is the supplies i will need for an all day hunting trip also will a rim fire automatic work for coyotes its actually a semi auto srry yes i believe you can hunt coyotes year round most states consider them pests and varmints so its open season if you are hutning all day rember to move at least a mile about every hour because once a coyote knows you are there you probly wont see one if you move you increase your chances of seeing shooting one because the ones in that area might not have heard previous calls and wont know what it is and will be curious for an all day trip you obviously need food and water and possibly bait if you can bait coyotes i suggest you wear full camo coyotes are very keen and can see a flick of a finger from yards and know somethings wrong and they will turn tail and flee if you hear a bunch of noise like birds and squirrels going crazy dont move theres a predator around it could be a coyote or bobcat or something else but if its there it can more than likely see you even if you dont think it can if you do see one try not to move at all but if you have to to say raise your gun do it as slow as possible id advise a decoy like a rabbit on a stick or other decoys you can get at about any outdoor store a dog will work too i take my dog and tie him up about yards away coyotes are very territorial and if they see another dog or coyote they will forget anything and cahse it off while its busy watching the decoy dog whatever you shoot it make sure the coyote doenst run full boar after the dog i ahd that happen adn it ruined my hunt'i had to chase off the coyote from chasing my dog my dog is prefectly capable of killing a coyote hes done it twice but him being tied up would have beena mess for him me and the coyote i would not use a no matter what type of action i shot a coyote at about yards with a lr and it ricocheted off its head it shook and ran off if you have a centerfire rifle use it i use a for coyote hunting and if need be i can hit one in the vitals at yards a lr might be good to yards but you are lucky if you get them into yards you can also use a shotgun with slugs they kill coyotes with ease remember shotguns arent as accurate and they are limited to around yards best guns for coyotes anything in that area or you could go bigger to say a with a littler bullet by the way watch the rabid ones they dont like humans i found out last year he ran at me but my shotgun slug met him halfway he died good luck  Shotgun Rifle Firearm Internal ballistics .22 Long Rifle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fox hunting Varmint rifle Coyote Poker jargon Dog Characters of Lost Ammunition Hunting USS Trigger (SS-237) Bullet M16 (rifle) Archery Trench warfare Cat Kevin and Kell Unreal Cartridge (firearms) Terminal ballistics Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sniper The Invisibles USS Tunny (SS-282) Carbine The Inside Shotgun shell Tag Turok: Rage Wars Airsoft GunZ The Duel Revolver Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Escape from New York USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening RuneScape quests Reservoir Dogs Blood (computer game) Captain Thunderbolt Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Battles of Lexington and Concord Donald Neilson Team Fortress Classic Wyatt Earp Shaggy dog story Rabies Metal Slug Wile E.

is it legal to own a dragunov rifle in massachusetts and where can i buy one according to the massachusetts assault weapon ban all copies of the ak are illegal to own and possess however even though the drag is a larger version of the ak by design it should not be banned so its not banned by name but what about by features massachusetts law states that a weapon which is capable of accepting a large capacity ammunition feed device holds over rounds is illegal it also includes the prior catagory of assault weapon as far as i know a drag does not have any magazine that's over rounds so it appears that you're ok there then you go back to part i administration of the government title xx public safety and good order chapter licenses sale of firearms chapter section firearms sales definitions antique firearms application of law exceptions it states in the exceptions to the assault weapon definition sub vi any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds of ammunition so it is not excepted from the assault weapon ban since it can hold more than rounds in my opinion it is allowed since as far as i know it is not named by feature or design to fall within the definition of the assault weapon ban of mass as far as where to buy one i'd look online and have it shipped into mass for the cheapest price you may also want to look in the ak section of ar com or www ak net for more info on drags and copies which are available i know a company released a romanian copy for around which was pretty accurate contact your local gun shop and ask them about the rifle before having it sent to them about the legality of the rifle  Firearm Federal assault weapons ban Assault rifle Rifle Assault weapon Carbine Airsoft M16 (rifle) FN FAL Terminal ballistics Dragunov M82 (rifle) Sniper rifle M4 Carbine Internal ballistics M60 machine gun Shotgun National Rifle Association Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act Beretta 92F/FS Krag-J__rgensen Ammunition Sniper Heckler & Koch G3 Marathon (computer game) M1 Garand Concealed carry (USA) SKS Gun politics in the United States Gun politics M249 Submachine gun Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Air gun Cartridge (firearms) Bullet Mini-14 Repeating rifle XM29 OICW Battlefield 2 Springfield 1903 rifle Artillery M1 Carbine Heckler & Koch G36 Cannon Colt Commando Sturmgewehr 44 United States Navy Mark 11 Mod 0 Sniper Weapon System Counter-Strike Halo: Combat Evolved Technology in the Stargate universe AK-74 Gun safety Beltway sniper attacks 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Lee-Enfield Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Microsoft Heckler & Koch G11 Speedloader .22 Long Rifle Kammerlader QBZ-95 GNU General Public License Stopping power FN P90 Jarmann M1884 Five-seveN Medium machine gun Public domain Bulletproof vest Punisher GLOCK Desert Eagle Tavor TAR-21 Paintball Weapons of mass destruction Bren Wildcat cartridge Archery Krag-Petersson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus M14 (rifle) Gatling gun Cosmic Era Mobile Units Karabiner 98k Heckler & Koch MP5 U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance SA80 Tank

arrows so expensive why are arrows so expensive for hunting and stuff are you supposed to reuse them i would ask my friend but he only uses guns yes you are supposed to reuse arrows nothing goes wrong with them when you fire them the main reason they're so expensive though is because most are carbon now anything carbon fiber is expensive by nature even outside of carbon arrows the fact that they're made so precisely ups the price alot  Plastic Microeconomics Bicycle frame Carbon fiber Transformation problem Archery Dry cleaning Future energy development English longbow Paradox Diamond Air gun Graphite-reinforced plastic Rifle Cartridge (firearms) Carbon Katana Dart (missile) Red Arrows Solar power satellite Zeno's paradoxes Inkjet printer Ammunition Fluorescent lamp Space Shuttle program Avro Arrow Tax Bow (weapon) Alcohol fuel Thread (computer science) Nuclear power Sin City Opportunity cost Alternative fuel Causality Carbon dioxide Deforestation RuneScape weapons One-time pad Biofuel Tag Gradius Shooting sports Armour Black powder Revolver Violin Pump It Up MAME B-47 Stratojet Action potential Adjoint functors Resident Evil Code: Veronica Grid energy storage Carbon nanotube Copyleft Pebble bed reactor Kyudo Magnetic resonance imaging Accuracy and precision Water Supply and demand View camera Drill bit Entropy Coal Pompeii Recycling Energy development Arrow's impossibility theorem Determinism Paintball Nuclear power phase-out 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hydrogen economy Centaurus GNU General Public License Heinkel He 112 Hunt the Wumpus Abstraction Grothendieck topology Sulfuric acid Insurance Teen Girl Squad Mitigation of global warming Mutual fund Steel Welding Social rule Machine gun Linked list Carbon monoxide PE ratio Wine Category theory RuneScape skills Waste management Emo

so what about taking apart a bolt i want to take apart the bolt on my mossberg is there a site that shows how what tools would i need well i know they say if its not broke dont fix it but i just wanna try for the experience and to say that i have i also want to try the trigger assembly next though this all probably voids the warranty since im not certified no major tools of any sort simple steel punches and a hammer a couple of nails would probably work though the locking lug pin can be a bitch there's only four main parts to that bolt the firing pin the bolt body the locking lug and the two extractors that main pin that goes crosswise holds the locking lug the square steel thingy in the middle of the bolt it's what locks into the barrel when you place the weapon in battery and it's not really meant to come out there's no reason why you'd ever take it out towards the back there's a tiny top to bottom pin that holds the firing pin in place pop that pin out pop out the firing pin and the firing pin spring pops out in your hand only take that out to change a broken firing pin it can be tough to get back in the spring the extractors have tiny pins on either side of the locking lug pop those out to change broken extractors not too tough to reinstall just takes one more hand than you always seem to have what part do you need to replace surely you're not just stripping it down for the fun of it  Revolver Internal ballistics Krag-J__rgensen Heckler & Koch G3 Machine gun Drill bit M16 (rifle) Pump-action Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Cartridge (firearms) AK-47 Screw Lee-Enfield Professional wrestling holds Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Kammerlader CQBR Recoil operation Shotgun Lathe Airsoft Firearm action Paintball marker Mauser GLOCK Knife Saiga-12 Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Suplex Martini-Henry Rigging Handloading M1911 Wire wrap Lock picking M2 machine gun AK-74 Wrench Shawn Michaels M-209 Reamer SA80 Heckler & Koch USP Drill M249 Krag-Petersson Clinker (boat building) Naval mine Browning Hi-Power Blacksmith Bicycle frame Toyota Prius Pinball Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Firearm Winchester Model 70 Makarov PM Upholstery Rail tracks Seismic retrofit M4 Carbine M60 machine gun Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando Powerbomb Novelty (locomotive) Professional wrestling attacks Heckler & Koch G36 Terminal ballistics M242 Browning Model 1919 machine gun U.S. Marine Corps Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle Speedloader Kurt Angle Guitar Jarmann M1884 Heckler & Koch MP5 Hand grenade Professional wrestling slang Accuracy International AWM Geodesic dome Bofors 40 mm gun Floyd Rose Bubble Bobble Climbing equipment Unreal Tire Beretta 92F/FS Final Fantasy magic M82 (rifle) Mattress Ammunition Glossary of climbing terms

hmr does anyone hunt coyotes with one whats the longest distance you have shot one i do hunt coyotes with the hmr and have killed thus far with this caliber the farthest i have ever killed one with it was around yds with a head shot using a grain bullet the rifle is very effective on body shots up to yds with the grain bullet but i wouldn't shoot one in the body much past that i have heard of people killing them with head shots up to yds but i personally think that distance is probably to far  Sniper .22 Long Rifle Terminal ballistics Rimfire Rifle .17 HMR Shotgun Internal ballistics Carbine Suppressor John F.

hmr on coyotes i know that i am probably outgunned using this calibre on a yote but my question is which load manufacturer and gr would be best if i am going to use this gun on coyotes i have heard that the gr cci tnt is the best penetrating and retains more of its mass however the hornady v max gr are supposed to be good too will the v max penetrate a rib or skull out to yds or should i use the less explosive tnt round or another round perhaps even tho i still think you're using too small of a caliber for an effective and humane kill if you're set on using hmr i'd have to go with the vmax bullet to ensure as much energy displacement as possible  Terminal ballistics .22 Long Rifle Shotgun Rimfire Ammunition Stopping power Shell (projectile) .45 ACP .17 HMR Cartridge (firearms) Explosive material 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Sniper Internal ballistics .357 SIG Firearm Rifle Varmint rifle Bullet 125 mm Smoothbore Rounds Carbine .17 HM2 Machine gun Suppressor M16 (rifle) Depleted uranium Revolver .22 WMR Tank gun ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Anti-tank Anti-tank rifle Air gun M82 (rifle) Kinetic energy penetrator Airsoft Projectile Caliber Ton Mortar (weapon) Tank Assault rifle Personal weapon Kammerlader Trinitrotoluene Cannon External ballistics Artillery Mauser 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO 10 mm Auto M1 Carbine Coyote 5.7 x 28 mm 9 mm Luger .22 Long Gatling gun Marathon (computer game) T-72 Anchor AK-74 Handloading Gun barrel Krag-J__rgensen Flechette M242 Blank (cartridge) Orders of magnitude (energy) Webley and Scott 88 mm gun High explosive anti-tank ISU-122 Nuclear weapon design Land mine Ordnance QF 2 pounder Schwerer Gustav Max Payne 7.62 x 39 mm Alien races from the Godzilla films B-47 Stratojet Spark plug M60 machine gun Mass Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Eventing Railgun Sniper rifle Beretta 92F/FS Punisher Mini-14 Battlecruiser Wildcat cartridge .50 BMG M4 Carbine Battleship Gun safety Perfect Dark Lee-Enfield Metal Storm Trinity test

how do you start up a gun shop i want the steps taken and how do you buy your inventory especially guns and ammo do you get discounts bulk surplus or what and profit a person who actually owns a gun store would be great to answer this question as a full service gun shop sporting goods store owner myself i think i qualify to answer this one first as you were advised already a through and complete knowledge of federal ffl dealers licensing record keeping and regulations procedures etc then the whole thing all over again with state laws and regulations that apply to your area you intend to open the business in you must even be knowledgeable about zoning regulations and how they pertain to your shop location then you must find a location and as they tell all small business owners starting out that location is in fact everything you need to be fully insured and bonded against fire theft loss and liability my shop location required million dollars in insurance and it's not cheap you need your location to be state inspected by the state fire marshall since you carry ammunition and explosive gun powders in quantity a state of the art security system some major cash or a large bank line of credit at the bank for inventory a retail sales tax licesnse and a federal tax id number etc etc you must start out at the bottom with distrubutors and prove you can be trusted to pay for your inventory timely this doesn't happen over night the distributors of course will give you dealer prices but in this day and age with ups fed ex and the other shippers uping their rates you must buy in quanity to get the best deal and paid shipping for what you buy the rest is just having a working knowledge of what you are selling and customer service that seperates you from the rest of the pack knowing first hand about firearms will keep you in business despite wally mart down the street it will take time but god willing and a little hard work you will be successful like i have managed to be ok thats the short compressed version of what you need to know to get started  Microeconomics Wal-Mart Insurance Bulk vending Taxation in the United States Illegal drug trade Inventory Citigroup Life insurance Corporation Retailer FairTax Economy of Russia Sears Holdings Corporation Monetary policy Airsoft Price discrimination Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions Ammunition Mortgage Credit card Contract Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Poker jargon Mutual fund United States Postal Service Gun politics in the United States Capital accumulation Supply and demand Tesco Deflation (economics) Stock Electronic commerce Lloyd's of London Value added tax Commodore International Cable television Security (finance) Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Article One of the United States Constitution Berkshire Hathaway Paintball Bond Social Security (United States) Gold standard Capitalism Gold as an investment UK Singles Chart Vending machine Investment bank Internet fraud Short selling Fractional-reserve banking Arguments for and against drug prohibition Bank fraud Keynesian economics Health insurance Money supply Productive and unproductive labour Financial services Federal Reserve Beltway sniper attacks Costco Internal ballistics Airline Bretton Woods system Great Depression Wall Street Independent agencies of the United States government Finance SCO-Linux controversies American Broadcasting Company Privatization Copyleft Surplus value Donald Trump History of the United States (1918-1945) Anarchism and capitalism Dairy Intellectual property Leasing Publicly funded medicine Best Buy First-sale doctrine Canadian and American economies compared U.S. public debt Handloading Resident Evil 4
