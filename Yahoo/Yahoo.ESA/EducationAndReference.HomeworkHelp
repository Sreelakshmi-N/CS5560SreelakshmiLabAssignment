fahrenheit mildred and montag can you please describe the relationship between montag and mildred do they ever show feelings for each other in the book i read this book a while ago but trying to remember i don't really think they did all mildred cared about was her family tv and her seashell radio her life sucked so much she tried to kill herself and though montag was worried about her then which shows he may have cared they never really had a loving relationship after all neither could even remember when they met and when montag gets caught mildred ditches him without a second thought all she cares about is her own safety and i can't remember but maybe she was the one who sold him out to the fire department at the end of the book montag kind of worries about her but he's more worried about the fact that she is dead and he should care but doesn't which disturbs him since that's not how husbands and wives should be i'm assuming this is for a school assignment i doubt this gives you enough to write a paper or something but i hope it helps  Fahrenheit 451 Dead Like Me Philosophical skepticism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) History of SNL:1980-1985 Marilyn Monroe Fahrenheit 9/11 Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Guy Montag EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Hey Jude Mildred Pierce The Ashlee Simpson Show Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Laura Schlessinger Death of a Salesman Sex and the City The Lovely Bones St. Elmo's Fire (film) Infantilism Major League Baseball television contracts Surveillance Another Simpsons Clip Show Euphemism Neighbours A Series of Unfortunate Events Miss Saigon Transactional analysis Bowling for Columbine Little Britain Highlander: The Series Futurama (TV series - season 4) Characters of Lost Friends The Critic The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular The Marshall Mathers LP Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pitaten The Secret of NIMH 2004 Republican National Convention Garth Brooks Ten Commandments John F.

proofread my memo date july to donald j beale from desiree a dies subject review of netiquette guidelines for university implementation the purpose of this memo is to give a recommendation of netiquettes guidelines that lsu can endorse for its students the two netiquette guidelines that i will be reviewing were both found online the first one is the website study guide and strategies at http www studygs net netiquette htm the second site i ve found is from linfield university at http www linfield edu policy netiquette html there is basic netiquette that is included in both of these guidelines these netiquette rules include do not send email when angry or emotional never send anything electronically that you wouldn t mind seeing made public be sure that any sarcasm or humor is translated in your words to avoid misunderstandings do not forward chain letters obey all copyright laws keep messages brief do not forward chain letters use distribution lists carefully the study s netiquette guideline includes more information about general informal email usage it address issues such as using all capital letters flaming spam and electronic trails this seems to appeal more to the younger population who has been sending rude and offensive emails at lsu the linfield s netiquette guidelines also address flaming but only in the instance of the student sending them the study s flaming guideline only addresses what to do when receiving the abusive message linfield mentions to not leave email account open at a computer when you are away which is definitely a suggestion that applies to all college students using public computers after careful consideration and comparison between both forms of netiquette linfield and study guide and strategies my choice would have to lie with linfield the netiquette policy at linfield university has already been instituted for their student body this is a policy that has been tailored for college students while this is not as stringent of a policy that one would find in the work place for professionals it is not so lax that students can misinterpret its meaning currently most students use e mail for personal correspondence more than for business correspondence because the student is more familiar with sending an e mail to a friend rather and co worker or boss the knowledge of proper netiquette has not been instilled it is better to start promoting proper practices early on in a students college years rather than sending him or her into the work place without the proper netiquette you have do not forward chain letters twice in this paragraph linfield mentions to not leave email account open at a computer when you are away which is definitely a suggestion that applies to all college students using public computers it should be re worded for example linfield advices you to not leave email accounts open at a etc in this paragraph currently most students use e mail for personal correspondence more than for business correspondence because the student is more familiar with sending an e mail to a friend rather and co worker or boss the knowledge of proper netiquette has not been instilled the words after rather should be than a in this paragraph the study s netiquette guideline includes more information about general informal email usage it address issues such as using all capital letters flaming spam and electronic trails this seems to appeal more to the younger population who has been sending rude and offensive emails at lsu should be it addresses issues such as in this paragraph it is better to start promoting proper practices early on in a students college years rather than sending him or her into the work place without the proper netiquette it should be student's college years

critique quote from ben franklin i was rather disappointed when i found myself recovering regretting in some degree that i must now sometimes or other have all that disagreeable work to do over again i can't say much because it's your assignment but have you ever been very sick for a while hospitalized perhaps if not try to imagine it especially if you were a hard working energetic person like mr franklin he was doing well through hard work then found himself and his employer so sick that he was near to dying nobody wants that but once he was sick he was able to relax stay in bed and get taken care of so when he found himself better he faced the prospect of having to work hard all over again to regain the position he had already held imagine what that would be like could you see how on one level getting better could actually seem ironically worse than staying sick or even dying in a book about the rightness of hard work and self sacrifice we get a glimpse here of how hard it was for franklin himself to keep at it do you identify more or less with franklin for having made this admission have you ever felt this way or known anyone who felt this way is it a sensible thing to think are even those who hold good sense in the highest regard always sensible themselves do you think it was the lingering illness that made him feel that way or just plain humanity  Democratic Party (United States) Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Franklin D.

explain why it appears that the professor made a mistake in computing the standard deviation a professor administers a point quiz to a class of students the professor calculates a mean of for the quiz with a standard deviation of although the mean is a reasonable value you should realize that the standard deviation is not explain why it appears that the professor made a mistake in computing the standard deviation i need help with my homework please thank you because std dev sqrt n e x i mean std dev n e x i mean e x i mean e x i mean e x i mean e x i mean so now you need differences squared that will add up to a grand total of so let's take the worst scattered case scenario score of that will give you the greatest difference from right and we'll take of those differences sounds like i'm ordering at mcdonald's lol so and you need a total of and that was just assuming that all the scores were which wouldn't give you a average i know because i'm just trying to illustrate a point here but when you have a large standard deviation that means that your scores are scattered and not clustered around the mean but i was assuming the worst case of scores and all the differences squared don't even come close to the standard deviation squared times that i needed so with just a few 's and then those close to meaning smaller differences well we just can't expect those to add up any closer than what we found with scores of if anything our total will be less than what we figured using scores of less than the that we found and so farther from the that we need might help to read the link i'm including then you'll see what i'm talking about http en wikipedia org wiki standard deviation well i hope that this helps and makes sense to you  Standard deviation Normal distribution Grade (education) C plus plus SAT Margin of error Intelligence quotient Variance Pi Regression toward the mean Mean Modern portfolio theory Doomsday argument Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) General relativity Theory of conduct Hardy-Weinberg principle Z-test Serial number Quizbowl Linear regression Gravity Test (student assessment) TI-89 series Uniform Resource Locator Path integral formulation Decibel ELO rating system Labor theory of value Chinese language Big Bang Jumpstart 3rd Grade Hangul Crossword GED Central limit theorem Race and intelligence Student's t-distribution Wiki Quicksort Minesweeper (computer game) Asperger syndrome Aberration in optical systems Norwegian language Root mean square Intelligent design Redundant array of independent disks Joseph Louis Lagrange Computer Transformation problem SAML File Allocation Table Kepler's laws of planetary motion Bowl Championship Series Chess terminology Square root Real number Planetary habitability Education in the United States Diving Education in Romania Sex and intelligence Consensus Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Galactic Civilizations Software engineering Kapil Dev Dynamic random access memory Voting system Go ranks and ratings Vector (spatial) Special relativity Error String theory Uncertainty principle VHSIC hardware description language Condon Committee Supersymmetry Item response theory Finnish language Archimedes Escape velocity Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Python programming language Value at risk Gifted Operational amplifier Large numbers Random walk Computus Napier's bones Logo programming language Plame affair Standard Model Whose Line Is It Anyway?

where can i find a argumentive essay on juvenile boot camps i am looking for a website that can help me with a argumentive essay on juvenile boot camps the pros and cons in the following viewpoint eric peterson contends that boot camps for juvenile criminals which provide military style discipline and physical training can have positive results he asserts that participants' academic skills improve and that many of these youths find jobs after leaving the camp in addition he claims boot camps are less costly than traditional confinement while peterson concedes that these programs are not as successful as more traditional programs at reducing recidivism he argues that boot camps can achieve their goals if they follow certain guidelines peterson is a program manager in the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention's ojjdp research and program development division as you read consider the following questions according to peterson what was the program completion rate in cleveland in the author's view what population should be targeted for boot camp what services should aftercare programs provide according to peterson in response to a significant increase in juvenile arrests and repeat offenses over the past decade several states and many localities have established juvenile boot camps the first juvenile boot camp programs modeled after boot camps for adult offenders emphasized military style discipline and physical conditioning the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ojjdp has supported the development of three juvenile boot camp demonstration sites this viewpoint describes those demonstration projects their evaluations and lessons learned that will benefit future boot camp programs highly structured programs in ojjdp funded three juvenile boot camps designed to address the special needs and circumstances of adolescent offenders the programs were conducted in cleveland ohio denver colorado and mobile alabama focusing on a target population of adjudicated nonviolent offenders under the age of the boot camp programs were designed as highly structured month residential programs followed by to months of community based aftercare during the aftercare period youth were to pursue academic and vocational training or employment while under intensive but progressively diminishing supervision ojjdp undertook impact evaluations for all three sites that compared the recidivism rates for juveniles who participated in the pilot programs with those of control groups the evaluations also compared the cost effectiveness of juvenile boot camps with other dispositional alternatives reports of the three impact evaluations are available the evaluations of the mobile and cleveland programs are interim reports that present data from the earliest cohorts as neither program had stabilized when the data were collected ojjdp is considering expanding the evaluation to include the remaining cohorts the denver program is no longer active success and failure most juvenile boot camp participants completed the residential program and graduated to aftercare program completion rates were percent in cleveland percent in mobile and percent in denver at the two sites where educational gains were measured substantial improvements in academic skills were noted in mobile approximately three quarters of the participants improved their performance in reading spelling language and math by one grade level or more in cleveland the average juvenile boot camp participant improved reading spelling and math skills by approximately one grade level in addition where employment records were available a significant number of participants found jobs while in aftercare the pilot programs however did not demonstrate a reduction in recidivism in denver and mobile no statistically significant difference could be found between the recidivism rates of juvenile boot camp participants and those of the control groups youth confined in state or county institutions or released on probation in cleveland pilot program participants evidenced a higher recidivism rate than juvenile offenders confined in traditional juvenile correctional facilities it should be noted that none of the sites fully implemented ojjdp's model juvenile boot camp guidelines and that some critical aftercare support services were not provided lessons learned several significant lessons have emerged from the pilot programs the appropriate population should be targeted boot camps should be designed as an intermediate intervention at one site youth who had been previously confined were significantly more likely to recidivate while youth with the least serious offenses were also more likely to recidivate facility location is important cost issues and community resistance were major obstacles to securing residential and aftercare facilities to increase attendance and reduce problems aftercare facilities should be located in gang neutral areas accessible by public transportation staff selection and training needs are critical to reduce staff turnover fill gaps in critical services and ensure consistent programming the screening selection and training of juvenile boot camp and aftercare staff must be sensitive to the programmatic and operational features of a juvenile boot camp this is particularly important with regard to youth development issues the importance of aftercare moreover continuous treatment between the residential and aftercare phases should be integrated philosophically and programmatically particularly through staffing aftercare programs are challenging to implement successful aftercare programs require attention at the outset to develop a comprehensive model with the flexibility to respond to local needs and concerns aftercare programs are unlikely to succeed if their participants fail to receive the full range of services prescribed for them aftercare programs must be broad based and flexible enough to meet the particular educational employment counseling and support needs of each participant the aftercare component should form dynamic linkages with other community services especially youth service agencies schools and employers coordination among agencies must be maintained all three sites experienced difficulties in maintaining coordination among the participating agencies considerable attention should be paid to building and maintaining a consensus among participating organizations concerning the program's philosophy and procedures evaluating the results effective evaluation begins with planning to assess the program's successes and failures quantifiable data should be collected about participation in treatment by juveniles in the boot camp and in the control group measures of program success should include a broad spectrum of outcomes recidivism measures should capture all subsequent delinquent activity not simply the first new adjudication and data on new offenses should include information on the origin and circumstances of the complaint to determine whether there is a monitoring effect in which the intensity of the supervision causes an increase in recorded offending when boot camps are used as an alternative to confinement savings can be achieved communities often implement juvenile boot camps in part to reduce costs the experience of the pilot sites indicates that when boot camps are used as an alternative to traditional confinement costs can be reduced considerably because of the significantly shorter residential stay however if boot camps are used as an alternative to probation savings will not be realized juvenile boot camps embrace a variety of objectives reducing recidivism improving academic performance cutting the cost of treating juvenile offenders and inculcating the values of self discipline and hard work in attempting to reach these objectives ojjdp is collaborating with the office of justice programs ojp to enhance program models policies and practices of juvenile boot camps as a result many of the lessons learned from ojjdp's three demonstration sites have been incorporated in the ojp boot camp corrections program

chem help what are the effects of atomic ionic radii on properties of elements this is a really broad question as atomic and ionic radii pretty much affect everything in general ions with a large ionic radii are negative anions and ions with a smaller ionic radii are positive cations because ionic radii is directly related to how many electrons an element has and how strongly the pull of the nucleus acts of these electrons therefore the atomic radii of an element can also affect the element's ionization energy or the amount of energy required to create a cation from a given element because an element with a small atomic radius will have only a few electrons held tightly close in to the nucleus these electrons are difficult to remove and so the ionization energy of this element is high the ionization energy of an element with large atomic radius is low because it is relatively easy to remove one of the many and loosely held electrons of this element accordingly an element with low ionization energy like an alkali metal which is likely to become a cation starts out with a larger atomic radius and shrinks rapidly in ionic radius upon ionization trends in electron affinity likelihood of an element becoming an anion and electronegativity ability of an atom of attract electrons to itself in a covalent bong follow directly from this trend in ionization energy in summary as atomic radius decreases ionization energy increases electron affinity increases electronegativity increases  Electronegativity Ionic bond Water (molecule) Corona discharge Ionization potential Atom Corrosion Hydrogen Ionizing radiation Chemistry Helium Transition metal Hydrogen bond Carbon Nuclear fission Capillary electrophoresis Technetium Rubidium Iron Plasma (physics) Caesium Plutonium Atomic nucleus Uranium Potassium Aluminium Sodium Magnesium Semiconductor Mass spectrometry Ruthenium Alkane Sulfur Nitrogen Fluorine Ionosphere Isotope separation Oxidation number Atomic orbital Nuclear weapon design Inertial confinement fusion Lanthanum Sun Strontium Xenon Vacuum Hydride Ammonia Chlorine Boron Spark plug Titanium Tellurium Beryllium Systematic name Action potential Electron Spectroscopy Phase (matter) Compact star Permittivity Enzyme Radiography Electrical resistance Hydrogen sulfide Lutetium Membrane potential Metal Thallium Radiation hardening Mercury (element) Langmuir probe Tin Haloalkane Chromium Iodine Lead Tesla coil Nuclear explosion Yttrium Cobalt Copper Calcium Germanium Solar cell Indium Zirconium Chemical bond Chemical reaction Neutron Acid Silver

can someone help me quick sue and tom wright are assistant professors at the local university they each take home about per year after taxes sue is years of age and tom is their two children mike and karen are and were either one to die they estimate that the remaining family members would need about of the present combined take home pay to retain their current standard of living while the children are still dependent this does not include an extra month in child care expenses that would be required in a single parent household they estimate that survivors' benefits would total about per month in child support both tom and sue are knowledgeable investors in the past average after tax returns on their investment portfolio have exceeded the rate of inflation by about if sue wright was to die today how much would the wrights need in the family maintenance fund use the needs approach and explain the reasons behind your calculations suppose the wrights found that both tom and sue had a life insurance protection gap of present the steps in sequence how wrights should proceed to search for protection to close that gap show all work for each assignment and explain each step carefully is your teacher a sadist or something that's the worst word problem i've ever seen okay let's see first we need to determine how much of the income goes to support each child because the children will come of age at different times since it takes of their annual income to support the entire family minus sue it's probably safe to assume that it of their income went to sue's welfare one can reasonably assume that it would also take of their yearly income would also go to tom's welfare leaving for the children divide that by and each child also gets of their current income of their combined income of is so it takes a year to support each child it will cost an additional a month for childcare yearly that would cost x months presumably half of this goes towards childcare for each child so the current total for child care yearly is tom would receive a month in survivor's benefits this totals to a year in survivor's benefits x months which would total a year per child in survivor's benefits children since that money is already available tom and sue don't need to put that money into their maintenance fund so the total per year per child that they would need to put into the fund would be mike is and thus tom would need to support him for more years before he became of age years x as the total amount needed in the fund to support mike until he's legally an adult karen is and thus would need to be supported for years before she comes of age years x as the total amount needed in the fund to support karen until she's legally and adult is the amount sue and tom need to have in the family maintenance fund in order to support both kids until they're of age at least that's how i'd figure it you could also figure in the rate of inflation but the problem hasn't given you the rate of inflation only the amount their portfolio exceeds that rate so i chose to ignore it  Annuity Social Security (United States) Insurance Life insurance Microeconomics FairTax Social Security debate (United States) Tax Unemployment Bond Divorce Gross domestic product Mutual fund Health insurance Education in the United States Economy of Russia Expert system United Kingdom corporation tax 401(k) Inflation Labour economics Education in the People's Republic of China Economic inequality Mortgage Student loan Personal finance Capital accumulation Ponzi scheme Bretton Woods system Arguments for and against drug prohibition Variable universal life insurance Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Government debt Labor theory of value Child support National Insurance Trust (Law) USA Economics Pension Unemployment benefit Space Shuttle program Keynesian economics Salary cap Publicly funded medicine Software patent debate No Child Left Behind Act Politics of Canada Institutional fund management Modern portfolio theory Growth hormone treatment Corporate finance Children of God Economy of the United States Free trade PE ratio Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Freeters Income trust Money Nuclear power Measures of national income and output Blackjack Minimum wage Centrelink Flat tax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Alcohol fuel Cost of capital Progressive tax Medicare (Canada) Explosive material Credit card Public domain Infantilism Article One of the United States Constitution Grade (education) Contract Corporation Capital gains tax Health savings account United States dollar Daylight saving time Lloyd's of London George W.

how do the hellenic and hellenistic periods differ how are they different in say philosophy literature art science religion medicine architecture and government i'm going to greece on my honeymoon in weeks and i dont want to look ill informed and have my facts mixed up hellenic period a early greece dark age period bc hellenic civilization focused in greece hellenistic greek civilization spreads to known world ages revival in many cultural activities based upon minoan mycenaean civilizations population overseas trade use of metals all increase migrate to many aegean islands creation of new city states rise of new merchant class good money to challenge traditional landed aristocracy b hellenic culture religion without prophets or scriptures focus importance of man humanism olympian gods local deities help or hinder variety of cults sacred ceremonies but religion more social than spiritual influence of homer s iliad trojan war odyssey upon greek culture emphasis on honor action consequence as man is a decisive actor in life c philosophy origins of rational thought with evidence to support argument instead of mythic faith based explanations for natural phenomena i cosmology rational inquiry into nature theoretical reason study of the universe with no places for gods natural explanations for physical occurrences ionians mathematical order of nature pythagoras logical proof parmenides mechanical structure of universe democritus ii sophists rational investigation of human society apply theoretical reason cosmology to society suggest self community improvement for benefit of citizenship statesmanship examined political ethical problems invented formal secular education challenged traditional view of slavery barbarians freedom greeks argued role of force or chance in slavery all people barbarian greek are really same attacked traditional religious moral values argue no universal truth exists relativism also argue that laws created for situation so must change from time to time laws created by powerful not god strong have power over weak in society thus stressed selfishness over community spirit iii socrates rational individual art of living search for perfection of human character individual at center of universe reason at center of individual shape character to values discovered through active use of reason true education questioning mind is a priceless tool use of dialectics or discussions to learn because must explain and justify position socrates died poisoned for his beliefs iv plato rational society change community before change individual theory of ideas universal standards exist in beauty goodness justice truth through knowledge of these ideas can the philosopher understand the higher reality his higher world affected religious thought just state the ideal state with personal fulfillment achieved attain moral excellence must improve citizens not power or wealth so need leaders with wisdom virtue believed society to be too democratic suggested reforms reduced voting rights voters ill informed election process looks not policy political system fear of anarchy wanted to reorganize society philosophers to rule courageous to protect those with desires to produce primacy of intellect regardless of gender v aristotle synthesis of greek thought universal principles plato but from human experience with real world facts objects focus on empirical sciences observation investigation record data facts theory must match ethical thought commonsense attitude use moderation over extremes in all actions apply reason to human affairs good life political thought be part of political community rather than individualistic effective government rather than utopia trust in law not people alter only when must d history greeks viewed history in different manner focus on human story separate events from religion myth non human aspects removed by cosmologists asked questions about human deeds based answers on evidence wrote with rational thought herodotus looked at persian wars through eyes of the historian compared worldviews saw value in study preservation of past asked questions to discover facts checked sources remained objective reduced mythological elements thucydides went one step further removed gods completely looked for social forces human decisions behind events influential upon political scientists historians statesmen hellenistic period a philosophy preserved rational tradition of greek philosophy adapt thoughts to understand needs of larger world on life of individual ease spiritual uneasiness reduce loss of security sense of alienation i epicureanism withdraw from evils of world to achieve happiness gods had no influence over human actions suggested moderation to achieve happiness ii stoicism sought happiness by entering harmony with universal reason all people are part of humanity all are significant class race and other differences are irrelevant human law should not conflict with natural law or moral order iii skepticism urged conformity follow the crowd better safe than sorry attitude no certainty only probability belief iv cynicism rebelled against all established values authority preferred indifference apathy no loyalty to family or community since everything a barrier to free life early version of homeless hippie wanderers conclusion a aegean civilizations influential in development of early hellenic society b hellenic period removal of religious centered influence over society study of man search for rational answers c hellenistic period continuance of traditional rational philosophy development of new outlook upon life based in part on new world focus

the prince by niccollo machiavelli can u answer this why do you believe the pope banned the prince in what are the advantages and disadvantages of the various routes to power according to machiavelli and what qualities does machiavelli write that a prince needs in order to maintain his power the pope banned the book because it focused on gaining power through political means the pope believed god and the pope distributed power so machiavelli's book dealt with things that were superfluous and or heathen machiavelli proposed various routes with various advantages and disadvantages based on certain archetypes in history through birth and through militance were the two means of actually getting power that he mentioned to my recallection anyways the advantage of birth were that you were 'in' with the aristocracy the advantage of militance is that you were 'in' with the aristocracy the qualities that a prince needs to maintain power are the ability to be loved and the ability to be feared when it is convenient he needs his subjects to love him so that they will want to obey his authority when it is necessary inconvenient to earn his subjects love he must resort to being feared so that his subjects will be unwilling to question his authority but the prince is like chess the things listed above are the basic moves rooks go as far as they want but in rows bishops on diagonals etc the prince was a strategy guide to an infinitely complex game with many layers that had to be slowly manipulated constantly  The Prince Chess strategy and tactics Niccol__ Machiavelli Chess terminology Chess Shogi Fischer Random Chess Tai shogi Philosophy Kasparov versus The World Cannon shogi Chess opening Nicomachean Ethics Sample chess game Dai shogi Chu shogi Yari shogi Second language acquisition Tenjiku shogi Taikyoku shogi Queen (chess) Political philosophy Ruy Lopez A Course In Miracles Pope Bishop Italian Renaissance Pawn (chess) Gallicanism John Wycliffe Investiture Controversy Epistemology Pope Gregory VII Rook (chess) Maka dai dai shogi Religion Human Goldstein's book H.

pcr primer question what is the point of running a pcr with two primers eg ovalbumin olgio and insulin oglio we were only interested in the ova band i assume insulin is the negative control there is an insulin band in all the columns but what is it for maybe it was used in order to show that the pcr actually worked that is you had intact dna and the conditions in your machine were conducive to replication if you didn't use a ladder in the gel then the insulin bands could be used as molecular weight markers ovalbumin is a protease inhibitor prevents catabolism or breakdown of proteins while insulin regulates anabolism and consequently carbohydrate breakdown so they kind of regulate opposite reactions did you extract the dna yourself maybe you had to use both in order to show that your extraction methods were reliable did you manipulate the organism sample cell before you extracted dna maybe there's a pathway that would involve both insulin and ovalbumin where insulin came first and you needed to show that the lack of insulin was not a factor in the lack presence of ovalbumin  Insulin Polymerase chain reaction Molecular biology Protein Enzyme Glucokinase Sequencing Cell (biology) Gel electrophoresis Agarose gel electrophoresis Whole proteome analysis Cancer HIV test Primer (molecular biology) Diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemia Western blot Genetic fingerprinting Antiretroviral drug Signal transduction Anabolism Lesch-Nyhan syndrome HIV Thermus aquaticus Genetic engineering Growth hormone Nutrition Biochemistry Metabolism Citric acid cycle DNA replication Protein sequencing Sleep Chain termination method Coagulation Gene expression DNA repair Virus Antiviral drug Gene Alzheimer's disease Jurassic Park Origin of life Glucocorticoid Crohn's disease Mitochondrial genetics Mutation Growth hormone treatment Cloning Bioinformatics Wound healing phases Plasmid Site-directed mutagenesis Biophysics Mitosis RuBisCO Genetics Gene therapy Ultraviolet Hepatitis B HIV structure and genome Biology Insulin-like growth factor Serine protease Clinical depression Schizophrenia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Programmed cell death SDS-PAGE Morphogenesis Pharmacology Chemotherapy Telomerase Staining (biology) Transcription (genetics) Bodybuilding Subcloning Chromatography Species Cystic fibrosis P53 Milk Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Hormone Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Insulin resistance Helicobacter pylori Obstetrics Central dogma of molecular biology Atkins Nutritional Approach

where can i find a biography of gervasio b santiago this is best answered by filipinos i have a short story report to do and gervasio b santiago is the author of my story i can't find him anywhere all that comes up in the net is this guy on trial or something he's the author of si pangit at si maganda and may isang munting pangarap kabayan i think i've found what you're looking for it's not really that much information but you could just check this site out source on march the defendant gervasio santiago alias r r revilla appeared at the house of jesus pereira the offended party located at sto sepulcro street manila and pretending to be an agent of the radium ore ravigator co offered to sell him a filter of said company as jesus pereira did not need it he at first refused to purchase but as the accused repeatedly urged him to do so stating that he had already sold filters and he needed to sell only one more in order to win a prize p besides which the filter he offered was worth p pereira agreed to purchase it as he only had p on hand the defendant said he was willing to accept that sum as the first installment the offended party then made out check no against the bank of the philippine islands for p and when about to write gervasio santiago's name on it the latter asked him to put in the word cash instead the defendant in turn made out receipt marked exhibit a promising to return that same day in order to deliver the filter the offended party in turn said he would complete the payment when he returned a few hours later the defendant returned to the offended party's store asking for a recommendation to one guerra who keeps a store at m h del pilar in order to sell him a filter as that was the first time the offended party had met the defendant he said he could not give him a recommendation but instead he would give him a letter stating he had purchased a filter of him the defendant repeated that he would return that afternoon to deliver the filter which the offended party had purchased as the afternoon drew on and the accused did not show up the offended party became suspicious and telephoned the office of the radium ore ravigator company inquiring for r r revilla upon being informed that there was no employee by that name in the office jesus pereira went to the police station and reported the case turning over the receipt exhibit a which the defendant had given him he was asked to look over the photographs in the rogues' gallery and upon doing so he saw among the photographs that of the defendant gervasio santiago alias r r revilla who had several aliases in view of this discovery the offended party notified the bank of the philippine islands to suspend the payment upon the check he had issued to the accused the check was never presented at the bank for payment the appellant contends that as the check was not cashed by the bank of the philippine islands and no attempt was made to cash it no crime has been committed the check issued to the defendant by the offended party was payable to cash and therefore negotiable while the defendant had said check in his possession the offended party could not dispose of the amount for which it was made out and this was at least temporary prejudice sufficient to constitute estafa u s vs goyenechea phil u s vs malong phil the defendant had already been previously convicted of estafa nine times having completed service of his last sentence in april testifying in his own behalf the accused denied everything the offended party had testified against him and declared that on march he was employed by the robert dollar company as checker taking into account the offended party's testimony and the defendant's criminal record this court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the act imputed to him by said offended party on the date stated the foregoing facts established beyond a reasonable doubt constitute the crime of estafa set forth in article number and penalized in article number of the penal code as amended by act no with arresto mayor in its minimum and medium degrees the amount in question not exceeding pesetas as the defendant has been twice at least convicted of the same crime the proper penalty to be imposed upon him is one degree above arresto mayor in its manimum and medium degreed that is arresto mayor in its maximum degree to presidio correccional in its minimum degree in accordance with article of said code there being no modifying circumstances this penalty must be imposed in its medium degree that is one year and one day presidio correccional as the defendant has been previously convicted of estafa nine times completing the service of his last sentence in the month of april he is an habitual criminal and must suffer twenty one years' additional imprisonment in accordance with section subsection d of act no by virtue whereof with the sole modification that the appellant is sentenced to undergo a principal penalty of one year and one day presidio correccional in accordance with the recommendation of the attorney general the judgment appealed from is affirmed with costs against the appellant so

got an idea plzz helpp i need story ideas based around this quote she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the kitchen and by watching her i began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl she doesn't have to be cooking maybe she's coaxing her younger brother to eat or arranging flower pots on the window sill and the person walking in could be a boy of about her age or the person could be a younger sister a reflective parent or a brother sister of the same age point being try to find a way to interpret it that is not the expected one that she's cooking and the person is an admirer with amorous intentions the story could spin around too say she was arranging herbs maybe she's a witch and the herbs she's using are to make a potion love potion one for luck one to be beautiful etc perhaps she's really an old lonely lady but the herbs she uses make her look young and attractive so that the young boy will marry her have fun with it  RuneScape quests RuneScape skills W.I.T.C.H.

please help me with my homework we're supposed to have a debate next week regarding the legalization of drugs in philippines i was chosen to represent the negative con's side could anyone please give me a link to a webpage with information related to the cons of drug legalization buddy you should first make sure your assignment isnt about debates on legalization of opium in phillipines which occured way back in otherwise heres a great article the pros and cons of drug legalization should drugs be legalized drugs are resources that are capable of affecting theamerican economy in many ways both positively and negatively drugs often have a bad name even though they help us everyday in medical cases and the drugs with the worst reputations are not the most abused drugs one may benefit from the legalization of drugs in many ways while others would suffer greatly almost every person in the united states has their own opinion on drug legalization there are many different pros and cons to the legalization of drugs drug legalization is also an ethical and a moral issue should drugs be legalized or not while i think drugs should be legalized many others disagree the first major benefit that will come from the legalization of drugs will be the increase in jobs creation of new jobs will take place in the manufacturing industry sales industry and marketing industry due to the increased demand for drugs the manufacturing industry will experience a boost because some drugs will need to be mixed with other substances to become other drugs such as crack cocaine the sale industry will expand from the legalization of drugs because the drugs will not sale themselves a new form of entrepreneurship will be available for many individuals to take part in marketing jobs will increase simply because every new drug product will need to be marketed in addition there will be a variety of legalized drugs not only will drugs create jobs for these three major industries they will also create jobs for farmers farmers will benefit from the sale and distribution of drugs in the united states the southeast and south west in general will benefit the most form these new types of crops in the west the very hot climate and usual low cloud cover will allow the marijuana plant to flourish much like it does in mexico in the south it will no longer be king cotton ruling the land it will be the great king cocaine that takes the throne and rain supreme the cocaine plant will do well in the south due to the similarities of the deciduous slightly tropical forest of south georgia and florida and the jungles of its native south america over seventy percent of drugs that come from plants need cultivating by someone the three major ones are cocaine marijuana and opium all three require very little to grow this will allow farmers that have very unfertile soil to grow vast acreage of different drug crops and reap large profits instead of going out of business and losing everything farmers that have incorporated crop rotation will be able to bring marijuana in plant it on their worst piece of property and make a profit farming has been on the decline in the last few years the legalization of drugs could be the driving force that brings them back this type of farming is legal in many places and has been proven effective this process being legal will allow farmers to flourish however it is not legal in the united states this leads to the next point the legalization of drugs would decrease the prison population significantly in there were drug offenders serving time in federal prison if drugs were legalized these offenders would be released some drug charges are federal offenses that can ruin one's life forever for example some states have laws that disable convicted felons from voting if caught only talking about selling or distributing drugs the charge can carry a one hundred year sentence if convicted while a convicted murderer could get out in seven years depending on the circumstances this is completely unfair unneeded and would not exist if drugs were legalized my third reason why drugs should be legalized concerns taxes tax breaks could be brought upon by this new source of tax money there is eleven point four billion dollars a year that is spent fighting the war on drugs that seems to be ineffective our tax money is putting this money forth but it could be put to better use if drugs were legalized if drugs were legalized the government could place taxes on them the money generated from the drug tax alone could be used to build new schools instead of new prisons the drug taxes could even be used toward special scholarships government grants or construction of new roads this will generate new opportunities for some people which they may not have had before due to the lack of government aid this shows how drugs could play a major positive role in our economy last of all the economy would experience an extreme boom from the byproducts of drug legalization certain drugs need other products to function properly or to be produced for example heroin addicts need needles to inject the drug this will call for a higher demand for needles and the production of needles will increase this is simply supply and demand the heroin and the needles will be complements of each other and will cause a direct supply and demand curve that will flex tremendously this supply and demand will help our economy thrive heroin is not the only drug that will benefit from byproducts other drugs such as crack need to be mix with american made products such as baking soda all these things intertwine for the greater good in a sort of you scratch my back i will scratch your back sort of way propelling the united states into a future as an even larger economic power house these are just a few reasons why drugs should be legalized for one reason the good ascends the bad and the input does not exceed the output farmers will be able to grow cheap crops and prisons will be for real criminals above all the economy will flourish this new concept will yield numerous positive results such as new jobs and sources of money for americans the money that spent on drugs is currently sent out of this country making other countries rich we are spending money to stop this instead of embracing it to make our own country rich this is a war does not need to be fought and is a blatant waist of the united states tax payers money the legalization of drugs should occur for the benefit and the well being of this wonderful nation as with all hot topics there is a con for almost every pro there are many reasons why drugs are illegal for example the rock bottom prices would put drug dealers out of business this looks like a good thing but once drugs are cheaper more people will experiment with the higher experimental level more people will become addicted a high increase of experimentation will occur because of a decrease in price and therefore there will be more drug addictions there is no way possible a single drug dealer can compete with big business meaning large corporations with lower prices the big companies will be able to buy tremendous amounts of drugs at wholesale prices therefore passing on a cheaper price to consumers this cheaper price will destroy the drug dealer for one simple reason the supply is extremely higher than the demand simple economics with price of production also being significantly lower the price of the drugs could drop even lower causing drugs to be lower then bread which is a shame with grain being the nation leading crop with the drugs being cheaper more people will be able to afford them this allows them to be easily accessible the more accessible they are the more people will try them drugs like heroin and crack cocaine are very addictive substances often taking only one use for one to become addicted in the case of heroin the addiction effect is so strong that a person would have to get addicted to a lesser drug such morphine to beat the addiction this is one major reason that drugs are outlawed it is proven that drugs alter ones physical emotional and often mental state virtually disabling a person in some form or way for a determined period the growing addiction rate would call for more rehabilitation centers to be built this money would have to come from somewhere the money more than likely will come from tax dollars that the taxpayer will have to provide this will mean an unnecessary new tax for a problem that we do not need to have even with more rehabilitation centers there is still a very strong possibility that some drugs users will relapse and start the vicious cycle over again this in turn will call for more money and more tax dollars that could be used for better things such as roads schools and scholarships not rehabs prisons and police since there is no major drug producer in the united states we have to import them form other drug producing countries this is a multi billion dollar a year industry proven evident by the one hundred thirty four million dollar drug bust that took place right here in the chattahoochee valley area on last year and the more recent five point five million dollar drug bust this leads you to one question where are the drugs coming from if there are no producers in the united states and the truth is that they are not coming from here they are coming from other countries out side the u s such as mexico costa rica nicaragua peru ecuador el salvador columbia bolivia and venezuela every year we spend billions of dollar attempting to fight this problem but to contradict that drug by twice as much spent on getting them in this is a battle that the united states is fighting that it will never win and the more money we spend to keep the drugs out the more money the drug dealers will spend to get the drugs in if drugs were to be legalized instead of shipping these billions off to third world country drugs lords making them rich and providing them with the funds to rule their country this money could be put to use here making our countries financial status better all these things make drug legalization such a hot topic in the world today there is enough evidence to support either side of this debate drugs have often had a bad reputation but it seems that in every good there is bad and vice versa it seems that the only thing that has so many people divided is fear fear of the harm it could do or even fear of the good it could do take for example the city of amsterdam it proves that drugs can be legalized in a safe and orderly manner since the legalization of drugs their there crime rate has been one of the lowest in the world in the end it all boils down to people because drugs do not control people people control drugs society has proven this with th amendment where one of the most commonly abused drugs alcohol was banned in the 's the ban was later repealed in the 's during the ban alcoholism went down but it created a booming industry for organized gangsters crime went up but when the law was repealed crime went down and alcoholism went up it seems history has a way of repeating itself and i think drugs should be legalized

can you suggest a project for our science club that will both gain us fund and will be used by the student just suggest a project that is unique thank you i am not very certain of what you're asking but i'll answer it according to my interpretation i think that you mean you need something that will attract money from the students yet the thing you create must useful to your fellow peers well you could create since it has to do with science a little booklet about science something like a study handbook for what you're learning at school or perhaps you can create a contest that the contestants must pay to enter like a little quiz show or something like jeopardy and the prize is something that you have invented or something that the students may want sorry if this answer wasn't what you wanted i hope i helped  Jeopardy!

solve this inequality p basically the same idea as if it were an equation if you are solving for p you need to isolate p on one side of the inequality p add to both sides p divide by on both sides p the only twist to solving an inequality as compared to solving an equation is if you multiply or divide by a negative number that did not happen in this particular situation but for example if you had something like this p you would need to divide through by to solve when you divide an inequality or multiply by a negative number you must reverse the inequality sign therefore you would end up with this p just a little extra tidbit for future problems of this sort  Inequality Conic section Dirac equation Quartic equation Quadratic equation Microeconomics Polynomial Dimensional analysis Trigonometric function M__bius transformation Quaternion Joseph Louis Lagrange Gaussian elimination Absolute value Basel problem Algorithm Two's complement Jean-Jacques Rousseau Welfare economics Simplex algorithm Cissoid of Diocles Ordinary differential equation Square root Complex number Fluctuation theorem Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Potential theory Computer numbering formats Economic inequality Exponentiation Optimization (mathematics) Projective transformation Random walk Contract bridge Vedic mathematics Recurrence relation Operational amplifier ___1 (number) Quantum computer Income inequality metrics Discrete Fourier transform P-adic number Mean field theory Computer Sobolev space Chemical equation Distribution (mathematics) Heat equation Negative and non-negative numbers Quadratic sieve Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Quantum harmonic oscillator Linear differential equation Mental calculation Mathematics of general relativity Economy of Africa Trip distribution Traveling salesman problem Daubechies wavelet Entropy Partial differential equation Sturm-Liouville theory Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges Bose gas Quicksort Newton's method Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means Separation of variables Transmission line Market failure Invalid proof Experiment Phase-locked loop Force Clifford algebra Dynamical system Luminiferous aether Clauser and Horne's 1974 Bell test Prime number Particle in a box Large numbers Mathematics Federal Communications Commission Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Temperature State space (controls) Quantum tunneling IP (complexity) Signed graph Control system Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Solar cell Star Trek Customizable Card Game RISC Matrix (mathematics) Karma Trigonometric identity George Biddell Airy Strategic management

algebra question a rectangle has the perimeter of feet and an area of square feet what are the dimensions of the rectangle can anyone please tell me how to solve the problem and the answer to it it comes down to knowing the geometric properties of a rectangle for this problem it is really nothing fancy except knowing that a rectangle has opposite sides equal so the lengths and widths we will call them so this gives you two pairs of sides in other words you should also know the basic formulas for finding the perimeter and area of a rectangle if l is the length and w is the width the perimeter can be defined as l w the area is simply the length times the width or lw so from here you can set up your equations l w lw for the top one you can make things easier by factoring out a and dividing by to cancel it out l w so now we have a system of two equations in two variables l w lw i would try substituting l for w into the top equation l l express l as l l and you can add the fractions together easily l l multiply both sides by l l l you are going to end up with a quadratic equation here so you need to set it equal to zero l l before messing around with completing the square or the quadratic formula first see if you can factor into two binomial terms in this case you can l l so the value of l can either be or so now if l is either or we can go back and substitute these values into the other equation lw so if l were equal to w w but if l were equal to w w so the way i would write my answer is that it is a x rectangle if they ask for further clarification you can say that if the shorter side is than the longer side would have to be hope this was helpful  Elementary algebra Quartic equation Quadratic equation Polynomial Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Complex number Ordinary differential equation Golden ratio Trigonometric function Projective transformation Clifford algebra Pi Pascal's triangle Square root Quadratic sieve Function (mathematics) Determinant Vedic mathematics Derivative Dirac equation Joseph Louis Lagrange Exponentiation Vector (spatial) Trigonometric identity M__bius transformation Prime number Ruler-and-compass construction Lebesgue integration Partial fraction Manifold Units of measurement P-adic number Geometry Continued fraction Quaternion Force Optimization (mathematics) Normal distribution Mathematics Dimensional analysis Cissoid of Diocles Fibonacci number Fundamental theorem of calculus Microeconomics Quantum harmonic oscillator Formal power series Matrix (mathematics) Galois theory Particle in a box Binomial coefficient Cubic equation G__del's incompleteness theorem Quintic equation Parabola Algebraic geometry Path integral formulation Riemann integral Orthogonal matrix Discrete Fourier transform Ruffini's rule RLC circuit Many-worlds interpretation State space (controls) Standard deviation Transformation problem Number theory Pythagorean theorem Large numbers Area (geometry) Aberration in optical systems Modular form Z-transform Probability Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Newton's identities Quadrilateral Nondimensionalization Linear differential equation Binary numeral system Sturm-Liouville theory Catalan number Sudoku Tensor Calculus Basel problem Numerical integration Fourth dimension Dynamical system Kalman filter Preferred number

as ac acid solution is added to aneutralize a base solution the oh concentration of the base solution a decreases b increases c remains the same i suck at chemistry could someone explain i don't even know what oh concentration is the oh concentration decreases in acid solutions you have more h ions in base solutions you have more oh ions this concentration is usually expressed in terms of ph the ph number is somewhat deceptive though because it stands for negative of the power of of the concentration of h ions neutral solutions such as water are ph that means that the concentration of h ions is more acidic solutions have lower ph numbers which means that their concentration of h is higher for example ph has a concentration of h ions which is times more than ph the whole h and ph thing come from the fact that a certain amount of water is in ionic form most of it is a molecule h o but a certain number of those molecules actually breaks off into an h ion and and oh ion those concentrations are in water in normal conditions by adding certain substances to water as they dissolve in water they release h ions this increases the h ion concentration and causes the solution to become acidic on the other hand there are certain substances that capture h ions as they dissolve those substances decrease h ion concentrations and make the solution basic but the concentration of h ions is tied to the concentration of oh ions as the relative concentration of one increases so the relative concentration of the other decreases because recombination takes place ions combine to turn into molecules thus preserving the combined concentration of h and oh ions i hope this helped a little good luck  Water (molecule) Concentration Ammonia Base (chemistry) PH Enzyme Acid Carbon dioxide Electrophysiology Corrosion Hydrochloric acid Ion Self-ionization of water Coulometry Alkane Action potential Sulfuric acid Hydrogen Biochemistry Buffer solution Soil pH Hydrogen peroxide Alcohol Hydrogen bond Chemistry Chlorine Hydrogen chloride Acid dissociation constant Ethanol Photosynthesis Chemical reaction Acetic acid Nuclear fusion Ozone depletion Soluble Protein Mass spectrometry Citric acid Hydronium Salt Explosive material Fluoride Haloalkane Ozone hole Water purification Acid-base reaction theories Sodium chloride Origin of life Ion thruster Oxidation number Ionosphere Electrolyte Systematic name Ion exchange resin Ion selective electrode Parts per notation Cracking (chemistry) Nephron Insulin Formic acid Temperature Liquid crystal Soil Battery (electricity) Organic chemistry Membrane potential Macromolecule Glass Gastric acid Fluorine Soap Plasma (physics) Atom Ra (board game) Spacecraft propulsion Hydrolysis Sulfur Hemoglobin Alum Phosphate Mole (unit) Blood Sodium sulfate Amine Helium Titration Osmosis Dialysis E85 Carbonic acid Signal transduction

car physics please could you help with this explain why a person should always wear a safety belt while travelling in a car explain your answer by making reference to specific principles of physics any help appreciated to put it simply it's because of newton's first law all objects that are in motion remain in motion unless a force is applied you and the car are moving if a collision occurs a force is applied on the car and it stops moving but you will continue to move forward inside the car unless a force like a seatbelt holds you in place  Classical mechanics Newton's laws of motion Seat belt Philosophy of space and time Modern geocentrism Inertia Airbag Car safety Gravity Equivalence principle Fictitious force Speed of light Seat belt legislation Faster-than-light Special relativity Kepler's laws of planetary motion Momentum Glossary of partner dance terms Physics Professional wrestling match types Frame of reference Calculus Swingout Luminiferous aether Falsifiability Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Quantum mechanics Friction Philosophy of science Center of mass Plate tectonics Time travel Crash test dummy Science Entropy Mechanism (philosophy) Collision detection Act of Parliament Energy Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Planetary orbit Force Manual transmission Automobile Atomism Action (physics) Collision Road traffic accident Boxing Skateboarding trick Aikido Modified Newtonian dynamics Roller coaster Physical law Scientific method Isaac Newton Glossary of American football Motorcycle Centrifugal force Car handling Black hole 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Lagrangian mechanics Professional wrestling throws Electric field Comet Tire Zeno's paradoxes Summary judgment Law of value Traumatic brain injury Inertial frame of reference Billiards Celestial mechanics Lift (force) Tide Spatial disorientation Coriolis effect Solar system Light Road safety Motorcycle helmet Spacecraft propulsion Philosophy of mathematics Flood geology Navier-Stokes equations Rules of the road Mercedes-Benz A-Class Supernatural Appeal Contract Richard Feynman Time Human sexual behavior Astrodynamics Rail terminology

the middle colonies were most american part of america examine the validity of statement doyou agree disagree here is some info that you may find helpful a middle colonies were a part of the original thirteen colonies that would later become the united states of america the region was originally new netherlands which was later divided into the western half of connecticut new jersey pennsylvania new york and delaware today these areas are described as the mid atlantic states the climate in the colonies what was relatively mild not as cold as it is in new england allowing for a longer growing season but not as hot as the southern colonies which helped stop the spread of disease the middle colonies were the most ethnically and religiously diverse of the thirteen original colonies because of the influence of their english dutch french and german origins this influence included tolerance and cosmopolitanism and resulted in new netherland's success as the commercial center of the eastern north american colonies this was evidence by the fact that they had more agriculture than the new england colonies the middle colonies were also known as the bread colonies because of their large grain export it was also the mid atlantic colonies that expanded into other areas of commerce before the others b the middle colonies of british north america comprised of new york new jersey pennsylvania and delaware became a stage for the western world s most complex experience with religious pluralism the mid atlantic region unlike either new england or the south drew many of its initial settlers from european states that had been deeply disrupted by the protestant reformation and the religious wars that followed in its wake small congregations of dutch mennonites french huguenots german baptists and portuguese jews joined larger communions of dutch reformed lutherans quakers and anglicans to create a uniquely diverse religious society african americans and the indigenous indians with religious traditions of their own added further variety to the middle colony mosaic see more at website c society in the middle colonies was far more varied cosmopolitan and tolerant than in new england in many ways pennsylvania and delaware owed their initial success to william penn under his guidance pennsylvania functioned smoothly and grew rapidly by its population was almost the heart of the colony was philadelphia a city soon to be known for its broad tree shaded streets substantial brick and stone houses and busy docks by the end of the colonial period nearly a century later people lived there representing many languages creeds and trades their talent for successful business enterprise made the city one of the thriving centers of colonial america more at website good luck to you  Mennonite Midwestern United States Christian denomination Northeastern United States Delaware German language United States religious history Languages in the United States American Revolution History of Europe William Penn Reformed churches Baptist United States Africa Maryland History of the Netherlands South Africa Protestantism Economy of Africa British colonization of the Americas Portuguese Creole History of Pennsylvania Music history of the United States during the colonial era Imperialism in Asia British Empire Frontier Europe Demographics of Brazil Atlantic slave trade U.S. Highway 1 Thirteen Colonies Jew Presbyterian Church in Canada Anglicanism Puritan Religion in the United Kingdom New Jersey Middle Ages Jersey City, New Jersey New York Pensacola, Florida Flanders History of Christianity History of the Jews in the United States Anglosphere Pontiac's Rebellion Philip II of Spain Lenape Western United States History of the United States (1789-1849) Dutch Golden Age White (people) Religious Society of Friends Baptism American Revolutionary War Charleston, South Carolina South America Hohokam History of the United States Atlantic Ocean African slave trade French colonial empires United Church of Christ Pennsylvania Railroad History of Denmark Culture of Lithuania Late Middle Ages Delaware River Huguenot Black (people) History of Scandinavia Dutch colonization of the Americas Eucharist Population history of American indigenous peoples Southern United States Thirty Years' War Wilmington, Delaware Mozambique History of slavery in the United States History of Connecticut England Plantations of Ireland Rhode Island Canada

help me plz simplify this expression type the variable term before the constant term x x x x x expressions in algebra consist of constants and variables a constant is a quantity whose value remains the same throughout a particular problem a variable is a quantity whose value is free to vary there are two kinds of constants fixed and arbitrary numbers such as and p are examples of fixed constants their values never change in x the numbers and are fixed constants arbitrary constants can be assigned different values for different problems arbitrary constants are indicated by letters quite often letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as a b c and d in ax b the letters a and b represent arbitrary constants the form ax t b represent many linear equations if we give a and b particular values say a and b then these constants become fixed for this particular problem and the equation becomes x t a variable may have one value or it may have many values in a dlscuseion the letters at the end of the alphabet such as x y z and w usually are used to represent variables in x the letter x is the variable if x then and so on for as many values of x as we desire to select and so on for as many values of x as we desire to select if the expression x is set equal to some particular number say then the resulting equality x holds true for just one value of x the value is since in an algebraic expression terms that contain a variable are called variable terms terms that do not contain a variable are constant terms the expression x contains one variable term and one constant term the variable term is x while is the constant term in ax b ax is the variable term and b is the constant term a variable term often is designated by naming the variable it contains in x x is the x term in ax by ax is the x term while by is the y term  Variable Complex number Lorentz group Normal distribution Polynomial Derivative M__bius transformation Maxwell's equations Boolean algebra Particle in a box Mathematics of general relativity Gaussian elimination Partition function (statistical mechanics) Explosive material Elementary algebra Vector (spatial) Quantification C syntax Transformation problem Function (mathematics) State space (controls) Gauge theory Resistor Quantum mechanics Compiler optimization Unicode Exponentiation Circumscription Orthogonal matrix RLC circuit Nondimensionalization Linear equation Combinatory logic String (computer science) Curry-Howard Exponential function Propositional calculus Laws of Form Navier-Stokes equations Cumulant Formal power series Projective transformation Linked list Common Lisp Probability On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences PID controller Renormalization Mathematics Production theory basics Calculus Microeconomics Stochastic process Planck units Arbitrary constant of integration CIE 1931 color space Entropy Force Einstein-Cartan theory Color Continued fraction Series (mathematics) Sheaf (mathematics) C programming language Abstraction (computer science) Dirac equation Derivation of the partition function Quantum harmonic oscillator Production function Exact solutions in general relativity ALGOL 68 Boolean logic Tuple relational calculus P-adic number Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Aberration in optical systems Mathematical logic Supply and demand Linear regression Programming language Fibonacci number Partial differential equation Field (mathematics) Model (abstract) Digital circuit Bose gas Harmonic oscillator Lambda calculus Simplex algorithm Model (economics)

please proof read e mail me with your email address so i can send you copys of my essays so you can proof read them they are too long to post on yahoo answers thanks in advance songs in john steinbeck s the pearl musical songs play an important role in how kino sees things his people had once been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song ch pg from this quote we can infer that the musical songs have been important to kino for quite a long time as much as kino enjoys some of the songs such as the song of the family or the song of the undersea not all of the songs are as pleasant when they first find the pearl the song that it emits is a joyous one that complements the song of the family but soon the song becomes the song of evil when the pearl causes so much damage to their family through all of this we see what a major role musical songs play in steinbeck s novel pearl in john steinbeck s the pearl we see how something of value in this case a pearl can bring out the worst in people at first the pearl seems to bring them joy and the music of the pearl rose like a chorus of trumpets in his ear ch pg in this quote we see how excited he is about what the pearl will bring them yet human nature causes things to go wrong because it is only human nature for the other townspeople to be jealous and want the pearl for themselves i was attacked in the dark said kino and in the fight i have killed a man ch pg from that quote we see that a terrible thing can happen as a result of greed the changes brought about by the pearl force kino and his family to flee town through all of this we learn how with human nature involved anything of value like a pearl can cause people to change contrast between the city and the village in john seinbeck s the pearl we see two totally different atmospheres one in the city and one in the village we have this description as they are on their way to the doctor s house in town they came to the place where the brush houses stopped and the city of stone and plaster began the city of harsh outer walls and inner cool gardens where a little water played and the bougainvillaea crusted the walls with purple and brick red and white ch pg this quote shows the physical difference between the two places the book also mentions the thing had become a neighborhood affair ch pg this quote shows that the village is a close knit one where the townspeople care for one another we can assume this because in the city all of the neighbors go and join kino and his wife when their son coyotito is ill whereas in the city the people there did not care about kino and his family but they cared about their money in the beginning of the story kino and his wife juana go to the doctor who lives in the city but he won t treat their son because he knows of their poverty however after they find their fortune the news came to the doctor and when it was made plain who kino was the doctor grew stern and judicious at the same time he is a client of mine the doctor said ch pgs from this quote we see that the doctor wanted to treat kino s son now that they had money through all of the aforemention quotes we learn how very different the city and the village are wishes in john steinbeck s the pearl when kino finds the pearl of the world he thinks that he will be able to fulfill his many wishes however it is human nature that causes everyone to think differently of kino when he is now able to fulfill his wishes and juan tom s who squatted on kino s right hand because he was his brother asked what will you do now that you have become a rich man we will be married in the church ch pg at first his main wish is to get officially married but as his circumstances change he realizes that another wish is now more important to him his lips moved hesitantly over this a rifle he said ch pg this wish represents his instinct to protect his family from all of this we can see how being able to fulfill his wishes changed kino conflicts in john steinbeck s the pearl kino and his wife juana face many difficult conflicts the first conflict arises when their child coyotito is stung by a scorpion it is a little indian with a baby he says a scorpion stung it the doctor put his cup down gently before he let his anger rise have i nothing better to do than cure insect bites for little indians i am a doctor not a veterinary ch pg this quote represents the prejudice that people used to have prior to kino s finding the pearl another conflict arises when the pearl dealers claim that kino s pearl isn t worth as much as he thought it was i do not want it this is not a pearl it is a monstrosity ch pg it is kino s pride that causes him not to believe what others say and he is determined to sell the pearl for what he expects it to bring him the third conflict that we see arise is an internal conflict and kino was afraid never in his life had he been far from home he was afraid of strangers and strange places ch pg even though kino is afraid it is only human nature for him to want to prove that he is brave enough to travel to the capital those are just some of the conflicts that kino and his wife juana have to face neighbors in john steinbeck s the pearl kino s neighbors symbolize the human nature in most people when kino and juana s neighbors follow them to the doctor s house and also to the pearl dealers not only does it show how most people are curious and nosy but it makes it seem like the neighbors care about kino and his wife they are making a party to search the shore the men will look for you ch pg from this quote we see how the neighbors quickly turn their back on kino because they think he murdered a man but they do not know the full story what we learn is that the human nature in all of us can often bring out our worst qualities as well as blind us to what is actually happening around us so we quickly assume or jump to conclusions the end you are welcome o by the way you did very well some minor changes punctuation here and there and if you noticed i took out all your because of s anyways i took the because of s out because i still to this day don t know if because of is acceptable english grammar i don t know if nowadays has changed so that it s now acceptable back then lol use of that was discouraged maybe things have changed since anyways feel free to keep what i have or change what i have or revert back to what you had also i m not too familiar with mla format is that what you are using if so then if the sentence before your quote is a full sentence then the period of that sentence gets replace with a colon only if you have partial sentences preceding the quote do you put a comma before the quote and if the word that precedes your quote then there is no comma between that and your quote refer to http www lehigh edu incent old site writing quotes quotes htm you're a really good writer wish i could write as well as you do just makes sure that the quotes and the surrounding text follow whatever format you are using as for the grammar and other stuff i think you're good to go well i hope this helps  Plame affair Milton H.

can you proof read something for me hi i finally finished writing my essays for my summer assignment yay can you proof read these for me just the grammatical and spelling stuff thanks in advance have you ever had to face a major conflict everyone in everyday life comes across many obstacles some of the conflicts people come across can be little such as scrapping a knee or failing a test but some of them are bigger than that such as getting into an argument with a close friend or even the death of a close family member in the truth about forever by sarah dessen the main character macy queen overcomes many difficult obstacles during her summer vacation one of the many obstacles that macy must overcome is the pressure she feels to be perfect but part of my new perfect my new perfect act was my appearance if i wanted people to see me as calm and collected together i had to look the part ch pg this quote shows us that she feels pressured to be perfect and to act how people expect her to because macy is concerned about how people will think of her she becomes jason s girlfriend when asked about jason and why she went out with him she replies well i began he s perfect you know great in school smart all these achievements he can do anything and when i was with him it was like good for me it made me better too ch pgs from this quote we see that macy thinks she must live up to everyone s expectations and thinks that she will not be loved anymore if she doesn t one day after being told off by another girl that works at the library macy realizes something important then about a year and half too late it hit me i was never going to be perfect and what had all my efforts gotten me ch pgs from this quote we can tell that macy finally realizes that she will never be perfect but that s okay because she realizes that no one is perfect and no one will ever be that is just one of the many obstacles that macy queen overcomes another obstacle that macy queen has to face and probably the most difficult is the death of her father my dad died and i was there this is how people knew me not as macy queen daughter of deborah i was macy queen who d woken up the day after christmas and gone outside to see her father splayed out at the end of the road a stranger pumping away at his broad chest i saw my dad die that was who i was now ch pg the death of her dad devastated macy because they had been so close there was so much i wanted to tell my mother like how much i missed my dad how much i still though about him ch pg from this quote we see just how much macy missed her dad she was so depressed by his death that she even stopped running even though it was a major part of her life as i started to run feeling my feet get under me i listened for the voice i knew so well the one i always heard at the beginning ch pg towards the end of the novel macy begins to run again and from this we can see how she realizes that her dad would have wanted her to keep running and to not let his death stop her from having a normal life even though macy faces some major obstacles she also faces some smaller conflicts one if the smaller conflicts that macy must face is that she has to deal with rude co workers in a tone that mad e it clear asking me would be a waste of time the first few times this had happened i d figured they were just letting me get my feet under me after awhile though it was obvious in their minds i didn t belong there ch pg from this quote we can tell that her co workers have been obnoxious around her but she gradually realizes that the job is not meant for her and quits another conflict that macy overcomes is something that everyone in life has to go through breaking up with her boyfriend a break i knew what that meant it was what happened right before something was officially and finally broken finished regardless of the language it was most likely i was out all for saying i love you ch pg from this quote we see why her boy friend broke up with her through talking to her new friends macy overcomes this and realizes that she was going out with jason for all the wrong reasons a third conflict that macy overcomes is something that everyone goes through while growing up arguing with her mother macy never before had i flinched at the sound of my own name but i did now i want you to go home get changed and get into bed we ll discuss this later ch pg from this quote we can tell that her mother is mad at her after discussing the situation with her sister and seeing how her mother has changed macy begins to understand why her mother was mad and punished her the way she did these are just some of the smaller conflicts that macy faces in conclusion we can see that in the truth about forever by sarah dessen the main character macy queen overcome many difficult obstacles during her summer vacation some of the things that macy overcame were breaking up with her boyfriend arguing with her mom dealing with rude co workers and ultimately overcoming her father s death through all of this macy learned that nothing will never be perfect and also understands that it is important to not dwell on the past but still remember her dad the end of the first one i don't know how i'm going to do this but i'll try nd paragraph nd sentence my new perfect my new perfect take one of those out rd paragraph library comma macy and after you cite things and put the source in you should put a period after every end since you are starting a new sentence after each one th paragraph needs a period and you put though you need to change it to thought sorry don't remember quite where read thru it you'll find it under me comma you have a period i somewhere in there you have the word made there is a space between mad e close that up you have boyfriend as two words i e boy friend close that space if you want it boyfriend when you talk about the many things macy had to overcome you put overcome it needs to be overcame you did it right the second time in that same paragraph and lastly you say nothing will never should be nothing will ever hope this was helpful good luck  Shaggy dog story The Lovely Bones EastEnders

what is a good topic for an investigatory project our instructor requires experimentation to solve it an example could be what causes red eyes in photos why not try is there truly such a thing as murphy's law the one that states when something can go wrong it will go wrong an example you forget to carry condoms and you will always meet a new girl you have no toilet paper 'cos you forgot to change it and you are sure to have diarrhoea you could analyse it in a probability or statistical manner by setting up some experiments that rely on chance or luck get several different experimenters to have a go to see if their pre disposition or starting state of mind affects the results and outcomes  Condom Luck Bell's theorem U.S. presidential election, 2004 Milton H.

need help solving this math problem the original question was this jim can finish a job twice as fast as jack when they work together they can finish the job in hours find the time it would take each person to finish the job individually my answer was x x x x jim works x hours jack works x hours now the second part of the question is is it possible for either one of them to finish the job faster that if they work together i need help answering this second part of the question any help would be greatly appreciated thanks this is the type of problem that you have to memorize the formula when a number of people work at different rates the formula is as follows x y z t where t the time it takes for everyone and x y z etc is the time for one person now lets plug in the formula x y now y takes twice as long as x so y x therefore x x multiply by x gives x x y x that is the general formula this problem is simpler since jim is twice as fast as jack therefore jim jacks jacks take hours therefore it is obvious that one jack would take times as long or hours jim working twice as fast takes only half that time or hours  Mathematics CPU design GED Complexity classes P and NP Combinatorics Calculus Computer IP (complexity) $ale of the Century 24 Hours of Le Mans CPU cache Numerical analysis Coriolis effect Series (mathematics) Quantum computer History of Formula One Expert system IPod Labour economics Speed of light Vedic mathematics You Don't Know Jack Complex number NP-complete G__del's incompleteness theorem Prime number Halting problem Compiler optimization Current teachings of Prem Rawat Multiplication algorithm Exponential growth Unemployment Bayesian inference Family Feud Economic inequality Quizbowl Transformation problem Extreme Programming Fast Fourier transform Discrete cosine transform Chess problem The Amazing Race Big Brother (USA TV series) Armored Core Pi Hypoglycemia Education in Romania Logarithm RISC The Princeton Review Newton's identities On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Electrophysiology Elementary algebra Hollywood Squares Galois theory Personal rapid transit Ordinary differential equation Social rule Computational complexity theory Collision detection Match Game Trigonometric function Whose Line Is It Anyway?

need college algebra i am half native first nations and mexican american i have been diagnosed with chronic depression and add i receive disability for my ailments that i mentioned above i have had problems with this all my life i left my state and went to a bureau of indian affairs college here in new mexico the tuition is free for natives first nations people that is why i came here i managed to finish college credits in fields of natural resources liberal arts environment i am closest to finishing in liberal arts i also finished some clep courses in history american history i was dismissed by college officals until i finish a college algebra class i need a college algebra to graduate and get my degree i tried tutors studying on my own etc i can only get to the first chapter or so then i have to give up in frustration what would be the best way for me to finish a college algebra i am a firm believer that you can learn anything if you find a good teacher a good teacher can make a topic like the bumps on ceiling tiles interesting so step find someone that will be patient with you and help you review the difficult concepts even if you don't get them the first few times around second have you tried using one of those study guides i have seen them around but forget what they are called basically they have everything you need to know on one sheet of laminated paper front and back so it takes a whole textbook and condenses it down and gives you a quick reference to just the important points it is not meant to take the place of the text but rather to have something to look at to supplement it you may also want to try another book to use in conjunction with your text i remember as a psychology major i had big problems with statistics in the beginning even though i was always good at math it was just that it was so different from the concreteness and rigidity of other math classes i took i ended up getting a small book that was done in cartoon form for example when i got to the chapter on probability theory there were these dice and cards with legs chasing each other it sort of made learning fun in a way and i ended up not only passing but getting an a in my stats course anyway there probably is a similar book out there for algebra there is also algebra for dummies which you can find more info about by going to the link below there are probably also computer programs that will teach you the basics and may be a better learning tool for you than just trying to learn it out of a book  Mathematics GED Education in Romania Homeschooling Education in Taiwan Graduate school Algebraic geometry Education in the People's Republic of China Sheaf (mathematics) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Statistics Polynomial Geometry Category theory Education in Germany Education Physics Psychology Secondary education in the United States Nurse Craps Master's degree Software engineering Calculus Logic Computer science Asperger syndrome University of Maryland Baltimore County BASIC programming language Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Complex number Surreal number Mental illness Pi Randomness Jaime Escalante No Child Left Behind Act College Bipolar disorder Massachusetts Institute of Technology Academia Economics Alexander Technique Volleyball Mahjong Education in Japan Multiple sclerosis American University Franklin W.

can you pls solve this physics problem sum for me a certain for exerted for sec raises the speed of an object from m s to m s later the same force is applied for sec by how much does the speed chage in sec thanks a lot energy is force times distance that means if a force is applied for one second at an average speed of ten mph and one sec at an average speed of the second is twice the energy that is good because with a constant force acceleration is constant at all speeds a m s therefore the force applied for seconds increases the velocity by m s final speed m s  Force Escape velocity Classical mechanics Torque Velocity Trajectory Gravity Mass Faster-than-light Momentum Frame of reference Kinetic energy Spacecraft propulsion Speed of light Black hole Special relativity Angular momentum Second General relativity Orbital speed Jet engine Explosive material Center of mass Acceleration Scramjet Two-body problem Semi-major axis Speed Tide Lagrangian mechanics Coriolis effect Equivalence principle Modified Newtonian dynamics Physical cosmology Electromagnetic radiation Gravitational slingshot Astrodynamics Cyclotron Friction Potential energy Hubble's law Electric field Zeno's paradoxes Project Orion Wind power Calculus Fictitious force Nuclear explosion Specific orbital energy Kepler's laws of planetary motion Action potential Specific impulse Aerodynamics Phonon Galileo spacecraft Wind turbine Rocket Terminal velocity World line Propeller Harmonic oscillator Magnetic field Variable speed of light Action (physics) Big Bang Speed of sound Space elevator Dimensional analysis Inertial frame of reference Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Neutron star Electromagnetic field Tests of general relativity Centripetal force Ordinary differential equation Moment of inertia Light Creationist cosmologies Turbocharger Difference between sub-orbital and orbital spaceflights Planck units Plasma (physics) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Siphon Centrifugal force Temperature Car handling Honda Civic Event horizon Particle in a box Trigonometric function Photon Particle accelerator

can someone help me with information on this topic what effects did the black plague have on art and life the black death was one of the major influences on art life and culture especially religious beliefs and its relations with politics during the late medieval period the effects of grievous loss of life were both positive and negative he black death or black plague was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history it began in south western or central asia and spread to europe by the late s the total number of deaths worldwide from the pandemic is estimated at million people there were an estimated million deaths in europe alone the black death is estimated to have killed between a third and two thirds of europe's population the same disease is thought to have returned to europe every generation with varying degrees of intensity and fatality until the s notable later outbreaks include the italian plague of the great plague of seville the great plague of london the great plague of vienna the great plague of marseille in and the plague in moscow there is some controversy over the identity of the disease but in its virulent form it seems to have disappeared from europe in the eighteenth century the black death had a drastic effect on europe's population irrevocably changing europe's social structure it was a serious blow to the roman catholic church europe's predominant religious institution at the time and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as jews muslims foreigners beggars and lepers the uncertainty of daily survival created a general mood of morbidity influencing people to live for the moment as illustrated by giovanni boccaccio in the decameron the initial fourteenth century european event was called the great mortality by contemporary writers and with later outbreaks became known as the black death it has been popularly thought that the name came from a striking late stage sign of the disease in which the sufferers' skin would blacken due to subepidermal haemorrhages purpura and extremities darken with gangrene acral necrosis however the term most likely refers to the figurative sense of black glum lugubrious or dreadful because the black death was according to historical accounts characterized by buboes swellings in lymph nodes like the late nineteenth century asian bubonic plague scientists and historians at the beginning of the twentieth century assumed that the black death was an outbreak of the same disease caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis and spread by fleas with the help of animals like the black rat rattus rattus however this view has recently been questioned nevertheless compelling descriptions of the clinical disease in literature including well researched if second hand accounts in historical fiction see daniel defoe's a journal of the plague year offer compelling description of the recognised disease which in the context of such an epidemic could be little else  Spanish flu Smallpox Rat Great Plague Population history of American indigenous peoples AIDS Italian Renaissance H5N1 Syphilis Bosniaks History of Europe Indigenous peoples Yersinia pestis AIDS pandemic Jew Tuberculosis Book of Revelation Middle Ages Influenza Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Late Middle Ages Ebola Vampire Breast cancer Russian language Group A streptococcal infection Thirty Years' War Literature Black (people) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Christianity Renaissance Witch-hunt Infectious disease Quarantine Hispanic Famine Novel Anti-Semitism White (people) Death Tribulation Lyme disease 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Marburg virus Jewish history HIV Sexual orientation The Decameron Tonality Coercion Abortion debate Natural disaster Cultural Revolution Disease Cancer Book of Daniel The Bible and history Soviet Union Biological warfare Left communism Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Western philosophy Dark Ages History of literature Akhenaten Opus Dei Virus Creationism Evangelicalism Supernatural Religion in the Soviet Union Roman Catholic Church Ashkenazi Jews Religion Capital punishment Livestock Prostate cancer Penda of Mercia Mongol Empire Pasteur Institute Historicity of Jesus Brown Rat Ottoman Empire Foot-and-mouth disease Tamil people Resurrection of Jesus

how do you stop feeling afraid of your final exams i always tend to do worst in the finals this time i am behind on my lectures because they forgot to send me to rest of the dvd lectures which i am waiting for when fear takes over me it's really hard to concentrate help don't try to study in a room with a television or radio or even with a computer that's hooked up with internet access you need a place that's quiet well lit probably one without windows or with covered windows try going to the school library see if they have study rooms if nothing else get some good ear plugs and study at a restaurant or a coffee shop you'll want to avoid eating sugar and simple starches like french fries and candy bars even white bread and pasta coffee is okay the caffeine will keep you going but studies have shown that your ability to recall what you're studying is much greater if you have the same chemicals in your body at the time you learn something as you do when you take the test in other words if you're going to juice up on caffeine to study you might want to juice up on caffeine before you take the test also get some exercise twenty minutes of walking running swimming anything that gets your heart rate up a couple of times a week will help your brain work better also take notes while you read keep a legal pad with you and if the material is too overwhelming to read all at once just skim each paragraph for important points and write them in your notepad you're much more likely to remember and learn if you're writing notes longhand good luck in your exam  Fecal incontinence Word of Wisdom Hypoglycemia Coffee Caffeine Breakfast GED Sleep Coffeehouse Stuttering American and British English differences Mnemonic Cuisine of Denmark Insomnia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Singlish Alcoholic beverage Chocolate Hangover Speed reading Dublin City University Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Game show Addiction Sugar Dyslexia Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pasta Bread Japanese cuisine Milk Atkins Nutritional Approach Reading (activity) Japanese tea ceremony Tea Tobacco smoking Trinity College, Dublin Starch Milton H.

what is the relationship the united states has to the issue of glabal warming question on a research project man is not causing global warming check nasa and other observers and you will find mars is experiencing warming as well as earth unless someone is exporting year old automobiles to mars and the martians are driving them a lot then we aren't causing this the planet s climate oscillates it goes through cycles in the it was global cooling scare and we all lost freedoms associated with government regulations and the reason was because we would all freeze to death by the last mini ice age was about years ago when all the people on earth burned wood and drove horses in the s and s we were killing the ozone layer and we would all die by from skin cancer that cost us the freon we used in our air conditioners now we have another less efficient less effective gas that is trying to work as well and failing do you know what ozone is it is breathing oxygen on steroids breathing oxygen is o ozone is o the sun energy at high altitude fuses these atoms the sun makes ozone so unless you have a big fire extinguisher you are not going to stop ozone production the people who are perpetrating this nonsense are politically motivated the leader of the current chicken little screaming bs is a man named al gore he was vice president under president clinton he was heard to lay claim to inventing the internet and now claims to be a world renowned climatologist he didn't invent the net and he isn't a scientist he is a politician interested in having greater control over you and emptying your wallet a bit faster a real climatologist the one considered by many to be the father of the science of climatology call the whole scare bogus i have done my part to curb global warming according to the radio if i replace light bulbs with those ugly weak florescent bulbs i will have done the same as removing cars from the road i think i am slightly over a million now so everything will be fine please be careful when someone starts screaming the sky is falling because while you are looking up they are tying your ankles together and stealing your wallet if this is for grade school and you want a good grade you will have to claim america is totally responsible that has to be a fact regardless of the fact that china puts out more than we do oh but they only pump out the poison because we buy manufactured goods from them so that s our fault too accept full blame for the whole bogus issue and your teacher will love you btw grazing animals produce more co than automobiles  Carbon dioxide Ozone layer Solar variation Air conditioning Haloalkane Mars Effects of global warming Ecology Tropical cyclone Earth's atmosphere Energy development Renewable energy Fire fighting Carburetor Future energy development Kyoto Protocol Scientific opinion on climate change Nuclear power E85 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Moon Global climate model Fluorescent lamp Urban heat island Vacuum tube Air pollution Greenhouse effect Turbocharger Welding Incandescent light bulb National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terraforming Global cooling Water (molecule) Ultraviolet Global warming and agriculture Solar system Exploration of Mars Lighting Permian-Triassic extinction event Fuel cell Petroleum STS-62 Spirit rover Fire Space disaster Carbon dioxide sink Extraterrestrial life Jet engine Hydrogen peroxide Paleoclimatology Richard Lindzen Ionosphere Peat Solar power Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gliding Greenhouse gas Sewage treatment Planetary habitability Causality Mars Exploration Rover Vacuum Astronomy on Mars Alcohol fuel Sea level rise Automobile Tire Earth Battery (electricity) Battery electric vehicle Mercury (planet) Great Depression Ocean thermal energy conversion Chernobyl accident Opportunity rover Helium Gasoline Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Toyota Prius Al Gore Wind power Nintendo The Day After Tomorrow Unidentified flying object Gravity

foci for hyperbolas does anyone know how to find the foci in the hyperbola equation x x y y i'm wicked confused man you need to put the equation in standard form for a hyperbola do these by completing the square for the x terms and then the y terms balancing on the right side and watch those signs x x y y becomes x x y y write as squares x y divide both sides by x y now we know that the center is and the foci are located at c and c that's c units from the center and how do we find c remember the pythagorean thm c a b where a and b are the denominators under the x and y terms of the hyperbola so c and c sq rt therefore the foci are located at sq rt and sqrt i hope this makes sense to you it's so much harder to type it out than to show it with pencil and paper good luck  Conic section Projective transformation Parabola Hyperbola Quadratic equation Trigonometric function Quartic equation Trigonometric identity Ellipse Pythagorean theorem Triangle Square root Maxwell's equations Standard deviation Quaternion Golden ratio Cissoid of Diocles Complex number Kepler's laws of planetary motion Orbit equation Planetary orbit Pentagram Equation of time Pencil Irrational number M__bius transformation Dirac equation Mathematics Hyperbolic function Path integral formulation Exponentiation Dimensional analysis Real number Manifold Nondimensionalization Linear differential equation Cubic equation Planck units Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Glossary of partner dance terms Tangent half-angle formula Black-Scholes Poker jargon Fran__ois Vi__te Apollonius of Perga Linear regression Meantone temperament Haversine formula Einstein's field equation GED Harmonic oscillator Pendulum Split-complex number Boy's surface Coordinates (mathematics) Force Inner product space Continued fraction Hilbert space John Wallis Quantum harmonic oscillator Nicomachean Ethics N-body problem Astrodynamics Absolute value Similarity (mathematics) Quantum tunneling Gaussian elimination Ruler-and-compass construction Quintic equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Joseph Louis Lagrange Siphon Regular polytope Mass Catalan number Augustus De Morgan Theology Gravity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fibonacci number Continuous Fourier transform Ruffini's rule Dot product Normal distribution Vedic mathematics Contract bridge Tangram United States dollar Frame fields in general relativity Relativistic mass Determinant Generating function Square root of 2 Particle in a box Pi On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

study tips please for all subjects but especially english math and french yea i'm only allowed to get straight a's need to get to tokyo in two years i'm not quite sure about what your question is but if you're looking for general study advice here's what i have for you organization is key from making sure your notes are organized your homework is organized to making sure you have all your assignments written down and separated by class and or due date i have a calendar above my desk that has when every paper is due or on what dates i have exams that seems to help a lot keep on top of reading this is especially important for history english classes if you don't do the reading on time you'll end up getting bogged down later in the semester or closer to tests have a good quiet study space where you won't be distracted and other people won't distract you quiet music is okay but don't have the television on or a whole mess of people around you while you're trying to study you won't pay attention to what you're doing and you will be too tempted to socialize or do something else other than your school work without specific questions i'm afraid that's really the best advice i can give you i hope it helps  Education in Romania Graduate school Test (student assessment) GED Grade (education) SAT Education in Taiwan Advanced Placement Program Education in the People's Republic of China Hunter College High School A-level Junior Certificate Juris Doctor Victorian Certificate of Education Massachusetts Institute of Technology Harrow School Mathematics Education in the United States Economics The Apprentice 2 Singlish Social rule IB Diploma Programme Education in Germany Education Pitaten Girls Aloud Parliament of Canada Calvin and Hobbes Great Teacher Onizuka Quizbowl Franklin W.

can you give me a few reasons why it is good to have capital punishment thanks i am writing a compare and contrast essay about capital punishment i need details of why it is good to have capital punishments that is definitely the tougher side to argue most of the arguments for the death penalty are emotional in nature how can you let a person live who just drowned her three children there was also a recent study which said that for every prisoner executed x number of murders were prevented but from what i understand that study did not stand up very well to scrutiny from a logical standpoint the anti capital punishment stance wins hands down by far the most compelling reason is this sometimes the legal system gets it wrong look at all the people who have been released after years of imprisonment because they were exonerated by dna evidence unfortunately dna evidence is not available in most cases no matter how rare it is the government should not risk executing one single innocent person really that should be reason enough for most people if you need more read on because of the extra expense of prosecuting a dp case and the appeals process which is necessary see reason it costs taxpayers much more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life the deterrent effect is questionable at best violent crime rates are actually higher in death penalty states this may seem counterintuitive and there are many theories about why this is ted bundy saw it as a challenge so he chose florida the most active execution state at the time to carry out his final murder spree personally i think it has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder by killing people the government becomes the bad parent who says do as i say not as i do there s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst of our criminals let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell and think about the freedom they don t have until they rot of old age when ted bundy was finally arrested in he told the police officer i wish you had killed me the u s government is supposed to be secular but for those who invoke christian law in this debate you can find arguments both for and against the death penalty in the bible for example matthew insists that violence shall not beget violence james says that god is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice leviticus warns against vengeance which really is what the death penalty amounts to in john jesus himself says let he who is without sin cast the first stone  Capital punishment in the United States Murder Abortion debate Miscarriage of justice Rape Appeal Theory of conduct Sin Mumia Abu-Jamal Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ted Bundy Plame affair Serial killer Ten Commandments Arguments for and against drug prohibition Gun politics Henry Lee Lucas Resurrection of Jesus O.

do you know any information about gravity that kids can understand well it depends how young the kids are but if i were trying to explain gravity to a kid i'd say that the earth's core is like a giant magnet so everything within the atmosphere is pulled down to it no matter what once you leave the atmosphere there isn't any gravity you could demonstrate with jumping and say that the reason everything doesn't just float around is because there's an invisible magnetic force pulling everything down to the earth i haven't taken physics in a couple of years but i think if i were or even younger i'd understand that pretty well  Gravity Sun Moon Planetary nebula Tide Mercury (planet) Stellar evolution Solar wind Planetary orbit Black hole Solar system Magnet Supernova Luminiferous aether Fundamental interaction Modified Newtonian dynamics Plate tectonics Hydrogen Neutron star Special relativity Spacecraft propulsion Quantum mechanics Anti-gravity Causality Diamagnetism Neptune Force Neutrino Physics Saturn History of physics Supersymmetry Planetary habitability Earth's magnetic field Weightlessness Earth Solar variation Isaac Newton Big Bang Magnetism Geology of the Moon Timeline of the Universe Superconductivity Celestial body atmosphere Creationism Jupiter STS-62 Artificial gravity Earth's atmosphere Items in the Metroid series Lunar Prospector Theory of everything Force powers Physical cosmology Hollow Earth Fermi paradox Grand unification theory Planet Dyson sphere Xen (Half-Life) Physical science Geodesy Coming of Age (TNG episode) Terraforming Theory of conduct Quantum gravity Unified field theory Space colonization Magnetic field Nuclear magnetic resonance Mass Gas giant Newton's laws of motion Center of mass Geophysics Robot Master Cassini-Huygens Non-standard cosmology Intelligent design Space elevator Equivalence principle Etheric plane Phase (matter) Time travel Bong Heat Gravity Probe B Perpetual motion Speed of light String theory 2001: A Space Odyssey Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Bubble Bobble Gee Rare Earth hypothesis Unidentified flying object Weight Loop quantum gravity Tether propulsion

what are some study tips that improved your grades use different colored pens if your teachers allow it the brain loves color so this will help you to learn and also to remember what you have learned whenever i had to study vocabulary or a subject with lots of content like a science or humanities course it helped me to write down all the main points in fabulous colors i even did this with statistics and it helped me remember all those wacko formulas if you are trying to learn some content with a friend you can drill each other while tossing a ball back and forth this movement also enhances learning and memory as you are engaging your proprioceptive sense where your body is in space and besides that it's fun you can also change this idea the only limit is your imagination suppose your friend asked a question and demonstrated a dance move then you answered the question while repeating the same movement fun fix a nice snack like carrot sticks and dip or a bag of m m's hehe and allow yourself to take a break and enjoy only after you've put in a solid minute study time no ims etc that way you are training yourself to be more disciplined but also feeding your brain some energy food when preparing for a test make up your own multiple choice or fill in the blank practice test and drill yourself and your friends like crazy until you all know it well they will really appreciate your help if you have a lot of assignments you have to do arrange with your study buddy to chat after you've finished or maybe before school the next morning so you can compare notes and make sure you are both ready to face the day sometimes reviewing and discussing your work together cements the concepts for you and again helps you to remember them good luck to you  GED Extreme Programming Science Alexander Technique A Course In Miracles Second language acquisition Education Autism Psychology SAT Mathematics Martial art Professional wrestling match types Neuro-linguistic programming Avenue Q Son Goku (Dragon Ball) CPU cache Shaggy dog story Memory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Mnemonic Meaning of life Philosophy of perception Scientific method Marching band The nature of God in Western theology Pitaten Teen Girl Squad Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Drawing Sydney Riot of 1879 Eye Amiga Power Psychokinesis YuYu Hakusho Special relativity Current teachings of Prem Rawat Blood on the Tracks Great Teacher Onizuka Education in Romania Columbine High School massacre Sexual orientation Deconstruction Milton H.

i don't understand this question i'm finishing a reading assignment for a book and i don't understand one of my questions here it is tell how the setting and historical context of the work is important in understanding the other elements of the work such as plot characterization or theme the book that i am doing is the jungle by upton sinclair can anyone tell me what i have to do in words that i can actually understand explain how the place and time of the story affects how the characters behave the story plays out or the overall meaning of the story for example west side story is basically romeo and juliet set in the west side of new york so the setting means that the romeo is part of a street gang instead of a nobleman's son and they are fighting with knives and guns instead of swords with the jungle you might imagine how the story might have played out in hong kong instead or on a farm would the story have had to be different would those settings changed the characters what if it had been set in japan during the shogun dynasty would the historical context changed it hope that helps  Romeo and Juliet Chinese character Shakespeare on screen Upton Sinclair Social psychology Wuxia Drama The Book of Five Rings Martial art West Side Story Extreme Programming Confucianism Shogun Juliet Simplified Chinese character Samurai Deeper Kyo James Clavell Feudalism Philosophy of language Writing system Theory of conduct Yu-Gi-Oh!

using sensory language this is one of my summer assignments using sensory language write a character sketch of your best friend how do i go about this am i supposed to say how my best friend tastes or feels or smells i understand sight and sound but that doesn't make for such a long paper i need help thanks when you write a character sketch you are trying to introduce the reader to someone you want the reader to have a strong mental image of the person to know how the person talks to know the person's characteristic ways of doing things to know something about the person's value system character sketches only give snap shots of people therefore you should not try to write a history of the person a good way to write a character sketch is to tell a little story about one encounter you had with him or her if you do that you could describe a place briefly hopefully a place that belongs to the person you are describing focusing on things in the scene that are somehow representative of the person you are describing describe how the person is dressed then simply tell what happened as you spent time together from time to time describe the person's gestures or facial expressions it is important to put words into the person's mouth in direct quotations as you work on this paper you should decide what kind of emotional reaction you want the reader to have in relationship to this person what kind of details can you select to create that emotional reaction avoid making broad characterizing statements instead let the details you give suggest general characteristics let the reader draw her own conclusions excellent example can be found at remove spaces from link http www engl niu edu wac grandma html use the sensory items to give an overall impression of the encounter you're describing about this person of them but also their environment and personality sensory items in this example sight wrinkled hands environment old white wooden cupboards hearing she shuffled slightly environment squeaky door smell lavender perfume faint whif of moth balls environment rancid aroma of over cooked coffee touch feel she placed a wet smack on my turned cheek soft loose flesh of her sagging arms environment the cracker turned soft taste crackers butter coffee hope this helps best wishes to you  Autism Meaning Milton H.

help with summer assignment i can't find any symbolism irony personification or foreshadowing in a tale of two cities no matter how many times i reread it nor can i find any personification in furthormore i can not find any lines with major conflict in a tale of two cities does anyone know where or on what pages i can look for them i understand the books both of them i just can not find those things listed above in the books i am not being distracted as said before i read and understood both of the books but i can not find the objects i am searching for i'm on the computer only to look for help on the matter and there is no music or television or telescreen in my room in a tale of two cities the author charles dickens uses a great deal of irony in the opening chapter to draw the reader into the story by using a slew of contradictory statements in the opening paragraph the author forces the reader to further investigate the meaning of the cryptic opening line it was the best of times it was the worst of times symbolism look for the meanings of symbolic names in a tale of two cities in his novels stories and other works dickens placed great importance on the names he gave his characters names for dickens were often a type of shorthand a way of communicating something essential about a character in a tale of two cities stryver is the ambitious lawyer working his way up the social ladder another example is lucie whose name comes from the latin word for light notice how often dickens refers to her as a bright and shining example to inspire the other characters as you read look for the meanings of other symbolic names in a tale of two cities what does the name cruncher suggest to you what english words does charles darnay's real name evr monde sound like and what might dickens be suggesting by naming one of his main characters charles darnay and giving him the initials c d other symbols broken wine casket knitting the marquis personification a figure of speech in which an animal object or idea is given human form or characteristics is called personification dickens was a master of this technique and used it often to help create striking descriptions or moods in his novels for example the concept of hunger is described in chapter as staring down from the chimneys of the poor and rattling its dry bones in chapter dickens uses personification to enrich his description of a noble's castle foreshadowing is a literary technique in which the author uses clues to prepare readers for what will happen later in the story both the first and second section of a tale of two cities contain much foreshadowing of future events in book the first chapter a wine cask shatters after describing hands feet and mouths stained red from the spilled wine dickens says the time will come when the people will be stained red with another substance blood another instance of foreshadowing in earlier chapters is the footsteps lucie hears outside her home in london toward the end of this section the footsteps draw nearer and nearer to lucie and her family conflict the final conflict between miss pross and madame defarge also represents a larger conflict between love and hate by having miss pross triumph over madame defarge dickens indicates that love can conquer even the strongest hatred carton similarly defeats madame defarge when he orchestrates darnay s freedom out of love for lucie however in both cases the struggle exacts a price for evil s defeat miss pross loses her hearing and carton loses his life dickens seems to be saying that good will overcome evil but not without suffering and sacrifice  Creation according to Genesis George Orwell Literature Goldstein's book Nineteen Eighty-Four The Tale of Genji The Brothers Karamazov Yoga

why does barton on sea have destructive waves i'm doing my geography gcse coursework and this is one of the things that i have to include beach the temporary deposition of sand and shingle along the coastline without its beach a coast is vulnerable to erosion e g the cliffs at barton on sea were easily eroded following the construction of a groyne updrift at bournemouth destructive waves found on steep beaches are steeply breaking and mainly responsible for coastal erosion their backwash is much stronger than their swash destructive process in storm conditions particularly the process can cause significant erosion to beaches an example being barton on sea on the english coast and therefore is a threat to coastal communities that rely on their beaches for protection from more serious erosion the need is most obvious where there are permanent structures on the shore the loss of first the beach then of old glacially deposited sediment to longshore drift resulted in the loss of the english town of dunwich in suffolk to the sea the problem causes coastal towns in erosional longshore drift areas to employ coastal defences such as groynes which interrupt the downstream movement of sediment jetties and groynes generally do not stop longshore drift but interfere with it to the extent of retaining some of the beach material which might otherwise be removed when a groyne is constructed once equilibrium has been regained the longshore drift resumes but if the groyne has been well sited some of the beach material is retained on its upstream side this is useful in dissipating the energy in incoming waves as the retained beach breaks some of the force the part of the shore in the shadow of the groyne downstream from it is sheltered by having the waves broken by the structure  Coast Glacier Bar (landform) Seawall Dam Jetty Dune Colorado Plateau Shipwreck Flood Desert Reculver Geology of the Appalachians Sea level rise Tsunami Geography of Ireland Spit (landform) Geography of Albania Death Valley National Park Breakwater (structure) Storm surge 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Sussex Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Spurn Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bournemouth Battle of Normandy Geography of Venezuela Geology of the Yosemite area Long Island Tide Desertification Deforestation Yosemite National Park Sutherland Shire Sediment Geography of Turkey Hurricane Ivan Geology of the Bryce Canyon area Amoco Cadiz Hampshire USS Sands (DD-243) Geomorphology Landing at Anzac Cove Dorset Oceanic trench Opportunity rover Three Gorges Dam Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Disaster Anchor Geography of Mexico Flood geology Snowball Earth Intermontane Plateaus Tlingit Atlantic Ocean Weymouth Levee Geography of India A151 road Natural disaster Ecology of Hong Kong Surtsey River Plate tectonics Geology of the Alps Galveston Hurricane of 1900 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Sun Radio Caroline Romney Marsh 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Impact crater Sedimentary rock Orjen Geology Swiss plateau Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign Landform Yellowstone National Park

please help me with these math problems what is the area of a square inscribed ina circle with radius what is the area of an equilateral triangle with perimeter leave in square root form if the radius is then the diameter is if a square is inscribed in a circle then the diameter of the circle is the same as the diagonal of the square since you know the diagonal of the square you can find the length of the sides let x length of the sides of the square then x the area of the square and x x x divide both sides by x therefore the area is i'm not sure what background you have you can either use trig to find the height or algebra if the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is then each side has length you can form a right triangle to find the height the resulting equation comes from the pythagorean theorem and it is h h h h sqrt the area is b h sqrt sqrt sqrt because the sqrt can be written as sqrt sqrt  Triangle Pythagorean theorem Pi Circle Square root Trigonometric identity Cissoid of Diocles Area (geometry) Pentagram Complex number Quartic equation Square root of 2 Quadratic equation Archimedes Golden ratio Ruler-and-compass construction Hipparchus (astronomer) Multiple integral Heron's formula Ptolemaios's theorem Fibonacci number Exponentiation Haversine formula Angle Tetrahedron Geometry Spherical trigonometry Reuleaux triangle Standard deviation John Wallis Linear differential equation Inner product space Kepler's laws of planetary motion Norm (mathematics) Dimensional analysis Normal distribution Escape velocity Quaternion Crystallographic restriction theorem Quadrilateral Conic section Wallpaper group Polygon Pentagon Pascal's triangle Platonic solid Cholesky decomposition Length of an arc Boy's surface Ellipse Ruffini's rule Euclid's Elements Timeline of mathematics Dirac equation Regular polytope Tessellation Pappus of Alexandria Semi-major axis Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Great-circle distance Constructible polygon Frame fields in general relativity Matrix (mathematics) Linear regression Distance Real number Lattice (group) Heat equation Parallax Combinatorics Lagrangian point Methods of contour integration Hilbert space Symmetry Langmuir probe Mathematics Convergence of Fourier series Polynomial Determinant Metric tensor (general relativity) Proper time Euclidean distance Josip Plemelj Parabola Octahedron QR decomposition Rotational symmetry Examples of groups Sphere Napier's bones Vector (spatial)

i don't know how to summarize the top ten list of grievances in the declaration of independence i have to decide on which of the grievances provide the best evidence that justifies the colonies' need for independence then i have to later rewrite them and i have no idea how to sum them up does anyone know the top ten and can anyone simplify them for me here is a nice site that summarizes the situation at the time remove all spaces from this link http students kennesaw edu talter thomas jefferson the declaration of independence htm i think your biggest challenges are understanding the old fashioned wording of the grievances and deciding which ones you think are most important i looked at many websites and nobody mentioned any top ten grievances you need to put yourself in their shoes and think like a patriot then you can decide which ten you believe to be the most important i couldn't find where anyone has simplified the grievances so i will try to do that for you but i ask that you still rewrite them for your teacher in your own words using my words to help your understanding so here are the grievances against the king he refused to agree to laws that were needed for the good of the people he told his governors that they could not enact any laws without his permission but then would not give permission he refused to pass laws over large groups of people unless they agreed to give up their rights to have a leader speak for them about their needs he called important lawmaking meetings in places that were so far away the people could not participate when the people appointed leaders to represent them the king refused to acknowledge them or the rights of the people when the people tried to appoint another whom the king might like the king refused to allow any elections which caused great trouble and confusion in the colonies he prevented immigrants from coming to the colonies in order to keep their numbers small and also made it more difficult for them to own land he would not allow the people to set up just laws for maintaining order in the colonies he controlled all the judges so that they would do whatever he liked rather than what was right he created new positions so that he could send his own people to fill them to cause even more trouble for the colonists during times of peace he forced the colonists to live under military rule he caused this military rule to be separate from and more powerful than the people's representatives and their laws he forced the colonists to follow a legal system that did not agree with their beliefs or laws he allowed large groups of soldiers to have their living quarters among the colonists he used mock set up trials of any of his troops who killed colonists so that they would go unpunished he made it impossible for the colonies to trade by ship with other countries around the globe he forced the people to pay him taxes even though they had no chance to vote on whether the taxes were fair many colonists were pronounced guilty without a trial by jury made up of other colonists he forced colonists to be shipped out of the americas even though they weren't really guilty of doing anything wrong he forced a neighboring colony to live under laws that did not give them the freedoms guaranteed under english law and then changed the boundaries to force the colonists to abide by the same strict laws he took away all the formerly established laws and charters which guaranteed the colonists' rights he refused to allow the colonists to have representatives in a legislature that would create good laws instead forcing them to live under government controls that he established he refused to recognize any of the colonists' elected officials refused to protect the colonists' lives or their rights and basically declared war against them he attacked their ships their coastal cities their towns and killed their people he hired foreign soldiers to fight against the colonists acting not like a civilized king but a barbarian he forced colonists who were captured at sea to fight against their own countrymen or be killed themselves he used his powers to cause the native americans indians to attack and kill the colonists including their old people women and children he proved himself to be unfit as king because no matter how the people tried to reach a peacable agreement he continued to be cruel and unreasonable best wishes to you  United States Constitution First Amendment to the United States Constitution Appeal Article One of the United States Constitution History of the United

chemistry can someone pls answer my questions my midterm exam is about to come and yet i don't have the answers to these questions i really need help badly how come the metallic properties of the elements in the periodic table decreases as you go across and increases as you go down how come the atomic size of the elements in the periodic table decreases as you go across and increases as you go down how come the ionization energy of the elements in the periodic table increases as you go across and decreases as you go down how come the electron affinity of the elements in the periodic table increases as you go across and decreases as you go down i'm not sure about metals occur when atoms form overlapping orbitals because of pauli's exclusion principle and i don't know how that correlates to atomic size or electronegativity but i'll guess they're going for an easy answer since it's as you go down a group the atomic size gets larger and the atoms have less attraction to the valence electrons hence it becomes easier for them to be delocalized like in metals as you move across the atoms get smaller and hold onto their electrons more increasing as you go down is because you are adding energy levels to the electrons as you go across you are staying within the same energy level and you are adding more protons so the protons pull the electrons in a little closer so the atom gets smaller the ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove an electron and the larger the atom is the easier it is because the electrons will be further from the nucleus so as you go down a group atoms get bigger the ionization energy drops as you go across a period the atoms get smaller and the ionization energy increases the way i think about this one is that atoms don't like to have extra or missing electrons it's unstable to have a large amount of extra charge in a small space so to add an extra electron it helps to have enough space so that it can spread out think of trying to babysit kids with babysitters if you add an extra kid it makes a big difference especially if they're all hyperactive but if you had kids and babysitters adding kid wouldn't be so bad so as you move across a period atoms get smaller and it's more difficult to add electrons as you move down a group atoms get larger and it's easier to add electrons extra note if you know the size trends all of the other ones can be rationalized using that  Ionization potential Atomic orbital Nuclear fusion Hydrogen Chemistry Electron configuration Semiconductor Ionizing radiation Electronegativity Helium Ion Periodic table Covalent bond Carbon Atomic nucleus Orbital hybridisation Nuclear fission Mass spectrometry Uranium Nuclear magnetic resonance Neutron Solar cell Water (molecule) Solar variation Pauli exclusion principle Explosive material Inertial confinement fusion Electron Metal Iron Radiation hardening Lithium Computational chemistry Stellar evolution Plasma (physics) Electrical conduction Isotope Timeline of the Universe Gamma ray Hydrogen bond Chemical element Vacuum Nuclear reaction Corona discharge Phase (matter) Neutrino Supernova Rocket fuel Plutonium Chemical bond Spin (physics) Ozone depletion Identical particles Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Acid Nuclear explosion Magnetometer Lanthanum Fine-tuned universe Ionic bond Antimatter Aluminium Internal ballistics Ruthenium Gravity Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Magnetism Nuclear fuel cycle Vacuum tube Compact star Ozone hole Spark plug Electrophysiology Lutetium Biochemistry Subatomic particle Planetary orbit Entropy Sulfur Corrosion

complete the following sentence with a word or words that show a logical relationship joshua took a nap sorting the mail a after b while c before d instead of this looks like a trick question a joshua took a nap after sorting the mail joshua sorted the mail then took a nap seems pretty logical to me and it shows a relationship sort nap b joshua took a nap while sorting the mail joshua napping and sorting mail at the same time possible but probably not logical c joshua took a nap before sorting the mail joshua took a nap then sorted the mail also logical also shows a relationship nap sort d joshua took a nap instead of sorting the mail joshua naps and doesn't sort the mail also logical shows a relationship nap not sort so a c and d work if you have to pick one i would guess a because there is a relationship based on the assumption of average human behavior sorting would make joshua tired so he would take a nap afterward but if this is a test question with only one correct answer this is just one of those tests that are totally unfair and need to be destroyed or saved as an example of how not to design a test rule don't write multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers  Expert system G__del's incompleteness theorem Theory of conduct Monty Hall problem Meaning of life CPU design Infant baptism Ethics Jumpstart 3rd Grade Crossword Halting problem Epistemology Philosophy of language Identity and change Internet troll Documentary hypothesis Theodicy Metaphysics Sudoku Philosophical skepticism Wheel of Fortune Siesta SAT Propositional calculus Science Complexity classes P and NP Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Logic The Princeton Review GED Philosophy of mathematics Natural deduction Abraham Ludwig Wittgenstein Sleep The Exodus Database Deconstruction Second language acquisition Economics You Don't Know Jack Domain Name System Fallacy Goodness and value theory Vacuous truth Presuppositional apologetics Creation according to Genesis Western philosophy The nature of God in Western theology Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

calculus question finding amp period and phase shift y cos x pi y tan x pi what is the amplitude period and phase shift of each the standard formula for the equations is y asin bx c d where sin can be sin cos tan etc amplitude is always the a value so for the first problem the amplitude is the formula to find the period of a sine or cosine equation is pi b note that in the second problem tangents and cotangents use the formula pi b so substitute your b value in and you get pi for sine cosine tangent and cotangent the equation for phase shift is c b in the first problem that would be pi which reduces to be pi remember if the equation has c you take the opposite because the original equation shows bx c first distribute the then use the same steps from above amplitude period pi b pi phase shift pi  Trigonometric identity Amplitude modulation Tangent half-angle formula Hyperbolic function Phase-shift keying Discrete Fourier transform Euler's formula Quaternion Trigonometry Alternating current Ordinary differential equation Timeline of mathematics Harmonic oscillator Cissoid of Diocles Trajectory Basel problem Discrete cosine transform Triangle Tangent Laplace transform Map projection Impedance Complex number Polarization Prosthaphaeresis Mathieu function Beat (acoustics) Quantum tunneling Fourier transform Frequency modulation Integral Fourier series Newton's method Multiple integral Normal mode Standing wave ratio Orthogonal matrix Taylor series 3D projection Madhava of Sangamagrama WKB approximation Integration by parts Particle in a box Circle Kepler's laws of planetary motion Coordinates (mathematics) Mathematics of general relativity Coherent state Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Wave Roman surface Bessel function Al Battani Phase (waves) Color Path integral formulation RLC circuit Phasor (electronics) Angle Derivative Cubic equation Modified discrete cosine transform Trigonometric rational function Slope Ellipse Uses of trigonometry Wave equation Calculus Astrodynamics Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Absolute magnitude Versine Pendulum Cotangent bundle Gibbs phenomenon Generating trigonometric tables Pi Vector (spatial) Parabola Tangent space Power (physics) Single-sideband modulation Action potential Coordinate rotation Phase-locked loop NTSC Fresnel equations Slide rule Dynamical system Geometry Proper time TI-89 series Vector field Joseph Louis Lagrange Legendre transformation Boundary value problem

as i lay dying i read the book but am very confused why does vardaman relate his mother to a fish and jewel's to a horse this information is from sparknotes com shortly after addie s death the bundren children seize on animals as symbols of their deceased mother vardaman declares that his mother is the fish he caught darl asserts that jewel s mother is his horse dewey dell calls the family cow a woman as she mulls over her pregnancy only minutes after she has lost addie her only female relative for very different reasons the grief stricken characters seize on animals as emblems of their own situations vardaman sees addie in his fish because like the fish she has been transformed to a different state than when she was alive the cow swollen with milk signifies to dewey dell the unpleasantness of being stuck with an unwanted burden jewel and his horse add a new wrinkle to the use of animals as symbols to us based on darl s word the horse is a symbol of jewel s love for his mother for jewel however the horse based on his riding of it apparently symbolizes a hard won freedom from the bundren family that we can draw such different conclusions from the novel s characters makes the horse in many ways representative of the unpredictable and subjective nature of symbols in as i lay dying  Days of our Lives Chinese character Elephant Horus Cattle Horse Abortion debate Iliad Unicorn Rastafari movement American Dad!

does anyone else besides me do their own homework just curious i've got a two year old son go to school full time and i have a full time job i still get my homework done by myself what i really get annoyed at though is when someone has a genuine question for help that gets completly ignored go figure well maybe it's not that that someone's genuine question for help is getting completely ignored you mean on ya here in the homework help category well i can only speak for myself but there are questions that i skip over not because i am purposefully ignoring the person but because i just don't know the answer i read the chemistry and physics questions all the time but that is not my area of expertise and so in answering and attempting to answer the questions my answer may actually steer the asker of the question in the wrong direction rather than help them solve the problem and it has happened a couple of times so now rather than give wrong advice or misled guidance as much as i would like to help i normally would skip on to some other questions that i do know that i can answer with greater certainty and accuracy so while it may seem like people like me who do contribute a lot are ignoring a seemingly genuine question in need of a respectful response not answering is better than my posting an answer that just says i don't know just to get points for offering not very helpful help sometimes those genuine questions asked require the right answerer to be at the right time and place and maybe just maybe the right answerers with the know it aren't online at the same time as the genuine asker thanks for asking your genuine question although you weren't asking for help it still deserved a respectful answer  Theory of conduct Plame affair A Course In Miracles Internet troll Asperger syndrome Downing Street memo You Don't Know Jack Expert system Extreme Programming Social rule Shaggy dog story GED Transactional analysis The Apprentice 2 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Philosophical skepticism Little Britain Singlish Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Quizbowl Philosophy of science Plame affair timeline The Princeton Review Free will 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Education in the People's Republic of China Discordianism Unidentified flying object Supernatural Goodness and value theory Media bias in the United States Scientology beliefs and practices Meaning of life Altruism Zhao Yun Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Deconstruction Adjoint functors Religion Whose Line Is It Anyway?

suggest first three steps for getting success in life first of all you don't get success in life you work for it very hard to achieve it you firstly must have the ambition to succeed find this within yourself or others for whatever reason realistic reasons ask yourself why do you want to be successful you have to find your inner drive to be able to find ambition secondly you must have a plan ask yourself how am i going to get where i want to go how will my goal of being successful be achieved thirdly put your plan into action start working toward your dream don't let anyone or any obstacles get in your way of success good luck just by asking this question i'm aware that you want to succeed if you really want to accomplish this you will definitely do it remember that success in life comes in different forms and shapes so what success is for me may be something completely unique for you once again wish you the best of luck  Luck Strategic planning Lucid dreaming Bernard Williams Novelty (locomotive) Tai Chi Chuan Sharon Tate Alcoholics Anonymous Ontological argument Nicomachean Ethics Kasparov versus The World Super Mario 64 Benjamin Mountfort Kung fu Social psychology War of the Austrian Succession American Dream Dog agility Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Cyrus S.

algebra problems that you could walk me through find the value of x in the following system of equations x y y x and another problem what is the slope of a line parallel to the line y x thanx muchoo love first problem we have y x so let's substitute that in for y in the first equation x x x x x to check that this is right we now have y y and y y y since they both come out as we know x is correct for the second problem y x the slope of this line is whatever x is being multiplied by is the slope any line parallel to this would have to have the exact same slope otherwise it would eventually intersect parallel means they never intersect or cross to see that this is true you can graph it on graph paper you'd start at y x and then plot another point at y the in means its increasing from the original point and x the in means its increasing from the original point then draw a straight line that goes through both of your points any line that isn't going over and up no matter how far away you put it to begin with on the y axis will eventually cross your original line  Cissoid of Diocles Parabola Projective transformation Polynomial Slope Conic section Supply and demand Trigonometric function Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Random walk Linear equation Incidence (geometry) Complex number Geometry Cartesian coordinate system Algebraic geometry Elliptic curve Vector (spatial) Newton's method Exponential function Quadratic equation Tangent Mathematics Microeconomics IS/LM model Ordinary differential equation Arthur Cayley Covariance and contravariance Duality (projective geometry) Calculus Roman surface Collision detection Quantum harmonic oscillator Perspective (graphical) Production function Glossary of graph theory Equation of time IP (complexity) Graph theory Elementary algebra Aberration in optical systems Bresenham's line algorithm Topology Boy's surface Ruler-and-compass construction Joseph Louis Lagrange Sundial Cubic equation Line at infinity Phase diagram Mathematics of general relativity Planar graph Special relativity Curve Augustus De Morgan Laws of Form Keynesian economics Minkowski diagram Simplex algorithm Euclidean plane isometry Circuit design Map projection Desargues' theorem Action potential Matroid M__bius transformation Transformation problem Astrodynamics Geographic coordinate system Non-Euclidean geometry Cournot competition Exponentiation Dirac equation Production theory basics Nomogram Dividing a circle into areas Ellipse Independent Subway System Orthogonal matrix Square root P-adic number Curve fitting Line (mathematics) Magnetic field Topological space Denotational semantics Logic Faster-than-light CPU cache Quartic equation Racetrack (game) Angle Perspective projection distortion Gaussian elimination Yield curve Elementary arithmetic Function (mathematics) Halting problem Quaternion

how do i write a critical essay i have to write an essay invoving an analysis of the author's work a breif overveiw of the plot and main points of the work and discuss how the author wrote rather than what was written what does that mean in simple english any other definition of critical essay would be helpful as well lol i think i may be able to help you on this one critical analysis you give the interpretation of the work and explain why include supportive evidence from the work to establish a connection between your ideas and the work itself when writing an analysis you need to use third person and present verb tense make sure that you can support your ideas and that the work does not have more evidence to contradict than support the ideas your paper includes writing a critical analysis in an analysis you try to understand something better by breaking it down into its component parts studying those parts and seeing how they relate to each other and to the work as a whole before you can make any judgments about something you have to be sure you thoroughly understand it when writing a critical analysis you are critiquing a work which is simply evaluating and judging the work analysis vs personal taste it is important to distinguish between making a critical judgment and expressing an opinion based on personal taste you can acknowledge an opera singer s skill and voice even if you don t personally care for opera in the same way you can analyze and critique an essay or other literary work even if the subject matter and writing style are not to your personal taste getting started the more systematically you go about analyzing the assigned literary work and writing about it the more successful you will be begin by reading the assigned literary work make a photocopy of it to write on mark unfamiliar words and look up their meanings also mark and look up any references to unfamiliar people places or things read the literary work first for a basic understanding of its main idea or theme and the supporting ideas next read through the work again carefully answering questions and looking for aspects or elements to critique summarize the work if possible even if you don t plan on using the summary in your paper writing a summary will help to clarify in your own mind a literary work s main ideas try to summarize the literary work without looking at it reread the essay as often as necessary if your instructor has assigned specifics aspects of the work for you to write about pay attention to those write notes on your copy of the literary work or on a separate sheet of paper try to comment on as many things as possible in the literary work you may not mention everything in your essay but considering the aspects of the literary work will help you understand it do some prewriting listing or freewritng take this prewriting and begin to arrange it around a thesis statement the thesis should give the reader a clear sense of what will be analyzed in the critical essay writing your analysis when you are sure that you thoroughly understand the literary work being analyzed you are ready to plan your critical analysis of it with the essay you must first decide on the following aspects of your paper your purpose in general to write a critical analysis of a work but narrow it down to what you want to analyze about your audience the audience will either be someone familiar with the work or someone who has not read the work an unfamiliar audience requires you to spend time summarizing and explaining the work before you can actual begin analyzing it for your audience your tone serious objective and thoughtful use third person and present tense when writing the analysis your thesis your thesis should do more than indicate the content of the literary work it should indicate something about how it is written and what elements appear in it it should also express your evaluation of the literary work or of some aspects of it examples of thesis statements a thesis that deals only with content in bringing back flogging jeff jacoby argues that incarceration of criminals is not effective or humane and it would be better to bring back corporal punishment this thesis states jacoby s main idea and indicates that the paper will summarize the article it doesn t indicate any analysis you need to go beyond this for a successful analysis a thesis that analyzes and critiques in bringing back flogging jeff jacoby uses both logical and emotional appeals very effectively to try to convince readers to agree with him this thesis both explains what the author does and claims that he does it well in a critique your purpose is not to just explain how the article is written it is also to persuade your reader that your opinion about the work is correct this is the type of thesis statement that should be used when writing a critical essay tips for writing an analysis writing the opening your opening paragraph needs to grab the readers attention and identify the focus direction of your analysis summarize your subject very briefly include the title of the work and author start with a quotation from the literary work and then comment upon its importance begin with an explanation of the author s purpose and how well you think he she achieves this purpose open with a few general statements about life and relate to the focus of your analysis begin with a general statement about the type of literature you are analyzing and then discuss your subject within this context writing the body develop and support you

what are thomas more's views of humans and humanity in utopia i need help on answering this question i looked everywhere but i couldnt find the answer please helpp more realizes that his quasi ideal society is only ideal because the population of utopia is not ideal more accepts humans completely and understands their flaws instead of trying to create a society with perfect people he creates a society that will best serve imperfect people utopia shows its inhabitants that immorality is irrational and teaches them to think rationally more acknowledges that people will always act in their own best interests but develops a society that formulates its institutions so that an individual's best interest is also the best interest of the community  Utopia Reality Discourse ethics Immanuel Kant Franz Boas Meaning of life Sexual orientation Social justice Altruism Software engineering Religion Value system Cultural relativism Objectivist philosophy Utopia (book) Morality Confucianism Thomas Hill Green Max Weber Atheism Homo economicus Moral objectivism Ontological argument Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Reinhold Niebuhr Epistemology Theodicy Liberalism Trinity Abortion debate Utilitarianism Robert Hutchins Capitalism Jewish principles of faith State Ethics Friedrich Schleiermacher Existence of God Anarcho-capitalism Creation-evolution controversy Republic (dialogue) Political philosophy Transhumanism Peter Singer Categorical imperative Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Neoclassical economics Merit Philipp Melanchthon A Course In Miracles Political ideas in science fiction Dialectic Coercion Evil Microeconomics Goodness and value theory Derek Parfit Indigenous peoples Theory of conduct Scientific method Creationism Psychology of religion Socrates Anarchism Simone Weil Contributions to liberal theory Bertrand Russell Supernatural Determinism Universal pragmatics Supply and demand Guru Frankfurt School Victor Cousin Economics Thomas More History of creationism Lebesgue integration Criticism of libertarianism Jewish philosophy Conspiracy theory Intelligent design movement Young Earth creationism Atomism Peace Sociology Ayn Rand Social sciences Age of Enlightenment Civil rights Patriotism Predestination School of Salamanca Religion and sexual orientation Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals Soul Karl Marx Sociocultural evolution History of science Gnosticism

do you know any good quotes from the book the jungle by upton sinclair i need to have quotes for each theme in my summer paper for my history class themes are immigration urbanization industrialization politics social justice injustice i have found for each but i cannot find any other good ones please help me quote it is an elemental odor raw and crude it is rich almost rancid sensual and strong chapter pg quote it is a sound a sound made up of ten thousand little sounds you scarcely noticed it at first it sunk into your consciousness a vague disturbance a trouble chapter pg quote the line of the buildings stood clear cut and black against the sky here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world chapter pg quote they use everything about the hog except the squeal chapter pg quote relentless remorseless it was all his protests his screams were nothing to it it did its cruel will with him as if his wishes his feelings had simply no existence at all it cut his throat and watched him gasp out his life chapter pg quote so from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar chapter pg quote and for this at the end of the week he will carry home three dollars to his family being his pay at the rate of five cents per hour just about his proper share of the million and three quarters of children who are now engaged in earning their livings in the united states chapter pg quote he forgot how he himself had been blind a short time ago after the fashion of all crusaders since the original ones who set out to spread the gospel of brotherhood by force of arms chapter pg quote all but the bones of them has gone out to the world as durham's pure leaf lard chapter pg quote here is a population low class and mostly foreign hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old time slave drivers under such circumstances immorality is exactly as inevitable and as prevalent as it is under the system of chattel slavery chapter pg quote it was piece work and she was apt to have a family to keep alive and stern and ruthless economic laws had arranged it that she could only do this by working just as she did with all her soul upon her work and with never an instant for a glance at the well dressed ladies and gentlemen who came to stare at her as at some wild beast in a menagerie chapter pg quote this is no fairy story and no joke the meat will be shoveled into carts and the man who did the shoveling will not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one chapter pg quote they were beaten they had lost the game they were swept aside it was not less tragic because it was so sordid because that it had to do with wages and grocery bills and rents they had dreamed of freedom of a chance to look about them and learn something to be decent and clean to see their child group up to be strong and now it was all gone it would never be chapter pg quote to jurgis this man's whole presence reeked of the crime he had committed the touch of his body was madness to him it set every nerve of him a tremble it aroused all the demon in his soul chapter pg quote they put him in a place where the snow could not beat in where the cold could not eat through his bones they brought him food and drink why in the name of heaven if they must punish him did they not put his family in jail and leave him outside why could they find no better way to punish him than to leave three weak women and six helpless children to starve and freeze chapter pg quote he has no wit to trace back the social crime to its far sources he could not say that it is the thing men have called the system that is crushing him to the earth that it is the packers his masters who has dealt their brutal will to him from the seat of justice chapter pg quote jurgis could see all the truth now could see himself through the whole long course of events the victim of ravenous vultures that had torn into his vitals and devoured him of fiends that had racked and tortured him mocking him meantime jeering in his face chapter pg quote the word rang through him like the sound of a bell echoing in the far depths of him making forgotten chords to vibrate old shadowy fears to stir fears of the dark fears of the void fears of annihilation she was dead she was dead chapter pg quote elzbieta is one of the primitive creatures like the angleworm which goes on living though cut in half like a hen which deprived of her chickens one by one will mother the last that is left her chapter pg quote only think that he had been a countryman all his life and for three long years he had never seen a country sight nor heard a country sound chapter pg quote ah what agony is that what despair when the tomb of memory is rent open and the ghosts of his old life comes forth to scourge him chapter pg quote they are trying to save their souls and who but a fool could fail to see that all that is the matter with their souls is that they has not been able to get a decent existence for their bodies chapter pg quote all of these agencies of corruption were banded together and leagued in blood brotherhood with the politician and the police more often than not they were one and the same person the police captain would own the brothel he pretended to raid and the politician would open his headquarters in his saloon chapter pg quote all day long the blazing midsummer sun beat down upon that square mile of abominations upon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors stank and steamed contagion upon bare blistering cinder strewn railroad tracks and huge blocks of dingy meat factories whose labyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them and there are not merely rivers of hot blood and carloads of moist flesh and rendering vats and soup cauldrons glue factories and fertilizer tanks that smelt like the craters of hell there are also tons of garbage festering in the sun and the greasy laundry of the workers hung out to dry and dining rooms littered with food black with flies and toilet rooms that are open sewers chapter pg quote there is one kind of prison where the man is behind bars and everything that he desires is outside and there is another kind where things are behind bars and the man is outside chapter pg quote when people are starving and they have anything with a price i guess you ought to sell it i say i guess you realize it now when it's too late chapter pg quote to you the toilers who have made this land and have no voice in its councils to you whose lot it is to sow that others may reap to labor and obey and ask no more than the wages of a beast of burden the food and shelter to keep you alive from day to day it is to you that i come with my message of salvation it is to you that i appeal chapter pg quote the sentences of this man were to jurgis like the crashing of thunder in his soul a flood of emotion surged up in him all his old hopes and longings his old griefs and rages and despairs chapter pg quote to jurgis the packers had been the equivalent to fate ostrinski showed him that they were the beef trust they were a gigantic combination of capital which had crushed all opposition and overthrown the laws of the land and was preying upon the people chapter pg quote in a society dominated by the fact of commercial competition money is necessarily the test of prowess and wastefulness the sole criterion of power chapter pg quote and we shall organize them for the victory we shall bear down the opposition we shall sweep it before us and chicago will be ours chicago will be ours chicago will be ours chapter pg

how do you solve this problem is of another approach that will help you solve any problem of this sort is as follows replace the is with an equals sign replace of with a multiplication sign x or replace the unknown with a variable such as x or y change the percent into decimal form by moving the decimal point two places away from the percent sign that is the way i always remembered it in school that if you want to get rid of the percent you move the decimal point away from the percent sign but if you want to make a percent then you move it towards the percent sign therefore you should end up with this x multiply both sides by to make it easier to solve x therefore if we divide through by x  Polynomial Decimal Elementary algebra Binary numeral system Pi Gaussian elimination M__bius transformation Trigonometric function CPU design Derivative Vulgar fraction P-adic number Numerical analysis Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Vedic mathematics Prime number Compiler optimization Grade (education) Ordinary differential equation Two's complement Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Numeral system Planetary orbit Joseph Louis Lagrange Quartic equation Logarithm Cissoid of Diocles Napier's bones On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Quadratic sieve Quicksort Floating point Wheel of Fortune Linear programming Esperanto orthography Zeno's paradoxes Multiple integral Egyptian mathematics Linked list 0 (number) History of computing hardware Multiplication Complex number Dimensional analysis Slide rule IBM 700/7000 series Lagrange multipliers Unix time Discrete Fourier transform Assembly language Lambda calculus Division (mathematics) Quadratic equation Orthogonal matrix Two-body problem Daylight saving time Conic section System/36 Trip distribution Pound sterling State space (controls) Trigonometric identity Angle Quaternion Quantum computer Boolean satisfiability problem Timeline of mathematics Mental calculation Path integral formulation Newton's method Dash Recurring decimal IP (complexity) Equation solving Reduction (complexity) Bayes' theorem Projective transformation Percentage Resistor Multidisciplinary design optimization Operational amplifier COBOL Expert system Mach kernel Linear differential equation Separation of variables Exponentiation Optimization (mathematics) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Divide and conquer algorithm Central processing unit Ackermann function Base (mathematics) Contract bridge Eight queens puzzle Mode choice Cyprus dispute Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Circuit design

charles dickens what do you think about his style especially the short stories he wrote thank you a little old fashioned but that's not surprising given that he's not a modern author dickens managed to combine all the ingredients for interesting stories did you know they were written and published in the newspaper chapter by chapter so in those days it was something like watching a soap opera or a serial program he also wrote in a terrific hurry and if you want to be really picky there are a few loose ends in some of his stories but very few works of literature have held up for the same length of time and they are still interesting to read  Charles Dickens Literature Serial Hans Christian Andersen Victorian literature History of modern literature David Copperfield (novel) Soap opera Terry Pratchett British literature Arthur Machen The Foundation Series Joseph Conrad Japanese literature The Pickwick Papers C.

of mice and men opinion of mice and men is a very short novel do you think that anything have been gained by including more scenes from the time before or after the events of the story if you think so what could have been added and for what purpose if not explain why not thank you for your op inion no the novel is fine all you need to know about each character's past is already in the novel for example we know that lenny had gotten in trouble before we know that george is one who looked out for him and we know that everyone on that workfarm had a good reason for wanting to leave curly's wife was bored candy was lonely and brooks was basically ostracized the people in the story had enough of their past revealed in the book to fully understand every event in the novel adding more history or an epilogue would not have given the climactic moments any additional depth the two major events in the novel the death of curly's wife and lenny's death would still have happened at the same time and for the same reasons  Memento (film) Bob and George Humphrey Bogart Taxi Driver Mickey Mouse Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Three Stooges Of Mice and Men FLCL Scientology beliefs and practices Supergirl Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Aida (musical) Law & Order Retcon Scenes from a Memory Lenny Bruce Shaggy dog story The Great Mouse Detective Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Nova (novel) Legacy of Kain M*A*S*H (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye Screenwriting Mouse (computing) Ostracism CBS Carl Barks Digimon Mythology The Lovely Bones Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Time Machine Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Wyatt Earp The Matrix Ghostwriter (television series) Alfred Hitchcock Life insurance Star Trek: The Motion Picture Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Garfield Sin City Doctor (Doctor Who) Paranoia Agent Canon (fiction) Kodocha Storytelling Free will Supernatural Treehouse of Horror XI Predestination paradox The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Charles Dickens Glen Jacobs The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Vladimir Peter Tytla Sgt.

if x varies directly as y and x when y then what is the value of x when y i got but the correct answer according the the book is can someone explain how to solve this with step by step work in other words x don't give me some whacky answer like i've been getting on my other questions when i've already written clearly that x x varies directly as y therefore is to as x is to x x therefore since the in the denominator is multiplied by to get you have to multiply the in the numerator by also to find x x and that is how they got x hope this helps p s you could have also done x in which case when you cross multiply you'll get x x x  Vedic mathematics Vulgar fraction Computer numbering formats Continued fraction Crossword Bayesian inference A Course In Miracles Ordinary differential equation Projective transformation Gaussian elimination Expert system Quartic equation Software testing Infantilism Egyptian mathematics Elementary arithmetic Jackpot (game show) Wheel of Fortune Pascal's triangle Shor's algorithm Esperanto grammar Theory of conduct New Testament Halting problem Derivative COBOL Lagrange multipliers Quantum computer Complexity classes P and NP Discrete cosine transform Jacob Neusner Trigonometric function Partial fraction Lebesgue integration Egyptian fraction Formal power series Biblical inerrancy Mental calculation Trigonometric identity Newton's method GED Scientology beliefs and practices On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Sturm-Liouville theory Algorithm Series (mathematics) Infant baptism Transformation problem Photography Complex number Circuit design Orthogonal matrix Meaning of life Random walk LU decomposition God RuneScape Random Events Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Phase-locked loop P-adic number Optimization (mathematics) Slide rule Christianity Derivation of the partition function Joseph Louis Lagrange 3D projection Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

davinci code i have to read two books over the summer for ap and im reading the davinci code right now i have to also right a pg anylitical essay on it and i don't really know how to go about doing it can anyone help me anylize it did anyone finish that wouldnt mind sharing their views im not going to steal ideas i just need a jump start to put in my own words and get started thanks to all that answer dear i strongly recommend you to see some movie criticizes it will help you and gives you great ideas about the methods of analyzing a movie or book you can analyze and a criticize a book in different aspects the style of narration dialogues descriptions being worth reading or not remarkable aspects of the book weaknesses in the book the style of narration have you ever read harry potter if so you can clearly see differences in the style of narration between the books i'm not going to say everything about it but i give you some clues to help you about this issue in harry potter jk rowling narrates the story completely honestly in every page she gives you some information about the events and doesn t hide any fact but in davinci s code the writer tries to distract you sometimes and gives you some information that leads you to misjudge characters for example i'm sure you think that there is something wrong with that french agent i don t remind his name bezo fash or something and almost near the end of the story you realize that you are dead wrong it originates from the style of narration because writer intentionally gives you some right facts in wrong situations specially when you re suspicious to someone in harry potter from the first book you know there is a problem with snape and then in book you realize that you were right i haven't read the last book yet and this conclusion might be wrong but in davinci code facts are told in a way that leads you in a wrong prediction about story line and in the end of the story you suddenly realize that you were wrong try to point to remarkable aspects of the book for example you can write a lot of pages about great description in the book about places religions and other stuffs and say how it makes the book worth reading you can write about the speed of the event occurrence events occur so fast in the book that makes it quite exiting but sometimes writer describes things so much that you feel bored have you ever seen a movie criticize try to write about some weak or strong scenes in the book and discuss why you think so for example one of the masterpiece scene in the book is when the writer describes the crime scene in the beginning of the story because you can exactly imagine the scene you can also point to the weaknesses in the book in your point of view i hope it can help you if you have any question email me sarmad riazi gmail com  Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Screenwriting Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Extreme Programming Determinism David Hume Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter (character) Fan fiction Plame affair Canon (fiction) Francis Crick Harry Potter Supernatural Literature A Course In Miracles Severus Snape Theodicy Fight Club Philosophy of language The nature of God in Western theology Ethics Ginny Weasley Biblical inerrancy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Deconstruction Goodness and value theory Dates in Harry Potter Narrator Harry Potter: Book Seven Intelligent design Hermione Granger Jacob Neusner CPU cache I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Lovely Bones Little Britain Prince Edmund (Blackadder) American Pie (song) Narrative Ontological argument Simone Weil Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Killian documents Magical objects in Harry Potter Causality Irony Milton H.

few questions regarding to kill a mockingbird these are some questions i got stuck on in my summer assignment study guide for my english class chapter how does atticus hope to prevent jen and scout from catching the disease of most people in maycomb chapter contrast the two groups of men atticus faces chapter what does maycomb's turnout for the trial imply about human nature chapter what does atticus attempt to establish through heck tate's testimony chapter what does atticus attempt to establish through bob ewells testimony chapter what does mayella's testimony add to the case chapter what startling revelation is made about tom chapter why is it significant that dill should be the one to get sick in the courtroom chapter what is atticus actually condemning in his closing remarks to the jury what is the target of atticus' final plea chapter discuss scout's comment about the mockiingbirds in relation to boo i'll only answer a few sorry i don't know how to answer he established that bob ewell did not call for a doctor although his daughter mayella was badly hurt this suggests that bob ewell might have inflicted the injuries himself after he saw what mayella did to tom and was too afraid to call a doctor at that moment he also showed that bob ewell was a left hander implying that he might have hit mayella that she had no friends and what the ewell's background was like and she let slip that bob ewell got angry when he was drunk you'll have to read her reactions and atticus's questions for yourself tom's left hand is useless but mayella's injuries are mostly on the right side of her face this implies that a left hander hit her how could tom do that if he could not use his left hand also tom said that mayella was the one who kissed him on his cheek tom did not do anything to harm mayella he also said that he felt 'sorry' for mayella blacks aren't supposed to feel sorry for whites he is actually condemning the jury sort of i dunno how to explain he said that in a courtroom the jury is made up of many different 'classes' of people and they're all equal once they form a jury he wants to persuade the jury to bring justice and not be prejudiced this is a simple question heck tate did not want to tell the town that is was boo who saved the kids because he would be brought into the limelight and he definitely would not like that so scout said that to drag boo into the limelight would sort of be like shooting a mockingbird these are the best explanations i can think of now  To Kill a Mockingbird Plame affair Sharon Tate YuYu Hakusho Jury trial W.

a seperate peace what would call gene's character and finny's a separate peace john knowles gene forrester gene is the novel s narrator and he tells the story as a flashback reflecting on his days at the devon school from the vantage point of adulthood he is the source of all of the reader s information in the novel and yet proves somewhat unreliable as a narrator especially regarding insights into his own motivations we first meet him as an older man returning to the place where he spent his adolescence we thus initially attribute the wisdom of maturity to him and assume that he brings a certain degree of perspective to his memories of devon but even the adult gene seems filled with fears and insecurities his great worry we realize is that nothing has changed since adolescence not the school buildings and not most important himself more finny although we see all of the characters through gene s eyes his perception of others is most significant in the case of finny even as gene resents his best friend and harbors dark unspoken feelings of hatred toward him he regards finny at times with something akin to worship his depiction of finny contains a strong note of physical if not erotic attraction finny is presented in classical terms as a kind of greek hero athlete always excelling in physical activities and always spirited thymos to use the greek term more http www sparknotes com lit separate canalysis html study guides these links will give you a summary of the book character analysis plot and much more so that you will be able to answer literary questions http www sparknotes com lit separate http www bookrags com notes asp http www gradesaver com classicnotes titles separate http www pinkmonkey com booknotes barrons sepeace asp http www cliffsnotes com wileycda litnote id html http www novelguide com aseparatepeace  A Separate Peace Religious Society of Friends Nicomachean Ethics World Wide Web C.

probability math i know this is easy but im stuck i want solve this without listing all the possibilities is there a formula to find the desired over the possible outcomes take a look a fair coin is tossed times what is the probability that at least of the tosses will come up heads well there's an easy way and a less easy way less easy let p the probability of success in a single trial and q the probability of failure in a single trial for one toss the probability that you get heads is p and the probability of getting tails is q so if you want the probability of three tosses being heads and one being tails you combine probabilities by multiplying probability p p p q p q now there are many different ways you could get three heads and one tail there's a chance that you could get three heads in a row and then the tails or maybe the tails would be first and three heads after that each way you could get three heads and a tail contributes p q to your total probability the number of ways you can arrange getting k outcomes from n trials is nck n n k k in your case you're trying to see how many ways you can arrange getting three heads out of four total tosses so your final formula for calculating the probability of getting three heads out of four tosses is c p q then you have to set it up again to find the probability of getting all tosses as heads once you find that add it to the probability of getting heads and that's your total i strongly recommend that you understand how why this works and that you get comfortable doing it the long way before you use shortcuts like the one below easier way this whole concept is called the binomial distribution and you can use pascal's triangle to solve it much faster consider that p the probability of success and q the probability of failure since the total probability is p q must equal raising the quantity p q to the power and expanding p q out to get all its terms would give you p q p q p q p q p q where the coefficients are on the fifth row of pascal's triangle in real life words the terms you get from expanding p q n each tell you the probability of getting some number of successes out of n trials p is the probability of getting successes out of trials p q is the probability of getting successes out of trials and so on where the exponent on p is the number of successes remember that since p q equals the expansion of p q n also equals so all the terms you're getting give you probabilities that finally add to they represent all possible outcomes since you want the probability of getting at least heads just keep the p q p q part of the equation that's the combined probability of getting successes in all trials all heads or getting just successes in trials heads you already know the values of p and q see above so plug those in to get your answer for any problem like this you can use pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of the expanded terms remembering that the terms always go from p n q n starting at n as the power of p and subtracting one as you move to the next term hint use excel's binomdist function to check your answer  Pascal's triangle Binomial coefficient On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Bayesian inference Gambler's fallacy Temperature Negative binomial distribution Complex number Quartic equation Normal distribution Polynomial Dice Bayes' theorem I Ching divination Coin flipping Microeconomics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Riemann zeta function Mathematics Fischer Random Chess Pi Exponentiation Maximum likelihood Trip distribution Catalan number Gaussian elimination Matrix (mathematics) Continued fraction Principle of indifference IP (complexity) Checking if a coin is fair Projective transformation Trigonometric function Computer numbering formats Quantum computer Halting problem Lebesgue integration Quadratic equation Ordinary differential equation Cumulant Path integral formulation Blaise Pascal Principle of maximum entropy Combinatorics Binomial theorem Elementary algebra Random variable Martingale Newton's identities Prior probability Random walk Taylor series Transformation problem Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Large numbers Expert system Derivative Vedic mathematics Stochastic process Poker jargon Binary numeral system Napier's bones Pointer Ruffini's rule Recurrence relation Expected value Quantum harmonic oscillator Many-worlds interpretation Particle in a box Probability distribution Dimensional analysis Derivation of the partition function Complexity classes P and NP Redundant array of independent disks Exponential family Pascal's Wager Likelihood principle Strategic management Timeline of mathematics Information entropy M__bius transformation Central processing unit Inflation Contract bridge Basel problem Quadratic sieve Poisson distribution

do the hair density and hair diameter affect on the vulnerability to become baldpate and why for my project in the university about baldness i would say so think about someone who has thin hair would have more of a chance to go bald than someone with thick hair if someone has thick hair and if they lose a few strands you're not really going to notice because they have so much of it additionally if someone has weak hair the natural elements such as wind could be enough of a force to rip out the hair also say if a man has thin hair and even losing his hair he may try to use the comb over technique or try to stretch what hair he does have causing more fractures and stress on the hair and pulling it out unintentally himself  Hair Haircut Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Seismic retrofit Violin Baldness treatments Equine conformation Carbon nanotube Headgear Wood Stress (physics) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Alopecia areata Textile manufacturing Dreadlocks Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Space elevator Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Glacier Dog Yami to B__shi to Hon no Tabibito Pok__mon Abilities Afro textured hair Gas metal arc welding Glass Depilation Wire Brush Vagueness Sun Internal ballistics Urinary incontinence Avalanche Kryptonite InuYasha (character) Fiberglass Bicycle frame Hair color Rastafari movement 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Prostate cancer Pubic hair Guitar Osteoporosis Afro Skin Nuclear weapon design Carding Tide Geology of the Moon Wig (hair) Leather Tooth enamel Optical fiber Carpal tunnel syndrome Textile manufacturing terminology Aluminium Extinction Leaf Barbed wire Cashmere wool Hip fracture Magnetohydrodynamics Laser hair removal Hypertrichosis Billiards Radiation therapy Drill bit Dr. Otto Scratchansniff Moustache Melanin Terminal ballistics Soap bubble Knitting Skin effect Scapula Tenshinhan Kodocha Bladderwort Thin client Welding Malaria Deformation Chlorophyta BloodRayne Instant-runoff voting Comb Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Huygens probe Motorcycle helmet Beavis and Butt-head Corrosion Normal distribution Kurt Angle Prestressed concrete Polymer Keeshond Trichotillomania The Legend of Zelda series enemies

help please hello i need help with the question that i am stumped on i think i have an idea but i'm not sure here it is hydrogen sulfide is composed of two elements hydrogen and sulfur in an experiment g of hydrogen sulfide is full decomposed into its elements a if g of hydrogen is obtained in this experiemtn how many grams of sulfur must be ontained b what fundemental law does this experiemnt demonstrate c how is this law explained by dalton's atomic theory for b would it be the law of conservation of mass or law of multiple proportions i know the answer for a but not c or b thank you it's the law of multiple proportions the law of multiple proportions is one of the most basic laws of stoichiometry it is related to the law of definite proportions it is sometimes called dalton's law after its discoverer the english chemist john dalton though this usually refers to his law of partial pressures one statement of the law is if two elements form more than one compound between them then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers for part c dalton's atomic theory it was concluded that so far from dalton being led to the idea that chemical combination consists in the interaction of atoms of definite and characteristic weight by his search for an explanation of the law of multiple proportions the idea of atomic structure arose in his mind as a purely physical concept forced upon him by study of the physical properties of the atmosphere and other gases part a which you solved is an example of what the law of multiple proportions is all about  John Dalton Hydrogen Atom Explosive material Chemical element Atomism Physics Sulfur Gravity Molecule Mass Sulfuric acid Carbon Stoichiometry Quantum mechanics Nuclear magnetic resonance Hydride Origin of life Helium Temperature Hydrogen sulfide Alternative biochemistry Atomic mass Mineral Nuclear weapon design Solar system Technetium Mole (unit) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Sulfide Big Bang Titanium Emergence Ammonia Nickel Physical science Aluminium Avogadro's number Supernova Organic chemistry History of chemistry Silver Rocket fuel Equivalence principle Flue gas desulfurization Subatomic particle Periodic table Hydrogen economy Physical cosmology Oxygen Chlorine Dmitri Mendeleev Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes Particle physics Alcohol Isotope separation Atomic orbital Atomic mass unit Sodium Philosophy of language Vacuum Neutron Battery (electricity) Solar cell Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Antoine Lavoisier Hydrochloric acid Gasoline Haloalkane Entropy Force Orbital hybridisation Electron Teller-Ulam design Phase (matter) Classical mechanics Radium Iron Mass spectrometry Dynamical system Internal combustion engine Normal distribution Covalent bond Hydrogen atom Nuclear fusion Photosynthesis Science History of the periodic table Permian-Triassic extinction event Jupiter Hydrogen chloride

how does critical thinking affect you as a reader and writer gosh i could teach a whole class on this this is a complicated question and i'll try to give you a good concise answer depending on what type of critical reading you are doing you gain a new lens with which to view the text for example if i were going to read a poem with a marxist critical view i would look at the text for examples of class divides stratification and the influence of wealth or power if i were to read the same poem with the critical lens of gender studies i would look for allusions to gender typical gender roles and stereotypes or references to inanimate objects being referred to as masculine or feminine looking at texts critically can help you understand what the author originally meant in the work but also what is implied in the work but not directly stated critical thinking helps you understand the text in many different ways and learn to think about things from many different perspectives critical thinking in writing plays a similar role there are so many things that you can say in a text without directly stating them an understand of different types of literary criticism can help you make sure you mean what you say but also what you imply for example if you were writing a love poem an understanding of basic imagery might be important understanding that feminine imagery is typically moon references being fair being white etc male imagery is typically the opposite ruddy bright dark sun like imagery understanding basic terminology or tenants of many different types of literary criticisms can help you use allusion and language in a way that others will understand and that will give your writing deeper meaning you must first know the rules in order to break them i hope this helps  God and gender Deconstruction Gender Philosophy of language Literary theory Postmodernism Feminism A Course In Miracles Grammatical gender Hermeneutics English grammar Gender identity Sexual orientation Second language acquisition Literature German grammar Writing system Ojibwe language Gender role Hangul Social psychology Theory of conduct Philosophy Labor theory of value Bulgarian language Extreme Programming Object-oriented programming Hierarchy Economics German language Catalan grammar Hell Sex Martin Heidegger Capitalism New Testament Political correctness GED Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Cross-dressing Arabic literature Political economy Sociology Carl Jung Chinese language Vietnamese language Varieties of Arabic Philo God XML Tamil language Mathematics Goddess Hebrew language Aesthetic Realism Riism Esperanto vocabulary Urdu Plato Psychology Marshall McLuhan Sociocultural evolution Fictional character Esperanto as an international language Gospel of John Fundamentalism Eli Siegel Art Meaning of life Anarcho-primitivism Culture Republic Physical attractiveness Chinese character Economic inequality Metaphor Poetry Libertarian socialism Translation Gary Snyder Magic (paranormal) Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Homosexuality and transgender Portuguese language Predestination

help me to prepare for a debate i want to know what is the gtrength and weakness of democracy have you studied cbse board in th std the civics book was all about democracy if not well democracy is a system ensuring that the people are governed no better than they deserve george bernard shaw democracy describes a number of related forms of government with origins in ancient greece rome south asia and north and south america democracy has generally grown and expanded throughout history citation needed the principles of democracy emphasize the importance of the individual in the context of government and today are a major influence around the world though the term democracy is typically used in the context of a political state the principles are also applicable to other groups and organizations in contemporary world politics democracy has become a significant concept with most nations in the world claiming to adhere to the broad principles of democracy however there is significant diversity among nations describing themselves as democratic in the modern world making democracy increasingly difficult to define for instance the north korean constitution describes north korea as a democratic state but some commentators in western nations have described it as a totalitarian dictatorship poor democracies have better education longer life expectancy lower infant mortality access to drinking water and better health care than poor dictatorships this is not due to higher levels of foreign assistance or spending a larger percentage of gdp on health and education instead the available resources are managed better democracies do not have large scale famines refugee crises almost always occur in nondemocracies looking at the volume of refugee flows for the last twenty years the first eighty seven cases occurred in autocracies political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of corruption democracy parliamentary systems political stability and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption democracies are more likely to win wars than non democracies democracies are more often associated with a higher average self reported happiness in a nation regarding the claim that nondemocracies have higher growth this only applies to east asia if leaving out east asia then during the last forty five years poor democracies have grown their economies more rapidly than nondemocracies poor democracies such as the baltic countries botswana costa rica ghana and senegal have grown more rapidly than nondemocracies such as angola syria uzbekistan and zimbabwe a recent meta analysis finds that democracy has no direct effect on economic growth however it has a strong and significant indirect effects which contribute to growth democracy is associated with higher human capital accumulation lower inflation lower political instability and higher economic freedom there is also some evidence that it is associated with larger governments and more restrictions on international trade remember to speak very confidently with a throw in your voice it shows that you are powerful and later even if you mumble your confidence will earn you points hope this helps  Republicanism Republic Democratization Free trade Famine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Botswana Economic inequality Social democracy Communist state International Monetary Fund Left-wing politics Economy of India Voter turnout Liberalism worldwide South Korea Bretton Woods system European Union Economy of Russia Chile Nationalism Economy of Pakistan North Korea Direct democracy State South Africa Election Capital accumulation Enlargement of the European Union Political economy Economic growth Anti-communism Privatization Federal World Government AIDS in Africa Economy of Haiti Supply-side economics Superpower Economy of Chile Monetary policy Marshall Plan Economy of the Philippines Niger Economic relations of Japan Wealth Liberal Democrats (UK) Myanmar Government debt AIDS pandemic Economy of Nigeria History of Modern Greece Canada Gold standard Economy of Venezuela Foreign policy of Japan Malawi Freedom House Publicly funded medicine History of South Korea Economy of Sri Lanka Asian financial crisis People's Republic of China Politics of the United States Soviet Union United States Political philosophy Totalitarianism United Nations Minimum wage Politics of Canada Neoliberalism Republic of China Constitution Economy of Belgium Democracy (varieties) Uzbekistan Sociocultural evolution Weimar Republic Anti-globalization Civil rights Economy of Peru Socialism Deflation (economics)

what are the causes for police corruption and police abuse of force are they caused by the same things explain please some of it is going to be due to the availability of bad money if a dope dealer offers some quick cash some police are going to take it sometimes when the police stop and do not arrest they just keep everything that the crook has it is easily justified in the mind sometimes it is easy to apear in court and use perjury to imprison someone because the cop thinks they need it that is overt corruption but there is another kind of danger as well when cops see how little difference they make at times they get bitter they just give up and slowly begin to do less and less then they just stay because it is a way to pay the rent and it has retirement benefits they burn out it happens a lot abuse of force can be because of burnout bitterness or maybe they are cruel to start with they are not demi gods they are people and people do bad things sometimes  EastEnders Knots Landing Theory of conduct 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Police Rent (musical) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Murder Beltway sniper attacks Anwar Ibrahim Arguments for and against drug prohibition Domestic violence Law & Order Illegal drug trade Life insurance Poker jargon Cultural Revolution Capitalism Blackjack Grand Theft Auto (game) KRS One Oh My Goddess!

can anyone tell me all the allusions biblical or otherwise found in the poisonwood bible well first there's all the biblical names bethlehem where jesus was born methuselah found in genesis who is the longest living man ironic that in pb the cat doesn't live that long leah who is the older less attractive sister of rachel and jacob's first wife in the bible chapter titles genesis revelation judges exodus bel and the dragon all books of the bible bel and the dragon is in the apocrypha much more can be found in the link below here's an example the demonstration garden nathan's demonstration garden serves as a wonderful symbol on three levels first the garden itself can be seen as a stand in for the attitudes and beliefs that the prices carry with them into africa like those attitudes the plants are wildly inappropriate in this environment the plants become unrecognizable almost grotesque in their hugeness more significantly though they are rendered inert and useless unable to fruit the indigenous north american plants cannot vegetate under the conditions in africa the very act of planting the garden rests upon one of the wildly inappropriate attitudes that the prices carry with them the venture reveals nathan's blind arrogance the belief that the congolese are so backward that they have no idea how to grow their own food it is beyond nathan's capacity to reason that if the climate permitted this sort of garden africans would have planted it themselves long ago it does not occur to him to consider whether there is some reason other than their utter stupidity and backwardness which might account for the fact that there is little agriculture in kilanga finally the garden is symbolic because of its biblical resonance gardens in particular the garden of eden play a prominent role in christian tradition it is in the garden of eden that adam and eve the original man and woman ate from the tree of knowledge thereby imbuing all future generations of human being with original sin there is a clear irony in drawing a connection between nathan's undertaking and adam and eve's adam and eve sin by grasping for truth and knowledge that is not intended for them nathan by contrast sins through his willful ignorance through his refusal to learn anything about the culture around him and to enlarge and deepen his understanding of the world  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Satan Garden of Eden Abrahamic religion Creationism Creation according to Genesis Philo Angel The Fall of Man Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bible Idolatry Mary, the mother of Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Apocrypha Biblical inerrancy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Paradise Lost Vegetarianism Devil Eastern Orthodox Church Dispensationalism Biblical canon Young Earth creationism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Tree of Knowledge Kabbalah Demon Prophet Soul Book of Daniel Divine grace Baptist New Testament Jacob Noah Simone Weil Church of Christ, Scientist Blacks and Mormonism God Theodicy Sabbath King James Version of the Bible Church of Christ Rastafari movement Covenant Theology Vegetarianism and religion Christian apologetics Law of value Human Evangelicalism Homosexuality and Christianity Holy Spirit Urantia Book of Revelation Day-Age Creationism Presuppositional apologetics Philipp Melanchthon Ten Commandments Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Two Babylons Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Tree of Life Entheogen Korban Endowment (Mormonism) Reinhold Niebuhr Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Book of Mormon Ishmael (novel) Apocalyptic literature Infant baptism Criticisms of Christianity John Wycliffe Noahide Laws Curse and mark of Cain Religion Origin belief End times Resurrection of Jesus Jacob Neusner Theology 613 mitzvot Mormonism and Judaism Justification (theology)

plz help how does planes fly ok i am learning about forces in science and i need to find out what forces there are what forces course planes to fly and etc basically how dose a plane fly also can anyone plz tell me what does engines do to make a plane to fly engines provide speed required to achieve lift lift is the principal where the air moving over the wings is faster than the wind below the wings this allows the plane to lift into the air flight is only possible due to the shape of the wings the bottom of the wing is flat while the top of the wing is arched this allows the wind speed to differ over the wing surface a wing that doesn't have this profile will only allow a glide which is not considered by aviation as true flight  Gliding Fixed-wing aircraft Aircraft Radio controlled airplane Glider Helicopter Lift (force) Paragliding Wright brothers Martin-Marietta X-24 First flying machine Aviation history Stall (flight) Flight controls Supermarine Spitfire Model aircraft Horten Ho 229 Messerschmitt Bf 109 Douglas DC-8 Bird flight Hang gliding Autogyro F-104 Starfighter Hot air balloon Mooney M20 Heinkel He 112 Lockheed U-2 Scramjet Wing P-51 Mustang Douglas Skyrocket Blown flap F-16 Fighting Falcon Avro Arrow Lift-to-drag ratio Propeller General Dynamics F-111 Boeing X-43 Northrop YB-35 Timeline of aviation - 19th century Aircraft carrier Airport Kitesurfing Edwards Air Force Base Flying wing Fighter aircraft P-61 Black Widow Boeing 737 B-25 Mitchell Waverider Blohm & Voss BV 155 Santos-Dumont 14-bis Convair B-36 B-24 Liberator Boeing 747 B-52 Stratofortress Parachuting F-35 Joint Strike Fighter P-47 Thunderbolt Mitsubishi Zero Messerschmitt Me 262 Royal Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress Concorde Planing (sailing) Sukhoi Su-27 Breguet 19 Fast bowling Space Shuttle program Equine conformation Performance envelope Professional wrestling throws Saturn V Hawker-Siddeley Hawk Ilyushin Il-10 Breaststroke Dassault Mirage IV Lift-induced drag Eastern Air Lines Arado Ar 80 Paper plane A-10 Thunderbolt II F/A-18 Hornet B-47 Stratojet Clyde Pangborn American Airlines Flight 191 Drill bit Critical mach Flight Unlimited II Atmospheric reentry Flight Red Arrows Tier One General aviation Planform United States Air Force Royal Flying Corps

what is the ethical dilemma associated with plea bargaining in my opinion you are saying that doing the right thing later being honest diminishes the wrong the earlier the criminal offense if you plea bargain the defendant admits to a crime or gives the names of others involved in exchange for diminished sentencing in reality the situation could be considered two potential crimes the original crime then purgery if someone refuses to plea guilty and is found guilty so instead of lessening the sentence for those that cooperate the courts could increase it for those that don't if this is a homework assignment the answer i gave probably doesn't help you much you would want to look into the prosectution selling justice for an easier job  Plea bargain Jury trial Plame affair Adversarial system Theory of conduct Capital punishment Nolo contendere Ethics Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Inquisitorial system Insanity defense Jury Appeal Probation officer Plea Prisoner's dilemma Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Double jeopardy Ronnie Earle 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Judicial functions of the House of Lords Schapelle Corby Lynndie England W.

fahrenheit what message you think rad bradbury is trying to convey to us in creating this fictional world there are many messages in the novel the first being that of oppression of the individual by the government bradbury wrote fahrenheit during the cold war in a time when the government was extending their reach into the lives of civilians and when the fear of communism was extreme the novel gives off an anti utopian feel as it shows that the perfect world created by the government was not working censorship and bradbury's belief that it should not exist is also a main theme throughout the novel it seems that this censorship came about in two ways in bradbury's world one is that people were doing too many things that are too stimulating e g watching tv listening to loud music etc to concentrate on books it is important that during bradbury's life condensed book were quite popular the other is that someone wants to restrict the knowledge of those around them the government wants to restrict the knowledge of the population the rich want to restrict the knowledge of the poor books are dangerous because people will read them and perhaps think for themselves deriving ideas different from those in power pay close attention to the use of fire as a symbol and how it changes throughout the course of the story at first it is used negatively to destroy knowledge and books in the end however it is used to burn beatty and win freedom  Ray Bradbury Fahrenheit 451 Equilibrium (2002 film) Science fiction Propaganda Fahrenheit 9/11 Simone Weil Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Book burning Censorship Wealth The Martian Chronicles Prior restraint Degree Fahrenheit Summa Theologiae Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Democracy Media bias Science fiction film Numerology Utopia Freedom of the press Malcolm Bradbury Modernism Existentialism Advertising Anthroposophy Deconstruction H.

please help what similarities and differences do you see between functions and linear equations are all linear equations functions is there an instance in which a linear equation is not a function create an equation of a nonlinear function and provide two inputs they both have x and y coordinates but graphs of linear functions are straight and have no breaks are continuous where function graphs may be curved or have breaks the only kind of linear equations that are not functions are those of the form x c where c is a constant these are vertical lines and so are not functions non linear functions just throw in x or x and pick values for x  Linear equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Linear Polynomial Trigonometric function Derivative Dynamical system Slope Nonlinearity Maxwell's equations Linear regression Supply and demand State space (controls) Parabola Recurrence relation Perspective (graphical) Least squares Lebesgue integration Continuous function Finite element method Cellular automaton Normal distribution Projective transformation Conic section Manifold Mathematics of general relativity Nomogram Einstein's field equation Discrete Fourier transform M__bius transformation Partial differential equation Trajectory Mathematical model Fibonacci number Aliasing Sturm-Liouville theory Elliptic curve Affine transformation Circuit design Artificial neural network Ellipse Complex number Bessel function Vector field Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Tensor Schr__dinger equation Linear transformation System analysis Determinant Gauge theory Wave equation Production theory basics Calculus Polynomial interpolation Dynamic programming Operator Chaos theory Production function Cournot competition World line Mercator projection CIE 1931 color space Path integral formulation Multiple integral Hydrogeology Line (mathematics) Halting problem Newton's method Ricci flow Spline interpolation Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) RLC circuit Exogenous growth model Logistic function Optimization (mathematics) Simplex algorithm Analog-to-digital converter Basis (linear algebra) Polarization Biomechanics Analog computer Spline (mathematics) Gamma correction Linear differential equation Distribution (mathematics) Complex system Cubic equation Self-adjoint operator Operational amplifier Extrapolation Linear algebra Dimensional analysis Aberration in optical systems Exponential growth

how does machiavelli seem to view human nature using only the prince as a reference please in the prince niccolo machiavelli presents a view of governing a state that is drastically different from that of humanists of his time machiavelli believes the ruling prince should be the sole authority determining every aspect of the state and put in effect a policy which would serve his best interests these interests were gaining maintaining and expanding his political power his understanding of human nature was a complete contradiction of what humanists believed and taught machiavelli strongly promoted a secular society and felt morality was not necessary but in fact stood in the way of an effectively governed principality though in come cases machiavelli's suggestions seem harsh and immoral one must remember that these views were derived out of concern italy's unstable political condition though humanists of machiavelli's time believed that an individual had much to offer to the well being of the state machiavelli was quick to mock human nature humanists believed that an individual only 'grows to maturity both intellectually and morally through participation' in the life of the state machiavelli generally distrusted citizens stating that in time of adversity when the state is in need of it's citizens there are few to be found machiavelli further goes on to question the loyalty of the citizens and advises the prince that because men a wretched creatures who would not keep their word to you you need keep your word to them however machiavelli did not feel that a prince should mistreat the citizens this suggestion once again to serve the prince's best interests if a prince can not be both feared and loved machiavelli suggests it would be better for him to be feared bey the citizens within his own principality he makes the generalization that men are ungrateful fickle liars and deceivers they shun danger and are greedy for profit while you treat them well they are yours he characterizes men as being self centered and not willing to act in the best interest of the state and when the prince is in danger they turn against him machiavelli reinforces the prince's need to be feared by stating men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared the bond of love is one which men wretched creatures they are break when it is to their advantage to do so but fear is strengthened by a dread of punishment which is always effective in order to win honor machaivelli suggests that a prince must be readily willing to deceive the citizens one way is to show his esteem for talent actively encouraging the able and honouring those who excel in their professions so that they can go peaceably about their business by encouraging citizens to excel at their professions he would also be encouraging them to increase the prosperity of the their state these measures though carried out in deception would bring the prince honor and trust amongst the citizens especially those who were in the best positions to oppose him machiavelli postulates that a prince must also deceive those who attempt to flatter him in choosing wise men for his government and allowing those the freedom to speak the truth to him and then only concerning matters on which he asks their opinion and nothing else but he should also question them toughly and listen to what they say then he should make up his own mind since each person will only advice the prince in accord to his own interests the prince must act on his own accord machiavelli discourages action to taken otherwise since men will always do badly by the prince unless they are forced to be virtuous machiavelli actively promoted a secular form of politics he laid aside the medieval conception of the state as a necessary creation for humankinds spiritual material and social well being in such a state a ruler was justified in his exercise of political power only if it contributed to the common good of the people he served and the ethical side of a princes activity ought to be based on christian moral principles machiavelli believed a secular form of government to be a more realistic type his views were to the benefit of the prince in helping him maintain power rather than to serve to the well being of the citizens machiavelli promoted his belief by stating the fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily comes to grief among those who are not virtuous therefore if a prince wants to maintain his rule he must learn not to be so virtuous and to make use of this or not according to need machiavelli's was that god does not want to do everything himself and take away from us our free will and our share of glory which belongs us having studied and experienced italy's political situation machiavelli derived these views he felt that his suggestions would provide a frame work for a future prince of italy to bring about political stability machiavelli writes italy is waiting to see who can be the one to heal her wounds put and end to the sacking of lombardy to extortion in the kingdom and in tuscany and cleanse those sores which have been festering so long see how italy beseeches god to send someone to save her from those barbarous cruelties and outrages see how eager and willing the country is to follow a banner if someone will raise it although italy had become the center of intellectual artistic and cultural development machiavelli did not feel these qualities would help in securing italy's political future his opinion was that italy required a leader who could have complete control over italy's citizens and institutions one way of maintaining control of was to institute a secular form of government this would allow the prince to govern without being morally bound machiavelli's view of human nature was not in accord to that of humanists who felt that an individual could greatly contribute to the well being of the society machiavelli however felt that people generally tended to work for their own best interests and gave little obligation to the well being of the state although machiavelli doubted that this form of government could ever be established it did appear several years after he wrote the prince machiavelli has become to be regarded as the founder of modern day secular politics  Wealth Simon Commission Erasmus Franz Boas Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an State Atheism Republicanism Human nature Freedom of speech Royal Assent Philosophy

how do i find the center of the circle with equation x y x y i don't know how to find the center with the equation in this form you'll have to put this equation into standard form for a circle x h y k r where the center is h k and the radius r to do this you have to complete the squares for the x and y terms balancing what you add by adding it to the other side x x y y now you have perfect squares so write them as such x y therefore the center is done  Quadratic equation Conic section Quartic equation Trigonometric function Circle Projective transformation Dimensional analysis Sphere Triangle Map projection Cissoid of Diocles Maxwell's equations Explosive material Quaternion Equation of time Gaussian elimination Dirac equation Einstein's field equation Coriolis effect Joseph Louis Lagrange Orbit equation Planetary orbit Ruler-and-compass construction Pi Kepler's laws of planetary motion Antenna (radio) Great circle Equation of state Haversine formula Gravity Z-transform Elementary algebra Spherical trigonometry Linear least squares Gee Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace 3-sphere Cubic equation Real number M__bius strip Force Stress (physics) Fibonacci number Escape velocity Square root Quintic equation Hipparchus (astronomer) Curve fitting Flag of the People's Republic of China Hypergeometric series Black hole SAT Glossary of partner dance terms Huzita's axioms Lens (optics) Perturbation theory Exact solutions in general relativity Orthogonal group Circular motion Sun Navier-Stokes equations Electron Great Pyramid of Giza Longitude Stereographic projection Great-circle distance Schr__dinger equation Astrodynamics Geometry Exponentiation Parabola Centripetal force Binomial coefficient M__bius transformation Versine Complex number Pythagorean theorem Copper Archimedes Schwarzschild metric Center of mass Radius of convergence Polynomial Cricket Roman surface Dynamical system Geographic coordinate system Radius (bone) Sturm-Liouville theory Equator Proper time Potential energy Latitude Nuclear reaction Neighbourhood (mathematics) Fluid solution Covariance and contravariance Contredanse Modified Newtonian dynamics

my summer reading book is tale of two cities i have weeks to read it before school starts i am kind of freaking out not only cause i have little amount of time left but also i tried reading the frist two chapters and i dont get it at all its so annoying that i dont get the book that i dont even have a will to read it but i have to do any of you have any tips first of all relax and stop taking this book so seriously try and enjoy it and try not to fight it understand that dickens wrote at a time when people had tons of throwaway time to spend on long books people didn't have the electronic diversions then they would spend hours each day reading they didn't multitask the middle classes who had leisure time had long hours to fill up and they couldn't jump around from tv channels to i pods to computers do try and appreciate the mentality of the period that produced dickens the lesson in so doing is as important as the story itself the style of dickens is very leisurely it can be loaded with asides and diversions and philosophy if you want you can speedread right to the plot remember that dickens was popular in his day justas stephen king is today people read him because they loved him not because he was forced on them you should read and reread the first few chapters so that you can follow the later story tale of two cities is really one of dickens' easier more plot oriented works once you get past the early chapters the going will get easier if you stop fighting your assignment chapter if you read nothing else read and memorize that first sentence it is one of the most quoted or paraphrased lines in all of literature it was the best of times it was the worst of times the rest of your life you'll see allusions to this if you read literate works such as good newspapers or watch thoughtful commentary on tv the opening chapter merely sets a mood it draws a distinction between france and england keep in mind that the two cities are london and paris and this book is about the french revolution the exciting and highly dramatic and entertaining french revolution i might add chapter something odd happens here the central character to this point mr jarvis lorry has been traveling on a coach jerry has bizzarly called out from the mist to hail the character with a message he approaches the coach almost threatingly a bizzarre message indeed wait at dover for a woman the message is lorry's response is evern odder recalled to life reader you're supposed to be confused and teased you aren'et supposed to understand what is happening this is a tease and to show that others are equally confused the chapter ends with characters reflecting on the message exactly as you the reader do did you hear the message i did what did you make of it nothing at all that's a coincidence for i made the same of it myself chapter another weird chapter what a strange book this dickens he sure is a tease the messager has his message and get this sentence he was on his way to dig some one out of a grave wow talk about high drama that sentence by the way is the last in the paragraph that begins but though the bank was almost always with him so now he sees a multitude of dead faces and to quote a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spector that is ghost buried how long almost eighteen years reader you see how exciting this stuff is who needs harry potter or king dickens beat them both to the magic the high drama the mystery now get to that book and start exploring it has wonderful things but are you wonderful enough to dig them out happy reading and by the way now you've got me excited about rereading this book which i myself read outside reading in high school several decades ago we did not have to read dickens at all so the way i see it you are the fortunate one you get to read dickens  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Shaggy dog story The Lovely Bones The Catcher in the Rye Scrooge McDuck Literacy The Tale of Genji Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Goldstein's book Storytelling Harry Potter Milton H.

how do i find the equation of the parabola with focus and directrix y i know the two forms of equations for a parabola are y a x h k and x a y k h i also know that the focus for the 'y ' form is h k a and the focus for the 'x ' form is h a k the directrix for the 'y ' form is y k a and the directrix for the 'x ' form is x h a you exactly can't just plug them in to figure it out which makes it tough how do i do it please explain if you answer thanks the focus is and the directrix is y which is a horizontal line the parabola is therefore symmetrical about a vertical axis as the focus is below the directrix the parabola opens downwards and will have an equation of the form x h a y k where h k is the vertex and a is the distance from the focus to the directrix for a parabola opening downwards a is negative the y co ordinate of the vertex is half way between that of the focus and that of the directrix and is therefore the x co ordinate of the vertex is the same as that of the focus namely the vertex is therefore substituting the vertex co ordinates in gives the equation x y  Parabola Conic section Cissoid of Diocles Archimedes Projective transformation Hyperbola Trajectory Ellipse Triangle Wallpaper group Quadratic equation Semi-major axis Line at infinity Pappus of Alexandria Orbit equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Planetary orbit Tetrahedron Ordinary differential equation Complex number Symmetry combinations John Wallis Dirac equation Pascal's triangle Microeconomics Point groups in three dimensions Catenary Hexagonal lattice Escape velocity Slope Polynomial Doom engine Cartesian coordinate system Equation of time Geographic coordinate system Schwarzschild coordinates Cubic equation Polyhedron Trigonometric function Knife Huzita's axioms Kepler's laws of planetary motion Dijkstra's algorithm Resistor Suspension bridge Determinant Game theory Quaternion Coriolis effect Pendulum Manifold Astrodynamics Logistic map Telescope Collision detection Stress (physics) Square root Circuit design Map projection Longitude Desargues' theorem Lattice (group) 5 (number) Length of an arc Lens (optics) Glossary of graph theory Torque IP (complexity) Coordinates (mathematics) Regular polytope Fano plane Special relativity Modular group Feynman diagram Anthemius of Tralles M__bius transformation Similarity (mathematics) Simplex algorithm Angle Rotational symmetry Headlight Exponentiation Western concert flute Symmetry N-body problem Precession Flag of the People's Republic of China Linear equation Fixed-wing aircraft Isaac Barrow Amplitude Geodesy Perspective (graphical) Gravity Door Graph theory Dynamic programming

help please hello i really need help with closing arguments that i have to write to the jury in this assignment they're are putting george on trial for murdering lennie and i have to choose whether george is guilty or not guilty of murdering lennie i think that he is guilty because if prerhaps he would have not killed lennie and he would have been excused pm grounds of lack of mental competence and may have been given a better life than had with george so what i need help with is how to start my closing arguments and a few points to back my arguement i will truly appreciate your help i'm not being lazy ihave been working on this assignment for a long time and i desperatley need help now thank you once again different writing assignments are given to help you figure out how to set your tone and pick your arguments for different purposes here you aren't supposed to be writing a cold dispassionate argument for an academic you are trying to appeal emotionally and intellectually to an average person who has someone's fate resting in their hands so you need to ask yourself what emotions or facts would cause the average person to be reluctant to agree with you remember in this case that you've got an author who has done a lot of groundwork to make us understand and excuse the killing so you have to counteract that one way you could do that is to use even stronger emotions against the killing right to life no matter what give examples that humanize the victim and make the jury identify with his innate struggle to live no matter what the hardship another route you could choose is an appeal to avoid emotion at all murder is defined as the elements of the crime are and set forth in a precise way how each of the elements of the crime clearly happened remind that jury that emotion has no place in determining whether the crime has taken place remind the jury that if we leave justice up to whether or not we like or identify with the accused then lots more murders will take place each person thinks in his or her own mind that the world would be better if this or that person were killed but that way lies anarchy set forth examples of how the accused was a very alert aware conscious person fully aware of what he was doing there is no exception in the law for good intentions nor should there be nobody appointed the accused as judge jury and executioner for the victim or you might combine the two approaches be clinical in evaluating the crime but emotional when humanizing the victim in the jury's mind  Theory of conduct Appeal Murder Jury trial Abortion debate Jury Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law & Order Torture Bayesian inference Presumption of innocence Scots law Capital punishment O.

of mice and men hello i really need help with closing arguments that i have to write to the jury in this assignment they're are putting george on trial for murdering lennie and i have to choose whether george is guilty or not guilty of murdering lennie i think that he is guilty because if prerhaps he would have not killed lennie and he would have been excused pm grounds of lack of mental competence and may have been given a better life than had with george so what i need help with is how to start my closing arguments and a few points to back my arguement i will truly appreciate your help i'm not being lazy ihave been working on this assignment for a long time and i desperatley need help now thank you once again i would vote no he'd be onlly be guilty of mercy killing at best and voluntary manslaughter at best and here's why lennie was dangerous because of his capacity to kill and not realize what he did or why because of his mental instability george also knew lennie's life was in imminent danger from the lynch mob and i think most of these people were already prejudiced against him to begin with so it's doubtful he'd even have gotten a fair trial george's motives were out of compassion for his friend who would have died a brutal death also didn't the woman he killed use lennie for her own sexual pleasure it's been so long since i read this but wasn't part of george's motive also because of this so should your jury's she knew what lennie was and shouldn't have messed with him that's reason's i'd either give george a light sentence or if it's totally within my purview i'd let the guy walk  Murder Gwen Araujo EastEnders Insanity defense Sharon Tate Rape Mumia Abu-Jamal Charles Manson Capital punishment Memento (film) Leo Frank Vernon Schillinger Jury trial Socrates Wyatt Earp Lenny Bruce Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Serial killer Friends W.

oh no i have to think for myself up until now the homework assignments that i've had have involved looking up information and providing references this assignment i have now i'm not sure how to go about it because it requires a little independent thinking i'm throwing it out here to get some ideas of what to include in my paper ok i have to write paragraphs on what the motivation is to learn medical terminology the argument is if you are unfamiliar with a word you can just ask the doctor or look it up in a medical dictionary or go online and find the answer what is the purpose behind trying to memorize pages and pages of medical terms i'm supposed to provide the reasons why you would learn medical terminology for your job in the medical field the only thing i can think of is it would make your job harder if you had to stop and take the time to look up words in the dictionary everytime you encountered one but that doesn't take up paragraphs any other ideas ok first paragraph someone actually taking the time to learn the definition of medical terms would greatly benefit over the person that chose to take the easy way out by asking what does that mean with conversations they will encounter in the work place first it will open more doors for the person that takes the time to learn the medical terms because an employer will be more impressed with someone they aren't going to have to explain everything to next learning medical terms will be beneficial if that person ever decides to become a nurse or even a doctor that person will be one step ahead of the ordinary person that didn't bother learning the terminology finally just the comfort of not having to stop and look up every word will increase speed and production which in turn might lead to a well deserved pay raise i personally feel that learning medical terms will benefit me in the job i am seeking now and ones that might become available in the future  Theory of conduct Economics Plame affair A Course In Miracles Sexual orientation Alcoholics Anonymous CPU cache Philosophy of language Predestination Milton H.

how can you determine a source's biases why is it important to consider a source's biases you can come up with more examples but here's a start look at things like sources the author relies on the author's use of language for instance does the author use words with negative connotations about one side but words with positive associations about the other side what examples does the author give are they typical or are they naturally going to support one conclusion over the other whereas a more neutral example could have resulted in another conclusion or a mixed view of the topic what groups is the author associated with for example an author paid by a group that supports one side of the argument's likely to be biased for that side why is it important a biased author is likely to give an unfair one sided view of the subject bias means that you have to do your own search to see if the biased author has given the whole story but still just because an author is biased doesn't mean that what the author's saying isn't correct  Media bias Postmodernism Gender-neutral language Intelligent design Hate speech John Lott Supernatural Ontology (computer science) Media bias in the United States Biblical inerrancy Deconstruction Capitalism Appeal Halting problem The nature of God in Western theology Induction (philosophy) Agnosticism Reparative therapy Philosophy Propaganda Election Cognitive science Randomness Esperanto as an international language Atheism Objectivist philosophy Intellectual property Decision making Species Advocacy journalism Scholarly method Political correctness Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Free market Homophobia Originalism Everything2 Philosophy of language History Democracy Two Treatises of Government Wikipedia Trigonometric function Fine-tuned universe Falsifiability Euphemism Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Inflation Cult Economics Religion Search engine optimization Microeconomics Color Paul Feyerabend Philosophy of mathematics Goodness and value theory Psychology Ad hominem Loaded language Coercion Creation-evolution controversy Logic Teach the Controversy Gross domestic product Economic inequality Meaning of life Alignment (role-playing games) Probability Policy Debate Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Narrator G__del's incompleteness theorem Margin of error Public domain Identical particles Newspeak Philosophical Investigations Causality Logical fallacy African American Vernacular English Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mathematics Art Flat tax Killian documents Open access Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Race and intelligence XML Patriotism Langmuir probe Operational amplifier Terrorism Autism Happiness Class (computer science) Conspiracy theory Critical thinking

hi everyone need your urgent help plz read and answer my questionwithin hours got to write an essay on indian culture and the young generation just help me out with a few points that i can include i got a rough idea about what to write if you all could just help me to make it better best wishes adarsha answer within hours the indian culture is indisputably among the oldest cultures in the history of our world when the modern industrialized nation was yet to rise before the advent of christianity islam and buddhism and long before the asiatic peninsula was to be declared a third world region indian civilization was alive and flourishing thousands of years later after the wake of several invasions and generations of foreign rule india remains a culture so unique as to have assimilated other cultures into its own rather than falling itself whether seen by a historian or the average keen observer the indian culture is easily recognized as a prodigy in human civilization however my purpose is not to discuss the history of the asiatic peninsula this history is relatively well known even if not fully appreciated throughout the world my purpose in writing is not what is known about india but rather what is forgotten as proven through time indian culture has changed dramatically as the times have themselves the indian culture is once again upon this brink of change and the indian culture prepares to enter yet another millennium through which it must survive the test of time the question is however will this great civilization one that has seen days of plenty and days of scarcity survive this next millennium if so upon whose shoulders will such a burden fall an entire generation of the indian population has literally been forgotten to their parents they are rebellious lost confused and utterly hopeless to their friends they are strange backwards and hopelessly different and to their relatives back home they are no longer nor have they ever been indians who are these forgotten indians his parents came here from india so he could have greater opportunities her parents wanted to be here so that she could get a better education their parents left india for them this is the story of the second generation indian who has grown up in the united states in canada in england in australia in a country other than india and yet has grown up as an indian this is the story of the indian who was told to be proud of his culture and who was told to be respectful to her elders this is my generation of indian youth a generation which struggles daily to discover its identity before i can begin to offer my opinions upon our culture and the direction it has traveled and the direction it must travel in the future i d like to begin by sharing a few of my personal experiences as a second generation indian i ve been asked many times why i have such a commitment to my culture and why i bother to look deeper into my roots this story is my reason why for those of you who may not be very familiar with toronto canada there is an extremely large south asian population in this city having been born there and lived there for years i was accustomed to having many indian friends indian teachers attending indian ceremonies and developing a uniquely indian social attitude my parents made it a priority for me to be aware of my culture at a very young age and so i was told daily of stories found in such indian classical literature as the ramayana the mahabharata and the bhagavad gita i was told of how lucky i was to be born in such a religious and cultural family and how simply incredible and deep the indian culture was of course being of such juvenile age i never really gave much merit to their lectures essentially i took it for granted that my culture would always be understood appreciated and lauded my first glimpse of cultural dissent arose when i began to notice contradictions within my upbringing the first conflicting aspect that i would discover in my seemingly flawless ethnicity was my parents even though they would encourage me constantly to appreciate and learn my heritage at home it seemed that whenever they went out of the house they would nearly cower in shame when they revealed their culture to western society i was always told to be proud that my mother country was india and yet my parents in public seemed to be eternally afraid of the western world s view of our tradition i sometimes caught myself wondering whether it was of pride or of shame to be indian but these thoughts were momentary and i d resume those seemingly trouble free days little did i know that everything i was taught would be challenged much sooner than i could have ever expected my father decided to buy a hotel in orlando florida and so my family was to move to this new place eventually i enrolled into a small suburban elementary school outside of orlando and the same day became my first day of school in the united states this first day was to leave a scar so deep that it is yet to heal yet the sight of this wound serves as a daily reminder for me to attempt and discover my background and myself upon entering the classroom i was greeted with absurd questions such as what tribe indian are you and did you live in an igloo up in canada dismissing the questions as idiocy i merely answered them and moved on in a short hour time came for the class to go to lunch  A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Education Bhagavad Gita Black (people) One Tree Hill (TV series) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Hinduism Constitution of the Turkish

need help in math problem the perimeter of a rectangle is meters find the dimensions of the rectangle that will contain the greatest area could you guys please help me with this problem and please put your solution in or an explanation on how did you do it please i really need to answer this well you have a rectangle say the bottom and top are length x and the sides are length y now you know the perimeter is so the perimeter of our rectangle is x x y y so x y y x y x now the area is something you need to maximize and you do this by taking the derivative of the equation of area and finding where it equals which is essentially finding the absolute max the area of our rectangle is x y a where a is the area now you need to make this one variable so you can take the derivative so using y x x x a x x a now you take the derivative of a and set it equal to to find the max a' x x x x so you know x the base is plus this into your equation to find y y x y y so x y it's a square this will always be true for any rectangle of a given perimeter the maximum area will always be a square  Lebesgue integration Triangle Numerical integration Orthogonal matrix Riemann integral Fundamental theorem of calculus Calculus Complex number Area (geometry) Dirac equation Square root Polygon Sudoku Optimization (mathematics) Smalltalk Quadratic equation Particle in a box Normal distribution Archimedes Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Dimensional analysis Golden ratio Quaternion Philosophy of space and time Gravity Integral Isoperimetry Translational symmetry Planetary orbit Maxwell's equations Pi Ordinary differential equation Kepler's laws of planetary motion Mathematics Hydrogeology Apollonius of Perga Hipparchus (astronomer) Fibonacci number Exponentiation Colours, standards and guidons Many-worlds interpretation Prime number Action potential Dynamical system Transformation problem Trigonometric function Partial differential equation Henri Lebesgue Slide rule General relativity Special relativity Quadrilateral Derivative Einstein-Cartan theory Collision detection Multiple integral Random walk TI-89 series Quartic equation Flag of the People's Republic of China Mathematics of general relativity Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Timeline of mathematics Welfare economics Cissoid of Diocles Karnaugh map Trajectory Algorithm Cellular automaton Path integral formulation Infinity Newton's method Diamond cut Nondimensionalization Parallax Joseph Louis Lagrange Principle of maximum entropy Galois theory Wallpaper group Statistical mechanics Artificial neural network Irrational number Quantum harmonic oscillator Force Heat equation Sturm-Liouville theory Black-Scholes Numerical analysis Geodesy Fourth dimension Determinant Gaussian elimination Regression analysis Modular exponentiation Planck units John Wallis Lagrange multipliers

what is the end of the muscles science lah i think it depends on which of the three types of muscle you are talking about i think you probably are referring to tendons but read the following or go to the web site indicated below muscle is mainly composed of muscle cells within the cells are myofibrils myofibrils contain sarcomeres which are composed of actin and myosin individual muscle fibres are surrounded by endomysium muscle fibers are bound together by perimysium into bundles called fascicles the bundles are then grouped together to form muscle which is enclosed in a sheath of epimysium muscle spindles are distributed throughout the muscles and provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system skeletal muscle is muscle attached to skeletal tissue distinct from heart or smooth muscle it is arranged in discrete muscles an example of which is the biceps brachii it is connected by tendons to processes of the skeleton in contrast smooth muscle occurs at various scales in almost every organ from the skin in which it controls erection of body hair to the blood vessels and digestive tract in which it controls the caliber of the lumen and peristalsis cardiac muscle is the muscle tissue of the heart and is similar to skeletal muscle in both composition and action being comprised of myofibrils of sarcomeres cardiac muscle is anatomically different in that the muscle fibers are typically branched like a tree branch and connect to other cardiac muscle fibers through intercalcated discs and form the appearance of a syncytium  Biomechanics Sarcomere Muscle contraction Cardiac cycle Skeletal muscle Humerus Bone Heart Motoneuron Circulatory system Skin Eye Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Scapula Arm Motility Biochemistry Aortic dissection Tendon Cell (biology) Elbow-joint Lung Puberty Protein Radius (bone) Weight training Action potential Blood vessel Anatomy Cartilage Pain Muscle spindle Artery Atherosclerosis Myocardial infarction Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Cardiac pacemaker Stomach Skeleton Peripheral nervous system Chlorophyta Lymphatic system Coronary heart disease Insulin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human anatomy Animal Cardiac stress test Cephalic disorder Tibia Cancer Stem cell Medicine Ulna Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sexual differentiation Leaf Enzyme Actin Massage Stopping power Death Textile manufacturing terminology Head Spinal cord Traumatic brain injury Eukaryote Diabetic neuropathy Spatial disorientation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Dietary fiber Sea star Hand Multiple sclerosis Signal transduction Cardiac arrhythmia Orgasm Cardiology Atheroma Human physiology Crocodilia Cell growth Tesla coil Acanthocephala Adrenal gland Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human biology Wood Abdomen Tachycardia Respiratory system Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome

need help due day after tomorrow write essay about julius caesar i'm writing an essay about julius caesar not the play but caesar himself and i need to write a specific topic about what i wanted to find out about caesar then pose three key questions regarding the topic well i thought of a topic like the difference between julius caesar as a mortal man and as a public figure but i don't know if that topic makes sense or what can u explain to me my topic i really need helpp please i need it done by tomorrow anyway my key questions are how does julius caesar continue to have power over events even after he is dead do the conspirators succeed in their goals by killing him is caesar s influence too powerful to be contained even by his death i really like those key questions but i dunno how it relates to the topic mentiond before awww maannn can u help me pleasee umm i know i need to do this by myself coz that would be cheating if you just told me the answer right but i don't want an answer to my questions i only want to know if my key questions relate to my topic and if my topic is good i really need help i love your topics and seem to be closely related is a yes or no question anyway so i suggest that you get rid of it you can relate and if the conspirators do not succeed in their goals you could argue that that is true because caesar's power and influence continues through the laws that he had passed though the changes he had made to roman society through his writings and through the ways he had affected people you'd certainly want to mention octavius if you choose to answer only discuss what the various conspirators' goals and motivations were they were not by any means motivated by the same goals some were motivated by envy some possibly by jealousy some many by cupidity some by the desire for power some were possibly merely malicious what did each conspirator hope to gain by caesar's death hmm i wish i were writing it myself  David Hume Phaedo Theodicy Caesar Augustus Tiberius Free will Paul of Tarsus Roman Republic Theory of conduct Atomism Plame affair Philosophy Mark Antony Conspiracy Cicero Book of Revelation Philosophy of language Cato the Younger Philosophy of mathematics Tacitus Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roman Emperor Roman Empire Objectivist philosophy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Assassination Social psychology Cryptography Social rule Marcus Junius Brutus Marius Sexual orientation Nero Goldstein's book Logic Conspiracy theory Coercion Leo Strauss Goodness and value theory Roman Kingdom GED Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Library of Alexandria Summa Theologiae Justification (theology) Joseph Addison Battle of Alesia Saruman Second language acquisition Federalist No. 10 Originalism Aristotle Universal pragmatics Iago Annuity Philosophy of science Christopher Marlowe Cleopatra VII of Egypt Roman conquest of Britain Antony and Cleopatra Predestination Psychology Sub-Zero Biblical inerrancy Irony Appeal Love English grammar Nicomachean Ethics Peter Singer Novel Caesar (title) Evil Apotheosis Kain (Legacy of Kain) Software engineering Confucianism Claudius New Testament view on Jesus' life Prayer Causality Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Deconstruction The Dalek Invasion of Earth

bit of aboriginal questions what is the significance of the end of terra nullius what was involved in the provisions of the ruling the significance is that when australia was first discovered and later invaded it was declared 'terra nullius' which translates to 'land belonging to no one' so the aboriginal people were not recognised as being the original inhabitants of the land when that was over ruled it was significant as it meant that it was finally recognised that australia was 'land belonging to some one' so aboriginal people were recognised as the original inhabitants who owned the land it was also significant for mabo and other land rights claims as the land had originally belonged to aboriginal people  Terra nullius Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992) Eddie Mabo Indigenous Australians Native title Australia Paddington, New South Wales Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals) Torres Strait Timeline of Australian history Indigenous peoples Senkaku Islands History of Queensland Australian Aboriginal art Treaty of Waitangi Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taiwan Northern Territory Spratly Islands Sk__neland Murray Island Aboriginal Tent Embassy James Cook Racism Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen Constitution Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands Landmark decision Legal fiction Stolen Generation La Grange expedition British monarchy Australian English Uniting Church in Australia Central Land Council Northern Land Council Australian constitutional law Indigenous peoples of the Americas James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement Liancourt Rocks Taiwanese aborigines Republic of China Indigenous peoples in Brazil John McDouall Stuart Pitjantjatjara Sydney Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Macedonians (ethnic group) Article One of the United States Constitution Torres Strait Islands History of Victoria Mutitjulu, Northern Territory Sutherland Shire Re Secession of Quebec Colville Indian Reservation Constitution of Ireland Nullarbor Plain Treaty Greenland Cyprus dispute Noongar History of Taiwan Tasmanian Aborigines John Wycliffe Yagan Maralinga, South Australia Northwest Territories Israeli Arab Auslan British Mandate of Palestine Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics History of Austria Pelasgians Art Franklin Dam Black (people) Palestine Liberation Organization Slander and libel Super League (Australia) Prehistory of Australia No man's land Henry Reynolds (historian) Tasmania Football Macedonia (region) Kaurna Torres Strait Islanders Green Party of Canada Yukon Land Claims Whaling Same-sex marriage Israeli settlement History of the Australian Capital Territory History of Australia before 1901 First Amendment to the United States Constitution Philippines Constitution Act, 1982 South Sea Islander

how broad should an ib extended essay topic be to be within words this is a bit embarrassing but i have to admit i have no idea how long a word essay is because i've never written one i've done a word research paper and a page research paper before double spaced but have no idea how long that was since it was years ago i've narrowed my topic down very significantly i started out with ideas from various subjects and in all different directions so this is an achievement i find jared diamond's book collapse very interesting i want to investigate the issue of why strong civilizations fail is it due to fate and uncontrolled factors such as the environment or due to the decisions of the people themselves i would narrow it down to the vikings colonies in greenland and compare and contrast it to the mayan civilization however i do not know if this topic would extend words and if so would it be better to narrow it down to one civilization like the example they give explanations of the collapse of the mayan civilization i am also working on the ib extended essay i would say choose a side environment or people your question could be something like 'to what extent is the downfall of major civilizations due to environmental factors ' that way you don't have to narrow it down to just the vikings and the mayans you can research them and others with all of the possible civilizations to research words should be easy if not maybe you could do to what extent do both environmental factors and the decisions of the people affect the downfall etc if you have a mentor be sure to clear any of this with them if you choose to use it because i'm not an expert particularly about what ib is looking for  Guns, Germs, and Steel Democracy Jared Diamond Second language acquisition IB Diploma Programme Franz Boas The Skeptical Environmentalist Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Social psychology Autism GED The Bell Curve Predestination Microeconomics Graduate school Philosophy of language Bj__rn Lomborg Collapse (book) Sea level rise Appeal Divorce Philatelic investment Race and intelligence Fair use Sexual orientation Economy of Africa Economics MP3 Black hole Academic publishing Cultural relativism Wood Science Gamma ray burst Corporate governance Psychology Infantilism Intelligence quotient Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Species Yuri Knorosov Inflation Biology and sexual orientation Maya civilization Bogdanov Affair David Hume Mathematics Plagiarism Theory of conduct Book of Mormon Tobacco smoking Indigenous peoples Patriotism Cognitive science Magnetic resonance imaging Ecology Theology Benjamin Whorf Asthma Ethics Child sexuality DDT Sylvanus Morley Cyprus dispute Homeschooling Geography A New Kind of Science American liberalism Nutrition Time travel Transsexuality Theory of the firm Thomas Pynchon End of civilization Inuit Animal cognition Human Theodicy Organic food Space colonization Homophobia Logic Francis Crick Expert system Terminal ballistics Voter turnout Duesberg hypothesis Gbe languages History of Greenland Model (economics) Speciesism Civilization Land use forecasting Australian constitutional law Viking Ozone depletion Plame affair

hi i have a research assignment i need to complete for uni the topic ive been assigned is 'australia at war' this is a huge topic and am unsure what angle to take or where to begin would anybody have any suggestions thanx people perhaps you should attack it from ww and work your way through to present day with emphasis on the way the public felt about each conflict and how it impacted on lives of civilians and soldiers eg ww and there were a lot of volunteers wishing to fight for their country's freedom and the soldiers had massive public support vietnam the police action was all about conscription and the public had little support for the soldiers etc i am looking at it from the humanistic angle but you may just wish to look at it from the historical angle i am not sure what you are studying  Conscription Vietnam War United States Army Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War Conscription in the United States Tet Offensive Conscription in Australia South Vietnam U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Democracy Military history of the United States Total war Waffen-SS Iraq War History of the Australian Army War Military history of Australia Social psychology Pacifism Provisional Irish Republican Army Guerrilla warfare Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 World War II casualties First Indochina War Medal of Honor Vietnam Veterans Against the War Vietnam Multinational force in Iraq History of East Timor Combat stress reaction One Year War Military use of children Battle of Gettysburg Peacekeeping Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq Anglo-Irish War Military history of the Soviet Union Conscription Crisis of 1917 Neville Chamberlain Post-Confederation history of Canada Irish Civil War USS Walke (DD-723) World War II Israel Defense Forces Conscientious objector Vietnam veteran Foreign relations of Australia Second Chimurenga Australian Army Amnesty International U.S. 82nd Airborne Division Arab-Israeli conflict Open access German student movement Philippine-American War Six-Day War Freedom of speech Military history of Canada Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Napoleonic Wars National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam U.S. 25th Infantry Division Participants in World War II 1948 Arab-Israeli War Swedish allotment system Australian 8th Division Yom Kippur War Iran-Iraq War Sociology Winter War Sino-Soviet split Chu-Han contention Suicide bombing Special Air Service Second Boer War Conscription Crisis of 1944 War on Terrorism History of modern Croatia Athrun Zala Indochina Wars Bloody Valentine War USS Taussig (DD-746) Militant Just War theory Canadian Armed Forces Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Anglicanism Community emergency response team Malayan Emergency Schutzstaffel Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka Sniper Military of the Republic of China Military police __lvaro Uribe Battle of Long Tan ANZAC Day Korean War Hong Kong Police Force Franco-Prussian War

math hw help can you please explain how to get the answer thanks x y x y p s how is g f x simplify it s very easy we can solve this tricky question by assuming x as another variable such as p and y as another variable too such as q hence we get p x and q y so we can change the question p q p q you can solve this question easily multiplying by the first equation p q so it change to p q you can solve this with elimination to get p and q don t forget to convert p x so x p and q y to y q the real answer was x and y about g f x this is a real classic problem for me many student confused with the parenttheis you can assume f x as x for the g example if you have function f x x and you have determined the value of x then you have f x f so every character in the bracket is multiplied by then added by in other word g f x are function which are the independent variables usually just x in simple function are depending on the value of f x i really hope this can help you feel free to contact me if you have any difficulty in any subject of math physic and chemistry you can contact me by email cheers  Mathematics Ordinary differential equation Microeconomics Dynamical system Derivative Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace SAT Quartic equation Mathematical model Richard Feynman Normal distribution G__del's incompleteness theorem Path integral formulation Polynomial Quantum computer Particle in a box Numerical analysis Quantum mechanics On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Physics Determinism Visual Basic Scientific method Variable Elementary algebra Collision detection Mnemonic Model (economics) Trigonometric function Gravity Complex number Exponentiation Abstraction (computer science) Interpretation of quantum mechanics Compiler optimization Stochastic process Heat equation Linear regression Halting problem Hydrogeology Joseph Louis Lagrange The Princeton Review Economics Complexity classes P and NP Formal power series Many-worlds interpretation Nondimensionalization Large numbers Welfare economics Expert system Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Navier-Stokes equations Bayes' theorem Dimensional analysis Vedic mathematics Multiple integral State space (controls) Calculus Computer numbering formats Occam's Razor Bohm interpretation Density functional theory Prime number Password Sudoku Computational chemistry BASIC programming language UBASIC Luminiferous aether Transformation problem IP (complexity) M__bius transformation Series (mathematics) Experiment C programming language Consciousness General relativity Modified Newtonian dynamics Philosophy of space and time Force Renormalization group Action (physics) Perl Quantification Operational amplifier Projective transformation Software engineering Land use forecasting Lagrange multipliers Hamiltonian mechanics Partial differential equation Random walk Prices of production MaxEnt thermodynamics Simplified Chinese character Extreme Programming Riemann zeta function

high school math help number write as a fraction in simplest form is it number write as a decimal is it re your second question about writing as a decimal an easy way to change a fraction into a decimal is to write the fraction by hand so hand writing would be writing with a line under it and writing the under the line put a closing parenthesis next to the and extend the line under the to the right and you'll have a division figure with the outside the box put the inside the box put a decimal point after it and add two or three zeros put the decimal point on top of the box right above the decimal point inside the box it's best to do this before you start so you don't forget it you're now all set to divide by the outside the box so going into becomes the decimal this way you never have to remember whether you divide the top by the bottom or the bottom by the top of a fraction to change it to a decimal after a few times you won't have to write it down and you should be able to visualize it right away hope this helps  Computer numbering formats Decimal Numeral system On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Vulgar fraction Napier's bones Real number Irrational number Manifold Mnemonic Chinese numerals Names of numbers in English 2 (number) Recurring decimal Continued fraction 0 (number) Exponentiation Multiplication Pi Rational number Counter Decimal time Scientific notation Fractional distillation P-adic number Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Arabic numerals Division (mathematics) Vedic mathematics Grade (education) Bowl Championship Series Unix time Cantor set Complex number Hexadecimal Julian day CPU design Contract bridge Duodecimal Trigonometric function ISO 8601 Elementary arithmetic Dewey Decimal Classification Method of complements Japanese numerals Number Poker jargon Orders of magnitude (numbers) Boxing Snooker Craps 24-hour clock Arithmetic coding Dash Metric system Railway signalling Logarithm Apollo Guidance Computer Dither Large numbers M__bius transformation Surreal number Significant figures Prime number Ruffini's rule Massachusetts Institute of Technology Collision detection X86 assembly language Collation Floating point Egyptian mathematics Geographic coordinate system Unicode SAT IEEE 754r Positional notation Abacus GED Redundant array of independent disks Glossary of partner dance terms Calculating the day of the week IEEE floating-point standard Golden ratio Order of operations Hello world program Polynomial IBM 700/7000 series 2005 English cricket season Time signature Post Office box Medical prescription Base (mathematics) Bracket Mathematics 2005 World Series Fibonacci number Textile manufacturing Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti
