i want to buy a snowmobile but i dont know anybody else who owns a sled so it would be just me and a buddy on one sled which would be pretty weak should i buy a sled and just sled with one sled riding by yourself is one of the stupidest things that anybody can do the threat of getting injured or lost is magnified when riding alone avalanches are another big threat and riding without anybody else in a party would be suicide every time new snow falls the chances of getting stuck are very high and digging a sled out with only two people is not that cool i would never ride by myself  Snow Iditarod Snowmobile Avalanche Balto (film) Blizzard of 1978 2005 Iditarod Mountaineering Calvin and Hobbes Mushing Sled Sled dog Winter Paragliding Roller coaster Snowboarding Working dog Murphy's law Tubing (recreation) 1925 serum run to Nome Codename: Kids Next Door Buddy Guy Severe weather terminology (United States) Crash test dummy Buddy Clark Winter Olympic Games Dorothy Page Rocket Working animal Ice Poker jargon Social Credit Party of Canada Geoff Bodine Super Mario 64 Joe Redington Bobsleigh Duluth, Minnesota Skiing Donkey Kong's Animal Buddies Inuit Professional wrestling attacks Jennifer Lopez Robert Falcon Scott Six Flags Over Texas Iqaluit, Nunavut Northern Michigan Table saw All-terrain vehicle Toboggan Roald Amundsen Mark Calaway Bombardier Dogpatch USA Blood (computer game) Lake Tahoe Equine conformation Namco Mount Baker Citizen Kane RuneScape economy X-Men: Evolution Dogsled racing The Adventures of Pete & Pete Naturally, Sadie Kenny McCormick Alaskan Malamute Disaster Kitesurfing Rocket propelled grenade Little Snow Fairy Sugar Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII Caterpillar track Grande Prairie, Alberta Campfire Black Pete Anchorage, Alaska Car handling The Slippery Slope Dog American Pie (song) Ultimate (sport) Buddy Holly South Park Carly Colon The Amazing Race 1 Characters in the Smurfs 1080__ Avalanche Tobacco Pittsburgh Steelers Season Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Toa GunBound Marilyn Monroe Patrick Star Doug Where's Wally?
