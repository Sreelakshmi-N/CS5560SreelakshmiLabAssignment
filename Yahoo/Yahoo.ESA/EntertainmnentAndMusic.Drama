singing help i can sing in tune but the problem is i dont have a nice singing voice it sounds really babyish does anyone know how i can improve my singing voice without lessons if you have access to a piano or keyboard try hitting the notes on the piano go as low and high as you can it might help also practice singing different types of songs see which type is good for you for example try singing slow songs like some by norah jones her songs are mainly deep and are good practice in singing beyonce her songs involve a lot of breathing techniques in order to hold long notes and a lot of power in you voice or carrie underwood her songs do not go too high or low and do not require as much power as beyonce's i hope this helps i am not an expert but this is something that i would try hope this works  Beyonc__ Knowles Destiny's Child Piano Minnie Riperton Throat singing Stuttering Clarinet Crazy in Love Kelly Rowland Whose Line Is It Anyway?

can any tell me how big brother is still going i dont understand how people can watch that rubbish this is definitely one of the more sensible questions on yahoo answers who watches big brother i thought that they said the last series ever was going to be when they revamped the house with bendy walls and everything does anyone remember that by the way the best joke to play on a big brother contestant would be that when they are evicted they leave the house and there is no one there just a few maintenance people tidying up the thoughts of these contestants to think that they had been on the show thinking that everyone in the country was watching them only to discover that the viewing public weren't interrested now that would be entertaining just to see the look on their face  Big Brother (USA TV series) Big Brother UK series 6 Bad Wolf Big Brother (UK TV series) Big Brother (TV series) Big Brother (Australian TV series) Pinoy Big Brother Big Brother UK series 5 $ale of the Century Jiddu Krishnamurti Game show Channel 4 SMTV Live Datalore (TNG episode) Meaning of life EastEnders Hollywood Squares Press Your Luck Fame Academy The Weakest Link Social rule The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Wheel of Fortune Singlish The nature of God in Western theology Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Britpop Humphrey Bogart U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Winning Streak Bullseye (British game show) QI ABS-CBN House of M Hey Hey It's Saturday Avengers (comics) Seinfeld Countdown (game show) Jeopardy! in culture A Course In Miracles The 64,000 Dollar Question Survivor (TV series) Shaggy dog story Joke Montgomery Burns Nineteen Eighty-Four Card Sharks Gottfried Leibniz Sesame Street Match Game Extreme Programming The Joker's Wild Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Max Payne ABBA The Apprentice 2 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Robot Wars Reality television American Psycho Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Ludwig Wittgenstein Mastermind (television) Shooting Stars Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i have a question about a csi or law and order episode it was an episode where the star character is catching a guy who was a rapist and he is hanging on to an apparentment building window and he feels to the ground and dies and when the woman was talking to him the song played it was something like will you remember me when im dead and gone what song is it please i cant find it and its driving me nuts i can tell you right off the bat it's not from law order criminal intent or csi from season's as i have seen all of them i highly doubt it's from law order they don't deal with rapists if it's not the episode i have suggested below than it's most likely from one of the csi's the csi's play music in the episodes the l o's very very rarely play music if it does turn out to be a csi episode i suggest this website to you elyse's csi music http members aol com jrd csi music htm she has a list of music from all three csi show's so that would be your best bet if it does turn out to be a csi episode it could be dependent from svu http imdb com title tt follow that link in the episode elliot stabler the main character is running after a rapist and he catches up to him while the guy is trying to jump on a fence elliot grabs the rapist in a choke hold and the guy dies i cant remember if there was a song or not it's a possibility because i do remember music but l o's are not known for having songs in there episodes unfortunately i dont know any l o sites that list songs that have been in the episodes as there wouldnt be much of a point since there are such few songs on the l o's but if it does turn out to be that episode you would be able to find it easier so i hope that helps you  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Law & Order CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Quentin Tarantino CSI: NY The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Fictional crossover Timon and Pumbaa Theme music CSI: Miami Crossing Jordan The Shining (film) Code: Lyoko Luke and Laura Spencer Friends New York Giants The Who discography Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skateboarding trick Memento (film) Undergrads Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Brian Griffin Aerial (dance move) Christopher Meloni Baseball Law & Order franchise The Lovely Bones Andy Kaufman Characters of Lost Stewie Griffin The O.C.
