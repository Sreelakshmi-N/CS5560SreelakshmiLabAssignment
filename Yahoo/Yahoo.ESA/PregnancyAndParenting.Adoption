what is the best way to adopt i am soon to be a special ed teacher in texas and would like to look into adoption but what is cheaper is it better to become a foster parent first or open vs closed adoptions there are so many different ways to adopt but on a teacher salary that will probably be less than k a year and could be as low as k i won't have a ton of money to throw around i have also heard that it is best to be a foster parent first because you will have the baby in your home from very young i want a newborn but would be willing to take siblings if they are all young enough i hope this all makes sense to somebody out there thank you there are different options for you to look at the one with the lowest no fees or next to no fees would be to adopt a child in the foster system expense should certainly not be your only or even the most important criteria google your state's name and foster care and you'll find out the process and guidelines for adopting for fostering you could also look at adopting domestically internationally contact and agency or an attorney to look into it find out the process and the expenses you could look at adopting internationally that will cost anywhere between not including travel it's a long process can be frustrating but we did it are happy with the results  Adoption Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China Mutual fund Gross domestic product Education in the United States Foster care Publicly funded medicine Taxation in the United States Tuition International adoption Child support Charter school Mortgage Freeters Infant Graduate school Corporate governance Education in Germany Child abuse Open access Economic inequality Tariff Infantilism Insurance Homeschooling Feral child Divorce Food and Drug Administration Welding Canadian and American health care systems compared American Red Cross Poker jargon Barrister Credit card No Child Left Behind Act Wal-Mart Social rule Paradox Motion picture rating system Fathers' rights Terri Schiavo Kodocha Thimerosal Newborn screening Breastfeeding United Nations Instant-runoff voting Gas metal arc welding Personal rapid transit Tennessee State Constitution National Football League Education Software engineering Microeconomics Education in Japan John Hinckley, Jr. Growth hormone treatment Pitaten Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Solar cell Octopus card Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) Marriage North American Numbering Plan Probation officer Telephone numbering plan Public education Prolog Hydrogen economy Social Security (United States) Education in France Health care in Canada Waldorf Education Monetary policy Food Stamp Program Bruce Johnson Hospitality service Culture Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) George W.

i want to adopt my friend's baby it would be with the hope that she would be able to adopt the baby back at some point but i know there are no guarantees my problem is that my boyfriend is not happy at all about the idea i'm not asking him to adopt her we know it is a girl with me but to just support me with this decision it would be an independent open adoption the baby's mother would be able to see her when ever she wanted she could take her to family events or trips i want the baby to know who her real mother is but that she would now have two families that love her i have a year old myself by my ex husband and i want her to have a sibling and with the way things are between my bf and i he doesn't want kids of his own or not until he is in his s to s then i won't be having another baby for at least years another friend of mine says to go for it because she would want me to be able to do that for her if it was her situation but another says to not do it my bf loves my daughter that i have now as his own and he is a great father figure to her she calls him daddy and his parents love her as their own grandchild my problem with him right now is that he has the attitude that is she was able to have sex then she should be able to live with the consequences she wants to keep the baby but her living situation doesn't allow for it that is why i want to take care of the baby for her until she can and if it turns out that she can't then i am fully aware that i would be responsible for this child and i would love and raise her as my own no matter what were to happen are you planning on marrying your boyfriend since your daughter calls him daddy i would say and hope its pretty serious between you two and i guess you have a relationship like a married couple if so then this is a decision you both need to agree on you don't want this to tear you apart since your daughter calls him daddy it would hurt her alot maybe you could just help her long enough for her to get a place to live and keep the baby herself maybe a couple of months if she wants the baby then i wouldnt get my heart set on keeping her b c it sounds like she just needs some help and will want the baby back can they both just live with you till she can get on her feet  Infantilism Knots Landing Friends Jon Secada Adoption Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) One Life to Live Neighbours Fathers' rights Sex and the City Theory of conduct Everwood Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Polyamory The Fairly OddParents About a Boy Hollyoaks Charmed Family Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sunset Beach (soap opera) Boston Public Baby Blues Sharon Tate Laura Schlessinger Transactional analysis Great Teacher Onizuka History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Sheryl Crow Situation comedy Saved by the Bell Marriage Divorce Will & Grace Smallville (Season 4) Domestic violence Characters of Lost Abortion debate The Lovely Bones Melanie Wilkes Days of our Lives Paradox Avenue Q Little Britain Miss Saigon Jam (TV series) Mystique (comics) Kimi Finster Cool (song) Care Bears Breastfeeding The Critic Marilyn Monroe For Better or For Worse Social rule Guiding Light Jean Grey Alois Hitler The Golden Girls Father Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Badly Drawn Kitties T'Pol The Ashlee Simpson Show Theodicy T.A.T.u.

open adoptions my room mate just found out she is pregnant she is considering giving the baby up for adoption she can not keep the baby because she and the father are still in college and both parents refuse to help them out financially or emotionally she is very upset she knows that if she keeps the baby that she will have to drop out of school and the baby will not have the quality of life it deserves but again she doesn't know if she will be able to give the baby up for adoption either it's very hard for her to consider loving someone so much and giving it away i mentioned to her that she could have an open adoption i was wondering though has anyone ever been involved in anything like this being the one who gave the child away or the person adopting we would like to know the good and the bad also if you see your child still thanks for all your help it is a very tough time for all of us if she wants the baby but just doesn't see how she will take care of it she will probably end up regretting giving it up for adoption every time she sees the baby it will break her heart she will want it back but it will be too late it will kill her for the baby to call the other person mommy i think she should keep the baby and get assistance with child care while she is at her classes all she has to do it prove her income does not allow her to pay for childcare she could get wic food stamps free medical care etc she would only have to buy diapers and clothes  Infantilism Kodocha Pitaten Knots Landing Diaper Parenting Friends Miss Saigon Adoption Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fathers' rights Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ageplay Childcare The McGuire Sisters Hollyoaks EastEnders Charmed Theory of conduct Childbirth Neighbours Fecal incontinence One Tree Hill (TV series) Lazarus Long Alois Hitler Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Urinary incontinence Kimi Finster Good Times Abortion in the United States Transactional analysis Health insurance Infant Piccolo Junior Saga Child abuse Something Positive The Amber Spyglass Day care Hera Baby Blues Shit Jon Secada Jam (TV series) Cytomegalovirus Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Cerebral palsy About a Boy Marriage Divorce Characters in the Smurfs Strong Medicine Characters of Lost Drawn Together Kyle Broflovski In vitro fertilisation RuneScape quests Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Le Malade imaginaire Angelina Jolie Days of our Lives Eddie Guerrero Poker jargon Full House Children of God Incarnations of Immortality Boston Public Polyamory Pregnancy Division of labour Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Social rule Frankie Laine Comanche Fathers' rights movement in the UK Justification (theology) Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show The Inside Code: Lyoko The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Childfree Sin City The Critic Feminists for Life Clint Eastwood Dinah Marler Flat tax The Shining (film) Pet skunk Rugrats Emergency Medical Services Grumpy's Three Wishes

advice on parenting i am in the process of adopting my cousin she will be in sept and i am turning in march i also have an month old baby she lives in mi in a foster home she and her younger sister already adopted by the family she was placed with were put in foster care in seperate homes years ago after their father molested them she has since developed r a d reactive attachment disorder she is now indescrimiately affectionate and becomes attached to almost anyone she meets last month her fathers parental rights were finally revoked and she became available for adoption no one else in my family stepped up for her so i did and i have been approved she will be comming to stay with me and my family in fl in weeks this will be a trial placement for months then we will go back up north to get it finalized now for the question does anyone have any advice on raising a child only years younger has anyone delt with her kind of rad how about a year old and an infant good for you for having the guts to do this it's not an easy decision to make i think one thing you have to try and remember is to not get carried away and become just friends it's important to have a good relationship but she has to respect you in order to listen to you and in order for your oppionion to matter the good thing is that the gap is small and she may be able to relate to you better take advantage of that but don't let her think of you the way she thinks of her school friends about the rad i have never had any experience with it but i read a little bit about it it seems it's something she developed due to the abuse and neglect she went through do some research and talk to a specialist but i think if you just show her the love and affection she deserves without overdoing it she 'll improve gradually show her you're not going anywhere and you're there for her make her understand she has to follow the rules like everyone else at home and she's loved and wanted like everyone else too no more no less she's one of the family what she needs is security and she'll start to feel that gradually as far as the baby is concerned i wouldn't put them in the same room give her her own space but let her interact with the baby too having her lelp out with him too will make her feel needed and also will make her care for him a lot more you'll need lots of patience it won't be easy i 'm wishing you lots of luck and courage and i admire you very much for doing this  Adoption Theory of conduct Infantilism Laura Schlessinger Social rule About a Boy Abortion debate Reactive attachment disorder Attachment theory Friends Narcissism Extreme Programming Breastfeeding 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jon Secada Neighbours Kodocha Charmed Pitaten Royal Assent Socrates She Loves You Second language acquisition Family Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transsexuality Clinical depression Humphrey Bogart Postpartum depression Theodicy Melanie Wilkes Child sexuality Divorce Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Borderline personality disorder Time Out of Mind Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.

why dont woman use precautions woman r always talkin about how they gt knocked up by accident oh please their r too many birth control options today for us woman every birth control option out there except abstinence has a certain failure rating there are a certain number of birth control failures even when women use it use it properly then you add in the ones who make a mistake forget a pill or don't have a diaphragm positioned correctly the numbers go up yep there are women and men who are just plain irresponsible either don't use birth control or use it irregularly it really bugs me when those folks gripe about getting pregnant if people are going to have sex they need to be prepared for the possible consequences of their actions pregnancy disease broken heart etc again abortion is not the answer the woman can make a choice to parent the child or to make an adoption plan for it if she chooses to parent it she'd better be ready to sacrifice put that child's needs first in her life  Birth control Abortion debate Fertility awareness Abortion Sex education Condom Oral contraceptive Prenatal diagnosis Teenage pregnancy Sexual abstinence EastEnders Pregnancy Friends Pro-choice Anti-abortion movement Human sexual behavior Abortion in the United States Childbirth Adoption Partial-birth abortion Roe v.

fostering adoption concerned about the approval process even though know it is absolutely necessary like most potential fosterers adopters i just wonder what the process will involve how formal intrusive it will be etc the last time i got the pack the way it was worded just put me off as it sounded quite an ordeal is it thanks so much in advance i think the process can be a bit overwhelming for either foster care or adoption until you have gone through it but hang in there it will get easier having done 's of homestudies for mostly adoptions i can give you the requirements by most agencies for adoption but there are some differences in foster care the overall requirements can be less stringent but there are other requirements such as square footage for the bedrooms etc that are only for foster care many of these requirements are set in stone in our state as they are with every state and then the agency approving you will also have their own requirements some may have christian only or no smoking reqirments for example but the basic requirements are as follows job and job history stable employment history salary decent stable salary reflected on your tax returns pay stubs and employment letters taxes good history of completing verifiable tax returns marriages usually look at number less than three is preferable and length of current marriage usually years divorces will need copies of the decrees and names of exes as well as explanation of reason for divorce children children will be interviewed even if live with you part time or if they are grown references must have personal and professional therapist rabbi teacher references who have known you both for years ideally medical letters from doc stating no communicable or catastrophic ilnesses diseases and state that you are mentally emotionally and physically stable mental stability abuse history from childhood on up history and how you have resolved or coped with it arrests if you have one why and when with details and resolution verified by criminal and child abuse background checks in all states where you have lived income must be sufficient to more than just pay all bills and expenses and not be in debt or bankruptcy pets must be child friendly and up on all vaccinations and healthy home must have a home not just a house can be an apartment or house but needs to be organized warm and child friendly and safe cars do not have to be new but need to be safe and dependable with approved car seats friends neighbors appropriate not partiers and moochers family need to be enthusiastic about the adoption for the sake of the child counseling history of marriage counseling and resolution as well as mental health counseling and therapist's names and reports alcohol and drugs no drug use and alcohol in strict moderation and if have history of addictions must have proof of resolution lifestyle generally fit and appropriate for children such as not a clubber or partier no risky habits hobbies what you do with your spare time religion spirituality do not have to attend church unless the specific agency reqires it and some birthmothers want only a certian religion or practice or the absence of it motivation to adopt why and history of desire to adopt history with children caring for nieces nephews or friend's children or volunteer work documnted childhood everything from your birth on up such as family activites discipline parental roles discipline etc family of origin how close are you now and how often do you stay in contact etc marriage stability and strengths and weaknesses duration usually at least years sex life normal agreeable to both indication of stability exes why ex relationships ended attitudes toward birthparents caring open appreciative or want nothing to do with her indication of attitude towards child as well attitudes towards people of different socio economic status general attitudes reflect how you may see child or birth parents attitudes about continuing contact with birthmother open semi open or closed most agencies will not work with families who want a closed adoption as this is not in the best interest of the child expectations of child are the expectations realistic or not such as must be bright and look like us argh health insurance must have adequate medical insurance for the child as well as for selves good luck to you  Medicine Clinical depression Drug abuse Marriage Same-sex marriage Breastfeeding Alcoholics Anonymous Insurance Probation officer Children of God Domestic violence Traumatic

how do you go about adopting a friend of mine is pregnant and she does not want the baby my husband and i are willing to adopt the baby we just dont know how to go about the whole procedures we donot have alot of money for expensive lawyers so how can we handle this adoption cheap and legally first you need to start using positive adoption language please read www adopting org article html it is not accurate or kind to say a birthmother does not want the baby this is a baby you may parent how do you think he or she would feel knowing his her parents described them as a baby that was not wanted adoption is a very complicated and loving decision i have yet to see a mother take it lightly or callously also it is not positive at all to say you are willing to adopt this baby again if you adopt how do you think your child would feel to know you were willing to be his her parent and if the adoption itself is a difficult strain financially you might want to consider how you will raise this baby parenting is expensive if you can do it great but just keep in mind that this is just the beginning you will have to depending on what state you are in get an adoption homestudy attorneys to do the termination hearings if you need a diligent search or private eye to find the birthfather add after the termination hearings then you can adopt which will be around for the finalization hope this helps good luck  EastEnders Marriage Abortion debate Breastfeeding Divorce Friends Abortion in the United States Charmed Knots Landing Sharon Tate Prenatal diagnosis Daredevil Constitution of Ireland Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Good Times Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion C plus plus Autism Pitaten Kodocha Love Jon Secada Mystique (comics) Polyamory Transsexuality Neighbours Days of our Lives Constitution Grief Childbirth Jean Grey Microeconomics Hollyoaks History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Legal research Graduate school Everwood Characters of Lost Cognitive science OpenDocument Royal Assent Charter school Court system of Canada Single parent Miranda warning Dinah Marler Milton H.

why r woman against abortion n for givin them up for adoption a woman becomes too emotionally attached to the baby during her nine months of pregnancy as well as has had her maternal instincts kick in during the pregnancy as she has protected and cared for the baby inside her womb to ensure that it is born healthy and alive these feelings become stronger once the baby is born they don't go away and women instinctively know this is how it will be and that it would be extremely hard if not impossible to give the baby away and act as though those feelings aren't there in other words they will still long for the baby they have come to care about and long to take care of it in short women know their maternal instincts and love will kick in more and more during their pregnancy and they will not be able to give away a baby that is theirs i think this is also why women choose abortion over adoption because they know they have not yet become too emotionally attached and during their period of emotional distress find it easier to have a baby aborted than go through the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption that's the primaty reason but there other issues to deal with as well i'm not sure about financial bec i think they can have the tab picked up by the adoption clinic or home or by the people adopting the baby if there are any and that may be only if they're lucky then there are social and physical issues such as going to work as morning sickness kicks in and probably the shame and sadness they feel in giving the baby up and having their peers at work know i don't think many people stop to think how the pregnant mom to be must feel about all this emphasis is placed primarily on the unborn childand in the case of abortion shaming an already shamed woman in adoption the people involved in the actual adoption process would care about the woman as well but what about all of her peers how are they going to react toward her during and after there's a huge gap missing in solutions between abortion and adoption and those are solutions which would enable the woman to keep the child raise it healthily and most of all be able to financially afford it i've though of two the first idea would be to have homes which would allow pregnant women housing during and after the pregnancy if they need it with strick rules enforced for conditions under which they could stay conditions that would involve ensuring she obtains skills to obtain and maintain means of employment in order to take care of the child through education or other means which would be offered throught the home other conditions would be that they attend x oamount of hours per day week etc of parenting classes and counseling which would help them mature emotionally and mentally to prevent another unwanted pregnancy other conditions which would include of course no drugs no alcohol inside or outside the clinic and no staying out overnight or of course having company over as well as being open to random checks and observations inside and outside the home to document her behavior and progress if i had a lot of money i would start a home like this and i bet adoption and abortion numbers would decrease if these homes became more prevalent and hopefully the cycle of premature and unwanted pregnancies through generations of now educated and emotionally mature and more stable moms raise these children and their children are taught and have a better example to follow the nd idea came about as i watch abortion protestors stand nearby clinics with a piece of poster board on a stick and basically wasting their time which could be put to better use who couldn't spend a few hours a week holding a stick and a sign up why don't they get an extra job or work extra hours for those same hours and donate toward financially helping raise the baby if a protestor holding a sign actually persuaded a woman from going through with the abortion do those same people offer any kind of emotional and financial help for the endurance of the baby's childhood through adulthood if needed or is the woman just on her own again i wonder how many women could be talked out of abortion on the doorstep if they were approached with a commitment and promise to be there financially to help raise the child a lot more than those just met by protestors i haven't gotten as far as how to ensure the commitment and promise are followed through on but this is all just wishful thinking so far  Transsexuality Infantilism Childbirth Hillary Rodham Clinton Sex education Roe v.

how to deal with your sister giving a child up for adoption i am so happy that my sister gave her baby up for adoption the problem is is that my family is still attached to the child and still call the baby theirs meanwhile their only grandson my son is put on the back burner for this baby that isn't even theirs anymore i am frustrated and doen right pissed off because my son is put second even my grandmother will not see my son but made a huge deal about seeing the other baby i was not near the family when all of this went down i have meet the child and do not feel any conection with him because i feel that he has been given to a great wonderful family and that he is now not a part of our family my husband is also adopted and i would never consider his birth mother to be an actually part of the family don't get me wrong we are very grateful to her but thats as far as it goes how can i convey this to my family in a tactful manner it's an open adoption and it has been months and nothing has gotten better the adopting family have had to cut contact with my mom and sister who is because they want to go see him all the time they have seen him about times i am actually my grandmas favorite grandchild because in her eyes i do everything right i will let her think that lol but i think that she won' t see him because she doesn't want to lose another great grandchild actually i didn t adopt and if i did i would tell them of the great and loving sacrifice that their birth mother did for them spoochy you are really mature my husband is the one that has the harder time eith all of this and he is the one that is adopted i don 't think that i would get upset but i see how it is affecting my son and when he asks me why his grandparents always talk about this other child and not him that tends to hit a nerve as you say you weren't there when all of this went down your family members have experienced a real loss and are grieving if your son is around and they actually do something that is hurtful to him talk to them about it but in the meantime try to be supportive especially to your sister this has truly been a traumatic time for her and while you do not feel any connection to this baby your sister and other family members feel a strong one it is not that your son is less important to them it's just that they know they will be able to see him you might say something gentle like i know you are hurting and missing but i wish you could enjoy the grandchild you have right here he misses his time with you  Pitaten Kodocha EastEnders Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Family Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Adoption Cindy Sheehan W.I.T.C.H.

would my parents have the right to force me to give my baby up for adoption i am yrs old going to be in november and am pregnant i am planning on keeping my baby but could my parents make me give my baby up for adoption thanks no they have no rights at all i don't care what other people think on this but there is only two people who have rights on this child and its you and the father of the baby if you have the baby after the age of the better for you both you can get help for your baby's health and get this some insurance company's out there say that you can be insured through your parents while you are in school before you get married and at times to a age limit talk to your doctor before your parents do and see if they can get you the information on this for you there are laws that protect you from your parents forcing you to do anything now say the father don't want the baby at all he cant force you to give the child up your parents or his parents either now if you were not wanting to give the baby up don't sign any papers at all on this matter no matter what happens and in some cases your parents will kick you out depending on how your parents are you can still get help i would find this help now just in case it does happen to you other things that can happen or come up now say your parents try to make you do anythig at all and you sign papers in the usa you have a period to say i want my child i have changed my mnd you will get your child back no matter what your parents have to say about this now if your parents try to get your rights taken away the courts will side with you since your the babys mother the courts will also make you tell who the father is and if you have no clue they will ask for ever person you have been with in the time frame of your conception now i do want to say that any infromation that is given to your doctor is for you and you alone your parents can never find out this infromation unless you say its ok so i would suggest that you tell your doctor to mot give out any information about you or your babys health in any way wow there is so much you can do and it may upset your life at home but if you want this baby like you say you do there is so much you have for you now since your almost talk to hud about getting housing for you and baby talk to your state assistance office for money for you and baby get on wic so you have food that can help your health go to a doctor so you can make sure you and your baby is healthy you can also do all this without your parents knowing what you are doing get a po box number in your name so you can have a privete mail box for everything your parents dont need to know about lets see tlak to the father about what you want and see what he wants to do with all this if he helps you out that is better for both of you if not the state will make him help you out you have more rights then you can ever guess you have just make phone calls and make sure you and baby are covered for anything that goes bad in your home with mom and dad i do want to say that you can still go to college if you plan on that its not unheard of at all so if you want a future you still have one no matter what crap anyone feeds you good luck in what you do and if you give up your child that is your right no one can stop you not even the father of the baby  Abortion debate Health insurance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Friends Fathers' rights Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Insurance Fathers' rights movement in the UK Child support Stomach cancer Divorce British nationality law Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Roe v.

should we adopt from our own country or other countries my friends and i are both interested in adoption someday far away some of my friends say they think its wrong to adopt internationally when we have kids here who don't have homes i on the other hand want to adopt internationally because while i feel bad for the children here our government makes sure the american orphans have medical care and food and schooling while kids in countries like ethiopia and liberia are barely hanging on because they're dying from starvation or deadly diseases so i feel while it's hard for american children to grow up in the orphanages at least they have a chance at life whereas children in other countries don't always have that anyone agree disagree sure i agree but medical care and food is not the same as a home some foster kids are living at the social services offices because of lack of adequate homes so i would have to investigate in adopting within the country first  Adoption Abortion debate Economy of Africa Orphan Theory of conduct Famine Anorexia nervosa Second Sudanese Civil War Kodocha Child abuse Laura Schlessinger Health insurance Overpopulation World Vision National Institutes of Health Transsexuality Polyamory AIDS in Africa Jon Secada Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Breastfeeding Ethiopia Economy of the United States Pat Buchanan Social work Liberia Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Infantilism International Criminal Court Hypoglycemia Politics of the United States Darfur conflict Palliative care Trade war over genetically modified food Finnish Civil War Publicly funded medicine Sigmund Freud Ethics Divorce Pitaten Breath of Fire III Humphrey Bogart Pet skunk Feral child Status of religious freedom in Sudan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus American Medical Association International adoption Hamster Fox hunting Same-sex marriage Stolen Generation Diarrhea Jazz Constitution of Ireland 2005 Kashmir earthquake Liberalism Animal testing Boston Public Androgen insensitivity syndrome Amish Charles Darwin's views on religion American Red Cross Stomach cancer Homosexuality and medical science Social security United Nations Children's Fund Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kyle Broflovski Serial killer Social rule Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Chronic fatigue syndrome Scramble for Africa Marshall Plan Prostate cancer Criticism of libertarianism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Korean adoptee Sino-Soviet split Third Culture Kid Neville Chamberlain Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Fecal incontinence Sudan Foster care Republic Knots Landing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Erectile dysfunction One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Church of Christ Hillary Rodham Clinton Folic acid Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Health care in the United States Naturopathic medicine

how hard is it to adopt a child for a single woman what do you go through etc im really interested in adopting a baby or child but i heard its a very difficult process what do you have to go through how much does it cost and can it be done if you're single also how do i guarantee that the biological parents wont come back a few years down the road and try to take my kid away i'm almost tempted to go over seas to adopt so that cant happen but i know theres thousands of children in the usa waiting to be adopted aw well thanks mamizorro it depends on the child you are looking to adopt and how you are looking to do that you have basic options private adoption in the us if you are looking for an infant in the us this is generally the way to go you would have to contact a private adoption agency this can be very expensive and also especially difficult for single women since many private adoption agencies in the us don't allow single parents to adopt adoption for the us foster care system if you are willing to adopt a child who is not an infant this could be the place to go children in the us foster care system who are available for adoption have been removed from the biological parents home usually due to abuse or neglect and the parents rights have been terminated meaning they won't be showing up to get their kid back most children available for adoption through the foster care system are between and with a great number of children being or over although sometimes infants and very young children do become availalbe the cost if any is negligble and some children qualify for subsidies to assist with the legal cost associated with adoption or with on going medical or theraputic needs in many states children adopted through the foster care system may also recieve medicaid until they turn and free college tutition at a state university single women are not only allowed to adopt but for some available children a single parent home is the preference if you contact your local children's services office they usually have free adoption classes where you can learn more about becoming an adoptive parent you can also go to www adoptuskids org to learn more about the process international adoption this varies widely in some countries single women can adopt and others they cannot the cost associated with the adoption also varies widely and some countries can be very expensive the most important thing you can do if you go this route is find an international adoption agency that is sanctioned by both the us department of state and the country in which you are adopting the us department of states website generally carries basic information about international adoption and is a good starting point  Adoption Infantilism Divorce Abortion debate Child support Education in the United States Student loan Breastfeeding Child abuse Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social work Education in Germany Marriage Foster care International adoption Education in Japan Abortion Constitution of Ireland Constitution Health care in the United States Childbirth Fathers' rights Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Dog agility Gross domestic product United States Postal Service Free trade Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Child Hearing impairment Education in the People's Republic of China Separation of church and state Economy of the United States Flat tax Education in Australia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Open access Food and Drug Administration Conscription No Child Left Behind Act Abortion in the United States Convention on the Rights of the Child Same-sex marriage Canadian and American health care systems compared Laura Schlessinger Domain Name System Child pornography Charter school Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Culture of the United States Centrelink Parenting Capitalism Economy of Africa Politics of the United States Education Family Lawyer Public transport Social rule Public education Credit card Volleyball Legal research Graduate school Medicare (Canada) Life insurance International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Medicine Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Day care Controlled Substances Act North American Numbering Plan Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Gold standard Education in England Taxation in the United States Privatization Feral child Ombudsman Freeters Economy of Haiti Tuition Trademark United Nations Transsexuality East Germany Children of God Second language acquisition Globalization

how to solve adoption mystery i was told that my father had another child with a woman they named the child chastity then she was adopted at one year of age it could have been az or ca this could have been ' or later that's all the info i have besides my bio fathers name i'm just curious if i actually have a sister or not not sure how to look for answers cathy rose unfortunately both g parents are deceased and i am estranged from that side of the family due to his abandonment of me my paternal grandmother told my maternal grandmother so i don't even know if it's factual both g mothers are deceased now did either of the grandparents leave a family bible with any information in it the girl might have had the last name of your dad and you have his name do you know where or if you biological dad is still alive if he's deceased you can get some info on him from the social security office if you know where you were born then you can start there or where your birth father lived at the time the girl was born you can begin search there and you can obtain records from archives of newspapers on births deaths and for school enrollment records they would be at the county clerk's office at a courthouse in a county where an individual attended school if someone is deceased and you learn what area they died there are funeral records you can always submit a letter to the editor of any news papers in any area you are searching and you will most likely make contact with blood relatives you might give any and all information about the names of any grandparents you have and i'm sure someone will recognize the name and be in touch with you you have to get your information out there just in case there is someone looking for you you can see a librarian to learn about the places where you can register your own information so others might can locate you you know what the last name is of your birth father check the internet for person's in various towns and cities and then find the newspaper for that location and submit a letter to the editor there do give a permanent contact address and phone number too  Family Genealogy Father Knots Landing Fathers' rights movement in the UK British nationality law Obituary One Tree Hill (TV series) Child support Friends EastEnders Incest History of British nationality law Fathers' rights Blood purity (Harry Potter) Pitaten Identity theft Luke Skywalker Wolfrider Grief Charmed Jacen Solo Calvin and Hobbes Alois Hitler President of the United States Divorce Hereditary peer Babe Carey Dinah Marler William Rehnquist Iberian naming customs Mary Wollstonecraft Kodocha Marriage W.

single adoption i am a single female and am thinking about adoption in the future i would like to keep it in the united states since not many countries allow single family adoption how difficult would it be for me to get a newborn or even a toddler pyarhai mse the reason i want to adopt is because there are so many children out there that do not have the chance to live with their birthparents and need to have a family that loves them i have been looking up adoption for a while and i have been drawn to it in so many ways i believe that god is trying to tell me that adoption is the right path for me that does not mean i can't have biological kids one day you can legally adopt at if you go through your local county they will do the homestudy for free they will look around your house and make sure it is safe go over financial stuff to make sure you can afford to care for a child ask for references from atleast people who know you really well the more refrences the better have you write up a paper explaining who you are and why you feel adoption is right for you you may have to take some parenting classes as well as sitting in on some adoption support groups to get an idea of what you will be getting involved in it can be difficult but being single will not really hurt you there are a lot of single adoptive parents in the us because there are so many children needing loving homes good luck  Fathers' rights Abortion debate Child Predestination Marriage Infantilism Same-sex marriage About a Boy Children of God Transactional analysis Father Education in the United States Breastfeeding Hikikomori Incest Theory of conduct Transsexuality Sigmund Freud Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Laura Schlessinger Divorce Korean adoptee Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Theodicy Extreme Programming Hey Jude Foster care Church of Christ, Scientist Tears for Fears Melanie Wilkes Parasite singles Dinah Marler Charter school My Parents are Aliens Our Gang Kimberly-Clark Corporation Scouting Rich Mullins Single parent Fathers' rights movement in the UK John Wesley Software patent debate Justification (theology) Civil union Pitaten Magical thinking Pledge of Allegiance Moral Politics Good Times Abortion in the United States Child abuse Day care The Critic Evil Scientific method Gender role Amish Constitution The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Constitution of Ireland Kodocha British nationality law Central processing unit Separation of church and state Fancy Crane Autism rights movement Family name Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Time Out of Mind Bernard Williams Infant baptism Summa Theologiae Social work Church of Christ Intelligent design Instant-runoff voting Androgen insensitivity syndrome God and gender Free will Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Productive and unproductive labour Socrates CPU cache United States dollar Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland Mid-levels Pedophilia Care Bears Social rule Teach the Controversy Bat Lash Government of Maryland Bah__'__ Faith and Science Separation of church and state in the United States Order of succession Primogeniture Mercantilism

why does it cost so much to adopt a child that needs a good home i think that every child deserves a home and as long as you can care for them and are able to provide what the child needs there should be no cost what does legally free to adopt mean it does not cost a lot of money to adopt from foster care in many states it is less than and may even be free plus there are adoption tax credits that can help cover the expenses involved in preparing your home for the adoption these are between and and are federal so they are available all over the us legally free to adopt means that the child's parents have had their parental rights taken away from them and now someone else can become the child's parent  Adoption Child support Foster care Education in the United States Divorce Insurance School choice Day care Health insurance Hillary Rodham Clinton Mortgage Public policy Public education Social welfare Publicly funded medicine FairTax Microeconomics Tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Fathers' rights Gold standard Student loan Capitalism Constitution of Ireland Credit card History of British nationality law Heather Wilson Civil union Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Money Minimum wage Abortion in the United States Marriage Gay adoption Abortion debate No Child Left Behind Act Democratic Party (United States) Father Same-sex marriage Convention on the Rights of the Child Health care in the United States United States Constitution Medicare (Canada) British nationality law Separation of church and state Culture of the United States Parenting Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Health care in Canada Canadian and American health care systems compared Homeschooling Incest Legal tender Tariff Education in Germany Social work Transsexuality Public good Article One of the United States Constitution Corporate personhood Offshoring Stolen Generation Education in England Kyoto Protocol United Kingdom corporation tax Theory of conduct Property (ownership right) Moral Politics Corporation Southern Poverty Law Center Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Gerrymandering East Germany Dave Reichert Bond Inflation Legal research Australian constitutional law Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nurse Free trade Food Stamp Program Desegregation Software patent debate United States Postal Service Conscription Deflation (economics) Charter school Illegitimacy Education reform Polyamory Infantilism International law Centrelink Small business

your opinion on attachment towards an adopted vs biological child hi i am wondering for pure curiosity if you think there is a difference between how parents feel towards their adopted versus biological children it seems the obvious answer would be that there is a difference just by human nature but i'm not sure i agree i worked with infants and felt such strong bonds with some of them and it taught me how easy it was to love a child regardless of whether or not it's your own also i am studying to be a social worker and will be working with prospective foster families so this is just for personal insight if you are an adoptive parent or a child either adopted or with adopted siblings i would love to hear what you have to offer on this topic thanks good question darlin' i'm a biological adoptive and foster parent i have five kids in my house right now two bio two adopted one foster they range in age from to we've had our bio kids all their lives they're two of the four teens we have obviously our foster daughter also a teen has only been in our family just shy of two weeks our adopted daughters one a teen the other have been in our family for years we're completely attached to the adopted ones just like we are our biological kids we're attaching quickly to our foster daughter also she was sitting on my lap this afternoon this evening we had a great time just snuggling i would lay down my life for any of the five without regard for whether or not they share our genetics i would walk to the ends of the earth for any of them how this plays out in my daily life is that we love care for and nurture them all we advocate for them all one has special education needs another special emotional needs another was missing some credits for graduation we needed to figure out how to help her graduate with her grade level peers this all took major advocating for them we consulted with experts we went to meeting after meeting after meeting we drove many miles getting them help and sacrificed a lot for it we got them the help and the results that they needed it was very much worth it we enjoy spending time with them and being the parents they need all of them not one over the other  Abortion debate Adoption Intelligence quotient Nature versus nurture Graduate school Sexual orientation Child sexuality Infantilism Biology Motivation Autism Education in the People's Republic of China Breastfeeding Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) Asperger syndrome Education in the United States Child abuse Homeschooling Simone Weil Dawson's Creek Human About a Boy Grief The Giver Biology and sexual orientation Species Affirmative action Fathers' rights Parenting Saved by the Bell Foster care Hikikomori Family Social rule Spanking Education in Germany Love Theory of conduct Culture Child Altruism Polyamory Sex education Teach the Controversy Laura Schlessinger Good Times Androgen insensitivity syndrome Charter school Sexual differentiation Objectivist philosophy Sigmund Freud Happiness Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Creation-evolution controversy Autism rights movement A Course In Miracles Social work Moral Politics Intelligent design movement Human sexual behavior Race and intelligence Charles Darwin Lazarus Long Gifted Transsexuality Catechism Attachment parenting Same-sex marriage Second language acquisition Controversies in autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Biodiversity Characters of Smallville Josemar__a Escriv__ Appeal Hollyoaks Prostate cancer Developmental psychology Intelligent design Center for Science and Culture EastEnders Scientific method Social justice Deprogramming Education Mystique (comics) Extinction Justification (theology) High school T'Pol Opus Dei

i am thinking of foster care my kids have grown and i still need to mother go for it we have biological sons internationally adopted daughters we became foster parents a couple of years ago i'm so glad we did right now we have a year old girl with us who is a delight she'll likely be with us through the end of the school year in may we've had kids from years to years with us so far we've not had a single bad experience you can do long term foster care what most folks think of when they think of foster care you can also do emergency respite care in that case a child might stay one night with you or a week or two for respite it's when foster families need a break could be for a night or weekend or when they go on vacation can't take the foster child with them this could be for a couple weeks but probably less than that emergency care is when social services calls you for example says we have a year old girl who was removed from the home we're trying to locate other family members or a longer term placement but could she stay with you for a couple nights while we find those folks emergency respite is good for people who either typically have busy lives or their schedule isn't the most predictable you're making a short term commitment which is ideal for some folks we generally do emergency respite but we were giving emergency care to the y o who is with us right now we fell in love with each other so we told the social worker we'd like her to stay with us longer unless that wasn't what was best for her so our emergency care went into longer term foster care definitely go for it if your schedule is pretty predictable not a lot of out of state town trips or whatever consider doing long term if you can't do long term for some reason definitely consider going for emergency or respite here's a list of the foster care state agencies broken down by state so you can find out who to contact once you call them they can help you get started on your journey http library adoption com resources and information foster care specialists by state article html generally there will be classes you will attend amazing information is given in these classes they're very valuable you'll be fingerprinted have back ground and child abuse and neglect checks done there'll be paperwork to fill out a home visit by a social worker don't be stressed about this they're just making sure that your home family will be a safe and healthy place for a child they're not checking to see if you live up to martha stewart's standards oh i should add that the social worker will give you information on a child's background behavioral issues etc and you can ask questions about their behavior and stuff too you can say no to any placement if you're not comfortable bringing that child into your home for some reason it's an awesome feeling to bring kids into your home who need nurturing love guidance and stability  Laura Schlessinger Infantilism Foster care About a Boy Transsexuality Strategic management Divorce One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Narcissism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kodocha Clinical depression Education in the People's Republic of China Social work The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Health insurance Theory of conduct Domestic violence Fathers' rights Poker jargon World Wide Web Marilyn Monroe Dissociative identity disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Pitaten Good Times Feral child The Ashlee Simpson Show Hikikomori Family Extreme Programming The Critic Science Stolen Generation Prostate cancer Abortion debate Borderline personality disorder Humphrey Bogart Gender role Economics Publicly funded medicine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Friends Children of God Terri Schiavo Education Charmed Vivian Solon Social rule John the Baptist Child sexuality Cross site scripting Ethics Education in the United States Polyamory Breastfeeding Homemaker Culture The Amber Spyglass Wolfrider CPU cache Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Cliff Richard Insurance Marriage Cruising (maritime) Controlled Substances Act Soap opera Tourism American Red Cross Melanie Wilkes Destiny's Child The Shining (film) Sexual orientation Palliative care Transactional analysis Same-sex marriage Education in Germany Homeschooling Samantha Smith Community emergency response team Plame affair Constitution of Ireland Nature versus nurture Childlove movement Dog agility Jon Secada Mojave people

anyone have any confusion with the forms to get the adoption process started dh and i were giving a whole folder of information and forms to fill out to get everything rolling but i am confused about the questionair about wanting to be adoptive parents of races different from your own i can't make any since of it it is basicly the same question worded many different ways and it is bit confusing my dh and i really want a human baby no matter what color his her skin or race is has anyone else run into this problem we also are having some confusion about the space where you need to have refrences of thoes who have wittnessed us with children for our ability to parent and it can only be non family members and friends well we have not have any contact with children of any age at our home and we have only been around family when were around a small child and that has been on holidays and speratic family social get togethers what can we do about this dh and i are going through an adoption agency in our area and these questions just came up after we came home from a information meeting with them and started looking through the paper work giving to us by the way being illiterate means you can't read just because i have some typos does not mean i can't spell it is just my typing skills need a little work thats all so don't be so rude ass whole have you been with any friends and their children if so see if those people would give you a reference how about kids at church about the skin color just let them know that you have absolutely no preference about the skin color of the child dh i are as white as you can be we have two bio sons who are also white foster daughter who is white and two adopted daughters who have a beautiful olive complexion it made no difference to us what color their skin was sometimes the girls bring it up but we just try to instill a sense of pride in how they look and where they are originally from people notice that the girls are different we get questions while we're out about we asked the girls they're school age how they wanted us to handle it we could answer they could answer or we could sidestep the question with why do you ask they usually choose to let us answer are proud of being adopted let the agency know that you understand that society may have issues or questions about a difference in skin color and the child may have issues or questions but you'll do all in your power to protect the child from any discrimination and you'll work hard to instill a sense of pride and self worth in the child about who he she is i think the questions are designed to get you thinking about how you might handle it whether or not you can handle it and how healthy your attitude is about it we also get the girls around folks who look like them as often as possible we know several people who are from their birth country some others from the same region plus we belong to a multi cultural adoptive family group  Adoption Theory of conduct Infantilism Education Transsexuality Literacy White (people) CPU cache Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices Japanese name Consensus decision-making Art Black (people) Same-sex marriage The Tale of Genji Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Religion Family Economic inequality Infant baptism Psychology The nature of God in Western theology Affirmative action Human skin color Extreme Programming Wolfrider Property (ownership right) House of M Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Evil Kender Human Singapore gay equality movement Cultural relativism Asperger syndrome Ethics Race Franz Boas EastEnders Bernard Williams Science Social rule Korean adoptee Skinhead Expert system Physical attractiveness Quizbowl Breastfeeding Atheism Justification (theology) Objectivist philosophy Epistemology Community Negima Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Transactional analysis Leadership Bosniaks Second language acquisition Windows 2000 African American Dyslexia Karen Horney Puberty Childlove movement John Wycliffe Blacks and Mormonism Theodicy Family name Religious Society of Friends Rudolf Hermann Lotze Racism Gender role Socrates Sant Thakar Singh Jean Grey Kodocha Who is a Jew?

do i call you mommy quick update i will be getting my cousin a little sooner instead of the th she will be here monday this is because school starts the next monday and we don't want her to start already behind anyway when i talked to her last night and told her the good news she was super excited and started asking all kinds of questions like will i have my own room and what time do i have to go to bed which are all simple enough but there was one that got me she asked do i call you mommy and i was not sure what to say i told her she can if she wants but she does not have to question for those of you who have adopted older kids do they call you mommy how about those of you raising family members do they call you the actual relation you are or mommy if she does decide to call me mommy will i need to explain to her teachers and such why my daughter is only years younger than me how do i do this with out constantly refering to her as adopted she does know i am her cousin through her father and my mother being brother and sister she also knows her bio mom and dad she was when she went in foster care her bio mom left when she was but she has a picture and small memories she is and i am i think that she can call you mommy if that is what is comfortable for her but another suggestion is to call you by your given name or find another special name for you like a pet name or nickname a lot of it depends on the information and access you plan to give her about and to her biological parents as she gets older and as far as explaining the relationship to teachers etc it's not their concern i am sure you will have to give some kind of documentation to the school proving guardianship but that will be in her file and should be sufficient if someone says something to you about it politely tell them thank you for their concern or interest but what does this have to do with her education or flat out tell them i am her provider her guardian or her mom if thats what she decices to call you that should be enough said and if they say something about the age gap tell them you just look remarkable for your age best of luck to you and she and congratulations  About a Boy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy EastEnders Family Terri Schiavo Adoption Plame affair Kodocha Garfield Neighbours The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Fairly OddParents W.I.T.C.H.

i only want to put of my quadruplets up for adoption what are the odds of the good one finding any others i don't plan on telling the one i'm keeping gosh i feel sorry that you got so much hate mail i've heard that a multiple birth like that can be difficult and perhaps sometimes some of children may be handicapped are all the children healthy or perhaps you feel overwhelmed i can't say that i blame you i think they would want to find each other one day and it may haunt you later you may have regrets if you do put up for adoption i would try and keep them together it's more fun for them they will like playing together that keeps them occupied and entertained i think the odds of the one finding the others are pretty good because they have all kinds of ways to do that now a days do you consider this to be good or bad if they found eachother do you want to avoid an emotionally awkward situation and not have the one child find the other or do you want the one child to be eventually be re united with his her siblings  Sydney Riot of 1879 Social rule Kodocha Pitaten Good Times Theory of conduct Multiple birth Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Craps Friends Knots Landing About a Boy Karen Horney Alcoholics Anonymous Procrastination Defence mechanism The Fairly OddParents Poker jargon Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Twin Video game controversy Toad Patrol Infantilism Stuttering Adoption Breastfeeding Kender Peter Pan Scarlet Witch Nancy Witcher Astor Recurring South Park characters Extraordinary Machine Transactional analysis Rocko's Modern Life Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fathers' rights Ulic Qel-Droma Simone Weil Michael Jackson Norway national football team Something Awful Kurt Cobain Series finale Singlish The Secret of NIMH Incarnations of Immortality Darth Vader Grief Gerund Humphrey Bogart Novel Real Love (song) Consensus decision-making Maison Ikkoku Asperger syndrome Breath of Fire III Milton H.

prospective fosterer adopter i plan someday to foster adopt i was looking over the child profiles on my state's website and i noticed that all of the children had some sort of psychological problem intermittent explosive disorder reactive attachment disorder add etc i understand that any child especially one who has spent any considerable amount of time in the system would have at least some trust issues i am wondering however if it is at all possible to find a normal child i have already dealt with too many medical issues with myself and family to rehash that again what is normal now a days i adopted crack addicted children the doctors didn't even give a chance to live they were months and yrs old they are now and have been straight a students all thru school we gave them a lot of love and support no meds we were very against the meds even though the docs and social workers wanted us to when they threw fits we held them close to us and used warm showers with all our clothes on and held them with us the water just trinkled but it calmed them in a way i never saw before one day my son was real upset i said what can i do to help you honey he was three he said i just need a warm shower so then i knew all the comfort and love worked we have a pool now they grew up to really enjoy the water and take long baths and showers to this day to relax don't be afraid to take a child with some problems if you have the love to give it was a hard yrs in the begining a real challage but we didn't give up and when you look at it in a different way i didn't go thru labor or pregnancy with them so i guess that was gods way of making me work for my wonderful children we sit down and talk a lot sit and do homework with them it really is all about the time you put into your children birth or adopted you have a good heart i pray things work out for you i spent many a nights rocking the children to sleep and watching them sleep they have a clean bill of health doctors now are doing studies and writing a book about the methods we used they said we are the most successfull story of crack addicted children they have ever experienced  Childbirth Urinary incontinence Autism Sauna Theory of conduct Medicine EastEnders Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shaggy dog story Adoption Insomnia Procrastination Social rule Pitaten Chronic fatigue syndrome Charles Darwin's illness Diving Combat stress reaction Sento Clinical depression Unemployment Drug addiction Prostate cancer Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Milton H.

contact him do i have to go to court so he can adopt them or can i just go through a lawyer or even possibly file papers myself and where to get them thanx for your answers you have to make an attempt to contact the biological father in order to do a stepparent adoption the easiest and fastest way to get a stepparent adoption done is with the non custodial parent's consent to the adoption since he has not contacted the children in over a year you can file for a stepparent adoption under abandonment charges since you do not know where the father is you are going to have to publish a public notice in the paper the notices usually run for about thirty days giving the non custodial parent time to see and to respond to the notice the non custodial parent in your case the father would not contact you directly if he were to see the notice he would respond to the courts if he sees the notice if he does not respond to the notice in the alloted time then the adoption will move forward as though he is consenting to the adoption while most states do not require that you have a lawyer for a stepparent adoption it really is best to hire one some lawyers charge a flat rate for a stepparent adoption but this is usually when the non custodial parent is aware of the adoption and consents to it as it is then only a matter of filing the papers and getting them signed by the judge having to serve a public notice adds both time and money to the adoption procedure for the actual adoption itself it differs from not only state to state but county to county in each state as to how that is handled some counties require an adoption hearing while others simply have the judge sign the papers and then mail them out to the family you will also need to check your local laws as to if you will need a guardian ad litem gal or not this is an attorney who is appointed to the child in some cases even when a state requires a gal the courts may waive it for a stepparent adoption it never hurts to ask look online at the website for your local government many courts now have forms available online to fill in and print out even if you use a lawyer you can still fill out the paperwork yourself lawyers usually give you their initial consultation for free so make sure that you speak to more than one before deciding on hiring a lawyer even quick adoptions are several months long and it is important to have a lawyer who matches your personality style before signing on to deal with him or her for the next few months you will need copies of each child's birth certificate as well as for you and your husband if you were married to the biological father you will need a copy of that marriage license along with the divorce and custody decree you will also need a copy of the marriage license for you and your current husband all of these documents can take several days to weeks to obtain depending on the state who holds the records so you will want to start on that as soon as you can while a homestudy is usually required for adoptions this is typically waived for stepparent adoptions since the children have already been living as a family with the stepparent stepparent adoptions usually start at about although i have seen lawyers who will charge a flat rate of for stepparent adoptions when the non custodial parent consents adoptions which require a public notice are usually around now this changes depedning on the area that you live in the price of the notice as well as what your lawyers hourly rate is but it is a good ballpark figure while you can get off cheaper removing the legal fees and doing the adoption yourself having the peace of mind of knowing that everything is done and done right is really worth paying a lawyer for it would be a shame to have an adoption denied or overturned due to an error in the paperwork good luck on your stepparent adoption journey you can check out the link below for more information on stepparent adoptions

if you are actually married then had kids tell me and others why this is important and the right way to do it i was married and then had my daughter but that does not seem to be very important to others i feel it is very important and the right way so if your like me speak up for your beliefs yes i'm with you on that one the reason that it's important is because guys like to like to get with girls so they can get in their pants then they dump the girl when they really love the girl they will marry her if they don't love the girl enough to marry her the girl shouldn't be letting him in her pants if the girl gets pregnant then the problems multiply times all of a sudden the guy's party is over and he hightails it outa dodge meaning he dumps the girl splits she is left to take care of the baby herself one of the most difficult jobs in the world is to be a single mom the child will be the one to suffer the most because of lack of having a dad and a lack of having enough money to be comfortable plus it teaches the child immorality oh yes and let's not forget that it's immoral sex outside the bonds of marriage is forbidden by god for good reasons some of them are listed above  Pedophilia Friends Married... with Children Kyle Broflovski Hollyoaks Humphrey Bogart Sex and the City Days of our Lives Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Laura Schlessinger Recurring South Park characters Religion and sexuality EastEnders Evil Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Polyamory Neighbours Mr. and Mrs. Turner Theodicy Avenue Q Divorce Sexual orientation Charmed The Fairly OddParents Jennifer Lopez Knots Landing Androgen insensitivity syndrome Women in Islam The Critic Muhammad Same-sex marriage American Dad!

looking for parents who have put they're child up for adoption and people who were put up for adoption okay so the deal is i think i may be pregnant i find out tomorrow i want to keep it but my boyfriend of over a year and a half does not want a child im young years young i honestly think i can do it but my boyfriend almost says its going to ruin his life i love him and dont want to do that to him and i dont want to lose him but im not sure how i can cope with all of this parents how did you cope with putting your child up for adoption how did you feel seeing your child then well not letting it go but yeah and any aditional details people who were adopted put up for adoption how do you currently feel about your birth parent s how did you used to feel about them do you wish that you knew your birth parents are you angry any aditional details so basically im looking for advice and answers please help i dont want to make the wrong decision and regret it later if i decide to keep it we talked before and got in a huge fight over it how can i get him to understand where im comming from and support me oh and idk if i said it before but i know the decision is entirely left up to me but im in love with my boyfriend and i dont want him to feel left out of the dissicion making unless there is a way i can alter his dissicion into the same as mine then i will have no problem with his input p but it still bothers me to think that i would leave him out of this completely i mean this is our lives not just mine nothing wrong with including him in the decision making process but you are more affected than he is simply because you're the one who will be carrying the baby and if you chose to parent the baby you'll be in the trenches if you choose to make an adoption plan you'll be the one to carry more of that emotionally i believe the time for him to be thinking about whether or not to be brining a baby into the world would have been before he slept with a year old that is just my opinion though ok now onto your situation go and get the test done to find out whether or not this is even an issue if you're pregnant you can provide for the child then begin to make plans to be the parent that the child needs with or without your boyfriend's help btw if you lose him over this situation he wasn't worth keeping around again just my opinion this might include you getting a ged it might include seeing if you have a friend or relative to watch the baby while you finish school finishing school in some form or fashion though is imperative don't neglect this after you're done with school you can find a job to pay the bills it will be a difficult road filled with sacrifices but you won't have sacrificed being this child's mom now if you decide that you aren't able to be the parent that the child needs then look toward making an adoption plan contact a lawyer or agency don't answer ads here or elsewhere you never know what might happen make appointments with several interview them ask for references call those references see how people feel about having worked with them and if they'd work with them again if the situation warranted also check online to see if you can find folks who aren't on the reference list ask them the same questions select the right agency or attorney move on from there from there you can decide how open you want the adoption to be it can be closed where you have no contact whatsoever it can be open where you have regular contact with the child and adoptive family it can be anywhere in between including some visits annual pictures and updates or whatever fits your needs and the child's needs the best you get to decide how open you want the adoption to be consider what is best for the child make your decision i am the mom to two adopted girls and one foster girl and two biological sons my foster daughter has regular contact with her birth mother and birth aunt it's been a good thing for her to maintain that connection my adopted daughters were adopted internationally so they can't maintain a relationship with their birth family while the adoption was a positive thing for them they grieve the loss of their birth family it's something that hurts me to see them go through i hope this helps  Friends Adoption EastEnders Charmed Theory of conduct Kodocha Knots Landing Fathers' rights Social rule Pitaten Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Everwood Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jean Grey Grief Polyamory Neighbours Androgen insensitivity syndrome Marilyn Monroe Phoebe Halliwell Boston Public Cindy Sheehan Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Domestic violence Dinah Marler W.I.T.C.H.

foster care adoption and private adoption at the same time is this possible my husband and i are foster parents and we are planning on adopting through our foster care agency however we really want to adopt an infant as well we know our chances are slim of getting a baby through foster care that we would eventually be able to adopt so here is what i don't know are we able to work with more than one adoption agency one for foster care to adoption and a seperate agency that would be for the infant adoption we live in pennsylvania so if anyone is familiar with adoption regulations here that would help also do you think that being foster parents would hurt our chances of being selected by a birth family to adopt thier newborn it is not a state law it is an agency policy you have to contact the foster agency and ask and also the adoption agency and ask as far as hurting your chances for adoption it depends mostly on the attitude of the adoption agency and luck if the adoption agency and or social worker views this as either positive or neutral related to adopting then you are o k then it is up to birthmothers who do slightly prefer couples with no children but not all and whether they will understand the difference between adopting and fostering is debatable my experience is that most people do not understand the difference so check this out with your agency as well in your photo book put in maybe two photos of the baby you foster and mention it in your letter but don't dwell on it good luck  Breastfeeding Infantilism Abortion debate Domestic violence Divorce Foster care Incest Legal research Childbirth Economy of the United States Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Child abuse Health insurance International adoption Conscription Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Infant baptism Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Transactional analysis Hillary Rodham Clinton Trade union Midwifery Fathers' rights Marriage Fathers' rights movement in the UK Transsexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Laura Schlessinger Eugenics Social rule John Edwards Family Children of God Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Magical thinking Polyamory The Giver Moral Politics Father Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China Crazy Horse Prenatal diagnosis Good Times Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Leadership Second language acquisition Food and Drug Administration Social democracy Constitution of Ireland Social Security (United States) Meme Religion and sexuality History of intersex surgery Ethics British nationality law Postpartum depression Newborn screening Charter school Cytomegalovirus Abortion in the United States Birth control Feral child Dinah Marler Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Childlove movement Publicly funded medicine Hearing impairment Japanese name Generation Y Pittsburgh Steelers European Union Friends Sant Thakar Singh Parenting Dissociative identity disorder Knots Landing Extreme Programming Public policy Surveillance Hate speech Single parent Free market Liberalism Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Flat tax Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Child Culture of the United States Politics of the United States History of British nationality law Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Child sexuality

more info on adoption i am only right now but i am sure that one day i will adopt that has always been my dream when i was little i would pretend that my dolls were my adopted children lol anyways i just want some information and tips from people who have been through or are currently in the process of adopting an adoptees take would be good too i have a few questions what is the best age to start the adoption process i don't really want kids till my mid to late thirties should i start the process then or earlier like late tenties when should i tell them that they are adopted thanks excellent questions when you start depends on where you're adopting from if you adopt from a country with a year wait once the dossier goes to the country then start the application process a year a half to two years before you would like to have the child join the family this will give time to gather all your documents together and for some of the delays you might experience so stay current on where you want to adopt from and move forward when the time is right i am a firm believer that the child should know he she is adopted from the beginning if you adopt an infant tell the child from the time he she is in your arms his her adoption story and how he she came into your family this will allow the baby to grow up with a positive view of adoption and his her adoption story if you adopt an older child do the same thing share the child's adoption story with him her from the beginning how you planned for him her from the time you were a teen and that they are so very wanted and valued by you good for you you are an amazing person  Adoption Jon Secada Daylight saving time The Amazing Race Aerial (dance move) Abortion debate Theory of conduct Child sexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Child Social rule Breastfeeding EastEnders Kodocha Sharon Tate Generation Y Dissociative identity disorder Gregorian calendar Cephalic disorder XML Strategic management Culture Economics Robert Owen Enlargement of the European Union John Wesley Speed of light International adoption Goodness and value theory Transsexuality Kimberly-Clark Corporation Religious Society of Friends Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Scientific method Supply and demand Cyprus dispute Jeopardy!

what to expect from a home visit we are starting the process for an international adoption part of this is a home visit with a social worker i am wondering what i can expect from this is it somewhat informal where they check out our home to make sure it is clean and safe or it is more in depth should we do some home improvement projects i e paint the bedroom clean up the landscaping etc if it helps we are going through all of god's children any information on the process would be helpful the information varies a little bit country to country and agency to agency but with over years in adoption work and having approved over families to adopt i can tell you what we looked for many of these requirements are set in stone in our state as they are with every state and then the agency approving you will also have their own requirements some may have christian only or no smoking reqirments for example but the basic requirements are as follows job and job history stable employment history salary decent stable salary reflected on your tax returns pay stubs and employment letters taxes good history of completing verifiable tax returns marriages usually look at number less than three is preferable and length of current marriage usually years divorces will need copies of the decrees and names of exes as well as explanation of reason for divorce children children will be interviewed even if live with you part time or if they are grown references must have personal and professional therapist rabbi teacher references who have known you both for years ideally medical letters from doc stating no communicable or catastrophic ilnesses diseases and state that you are mentally emotionally and physically stable mental stability abuse history from childhood on up history and how you have resolved or coped with it arrests if you have one why and when with details and resolution verified by criminal and child abuse background checks in all states where you have lived income must be sufficient to more than just pay all bills and expenses and not be in debt or bankruptcy pets must be child friendly and up on all vaccinations and healthy home must have a home not just a house can be an apartment or house but needs to be organized warm and child friendly and safe cars do not have to be new but need to be safe and dependable with approved car seats friends neighbors appropriate not partiers and moochers family need to be enthusiastic about the adoption for the sake of the child counseling history of marriage counseling and resolution as well as mental health counseling and therapist's names and reports alcohol and drugs no drug use and alcohol in strict moderation and if have history of addictions must have proof of resolution lifestyle generally fit and appropriate for children such as not a clubber or partier no risky habits hobbies what you do with your spare time religion spirituality do not have to attend church unless the specific agency reqires it and some birthmothers want only a certian religion or practice or the absence of it motivation to adopt why and history of desire to adopt history with children caring for nieces nephews or friend's children or volunteer work documnted childhood everything from your birth on up such as family activites discipline parental roles discipline etc family of origin how close are you now and how often do you stay in contact etc marriage stability and strengths and weaknesses duration usually at least years sex life normal agreeable to both indication of stability exes why ex relationships ended attitudes toward birthparents caring open appreciative or want nothing to do with her indication of attitude towards child as well attitudes towards people of different socio economic status general attitudes reflect how you may see child or birth parents attitudes about continuing contact with birthmother open semi open or closed most agencies will not work with families who want a closed adoption as this is not in the best interest of the child expectations of child are the expectations realistic or not such as must be bright and look like us argh health insurance must have adequate medical insurance for the child as well as for selves etc good luck to you  Marriage Clinical depression Adoption Breastfeeding Alcoholics Anonymous Same-sex marriage Drug abuse
