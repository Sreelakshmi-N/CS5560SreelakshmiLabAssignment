what is a shalally please define it's amazing the lack of reference online for this word even if it is slang a short walking stick with a thickened t shape at the top supposedly used more in fighting than in walking but i've never seen an actual one in ireland only in souvenir shops said to be named after the little village of the same name in county wicklow often the sticks were made from blackthorn roots a very dense wood and had a fist size knob instead of a t shape or any other dense wood such as oak unfortunately eventually the english nearly wiped out the oak forests for their ship builing needs the shillelagh which can have numerous pronounciations could be long like a walking stick or sometimes short and worn in the belt in more ancient times they were carried for protection or were used in ritual type fighting with definite rules of conduct based on certain honor or codes though not as formal and usually not ending in death think of the japanese sword fighting and the formal honors and codes of contact in that type of battle spelled shillelagh pronounced shalaylee  Club (weapon) Japanese tea ceremony Samurai Nunchaku Martial art Billiards Asteroid Hangul Yu-Gi-Oh!

which languages apart from english use conversion or zero derivation in word formation this is very common in english for example the noun 'parent' is used as a verb 'to parent' with no internal changes or affixation there are very many examples of this in english in polish for example there are no examples it does not exist are there any other european languages that do use this i believe that the answer is no reasons for this may be either that the structure of many languages limits the role that words play for example polish words ending in a are generally infinitives and it is hard to envisage their being used as nouns or pehaps more accurately the lack of verbal affixes makes it hard for polish nouns to be used as verbs or that nearly all european languages except english have some kind of governing body e g l'acad mie fran aise la real academia etc which clearly defines how words are used the same considerations apply to those few non european languages of which i have any knowledge however i believe purely on hearsay that in sino tibetan languages e g chinese words may be used as different parts of speech  Esperanto as an international language Swedish language Bulgarian language Morphology (linguistics) Grammar Esperanto grammar Quebec French Finnish language Chinese language Gender-neutral language Dictionary Verb Sanskrit French language Korean language Grammatical aspect Japanese language Navajo language Finnish grammar Mathematics Japanese grammar Slovak language Infinitive English grammar Esperanto vocabulary English verbs Spanish language Ancient Greek Acad__mie fran__aise Grammatical number Proto-Indo-European language Latin Polish language English compound Gender Ubykh language French grammar Family name Inflection Copula Quechua language Esperanto Tibetan language Reduplication Compound (linguistics) Chinese grammar Georgian language Proto-Germanic language Hebrew language Romance languages Swahili language Hangul Reforms of French orthography American and British English differences English plural Non-native pronunciations of English Ido Irish language Czech language Kanji German language M__ra-Pirah__ language Danish language Portuguese language Science Deconstruction Amharic language Object-oriented programming Class (computer science) Vietnamese language Japanese honorifics Adverb Capitalization Noun German grammar Declension Adjective Grammatical gender Tamil language Inuit language Lojban Accusative case Southern Athabascan languages Kapampangan language Copyleft Gothic language Anglicism Catalan grammar Klingon language Varieties of Arabic Preposition Profanity

the latin language is the latin language a difficult language to learn how can i learn it thanks it's medium difficult on the difficulty scale it's what we call highly inflectional which means it has a lot of endings for words latin is fun i believe personally and it does help in learning romance languages it is also a helpful base for the case systems of slavic languages german and others there is a really really really really good book which helps you slowly in learning vocabulary and grammar without making it hard and overwhelming look for a book called ecce romani you might have to find it online but it's a great book and i think there is online support and practice as well it uses story telling and cultural references instead of giving your vocabulary to memorize and just plain grammar it also helps with connections to english and it does give some classical poems when you get to the end of one of the books i have three of them so far hope you have fun with it you can talk to me if you want more info about the grammar or difficulty  Esperanto as an international language Inflection Chinese language Interlingua Polish language Russian language Dutch language English language Latin Spanish language Romanian language French language Ukrainian language Vulgar Latin Hindi Sanskrit Urdu Finnish language Japanese language Non-native pronunciations of English Bulgarian language Literature Italian language Yiddish language Copula Vocabulary Grammatical mood Hungarian language Esperanto grammar Romance languages Arabic language Grammar Korean language Grammatical gender Old French Basque language Greek language Esperanto American Sign Language Ido Classical Chinese Old English language Czech language Pronoun Swedish language Gender-neutral language Historical linguistics English as an additional language Tamil language Middle English Afrikaans Danish language Bengali language Proto-Indo-European language Second language acquisition Anglo-Saxon literature Lithuanian language Medieval Latin Lojban Standard Mandarin Taiwanese (linguistics) Preposition Balkan linguistic union Germanic languages Croatian language Chinese written language Vowel Vietnamese language Subjunctive mood Indonesian language Spanish verbs Latin alphabet Translation T-V distinction Catalan language Esperanto vocabulary Arabic grammar Norwegian language Esperantido Cornish language Inuit language Varieties of Arabic Machine translation Latin spelling and pronunciation Kanji Mutually intelligible languages Navajo language Dialect Grammatical number Autism Yeshivish Adverb

when where do chinese use pinyin and also characters is it used in newspapers and texts is it used in emails and such are there implied rules customs about when where to use that i should know basically pinyin is almost never used by native chinese speakers if you show the average chinese person text written in pinyin they'll stare at it blankly if you show a taxi driver the name of a hotel or address in pinyin they won't have a clue what it means in fact most native chinese speakers who aren't trained chinese teachers struggle with pinyin when i learn a new word in china but the speaker has a difficult accent i find that there isn't much point in asking them to spell the pinyin because either they don't know how to write in pinyin or they get it really wrong the only places you see pinyin in day to day usage are in dictionaries the pronounciation guide on street signs the names of places and streets are transcribed in pinyin for the benefit of foreigners and used as a way of inputting characters into a computer  Pinyin Chinese language Standard Mandarin Simplified Chinese character Cantonese (linguistics) Non-native pronunciations of English Diacritic Taiwanese (linguistics) Written Cantonese Zhuyin Hanja Classical Chinese R__maji Chinese written language English language Punctuation Romanization Kung fu Traditional Chinese character Standard Cantonese Korean language Apostrophe (mark) Mandarin (linguistics) Esperanto as an international language Chinglish Indonesian language Finnish language Hangul Radical (Chinese character) Latin alphabet Kanji Phoneme Martial art Chinese input methods for computers Vietnamese language American and British English differences Cangjie method Hong Kong English Spanish language Japanese writing system Caron Chinese numerals Mahjong Transcription (linguistics) Esperanto Hakka (linguistics) Tai Chi Chuan Tongyong Pinyin Hyphen Languages of Hong Kong Greek language Hiberno-English Postal System Pinyin E-mail German language Singlish Ojibwe language Furigana Taxicab Hmong Moldovan language Swedish language Confucianism Dictionary Beijing Italian language Hindi Gwoyeu Romatzyh Tetragrammaton XML Transliteration Chinese Taipei Writing system Speech synthesis Japanese language Keyboard layout Hebrew language English as an additional language Tamil language Australian English Chu nom Arabic alphabet Second language acquisition Braille Formal written English - regional differences Linguistics Welsh language Middle Chinese Names given to the Spanish language AmigaOS Japanese honorifics Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Chinese era name Speech recognition Xiangqi Chinese sovereign

why do people ask the wrong questions at fast food places subway pizza shops etc they ask for here or to go when they are really asking whether you want it in a bag or not i eat and run i don't eat it there and i don't need a bag so if i answer honestly its to go they stuff it in a bag which i don't want its inconvenient wasteful polluting if i tell them to go but with no bag they're all confused why can't they just ask in a bag or no bag which is really the info they're asking another example someone asked me if i go to work saturday i answered no then my car gets blocked in the driveway why do people ask wrong questions they should ask do you need to go out then yes and my car wouldn't be blocked in people are so stuck in their routines and their standard questions expecting standard answers i should be able to answer their question and the results went right otherwise why ask the wrong questions it's a standardized society with standardized rules behaviors actions reactions processes phrases and attitudes not a good thing that's the way the every day us operates more because of convenience saving time and getting more things done than because of efficiency or accuracy people ask the wrong questions because they are pre programmed to do so by a wrong and illogical learning process based on general practice as opposed to logic and coherence applied differently for each individual situation so most americans become like robots saying the very same idiomatic expressions albeit wrong ones asking and responding almost like pre recorded tracks and having no minds of their own because being different unique or special simply means being impractical in modern society so in order to help you have less trouble dealing with your automaton human partners please you too act like a robot without an individual identity yourself and accept and use everyday's illogical terms like to go do you have the time and so many other incoherent expressions that everybody treat as coherent because everybody else uses them and that's the practical thing to do  Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Ethics Criticism of libertarianism CPU cache Scientology beliefs and practices Logic Economics Goodness and value theory Social psychology Theodicy Determinism Social rule Expert system Consensus decision-making Ontological argument Postmodernism Euphemism Artificial intelligence Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Plame affair Psychology Epistemology Abortion debate Lie Objectivist philosophy Property (ownership right) Coercion Moral relativism Religion Halakha Indian English Confucianism Stuttering A Course In Miracles Philosophy of language Religious Society of Friends Translation Genetic algorithm Irony Cultural relativism Computer Meaning of life Milton H.

what occasion do you use forebode what occasion do you use forebode i am not sure please give me expample sentences with explanations do you sometimes use it and also do you have a good idea to memorize it many in thank the verb forbode is not used very often as such it is much more common to see the noun 'forboding' and the verb 'bode' used encarta defines the word as follows fore bode past and past participle fore bod ed present participle fore bod ing rd person present singular fore bodes transitive and intransitive verb definition portend or predict to be or give an advance warning of something that may happen especially something undesirable 'the gathering clouds foreboded a terrible storm ' have premonition to have a feeling that something bad is going to happen before it does 'i have a recurring dream which forebodes a terrible accident' but more usually in this sense 'i had a dream which left me with a dreadful foreboding ' note that it has nothing to do with the verb 'to forbid' whose past tense is 'forbad' or 'forbade' the latter is more common these days 'to bode' is used in the sense of the promise or expectancy of a particular outcome 'the team's performance in the first part of the year bodes well for them winning the cup ' 'new data bodes ill for newspaper advertising ' from an actual headline http rebuildingmedia corante com archives new data bodes ill for newspaper advertising but a few notes of positive news php note that in the first example 'well' seems to be an adverb but the opposite of 'to bode well' is always 'to bode ill' so in fact it is being used as a noun  Finnish grammar Verb German grammar Esperanto grammar Bulgarian language American and British English differences Ancient Greek Infinitive Gerund Romance copula Participle Spanish verbs Ergative-absolutive language Italian grammar Latin grammar Subjunctive mood English verbs Inflection Slovak language Hebrew grammar French grammar Grammatical aspect Proto-Indo-European language Ubykh language Grammatical tense Swedish language English compound Japanese language Subject (grammar) French verbs Welsh language Future tense Arabic grammar Chinese grammar Hiberno-English Intransitive verb Dutch grammar Morphosyntactic alignment West Germanic strong verb Catalan grammar Grammatical voice Agreement (linguistics) Adjective Swahili language Japanese grammar Singlish Laal language Finnish language Vulgar Latin Ojibwe language Proto-Germanic language Amharic language Grammar Go (verb) Interlingua Greek language Thai language Scientology beliefs and practices Irish syntax Non-native pronunciations of English Basque language Morphology (linguistics) Southern Athabascan languages Auxiliary verb Lingua Franca Nova Adverb Pushtu language Yeshivish Brown Corpus Meaning God Grammatical number Portuguese language Kapampangan language Sesotho language Attic Greek French language Slashdot subculture Pronoun Bench language Spanish pronouns Indo-European copula Grammatical gender Gothic language Relative clause Storytelling Romance languages WordNet Korean language Ablaut

i want to learn to speak arabic do you have any tips i was thinking that just for starters i would pick up the pimsleur language beginning program on arabic if i can handle that then i would take classes there is a college in my city that teaches levels in the language is this a good plan or is there a supperior beginners' audio program that you would recommend any other ideas thanks to the person who asked why and said it's a waste of time i'd have to disagree i could double to triple my current salary if i were to attain fluency in that language and i don't plan to travel to the middle east there are actually many job opportunities within the u s it s amazing how ignorant people can be referring to the comments above well i would highly advise you to start taking classes before trying to self teach you ll need people who are fluent and pronounce the letters correctly in order to attain fluency it would be great if you use other things while taking classes like audio cds and once you start learning the most important thing to do is practice you should practice all the time not because arabic is difficult but because it s important for any language you learn in order to become fluent to make learning fun try to listen to arabic songs but if i were you i d do that once i can understand a lot of things in the language because the songs are in colloquial arabic hope this helps good luck  Arabic language Stuttering Irish language Second language acquisition Python programming language Esperanto as an international language Multilingual Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Literacy Chinese character Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States German language Non-native pronunciations of English African American Vernacular English Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Welsh language Dutch language Hiberno-English Noam Chomsky Spanish language English language Taiwanese (linguistics) Chinese language Extreme Programming American and British English differences Economics I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Standard Mandarin Urdu Philosophy of language GED Milton H.

does anybody here read russian what is the significance of a letter y before a vowel as in byereg pyisma dyevushku i cannot hear the y pronounced as it would be in english i have been trying to learn the words to kalinka and katyusha and also the cyrillic alphabet my sound source has been the red army chorus probably not the best possible resource bear in mind that russian isn't written using the latin alphabet in russian those words are written these are actually more commonly transliterated into english as bereg pis'ma and devushka basically russian has two types of vowel hard and soft ones the vowel written e in cyrillic is one of the soft ones at the start of a word it's pronounced ye so yeltsin is written in russian when it follows a consonant it palatalises that consonant in other words the tongue is pushed closer to the roof of the mouth specifically the soft palate this can sound to anglophone ears as if there's a short y sound present in reality it's more like a combination of the consonant and a y and is sometimes quite subtle  Cyrillic alphabet Vowel Hangul Bulgarian language Diacritic Russian alphabet Russian language Tatar language Palatalization Non-native pronunciations of English Finnish language Arabic alphabet Latin alphabet Alphabet Belarusian language Polish language Russian phonology International Phonetic Alphabet Greek language Hebrew alphabet Romanian language Dutch language Arabic language Devan__gar__ Hebrew language Ukrainian language Serbo-Croatian language Caron Consonant French language R__maji Apostrophe (mark) Vietnamese language Phoneme Hungarian language Romanization Italian language Acute accent Egyptian language Transliteration Chinese language Slovak language Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Vowel length Serbian language Korean language Spanish language Russian orthography Pinyin Thai alphabet Taiwanese (linguistics) Gothic language Sesotho language Ukrainian alphabet Schwa Writing Voiceless glottal fricative Tamil language Latin spelling and pronunciation English language Greek alphabet Indonesian language Writing system Slovenian language Varieties of Arabic C Tetragrammaton Silent E Esperanto phonology D'ni language Liaison Aramaic language Lithuanian language Diaeresis Estonian language Sindarin Klingon language Shorthand Catalan phonology and orthography Urdu Wolof language Tamil script Voiceless velar fricative Vishnu sahasranama Romanian phonology Keyboard layout Inuktitut Languages of India Yoruba language Sanskrit English spelling Romanization of Hebrew

i'm learning english can someone help me i'm not sure of what the difference is between sentences like the following ones i can't wait for the weekend to begin i can't wait that the weekend begins or i want you to bring me there i want that you bring me there are all correct or not if yes do they mean exactly the same or do you use them in different cases for example to emphasize some aspects of the request the above answers are correct but they haven't told you why which makes it hard for you to construct other sentences with a similar structure i can tell you that the structure i want that you bring me is not grammatically incorrect but that it is not colloquial in other words this is not the way native english speakers talk it just doesn't sound right we use such structures as these all the time i believe that i think that i wish that i hope that i demand that i insist that although just to confuse you we often leave out that i wish he would go away i hope you believe me but i want i love i hate and i like are followed by either a noun such as peace a pronoun such as you or a noun phrase such as you to take me there examples i want you to tell me the truth the dog likes me to play with him the baby loves me to tickle her tummy my boss hates me to be late for work my mother wants us to come over for dinner your girlfriend hates you to laugh at her hair they may also be followed by the infinitive of a verb i hate to lie i want to dance i can't wait i long i yearn are phrases that are followed by for plus a noun pronoun or noun phrase or just the infinitive of a verb such as i long to know i can't wait to see examples i long for an end to the war she yearns for love he can't wait for the end of the movie contrast i want an end to the war she wants love really the only way for you to become confident about choosing which structure to use is to listen all the time to native speakers talking on the bus on the radio in movies everywhere gradually you will become familiar with the commonly used phrases and colloquialisms and then you must use them yourself in real conversations good luck and i hope you enjoy learning english  Bulgarian language Gender-neutral language German grammar English grammar Singlish Slovak language Finnish language Spanish verbs Swedish language Shit Non-native pronunciations of English Spanish language Japanese grammar Pronoun Gerund Czech language Japanese language Dutch language Hiberno-English Esperanto grammar Finnish grammar American and British English differences Grammatical aspect Greek language Korean language Grammatical gender Welsh language Grammatical mood Portuguese language French grammar English verbs Kapampangan language Tamil language Preposition Quebec French Hypercorrection Navajo language Philosophy of language Georgian language Japanese honorifics Subjunctive mood Sesotho language Proto-Indo-European language Sanskrit Second language acquisition Pleonasm Morphology (linguistics) Disputed English grammar Polish language English plural Vietnamese language English language Grammar Esperanto as an international language German language Ido Grammatical number Japanese particles God and gender Chinese grammar Infinitive Written Cantonese Spanish pronouns French language Italian grammar Chinglish Brazilian Portuguese Esperanto vocabulary Dutch grammar Indian English Article (grammar) Meaning Literary language Hong Kong English Adjective Dative case Relative clause Expletive Arabic grammar Umlaut Figure of speech Ubykh language Spoken Finnish E-Prime Burmese language Inflection Shibboleth Hindi Vulgar Latin African American Vernacular English Dual (grammatical number) Kanji Latin grammar Serbo-Croatian language Varieties of Arabic

when did latin names like gaius villius etc disappear and why i would like a specific time period i also want to know when common latin began to disappear from street use and when it began to become replaced by italian thanks pagan greek latin and celtic names gradually gave way to christian names everywhere in the roman empire as christianity gained more and more converts the pace quickened after the emperor constantine embraced christianity in a d and again after emperor theodosius i made christianity the official religion of the roman empire in a d some pagan names eventually became christian names but gaius and villius were not among them i think it's safe to say that by the last decade of the th century the romans had completely stopped using these names the morphing of vulgar latin to italian was a gradual one some spanish and italian like characteristics already appear in the latin of the pompeiian inscriptions of italy and in the vindolandia tablets found in northern england which date from the st century a d for example cerevisia for beer spanish cerveza camisia for shirt instead of subucula cf spanish camisa italian camicia and caballi for horses instead of equii cf spanish caballos italian cavalli etc the earliest written documents in italian like spanish date only from the th century a d however probably as early as the beginning of the th century a d the italian language was already a separate entity from latin a new daughter language of latin along with proto spanish proto french and daco romanian  Roman Empire Ancient Rome Middle Ages Latin alphabet Constantine I (emperor) Byzantine Empire Vulgar Latin Western Roman Empire Latin History of Christianity Roman Emperor Theodosius I Emperor Icon Old French Roman Britain Anno Domini History of Greek and Roman Egypt Chinese language Aramaic language Names of the Greeks Jew Roman law Hispania Italy Sardinian language Tacitus Romanian language Indo-European languages Spain Nicene Creed Timeline of ancient Rome Origin of Romanians Celt Late Antiquity French language History of Slovakia Greek language Greece Mithraism Roman currency Dark Ages Jews in the Middle Ages French people Justinian I Bosniaks Roman mythology Historical basis for King Arthur Germanic tribes Dalmatian language Paul of Tarsus Trinity Constantinople Italian language Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor Common Era German language Franks History of the Roman Catholic Church Celtic Christianity Greeks Italian Renaissance Pontifex Maximus England Renaissance History of Europe History of the English Bible Arianism History of the Balkans Europe Ancient history Medieval Greek Sephardi Jews Ambrose Christianity Library of Alexandria Vortigern Latin spelling and pronunciation Anglo-Saxons Roman and Byzantine Greece Etruscan language 1270s Culture of Ancient Rome War of the Spanish Succession Ephrem the Syrian Celtic mythology Balkan linguistic union Germanic paganism History of Buddhism Romanians Nontrinitarianism Religion in the United Kingdom

what's the best way to learn sigh language i feel it is very hard to learn a language without being immersed in it in my experience the people who become fluent in any language are surrounded by the language they are learning for a long period of time anywhere from a few months to a year immersion progams during which one travels to the country of origin of the language are very helpful but how to do that with a language that has no centralized home base i grew up around deaf people and studied deaf culture which included a bit about the structure of sign language it is beautiful and very complex the grammar is so different from any language i know and yet many people who study sign langauge profess to be fluent after a few years of study most are not some go on to work as certified translators and they suck most hearing people who are fluent in sign were raised with the language however it's possible to learn my cousin in spain did and she translates for parliament she's wonderful first take a class or two or three then try to meet deaf people and socialize with them on a regular basis so you can practice there are events that occur with regularity in most cities during which deaf people get together to socialize also keep in mind that there are different forms of sign for example asl american sign langauge is a language signed exact english used widely in schools even though it cannot replace the necessity of asl for the deaf is not there are other forms as well most deaf people who use sign communciate with asl by the way there has been a project in progress for a couple of years to build a town called laurent which will emphasize asl as the primary form of communication there  American Sign Language Second language acquisition Sign language Signing Exact English Hearing impairment Nicaraguan Sign Language British Sign Language Languages in the United States Advanced Squad Leader Deaf culture Washoe (chimpanzee) Music Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Models of deafness Esperanto as an international language Deaf Education in the United States Great Ape language Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Language Multilingual Education in the People's Republic of China Chinese spoken language Baptism Charles-Michel de l'__p__e Language education Noam Chomsky Autism Home sign German language Hungarian language Philosophy of language Russian language History of science Japanese Sign Language Stuttering Experiential education Social psychology Spanish language African American Vernacular English Tactile signing Milton H.

proper way to get a japanese name for an english person so a couple of friends of mine and myself are teaching ourselves japanese support group kinda thing and have people to talk to we've got cds books websites videos in japanese all kinds of stuff the question came up on what to call each other well we've all got quite western names shawn chris and david after short looking we found these two sites http www japanesetranslator co uk your name in japanese http www yournameinjapanese com one creates phonetic versions of the names in katakana another attempts to create the name in kanji as we are practicing our writing as well as speaking and reading we want to have accurate versions of our names to practice with are the outputs of these generators accurate also would it be proper socially to pick a more japanese sounding name what would be the best process for that like somebody moving to america and picking the name john smith your name would never ever be in kanji you're foreigners your name is foreign so it would be in katakana which is what the first link does and accurately too it's just proper to stick to your own name if you went to japan and introduced yourself with a japanese name you would cause a bit of confusion as to why you a westerner with probably no asian heritage has that name  Japanese name Katakana Kanji Furigana Chinese character R__maji Japanese writing system Hanja Chinese language Transcribing English to Japanese Hepburn romanization Mahjong Kana Pok__mon (anime) World Wide Web Ideogram Chinese calligraphy HyperText Transfer Protocol Japan International Phonetic Alphabet Hangul Otaku Ruby character Okurigana Cross site scripting Crossword Aikido Culture of Japan Diacritic English plural Hiragana Compact disc Rich Mullins Negima Finnish language Haiku History of Japan Toyo kanji Karaoke Vietnamese language Non-native pronunciations of English Wget Japanese mobile phone culture Confucius Chinese written language Super Nintendo Entertainment System Uniform Resource Locator Learning kanji Speech synthesis Languages of Hong Kong Punctuation Hebrew language Yu-Gi-Oh!

american canadian and austrailian dialects americans canadians and austrailians all speak a dialect of the english language but how long would it have taken for the dialects to become distinct from the mother tongue in other words when did american settlers colonists stop speaking in an english english accent and start to speak in an american english accent for example this isn't as complex as you might believe yet it's also not as simple first of all american english isn't uniform just as british english isn't as well the different parts of the country were influenced by different dialects of british english for example the southern dialects were influences by slaves who were brought over and they also have scotch irish influence which was heavy there in the north it was more influenced by the puritians who settled in that area that's why they drop some of their r s just as some dialects of british does still i pahked my cah in havahd yahd in my own state of pennsylvania just west of my area philly there is a german influence especially since there is the pennsylvanian dutch dialect of german but it shows up in some phrases in english i know other regionally dialects are affected by who settled there so remember that now australia has a heavy cockney influence so that even now both accents have the shift from aj the sound like ie in tie to oj the oy in boy as well as the shift from ej to aj and others consult my fair lady or a dialect book or me for more info on their vowel shifts remember that australia was a prision colony and many of the prisioners were irish or cockney sometimes more low class people of britian canada has a lot of influences like from the states and from other settlements from the british but here is another thing in recent years the dialects are possibly moving together into a new standard the reason for the change away from it was the isolation well with the media today there is less and less isolation so children in all the english speaking countries are hearing british irish american australian and other accents and there is a change they might merge and become a standard again  German language Regional accents of English speakers English English American English Hiberno-English Dutch language Germanic languages Non-native pronunciations of English Southern American English Finnish language New Zealand English Old Norse language Portuguese language Hangul Vowel Japanese language Chinese language Swedish language Danish language Spanish language Languages in the United States French language Irish language Australia Standard Cantonese Inuktitut Received Pronunciation Hebrew language Inuit language Slovenian language Phoneme Welsh language Sesotho language Canadian English Proto-Germanic language Spanish dialects and varieties Korean language Tone (linguistics) French people African American Vernacular English History of the English language Greek language M__ori language Dialect Sindarin Cockney Occitan language Singlish Australian English phonology Sanskrit Taiwanese (linguistics) General American Old French High German consonant shift Swiss German Romance languages Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Vowel length Russian language International English Newfoundland Old English language Aramaic language Japanese dialects Standard Mandarin Diacritic English-language vowel changes before historic r South Slavic languages Serbo-Croatian language Indonesian language England Quebec French Hong Kong English Cot-caught merger Languages in the United Kingdom Indian English Romanian language Cantonese (linguistics) Shibboleth Swahili language Spelling reform British colonization of the Americas Bulgarian language Yoruba language

what exactly does teutonic mean is it of german language or something cant seem to find definate answer on the web the word teutonic derives at once from both the latin name for a tribe who were thought by the romans to be germanic die teutonen wich means the teutons and from the germanic word tiutisch new high german deutsch german originally meaning belonging to the people the romans identified die teutonen as a germanic tribe and therefore roman writers began to use the term teutonicus as a synonym for their existing word for germanic peoples germanicus today many scholars think that die teutonen were not a germanic tribe at all but were actually a celtic tribe and it has been suggested that teutone derives from the celtic word tuath meaning the people or the tribe as in the mythical irish race the tuatha de danaan the tribe of danaan citation needed tiutisch is the source of the german word deutsch as well as the english word dutch by germans writing in latin used teutonicus instead of the earlier theodisca which was a latin word form of the germanic tiutisch which meant germanic it appears they thought it was an alternative form of the same germanic derivation as theodisca the words teutone and tiutisch thus merged into one modern term teutonic the italian form tedesco derives from the older theodisca the term was used by the economist william z ripley to designate one of the three races of europe which by later writers was called the nordic race this word was also incorporated into the great gatsby by f scott fitzgerald as part of a phrase describing the great war or in other words world war i the teutonic order history of the order the teutonic order was founded in during the siege of acre when a hospital brotherhood was established to care for the many sick german crusaders it was given a building after the conquest of the city and in was turned into a military monastic order on the model of the hospitallers of saint john and the templars this creation reflected the growing involvement of the hohenstaufen dynasty in the holy land from the start the order started a policy of conquering land and building up independent territory in the holy land in hungary in and later in prussia after it absorbed the sword brethren in livonia it was in prussia that the order fought with the polish dukes of masovia and silesia to subjugate the pagan prussians and fight against novgorod after the fall of acre in the grand master went to venice and following the conquest of pomerelia in to marienburg in prussia thus the order by now exclusively nobiliary came to form an independent political entity in pope innocent iv had placed the order's possessions in the pope's domain but in practice the order was completely independent its fortunes began to fade in with the defeat inflicted at tannenberg by poland lithuania and a revolt in its territories in further diminished it and it became a vassal of poland the reformation brought many changes to the order in the hochmeister albrecht of brandenburg anspach secularized the order's prussian holdings into the duchy of prussia resigned from the order became lutheran and gav ehomage for the duchy to the king of poland on april in livonia the ordenmeister livlands gotthard von ketteler did the same in and turned the remnants of the order's estates most of which had been divided between sweden and poland into the duchy of kurland in the german empire the deutschmeister became grand master in and the seat of the order transferred from marienburg to mergentheim the order survived in germany adapting to local politics the protection of the habsburg dynasty which reformed the order in proved a mixed blessing the order survived but it never regained any independence and its efforts were redirected in the habsburgs' wars against the turks with the treaty of westphalia in catholic lutheran and calvinist knights received equal rights within an order headed since the late th century by a habsburg grand master some bailliwicks like elsass burgund koblenz sterreich bozen remained catholic others like th ringen sachsen were protestant and hessen was tripartite catholic lutheran calvinist in the protestant dutch knights broke away and formed the ridderlijke duitsche orde ballij van utrecht which still exists in the order was expelled from most german states and survived only in austria reduced to four knights in it was reorganized by the austrian emperor as a catholic charitable institution nuns were introduced they had existed in the medieval order knights of honor and marianer were created to attract financial support while the knights themselves were essentially noble austrian officers with world war i and the end of the habsburg monarchy the order lost its last possessions in archduke eugen resigned as grand master in the pope reorganized the order as a purely religious order of priests no more knights were created and the last one friedrich graf belrupt tissac died in the order suffered during world war ii when it was abolished by the nazis in austria and czechoslovakia but it survived in italy and started again after in austria and germany in its current form the order has brethren sisters honorary knights and marianer or associates the hochmeister resides in vienna

ialways thought that the ipa had a different symbol for every sound but i see that the same symbol is used for the 'u' in words like 'gun' and 'gut' like a sort of upsidedown 'a' does this mean that the same symbol is used for more than one sound or does it mean that people who speak 'rp' pronounce the 'u' in both words the same way edit for onetwothree lol differently edit for grahamh yes at least one mine but then i don't speak rp i think they are talking about the wedge the symbol is the thing is accents change for each individual that is the sound in my dialect btw i don't like to use the wedge i prefer the schwa regardless of stress length or tense laxness as for an upside down a there is and there is slightly different in where the tongue is the former is a bit lower in the mid open range and the latter is rounded back and low i think you mean the first one the only means that whoever heard this might think the vowel was more mid low then mid central different dialects pronounce the same thing differently for example the word like might be pronounced by americans as l jk and rp might be lajk and cockney australian might be lojk it can be kind of interesting phonetic and phonology rules  International Phonetic Alphabet Schwa English language Korean language Non-native pronunciations of English American English Greek language Hangul Danish language New York-New Jersey English Standard Mandarin Hebrew language Pinyin Close central unrounded vowel Slovenian language English English Italian language Thai language Serbo-Croatian language Southern American English Indonesian language Dutch language Tone (linguistics) Russian phonology Australian English Romanian language Finnish language New Zealand English Regional accents of English speakers Vowel length Diacritic Sesotho language Polish language Slovak language English phonology Chinese language Australian English phonology Arabic language Aramaic language Old English language Portuguese language Spanish dialects and varieties Phonology Umlaut Silent E Sound change Swedish language Quebec French Phonetics Taiwanese (linguistics) English plural Cot-caught merger Tamil language Russian language Hiberno-English Welsh language Voiceless palatal-velar fricative Vulgar Latin Varieties of Arabic Sindarin Hungarian language Hindi Stuttering Old French Twi Glottal stop Spelling reform Lithuanian language Bengali language Ojibwe language German language Finnish phonology Standard Cantonese Vietnamese language Japanese language Yoruba language Sanskrit Proto-Slavic language French language Gothic language Southern Athabascan languages Basque language Cornish language Koine Greek Bulgarian language Dictionary Yorkshire dialect and accent Singlish Phonation

can someone help with a suggestion on a cross culture relationship my wife is chinese and she came to our western country in we have a boy aged yrs i am european however i have a big problem i cant seem to solve my wife insists she wants to teach him chinese and so she talks to him all the time in this language the issue is i dont mind her teaching him chinese but when our boy is doing something wrong or needs urgent attention she yells at him in chinese yet my wife knows english very well she keeps on speaking in chinese even though i try and teach him english so he can go to school and speak our native language without having to be confused i dont speak chinese but when i am speaking english she will insistantly keeps on in chinese to him even though his small knowledge of english is better than chinese i have spoken to her about my concerns but she refuses to listen i am very frustrated as i think that if she is in my country then she should speak our english is there any suggestions to solve this to add more pain to my situation over the last year she has slept with our boy and neglected our relationship she refuses to sleep with me and makes excuses for why she wont come to bed with me ie i dont shower i dont brush my teeth which i do of course and i get negativity from her instead of encouragement she isnt physical and emotionally attached with me and sits away from me and wont even look at me its a frightening scenario and this certainly wasnt what it was like when we first went out it's great to be bilingual we are bringing our daughter up to be kind of a necessity because daddy is deaf a bilingual child will have a smaller vocab in each language than a monolingual child but will have an overall greater vocab since they have two languages that your wife speaks chinese to your boy is no problem that she interrupts you speaking to your son is a problem you have every right to converse with your boy if you are speaking to him in english and he is out and about in the world he will learn english if there is any danger to his learning either language properly it is his chinese as he will hear less of it because it is the minority language by the time he gets to school age he should be a functional bilingual actually by his current age he should have a pretty clear idea on which language to use to which person i think you should encourage his chinese but stop your wife interrupting you i've known hearing kids with deaf parents who only signed to them they pick up english everywhere else in their life and are perfectly bilingual long before they get to school don't worry about it mother son relationships are very strong in chinese culture if i were you i'd do a bit of research about that norms in childraising vary a lot from family to family let alone between cultures what she's doing might be perfectly normal for chinese people even though it isn't for you i don't know i'm just suggesting a different avenue for you to consider once you've sussed out that you'll both have to come to a compromise  Multilingual Second language acquisition Autism Infantilism Hearing impairment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Singlish Philosophy of language Simplified Chinese character Franz Boas Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Deaf culture Chinese language Languages in the United States Korean language Shaggy dog story Ludwig Wittgenstein Domestic violence Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Narcissism Family name Culture of Lithuania Education in the People's Republic of China Grief Friends Theodicy Theory of conduct About a Boy Hypnosis Autism rights movement Avenue Q Non-native pronunciations of English Esperanto as an international language American and British English differences Education in the United States Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Humphrey Bogart Love Welsh language Sociolinguistics Abortion debate African American Vernacular English Signing Exact English The Fairly OddParents The Shining (film) Alcoholics Anonymous W.I.T.C.H.

teaching a child another language i want to teach my month old hebrew because i was born raised in israel my adoptive family doesn't speak it though and they say he should learn english first then hebrew i think he should learn hebrew first because he'll be around english all his life what should i do i've heard it's better to teach the other language first is this true sorry i was when i left israel and i had to leave for personal reasons i came from an upper class family and had learned a little bit of english but i had a tutor to profect it i do speak hebrew fluently but my adoptive family never learned because i spoke enough english to get by with them it is possible for you to teach your son hebrew you only have to stick to speaking hebrew to him solely no english the acquisition of english will come naturally through your surroundings and your adoptive family is not right with the claim that he should learn english first that would only make it harder for you to teach him hebrew the problem with bilingual children is that they start feeling uncomfortable about their bilingualism once they detect that they are different from other children usually the reaction to this is that they refuse to speak the foreign language for a while but they still understand it they can also reactivate the foreign language again if they want this problem is intensified when the foreign language lacks prestige in the surrounding environment as it seems to be in your case as the children feel even more awkward but don't let this put you off your plan and don't let your adoptive family put you off your plan he's your son you can teach him what you want just stick to this speak only hebrew to him prepare yourself for the day when he starts refusing it stay calm and confident this is just a phase if you persistently stick to hebrew he'll get back to it too good luck  Second language acquisition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Adoption Non-native pronunciations of English Esperanto as an international language Avenue Q Pitaten German language English language Noam Chomsky Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Education in the United States Education in Germany Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Trinity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gender-neutral language Theory of conduct Israel Chinese language Bilingual education Hearing impairment International English Education in Romania Scientology beliefs and practices Names of God in Judaism Autism Stuttering Book of Isaiah Justification (theology) Ten Commandments Hebrew alphabet Family name Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Constructed language Finnish language Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophy of language Infantilism Melting pot Idolatry American Sign Language Jewish languages Holy Spirit God and gender Kodocha Who is a Jew?

why can some people imitate other accents and sounds while others really suck at it it has alot to do with your listening skills for example when most people are learning a new language there are sounds and accents they cannot interpret hear diphthongs two vowels joined to make a new sound are common culprits they often produce sounds that are very unfamiliar also is accent in stress for example asian languages depend on accent and stress it is why white people make fun of the way they talk however unless you can stop giggling i mean you beavis long enough to hear and duplicate those accents you will never speak the language well enough to be understood except by the most tolerant of listeners but seriously that is the reason why you'll find that people who cannot hear and duplicate sounds and accents are also people who will misunderstand things in conversation or mis speak themselves  Vowel Non-native pronunciations of English Italian language Welsh language Hearing impairment Finnish language Dutch language Tone (linguistics) Phoneme Greek language Spanish language Regional accents of English speakers Southern American English English English American English Gothic language Indonesian language Danish language Polish language New York-New Jersey English Varieties of Arabic Serbo-Croatian language Pinyin Singlish Second language acquisition English phonology Meter (poetry) Korean language Hindi French language Australian English Hong Kong English Acute accent English language Romanian phonology Hangul Standard Mandarin Apostrophe (mark) Koine Greek Canadian English Scouse Standard Cantonese Chinese language Latin spelling and pronunciation Spanish dialects and varieties Grave accent Hungarian language Vowel length Portuguese language Slovenian language Stuttering Arabic alphabet New Zealand English Stress (linguistics) Silent E English as an additional language Old French Syllable Romanian language Philosophy of language Vulgar Latin Czech language Diphthong Languages in Star Wars Arabic language Japanese language Old Norse language Kapampangan language Lithuanian language Esperanto Esperanto phonology R__maji Yorkshire dialect and accent Hebrew language Irish language California English Thai language Australian English phonology Welsh English Irish phonology Japanese phonology History of the English language Swedish phonology Phonology Aramaic language English-language vowel changes before historic r Hiberno-English Liaison Aphasia Somali language Brazilian Portuguese Diaeresis Sound change

in chinese does 'bi zui' translate to shut up because my freind said that but i speak and i thought it was 'bu yao shou hua' literally translating to 'do not take the action of talking' so i guess it's a mouthful but it sounds one hell of alot cooler than just bi zui lol so if you are fluent a native speaker help me out here which one would you use first sorry i know i can't put characthers up here that would probably help a ton but i guess i only know the pinyin for bizui any way so it wouldn't matter haha actually bi zui is much more informal than bu yao shuo hua bi zui you would usually use with friends or people you are familiar with in china if you tell someone to bi zui and you are not familiar with them they'll most likely be offended if you are trying to say please don't speak politely you can say qing bu yao shuo hua bi zui please stop talking hope this helps  Chinese language Hakka (linguistics) Standard Mandarin Personages of the Three Kingdoms Gang of Four Shanghai China Hua Guofeng Mandarin (linguistics) Standard Cantonese Yao Ming Demographics of Taiwan Zhao Yun Taiwanese (linguistics) Zhuang Pinyin Cao Cao Chinese spoken language Hmong Wang Tao Ken Chu Korean language Written Cantonese Qingdao Names of China Wade-Giles Chinese name Chinese calendar The Legend of the Condor Heroes Hunan Taiwan Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Taiwanese aborigines Qing Dynasty Hakka Confucius Jiang Qing Taoism Chiang Kai-shek History of the People's Republic of China Sun Yat-sen Guan Yu Cantonese (linguistics) Mid-Autumn Festival Greek language Japanese honorifics Communist Party of China Singlish Shit Xiongnu Romance of the Three Kingdoms Japanese language Kung fu Yin Shun Yiquan Emperor of China Singapore gay theatre Falun Gong Guqin Hongkonger African American Vernacular English Taiwan independence Huangshan Mountains Mainlander John Woo Hua Mulan Chinglish Other characters of Fullmetal Alchemist People's Republic of China Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China Jinyong Emperor Wu of Han Buddhism in China Political divisions of China Water Margin Chinese surname Esperanto as an international language Zhao Ziyang Vietnamese language Manchuria Republic of China Triad Chinese character Romanization Shaanxi Irish language Guangxi Languages of China History of China Manchu language Mao Zedong Confucianism Guangdong Dialects of Mandarin Warring States Period Russian joke

i'm sorry what did you say i can't hear you i'm afraid i'm beginning to lose my hearing i am very frightened by the thought of such an outcome i found out when i was talking to one of my friends and someone else was talking to me but i had my back to them and i didn't hear them at all they were standing right behind me also my fianc needed help unloading the car and called for my help and i didn't hear it she was screaming ironically i've already learned bsl because i was interested in the deaf community but now that i'm becoming deaf i just feel disabled in some way do you know any way to become adjusted to something like this should i embrace it or should i try to ignore it sorry if this isn't making any sense but i'm quite scared confused and a bit annoyed that this is happening to me all help would be appreciated p s i don't think that people who are death have a disease or anything it's just different when you've been able to hear your whole life and now it's suddenly going away my advice is to go to the doctor it may not be anything perminant of course it's frightening it's nothing to be ashamed of and it doesn't mean you have anything against the deaf community your doctor will tell you what's going on and how to proceed from here i hope everything works out  Hearing impairment Milton H.

what is the difference between french and creole please excuse my ignorance but i have no clue for some time i was thinking that lyrics to this one song was in french but then i was told it was creole lol the languages must be very similar also excuse any grammatical mistakes i might have made i suck at grammar okay the last two are clooooose but not so what happens is when a culture comes and conquers another is that the conquering group mixes it's language with the conquered group the first generation develops what we call a pidgin now it's not always like this sometimes pidgins occurs in trading cities or when there is other forms of mixing it can have more than one language to form a pidgin as well especially areas that have been conquered more than once anyway the second generation doesn't have a direct langauge to learn they develop what we call a creole often there is vocabulary from whatever the original languages are however the interesting thing is that creoles all around the world seem to have similar grammars this connects back to theories of the origins of language eventually the creole can become a language of its own afrikaans is such a language which was formed from various african langauges and dutch and believe it or not english was once a creole of anglo saxon and norman french that's why we have vocabulary from both hawaiian is a creole there is french creole in lousian pennsylvania german is somewhat a creole haitian creole french guiana jamaican creole and many others french i believe might have been a creole of a form of frankish and latin but french has been a language for a long while just as english has been for probably years or so  Creole language English language Romance languages Pidgin Languages in the United States French language African American Vernacular English Dutch language Hawaiian Pidgin Old English language Jamaican English Portuguese language Proto-Germanic language German language Mixed language Spanish language Singlish Langue d'o__l Grammatical gender Bislama Americas Papiamento Varieties of Arabic Japanese language Creole Spanish Creole Language family Loanword Yeshivish Mutually intelligible languages Non-native pronunciations of English Hawaiian language Lingua franca Esperanto as an international language Language acquisition Basque language Crist__o Middle English Haitian Creole language Capeverdean Crioulo Multilingual Chinglish Origin of language Old French Russian language Gbe languages Anglo-Saxons Music of Louisiana Finnish language English-speaking Europe Tok Pisin Jamaican Creole Chinese language Music of Trinidad and Tobago Grammar Norwegian language Diglossia Language contact Interlingua Manually Coded English Latin America Historical linguistics Hungarian language Anglo-Norman language Vulgar Latin Indonesian language European languages Malay-based creoles Swedish language Romance copula African languages Egyptian language Forro Hong Kong English Peru Hispanic Music genre Acculturation Black (people) Greek language Medieval Latin Latin Goths Hindi Nicaraguan Sign Language Patu__ Vowel Regional accents of English speakers Second language acquisition Etymology Cornish language Vietnamese language

irish does anyone speak it only of people in ireland speak their native language and i find it appauling i agree that it is redundant but people who live in ireland should be able to speak it its sickening and i give kudos to those who take the time to learn it thanks for your feedback oh and the second person who answered yea it is known as gaelic elsewhere but here its just plain irish i'm a native speaker of irish and i never had the difficulty of having to learning it nancy i understand it is a difficult language to learn for english speakers but then english is also extremely difficult to learn properly for speakers of other languages i know because i didn't start learning english until i began attending school the spelling system in english is chaotic in the first place it is different from every other language take a simple woird such as make in any other language that would be pronounced like mack eh in the second place there is very little consistency in the spelling try pronouncing through tough rough though trough bough so the difficulty in irish isn't the spelling which is nearly completely consistent within the spelling rules of irish not within the spelling rulkes of english as regards whether people should learn irish i'm biased and i think it's a beautiful language and i think it's far more expressive than english and i believe that's the only good reason for learning it people who want to learn it because they think they should as an expression of their heritage may do so of course but i don't believe that's a reason to exhort others to have to do the same so there's nothing appalling about the fact that so few speak it it's a wonder the language exists at all considering the way it has been disadvantaged historically also nancy whether or not you think it's a redundant language isn't the point you don't have to learn it if you don't want to do so and it's none of your business if people like me do speak it and expect to deal with state business in that language as a result certainly i should not suffer any disadvantage as a result of anybody thinking it's redundant as regards the statistic f speaking irish it's actually less than who actually speak irish on a daily basis as a working language i'm one of those and i can't claim any kudos for it i was just born in those circumstances  Irish language Esperanto as an international language Hiberno-English Greek language English language Non-native pronunciations of English Chinese language Scottish Gaelic language Dutch language Goidelic languages African American Vernacular English Multilingual Australian English Northern Ireland Bulgarian language Second language acquisition Phoneme Dyslexia English plural British Isles Manx language Pleonasm Celt Finnish language German language English as an additional language SAT Wolof language Pinyin English spelling Hungarian language Singlish Philosophy of language Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Family name New Zealand English French language Junior Certificate Newfoundland English Ulster Scots language American English Spanish language Appeal History of Ireland Logic Russian language Writing system Italian language New York-New Jersey English Shit Cornish language Constitution of Ireland Korean language Hearing impairment Standard Mandarin Theory of conduct Parliament of the United Kingdom Esperanto grammar Entropy English as a lingua franca for Europe Cognitive science Indonesian language Czech language Languages in the United Kingdom International English Gaelic football Danish language Japanese language United Kingdom Anglosphere Ido Welsh language English grammar Hong Kong English Regional accents of English speakers Shall and will Sexual orientation Cantonese (linguistics) Slovak language Swahili language Contract Culture of Ireland Republic of Ireland Policy Debate President of Ireland Occitan language Esperanto Urdu

is the welsh language hard to learn to put it plainly it is not the easiest language around it has an unusual writing system with some annoying irregularities albeit one that is far more logical than english's mishmash and a vocabulary and grammar that on the whole are incredibly foreign to the anglophone student the dreaded consonant mutations where his cat ei gath her cat ei chath and their cat eu cath all have different starting consonants is a major part of the learning process nonetheless it is not ridiculously complicated and is less difficult than many languages if you can get used to a nearly entirely foreign vocabulary the verb system isn't so difficult all versions of the language other than the literary standard which is barely ever spoken make heavy use of periphrastic verbs i e where 'i sing' and 'you sing' are 'dw i'n canu' and 'rwyt ti'n canu' basically the conjugated verb 'bod' to be followed by 'n and the infinitive verb so when you learn bod it is very easy to write thousands of phrases in the present and there are periphrastic verbs for other tenses too in any rate welsh is really rewarding and in my opinion one of the most stunning languages to communicate in dymuniadau da c s  Welsh language English verbs English grammar English language Ancient Greek Slovak language Infinitive Bulgarian language Polish language Dutch language Portuguese language Japanese language Esperanto as an international language Korean language Danish language Greek language Hungarian language Sindarin Non-native pronunciations of English Hindi Latin Sanskrit Finnish language Chinese language American and British English differences Translation German grammar Esperanto Thai language Spanish language Spanish verbs French language Romance languages Subjunctive mood Interlingua Cornish language Scottish Gaelic language Finnish grammar Lojban Arabic grammar Taiwanese (linguistics) West Germanic strong verb Grammatical mood Serbo-Croatian language Spoken Finnish Consonant mutation Esperanto grammar Lithuanian language Germanic languages Aramaic language Singlish Czech language African American Vernacular English Old Irish language Manually Coded English Old French Grammatical gender Future Irish language Verb Copula Japanese grammar Syriac language Germanic weak verb Arabic language Grammatical conjugation Proto-Indo-European language Navajo language Irregular verb Romanian language Vulgar Latin Georgian language Sesotho language Indonesian language Old English language Ojibwe language Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Tamil language Quebec French Adverb Italian grammar Breton language Vietnamese language Slovenian language Alphabet D'ni language Urdu Brazilian Portuguese Kanji R__maji Wolof language Gbe languages Scots language French verbs

do you like germans and why i was always wondering about this as an austrian girl i've been living in the states for many years now and all the people here have been so nice and kind to me always i can olny say positive things so far but what do american people really think of germans and why and do you have any german friends i am american and i like germans and of course austrians i have known several germans and they were all incredibly nice people who were always willing to help me or a friend i can't speak for all germans but the ones i knew were all very educated intelligent and understanding people most of all they had a great sense of humor which was really fun actually i speak some german and am thinking of getting a minor in the german language i have nothing against germany i like their culture especially their musical and literary heritage although i have no prejudice against germans i know for a fact that some americans do i think it is a shame that one of my german teachers a woman who was almost nice to a fault was treated with disrespect by the head of the language department and a coworker because she was german yes the comment they made was german specific that is wrong disappointing and only showed their ignorance on another note last year a friend of mine who is mexican went to berlin for a month to attend a language school she told me she felt very safe there and that everybody was helpful and nice to her i agree with sam s a large amount of the germans who are alive today had nothing to do with wwii and i think it's sad that they feel so much self hatred just because they're german and dwell on it feeling self hatred for things you had nothing to do with is not a healthy or happy way to go about life  Negima Asperger syndrome Transactional analysis Pitaten Reality Social rule Infantilism Theodor Adorno Novel Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ranma __ characters Homophobia Rudolf Steiner Cultural relativism Austria Alcoholics Anonymous Abortion debate One Piece minor characters Invader Zim Current teachings of Prem Rawat Nancy Witcher Astor Friends The Apprentice 2 W.I.T.C.H.

in english possesive of words ending in s this seems to come up most often with proper nouns so for example let's take the name james to make it possesive is it james' or james's which is correct also how would you pronounce it properly when speaking would it sound like 'james' or 'james es' actually both of these forms are correct it's just a matter of personal preference when it comes to which one you should use personally i like james's because that double 's' serves as a reminder that you're talking about the possessive of the word james when speaking you should definitely pronounce it 'james es ' if you're talking about the house of the james family and you just say the james' house some people might get confused to avoid this say 'james es ' hope that helps  English plural Hypercorrection Greek language Apostrophe (mark) Gender-neutral language English grammar International Phonetic Alphabet Non-native pronunciations of English Korean language Bulgarian language Slovak language Finnish language Latin alphabet Hong Kong English Gerund Sindarin Dutch language Sesotho language Names of God in Judaism Vulgar Latin Romanian language Japanese language Hangul Grammatical number Spanish pronouns Finnish grammar Indonesian language Danish language Brazilian Portuguese Webster's Dictionary Dutch grammar Scottish Gaelic language Jehovah Georgian language New Zealand English English language Spanish verbs Esperanto grammar American and British English differences Indian English Old English language Punctuation Pleonasm Written Cantonese Hiberno-English Chinglish Agreement (linguistics) Japanese name Diaeresis Hungarian language Southern American English Taiwanese (linguistics) Armenian language Ojibwe language Shit Finnish phonology Czech language Tetragrammaton Arabic grammar Diacritic Mispronunciation Grammatical gender Kapampangan language Burmese language Polish language French grammar Quotation mark English as an additional language Hebrew language Egyptian language Singlish D'ni language Sanskrit Serbo-Croatian language Standard Cantonese Quebec French T-V distinction Old French Lojban Noun Javanese language Spanish nouns Aramaic language Thai language Italian grammar Varieties of Arabic Arabic alphabet History of the English Bible Proto-Indo-European language Adjective Albanian language Italian language Leet Family name Appeal Gender Shibboleth Middle English Phoneme Vishnu sahasranama

if you've ever taken a latin course if so how and why the course was beneficial to you is there any in specific you remember from the course thank you yes i have taken latin before and found it to be highly rewarding it helped my english vocabulary and grammar immensely and i am able to read some awesome literature it also teaches you to think more logically and it teaches you to be more precise when it comes to words and language scientific and medical professionals will find the vocabulary useful as well and greek too it was also easier to gain a strong foundation in latin than it was in other languages i have studied you will actually come a long way in just one or two semesters so you will feel like you are making real progress relatively quickly the main downside is that there is little direct application as you will not be learning to speak it in a typical class the focus is on reading it's a fun language and i highly recommend it  Esperanto as an international language German language Latin Second language acquisition Russian language A Course In Miracles English language Grammar Spanish language Greek language Graduate school Autism Dutch language Literature Chinese language Vocabulary Ontology (computer science) Education in the United States Romanian language Vietnamese language Esperanto Hungarian language Multilingual Hindi Neuro-linguistic programming Inflection Education in Romania Portuguese language History of Esperanto Mnemonic Constructed language Scientology beliefs and practices Catalan language Science French language Esperanto vocabulary Swedish language English grammar Taiwanese (linguistics) Interlingua Irish language Computer science Dialect Sanskrit Japanese language Mathematics Slovak language Medicine History of the English Bible Bengali language Linguistics Ukrainian language Esperanto and Interlingua compared Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Persian language Classical Chinese P__li Germanic languages Manually Coded English Latin spelling and pronunciation Non-native pronunciations of English Grammatical gender Proto-Germanic language Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Historical linguistics Hanja Vulgar Latin New Latin Occitan language Anglo-Norman language Cornish language Physician Old English language Education in the People's Republic of China Independent school (UK) Middle English Lojban Stuttering Church of Christ, Scientist Etruscan language Auslan Translation Basque language Anti-intellectualism English as an additional language Egyptian language Mandarin (linguistics) Object-oriented programming Italian language Indian English Korean language Sexual orientation Perl American and British English differences Yiddish language African American Vernacular English Euro

british accents do you have some trouble to understand each other hi i was wondering if english people have some trouble to understand scottish people or welsh people and mutually definitely yes some accents in the british isles are very strong with specific regional dialect words that are not commonly known outside the area where they are used i find it can be very difficult to understand the broad geordie newcastle tyneside ne england the glasgow accent can be complete gobbledegook to every one except another glaswegian i once had a girlfriend from east wall dublin a charming irish coleen but i would get rather embarrassed when i'd ask her for the third time to repeat what she had just said because i could not understand her accent and the belfast dialect 'wadeeowdynaee' can be translated as 'what do i do now' to end there is the famous cockney accent from east london with its rhyming slang and the sing song liverpuddlian accent from liverpool that is delightful to hear but sometime very difficult to understand eg 'gorra cob onyer avyer ' can be translated as 'are you in a bad mood ' this rich variety of british accents may be disappearing to be replaced by 'estuary english' heard on british tv the 't' has been completey abolished 'b er' for 'better' etc and the short anomatopaeic anglo saxon words are becoming much more popular in every day speech a living language changes but i hope the rich variety of regional british accents will survive  English English English language American English Geordie Languages in the United Kingdom Australian English Hiberno-English United Kingdom Cockney West Country dialects Germanic languages Cockney rhyming slang Old English language Non-native pronunciations of English Southern American English History of the English language German language Mandarin (linguistics) Dutch language Swedish language Slang Quebec French Standard Mandarin Ulster Scots language Dialect New York-New Jersey English Danish language Celt English-language vowel changes before historic r Greek language British Isles Irish language Singlish New Zealand English British English Polish language Yorkshire dialect and accent Varieties of Arabic British Isles (terminology) Scottish Gaelic language American and British English differences Esperanto Dictionary Northern Ireland Scouse Subjunctive mood Trap-bath split Boston accent Dialects of Mandarin Glasgow Chinese spoken language Offensive terms per nationality Acute accent Languages in Star Wars Welsh language Wales South Tyneside African American Vernacular English Scots language Slovak language Formal written English - regional differences Portuguese language Cornish language Wars of the Three Kingdoms South East England Newfoundland English Scanger Brummie Sanskrit Culture of the United Kingdom Australian English phonology Slovenian language Anglo-Saxon literature Standard Cantonese Old Norse language Canadian English French language Hindustani language Hungarian language Spanish language Grave accent Proto-Germanic language Hebrew language Welsh English Arabic language Newcastle United F.C.

what language should i study now just studied spanish i'm thinking either german french or chinese other ones russian japanese arabic german and french are used widely throughout the european continent after english they are the de facto languages of the eu either of those would be worthwhile personally i recommend german it's widely spoken in both west and east europe including ex soviet republics whereas french is limited a little bit more to west europe arabic is supposedly extremely easy to learn to speak but extremely difficult to learn to write it can be a very useful language however and has an immense vocabulary that lends itself to flowery poetic language you will also be able to communicate with most of the muslim world including many african and south asian countries if you know arabic japanese and chinese are reputedly difficult both to speak and write but would be very useful russian is difficult but not terribly so the biggest jump is not the new alphabet which is admittedly hard to pick up especially as russian words tend to get really long but all the case endings there are like of them and they all start to blur together after a while russian also has obscure pronunciation rules like english does so what a word looks like is not always what it will sound like  German language Non-native pronunciations of English Russian language Chinese language Spanish language Arabic language Esperanto as an international language Esperanto Latin alphabet Dutch language Finnish language Japanese language Africa Cyrillic alphabet Arabic alphabet Afrikaans Korean language Nationalism Urdu Jewish languages Ukrainian language Hebrew language Tatar language Diacritic Germanic languages Portuguese language Old English language Vowel Alphabet Central Asia Hindi Taiwanese (linguistics) Vietnamese language French language Polish language Danish language Varieties of Arabic Russia Languages in the United States Pinyin Keyboard layout Linguistics Aramaic language Mutually intelligible languages Phoneme Creole language Languages of Hong Kong Greek language Romanization Interlingua Japanese writing system Simplified Chinese character Turkic peoples Chinese character Coptic language Grammatical gender Speech synthesis English as a lingua franca for Europe Egyptian language Classical Chinese Cantonese (linguistics) Standard Mandarin Kanji Jew Standard Cantonese United Nations Security Council Tatars Persian language Indonesian language Spelling reform Passport Belarusian language Translation Dictionary Chinese written language Hanja Old French Slovenian language Ido England Singapore Arab world Basque language Transliteration African American Vernacular English Black (people) Norwegian language English English Latin spelling and pronunciation International Phonetic Alphabet Poetry Swedish language Lingua franca

why is standard english referred to as correct or proper english standard english is only correct or proper according to standard english and those who prefer it why are so many people willing to accept new word formation as long as the new words are considered to be a part of standard english while criticizing sub languages dialects of english you're confusing standard with correct this is what i don't understand why is standard referred to as correct what does gangsta have to do with anything urban vernacular english is only one dialect what about canadian english is that incorrect okay standard english like most standards are only dialects the only issue is that they are considered the upper class or scholarly dialects for example british rp recieved pronounciation was right out of oxford college standard american has two forms it has the form which was from children growing up in different parts of the country and thusly not developing one true regional dialect but a more general one it also has the form which came from the upper class and was dictated by universities and such from the major cities the problem is standard doesn't like to be challenged or changed in fact they don't even think of themselves as a dialect though they are that's why they made it to be considered the only correct way to say it luckily no one large gives in to it and keeps regional dialects remember that dialects like languages have their own set of rules which they have to obey otherwise communication is lost and the whole point of language is communication german is like this as well the standard is called hochdeutsch high german and it's primarily in the south but plattdeutsch low german is heard in the north and sometimes one needs to know both remember those that speak the standard have the power so they will belittle the lesser dialects but linguists like myself know better and we promote dialects as long as communication is still there if it's not then we have another language almost hope that helps you can contact me if you want more on it  German language Dialect English language Non-native pronunciations of English Dutch language Standard Mandarin American and British English differences American English Chinese language Newfoundland English Standard Cantonese Serbo-Croatian language Taiwanese (linguistics) English plural High Germanic languages International English Greek language Cantonese (linguistics) Inuktitut Regional accents of English speakers African American Vernacular English Tone (linguistics) Indian English Multilingual Mandarin (linguistics) South Slavic languages Slovak language Spanish language Germanic languages Hebrew language Vowel Standard language Hindustani language Russian language Danish language Gender-neutral language Swedish language Croatian language Philosophy of language Arabic language Swiss German Yiddish language Romanian language Mispronunciation Afrikaans Sanskrit Norwegian language Bulgarian language Korean language Southern American English Old English language Slavic languages Aramaic language Shtokavian dialect Quebec French Languages in the United States Finnish language New York-New Jersey English Austrian German Thai language High German consonant shift Italian language Differences in official languages in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia Jamaican English Spanish dialects and varieties Grammar Portuguese Creole Low German languages Webster's Dictionary Names given to the Spanish language Languages in the United Kingdom Manually Coded English Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Diglossia Alemannic German Spanish pronouns Urdu Hangul Written Cantonese Linguistics English English History of the English Bible Athabaskan languages Political correctness British English Hindi Ukrainian language Tamil language

anybody that can write in chinese if you could is there anyway u could write stay true to yourself and take a pic and post it what you are wanting to say is not easy to express in chinese probably the best way to say it would be something like respect yourself or something near to that there is no way to express the idea of being true to someone even the idea of honesty as we understand it is hard to express unfortunately the chinese mind set does not allow for this sort of thing to be correctly expressed in the language and even if you could it would not be understood in the meaning that you are trying to convey rather it would be taken something more like the idea of spoil yourself take care of yourself or pamper yourself the chinese have not gotten to the point socially to be concerned about others enough to have to worry about not being true to themselves basically they are the most important person to themselves it would almost be better for them to learn to be true to others the cultures are too different  Philosophy of language Chinese language Confucius Simplified Chinese character Ethics Chinese character Liang Qichao Truth Deconstruction Meaning Religious pluralism Confucianism Social psychology Cultural relativism Socrates Infantilism Psychoanalysis Mantra Japanese language Meaning of life Lie Philosophy of mathematics Writing system G__del's incompleteness theorem Theory of conduct Alan Watts Logic History of philosophy Art Reality Chinese written language Goodness and value theory Epistemology Writing Universal pragmatics Scientology beliefs and practices John Locke Philosophy Drama Gender role Japanese honorifics Sense and reference Multilingual Simone Weil The Book of Five Rings Numerology Tao Te Ching Science Martial art Infant baptism Buddhism Irony Phoneme Identity Alcoholics Anonymous Culture Singlish Rudolf Hermann Lotze Social rule Natural deduction Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Franz Boas Randomness Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Chinese martial arts Cultural Revolution Phaedo Transformation problem Chinese spoken language Extreme Programming African philosophy Chinese grammar XML I Ching Python programming language Classical music era Dog training A Course In Miracles Hearing impairment Donald Davidson (philosopher) Love Cantonese (linguistics) Causality Japanese poetry Sign (semiotics) Polyamory Scientific method Noam Chomsky Coercion Tone (linguistics) BASIC programming language Hangul Culture of China Body language Internet slang Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India John Wycliffe Artificial consciousness Autism
