how to use a hand net in fishing as i gain more experience fishing i am finding that i am loathe to actually use my hand net although several of the species i am catching really begin to fight after i pull them from the water and netting them would be ideal what i end up with is a terrible tangled mess the fish struggles for a bit and the two treble hooks get hopelessly caught in the net mesh i have spent ten minutes trying to unsnag everything causing possible harm to the fish and sometimes necessitating my snipping small parts of the net what am i doing wrong suggestions when i land a fish i wait til it gets tired out some and when i use a lure with treble hooks i hold the net in one and and my pole in the other and just pull the fish into the boat with the net underneath just in case he or she spits the hook and then it can just fall in to the net if that does by chance happen  Fishing Seine (fishing) Trawling Catch and release Angling Suplex Big-game fishing Spider Boxing Fly fishing Poker jargon Gillnet Happy Tree Friends Trapping Professional wrestling holds Common Fisheries Policy Professional wrestling match types Leatherback Sea Turtle Professional wrestling throws Fishery Aerial (dance move) Kitesurfing Animal Crossing USS Thresher (SS-200) Snooker Trolling for fish Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Drowning 2000 Australian Grand Prix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Antarctic krill Dinghy Tag RuneScape Random Events Social rule The Contender (television series) Striped bass Mixed martial arts Characters in the Smurfs Coral reef Seabird Smelt Great Lakes The Old Man and the Sea Operation Market Garden Inuit Flax Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fish Penalty (ice hockey) Salmon Albatross Abortion debate Loudspeaker Second Battle of the Atlantic USS Tunny (SS-282) Aquaman Fly lure Shaggy dog story Remora Textile manufacturing Drill bit Bladderwort Coelacanth Clef Paddlefish Marine aquarium Manual transmission Whitebait Mega Man VII Time Out of Mind Whale song Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish Anchor Magnet 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Turbot War Bocas del Toro Province Water polo Patrick Star Shark Menstrual cup Gordon Banks The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Professional wrestling attacks Jaws (film) Fire fighting Mosquito Carnivorous plant Ice hockey Lakitu Blood on the Tracks Dragon boat Avalanche Captain Thunderbolt Badminton Sailing Elis Prefecture Eldfell Chinese White Dolphin

could i stock striped bass in my backyard freshwater river there are freshwater striped bass in lakes and whatnot and i'm thinking of stocking some cuz they get huge what habitat do they like warm water or cold structure with weeds how deep does the water have to be granted there are stripers in lakes but remember that the fish are landlocked and the lakes that they were stocked in were also stocked with gizzard shad as forage fish i e lake wallenpaupack raystown lake beltzville res a striped bass is a anodromous fish meaning that it lives in saltwater and spawns in fresh water stocking them in a freshwater stream is not a good idea because they will head downstream until they hit the ocean or an impoundment if stocking them in a pond you would not be able to keep enough forage for them last but not least der would not be too pleased  Striped bass Sockeye salmon Dam Fly fishing Lake Water (molecule) Fish Fish farming Salmon Australian bass Lake Erie Largemouth bass Shrimp farm Water resources Lake Texoma Aquaculture Coast Seema Eastern Freshwater Cod Carp Hackensack River Atlantic salmon Trout Dead Sea Yosemite National Park Atlantic herring Golden Perch Rainbow trout Seabird Fishing Zambezi Blackfish Smelt Albatross Nerpa Landlocked Chinook salmon St. Johns River Stream Fish migration Angling Muskellunge Marine biology Geology of the Grand Canyon area Lamprey Marine aquarium Lake Burley Griffin Water Zebra Danio Brown Trout Eel life history Great Salt Lake Aquifer Lake trout Brook trout Geography of Russia Yenisei River Geography of Africa Ecology Geography of Japan Murray Cod Atlantic Ocean Lake Vostok Fauna of Australia Columbia River Blue catfish Tlingit River Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Perch Saltwater Crocodile Macquarie Perch Sawfish (fish) Jamaica Bay Drowning Freshwater angelfish International waters Biology of the Sierra Nevada Crocodile Trout Cod Rhine Effects of global warming Mystic River Dolphin Swiss plateau Pink salmon Rift Valley lakes Pennsylvania History of Victoria Black sea bass Sturgeon Saltwater intrusion Amazon River Osmosis Global 200 Hydropower Crayfish Diving locations

using a fixed spool i have just started fishing with my wife we recently bought a rod and reel the reel is an lc we seem to have a problem loading it and castingm the line has been loaded we think correctly but when i go to cast it does not release it is really tight the bail arm is up i am not sure where the line is supposed to be in relation to the bail arm inside outside is it supposed to be wrapped around anything if it is on the spool the wrong way can we cahnge it around many thanks the line should come out under the bail under a little roller when the bail is closed to cast you hold the line with your right forefinger open the bail and swing the rod forwards releasing the line from your finger just before the rod is pointing straight up once you've cast out you turn the handle the bail will snap closed and you can wind the line back in if you wound the line on the spool yourself by cranking the reel it's loaded correctly assuming you put a little tension on the line if it's loose on the spool it won't work well at all also by the way spinning reels are held underneath the rod with the base between the middle and ring fingers of your right hand some beginners try to use them on top of the rod like a bait casting reel and this is awkward to say the least  Fishing reel Professional wrestling holds Fly fishing Fishing rod Movie projector Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Glossary of climbing terms Wire Swingout Textile manufacturing Fast bowling Horizontal bar Lawn mower Suplex Equine conformation Anchor Timpani Knife Glossary of American football Parachute Side pass (dance move) Heckler & Koch G3 Violin Angling Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Poker jargon Harp Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling attacks Guitar Double bass Revolver Car handling Internal ballistics VHS Boxing Eye Archery Strap-on dildo Hawker Hurricane Skateboarding trick Trolling for fish Connecting rod Butterfly stroke Wheel of Fortune Craps Recumbent bicycle Roller coaster Diabolo Glossary of nautical terms Laws of cricket Wicket Screw Heinkel He 100 Neckbreaker Happy Tree Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Slot machine Avenue Q Figure skating Snooker Gesture M60 machine gun Puppet St. Louis Cardinals Clarinet Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Hydraulic machinery Sling (weapon) Rod Stewart RuneScape Random Events 8-track cartridge Front crawl Dodge Neon System/34 Reel Lindy Basic Sailing Electric motor Softball Bullet Audio tape length and thickness Blooper American football Cessna T-37 Wind turbine Drag racing RuneScape quests System/36 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Backstroke Breaststroke The Midnight Sun

have you ever try fishing before what are some of the things you learn from fishing me and my family go fishing all the time we don't fish to keep them and eat them we always throw back what we catch it's just the fun of trying to catch them what have i learned well it teaches you alot of patience because you throw the line out there and you have to be quiet and wait quit awhile to get a bite so you have to be patient it can teach you alot of hand eye cordination because if you want to throw your line in a certain spot you have to aim it that way thats a few things i've learned  Spidey Super Stories Social rule Milton H.

what's the biggest fish you can land with lb line i'm just getting started fishing and i'm curious how you decide what size line to use i know it doesn't have to equal the weight of the fish but i've never heard any rules of thumb on what strength line to use usually your reel will tell you it can accept sizes up to say lb for a number to work with the heavier the line the more difficult it is to handle easily it won't cast as well it will tangle more easily and it will not be as sensitive to the bite keep in mind though it depends on what your fishing for i usually stay around lb test line but when i am fishing for big strippers or big catfish i change to a heavier line you my need to have a bigger reel for this also a heavier rod especially if you are ocean fishing it can be a little expensive to have all the equipment for all the possible fishing experiances you may encounter back to the question it is possible to catch a pound fish on pound test line you have to set your drag and play them out till they are tired enough to reel in only problem is if they run and you don't have enough line on the reel to slow them down before they hit the end i have many rods and reels for different types of fishing but for fun i love to catch a bass or any nice fish on an ultra light with pound test it's exciting and fun  Fishing rod Slot machine Movie projector Avenue Q Drag racing Angling Explosive material Big-game fishing Kitesurfing Drill bit 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fishing Lawn mower Fast bowling Badminton Striped bass Social rule Anchor Tag CPU cache M60 machine gun Car handling Poker jargon Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Indianapolis 500 B-47 Stratojet Weight training Knife Equine conformation Fishing reel M16 (rifle) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie RuneScape Random Events English cricket team Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Nuclear reactor Timpani Coming of Age (TNG episode) Radio controlled airplane Reel Big Fish Diving Welding It's Walky!

fishing question my husband tells me when a fish swallows a hook and we have to cut it off that the hook dissolves and the fish is fine is that true or is he trying to make me feel better or did somebody lie to him it's true i only freshwater fish for bass but if i deep hook a fish i do not even mess with the hook this is to keep from doing anymore damage than i have already done i just cut the line about in outside of it's mouth it will rust the hook out in a few days it might not eat during that time but it has a far better chance of living than if you pulled on it's guts i have had more fish die on me by hooking them in their tongue than deep hooking them i fish competitively and i have kept some deep hooked fish and did what i said to do and they lived all day and swam off after i let them go but every fish i have hooked under the tongue has went belly up in a few hours or minutes  Trolling for fish Fishing Angling Happy Tree Friends Leviathan Drowning Striped bass Fugu Pok__mon Abilities Fly fishing Shark Tetrapod Dinghy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jellyfish Link (Legend of Zelda) Tooth Seine (fishing) Sawfish (fish) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Nile crocodile Megadeth Diving Poker jargon Whale Shaggy dog story USS Thresher (SS-200) Knife Oral sex Tlingit Kodocha Big-game fishing Professional wrestling holds Old wives' tale Tongue Benjamin Hooks Snake Jaws (film) Lake Joy Division (band) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Mixed martial arts Boxing training Catch and release Piranha New Order Myxobolus cerebralis Lake Burley Griffin Aerial (dance move) Boxing Leatherback Sea Turtle Kenny McCormick Sushi Time Out of Mind Deluge (mythology) Dolphin Johnny 5 Chinook salmon Bocas del Toro Province Albert Fish The Amber Spyglass Frog USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Ice fishing Patrick Star New Morning Smelt Atlantic herring Gas bladder Jon Secada USS Flying Fish (SS-229) Humpback Whale Snooker Antarctic krill Fly lure Sport fishing USS Threadfin (SS-410) Tuatara Tony Galento Oily fish Tanya Donelly Lamprey Tofu United Airlines Flight 93 History of swimming Suplex USS Tang (SS-306) One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish Wire Harp Walleye Grunion Seppuku Mercury 4 Aquarium Gar 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Harp Seal Charles Peace

whats the best bait to use for carp fishing in your own experience please thanks in advance the bait that catches the most fish is probably bread followed by maggots and worms you ask about carp baits well boilies have accounted for millions of carp on lakes rivers and reservoirs all over briton but as to what type without knowing where your fishing what the stock levels and general conditions are it would be a brave man to put his faith in one bait if you have reasonable access time and money maybe you could prebait certain swims with a shop brought boilie for say a week and then concentrate your efforts on these spots using a presoaked boilie or a washed out boilie if i only had one choice it would be richworths tutti fruti frozen boiliess with washed out cut down bottom baits on the hair rig free running leads an ever thing pinned down hard to the bottom good luck and tight lines  Fishing Lake Burley Griffin Angling 1957 World Series Great Lakes Lake Carp Fish farming Flathead catfish Computer virus Trolling for fish Toilet Trapping Blue catfish Fly fishing Teen Girl Squad New York Giants Dam Neopets Animal Crossing Poker jargon Salmon Myxobolus cerebralis Brewery Murray River Whale Tlingit Krill Koi 613 mitzvot Anchor Fishing rod Whitebait Water Make money fast RuneScape quests Windows XP Sauna Albatross Advance fee fraud Lake Erie Channel catfish Andrew Carnegie Glossary of nautical terms Water (molecule) Oily fish Grand Calumet River Eutrophication MapleStory Erie Canal Gaia Online Catch and release Seabird RuneScape Random Events Shrimp farm RuneScape locations Atlanta metropolitan area Geology of the Grand Canyon area Babe Ruth Professional wrestling slang Glossary of American football God Emperor of Dune The Life and Times of Juniper Lee 2005 World Series Economy of Russia Livestock Flounder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mad Money RuneScape skills Great Depression Knife Electrophysiology Smelt Aquaculture Common carp Experiment Professional wrestling holds Water purification Pete Sampras Aquarium Seine (fishing) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Economy of India Ice fishing Bernard Williams Feet washing Orca Prostate cancer Lighting Philip J.

what is the best fly pattern this time of year i know people say match the hatch but i dont know what the hatch is a link to a good pattern would be great p s i live in nh if that makes a difference living in nh the majority of your major hatches are over depending on the quality of the stream you may see some tricos and blue wing olives early in the morning and isonychias and golden stoneflys late in the day you may also have a white fly hatch at the end of the month caddis will abound all throughout the summer but they will be sporadic east coast trout fishing in the summer can be tough i live in pa due to the streams being gin clear and with genreally much less volume of water than the spring that's not to say you can't catch fish this is terrestrial time ant patterns both black and cinnamon griffith's gnat foam beatles i'm partial to the ones tied using peacock herl olive crackleback a good attractor pattern and a small adams parachute should take fish i also carry a generic white mayfly pattern with me as well as some small elk hair caddis and i never leave home without having some small bwo cdc comparaduns head out early in the morning and stalk the stream looking for risers it's not so much the pattern but the presentation i usually start out with an ant pattern if i don't see any tricos caddis or blue wing olives be observant try to see what the fish are rising for if you don't see any caddis blue wings or tricos there probably rising to terrestrials i would advise using a ft leader tapered to x or x on a or wt rod and make your casts count i've been doing this a long time and believe me trout are unforgiving in skinny water a cast where your line slaps the water and you may as well head upstream looking for another fish evening fishing can be fun if there is a hatch of iso's because they are generally large size and easy to see a chocolate comparadun is a good pattern for them if you see some stoneflys stimulator patterns work well don't be afraid of twitching the stimulator on the water you may get some vicious strikes when fishing these larger flys in the evening you can trim back you leader to ' and use a heavier tippet so you can see there is a difference between morning and evening normally the first hours of daylight are productive stoneflys iso's and the white fly won't come off until the last hour or so of the day but you may see some other activity prior to that if you want to fish subsurface i would look for the deepest parts of the stream and probe them with wooly buggers and nymphs check w your local flyshop they should carry the patterns i mentioned and should be able to tell you what hatches are on your local stream hope this helps and tight lines  Trout Fly fishing Daylight saving time USS Ammen (DD-527) Macquarie Perch Charles Cotton USS Tunny (SS-282) Bird migration Casting Insect Wood Angling Textile manufacturing Murray Cod Poker jargon Fishing rod Salmon Paragliding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Capercaillie Mercury Atlas 6 USS S-35 (SS-140) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Sea-Monkey Tai shogi Sand casting Mattress Hebrew calendar Knife Taikyoku shogi USS Trout (SS-202) USS Thresher (SS-200) CPU cache RuneScape quests Tide Fixed-wing aircraft Bladderwort STS-59 Hampshire County, West Virginia Fly Humpback Whale Diving Parachuting IND Chrystie Street Connection Ant Great Lakes 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Seine (fishing) International League Glacier National Park (US) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Climate of the United Kingdom Stream Equine conformation Operation Market Garden Cat 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Ron and Fez USS Alden (DD-211) Comanche Extraterrestrial skies Transit of Venus Color Peafowl Colours, standards and guidons Aerial (dance move) USS Seadragon (SS-194) Antenna (radio) Mayfly Radio controlled airplane USS Wasp (CV-18) Platypus Television in the United States Parachute Bee The Den (television) Oasis (band) New York Rangers Fish farming Baseball Eldfell RuneScape economy Leopard USS Waters (DD-115) Toronto Blue Jays Buckingham Palace Lake Burley Griffin
