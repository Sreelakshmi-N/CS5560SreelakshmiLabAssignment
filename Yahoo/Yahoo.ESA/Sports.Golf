on a golf telecast with the camera behind the player the ball always appears to go to the right why two answers if the camera is truly directly behind the golfer then s he is drawing the ball for a right hander towards the target a draw is like playing a baby hook on purpose contrarily if the ball appeared to go left at impact when the camera is directly behind a right handed golfer then the golfer is hitting a cut baby slice if the camera is actually a little off center meaning to the viewer's right for the right handed golfer but still behind the golfer then it's the illusion of two dimensional television keep in the mind that while the ball appears to be going to the right in reality it is travelling away and up from its original position but on tv it appears to be going to the right and up even if the camera was off center and a right handed golfer was hitting a cut the ball would still appear to be going to the right now if the camera zoomed out so you could see the entire ball flight which would be very difficult considering the size of the ball the angle from the ball to its right when it rises wouldn't be as significant this is simply because you are further away from the ball of course none of this says anything about a shank  Golf Golf glossary Snooker Golf club (equipment) Billiards Table tennis Baseball Volleyball Fast bowling Caddy View camera Tennis Glossary of American football Ryder Cup Disc golf Mouse (computing) IMAX Water polo Seishun Academy Middle School Four square Greg Norman Softball Field hockey Deep Impact (space mission) Digital photography Tiger Woods Cricket The Big Break Leg before wicket Eight ball Major League Baseball television contracts Golf ball Vin Scully Digital camera Michelle Wie Ben Hogan Sudden death Stereoscopy Photography Bullet Vijay Singh Apollo 8 Magic (illusion) Polo Grounds Hot Shots Golf (series) Katamari Damacy Collision detection Photographic lens Sprite (computer graphics) Resident Evil 4 Golf handicap Anchor Oscilloscope Bad Wolf Combine (Half-Life 2) Wrigley Field Lawrence Whistler Tag Internal ballistics Jack Nicklaus National Football League Pinball Quake III Arena MTV2 GunBound Panoramic photography Laws of cricket Professional golf tours 3D projection Opportunity rover Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Drill bit Nick Faldo Autostereogram Rugby union positions Left-handed American football strategy Anamorphic widescreen Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Starfleet ranks and insignia Reality Sun Coriolis effect Comparison of Canadian and American football Leica Arnold Palmer Helicopter Manifold MLB on FOX Candlepin bowling Bass guitar Bobby Jones (golfer) Surveillance The Open Championship PGA Tour

any tips on increasing distance what are some good ways to increase the distance of your drives what strength training excercises can help improve your swing speed anyone know anything from experience im gunning y and i want more what do i do yes my short game's not too bad either just would like to know how to break y lol improve contact with your driver for every half inch that you hit off the sweet spot of your driver you will lose yards on your tee shot so you can pick up yards by getting inch closer to the sweet spot how does yards without even trying sound find the right height today s cc drivers have a sweet spot that is slightly higher on the club face than the drivers of years gone by to make contact on your new driver s sweet spot you need to tee the ball up high really high the correct height for your driver tee is when at least half of the ball stands above the driver s crown as you address the ball the right tee height will also allow you to have the correct angle of attack and optimize your launch angle more on that later ball position stance width ball position to accommodate your new high tee and to make contact on the right part of your driver you need to make sure that the ball is opposite the inside of your left heel at address most long drive competitors will actually put the ball farther forward than this but for the average golfer this ball position will look very far forward but trust it you will hit the ball farther this way because the driver swing is so fast you need to have a stable base to achieve this stable base i recommend that you take your stance slightly wider than shoulder width apart this means that the inside of your feet should be slightly outside the width of your shoulders in this position you may feel that you have more weight on your right foot than your left foot if you do that your weight should slightly favor your right hand side if not please be sure to check your alignment watch your alignment when trying this ball position and tee height many golfers compensate by opening their shoulders to the target line if you allow your shoulders to open at address you are risking poor contact and are bringing a slice into play it is imperative that your feet hips and especially your shoulders are parallel to the target line at address to monitor your address position and to perfect this perfect ball position make sure that you set up a practice station at your driving range  Equine conformation Fast bowling Golf club (equipment) Softball Baseball Glossary of American football Swingout Golf glossary Professional wrestling throws Glossary of partner dance terms Swimming Snooker Car handling Internal ballistics Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Billiards Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Archery Pole vault Boxing Skateboarding trick Table tennis Terminal ballistics Parade (military) Shotgun Vegeta Suplex Water polo Rugby union Rugby league Tank American football Backstroke Sailing Tennis Field hockey Weight training Butterfly stroke M16 (rifle) Chair Helicopter Glossary of ballet terms Laws of cricket Eight ball Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling attacks View camera American football strategy Knife Poker jargon Tire Canadian football Rugby union positions Cricket Comparison of Canadian and American football Electrophysiology Gliding Bass guitar Batting (cricket) USS Trigger (SS-237) Wing Chun Curling Disc golf Motorcycle Recumbent bicycle Parachuting Stairway USS Whale (SS-239) Team Fortress Classic CPU cache Anchor Tide Contredanse Double bass Wrigley Field Racquetball Football (soccer) National Football League Lore New York Giants Sniper St. Louis Cardinals High-heeled shoe Violin Breaststroke TGV Rugby league positions ELO rating system Anatomical terms of location Stereoscopy Lindy Basic

is golftec really worth the money this is the place inside the golfsmith stores where they give you golf lessons using machines and computers teaching pros but it's really expensive and i'm wondering if it's worth it i took about lessons and scored a couple freebies along the way from golftec and it made all the difference i was really struggling before the lessons and was faced with a decision to get better or stop playing i was shooting in the range i had been playing for about years and was getting worse my naturally ability and lack of fundamentals ran their course i needed professional help after about months of lessons and serious practice i shot in the s for the next couple of seasons and even broke once on a par my handicap dropped to it's been about three years now since my lessons and my playing time and practice time is significantly less and i'm still shooting in the range my handicap is for me the was well worth it i never knew anything about golf fundamentals before and now i know a little something all that practice time and lessons and drills gave me the ability to figure my swing out now i have some fundamentals i can fall back on whenever things get out of whack before i put band aids on top of band aids without knowing what the problem with my swing was those quick fixes never lasted and eventually compiled to make things worse if you can afford it i highly recommend golftec if you do it i also recommend buying a couple pracitice irons maybe iron iron because you'll be beating them up hard that way you can keep your game set in tact get something with a similar feel and same type of shaft more great things about golftec were i could do the lessons during the off season i live in colorado so even during the winter i could still practice outside in my back yard where i built a practice net and bought a used practice mat there's no wasted time at goftec you show up you strap on the sensors and away you go all the equipment is set up and ready to go a minute lesson is minutes i had a lesson with a crappy teaching pro at a golf course and he was dicking around with all these cameras and equipment and it took minutes just to get the stuff set up waste of my time there are excellent teaching pros out there but this guy was a chump you can view your lessons online they give you drills to work on to mold your swing rather than change your swing to match somebody elses key here is that they mold your swing get ready to get better what's golftec's slogan bring your passion and we'll teach you the rest i have no affiliation with golftec whatsoever i just went through their process and am happy i did  Golf New York Giants Babe Ruth Volleyball Microeconomics Digital photography Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cincinnati Bengals Tennis Professional wrestling match types 1957 World Series Infantilism Go (board game) ELO rating system Golf glossary Golf club (equipment) Professional wrestling holds Second Battle of the Atlantic Strap-on dildo Tiger Woods Japanese tea ceremony Floppy disk Windows XP Perl Casting Fast bowling Professional wrestling throws Java programming language Aerial (dance move) Textile manufacturing Brian Close American football Kurt Angle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ice hockey Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers The Amazing Race Super Bowl XXVII Drill bit Enron Corporation Unreal Equine conformation Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Apple Macintosh Swingout Carolina Panthers GunZ The Duel Computer and video game genres Ty Cobb Crash test dummy IBM PC compatible San Francisco 49ers Baseball Visual Basic Hard disk Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling A Course In Miracles Anchor Heinkel He 112 Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Archery New York Knicks The Big Break Hulk Hogan Norway national football team Ravi Shastri Snowboarding Education in the United States Squash (sport) Timpani Windows Vista Paintball Software engineering Football (soccer) American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Bretton Woods system Bj__rn Borg Denis Law Laws of cricket Pete Sampras Professional wrestling aerial techniques Apple Computer Oscilloscope Shotgun M60 machine gun History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Poker jargon Sailing

what is a good way to get more distance on my drives slowing my swing made it more accurate which translated to more fairways hit and fewer strokes to the green i didn't change grip stance or any other fundamental only swing speed over the course of just one summer season about twelve rounds my overall distance improved dramatically as with martial arts cutting dovetail joints the break in pool or musical skills you can always add a little power when you have accuracy but you can never add accuracy to brute power slowing down the swing allows you to focus on accuracy you also can relax by itself the psychological relaxation of an intentionally slow but accurate swing really improves your enjoyment and ability to re groove your game the only reasons you should try this advice is because it is free it worked for me and every pro player recommends it to amateurs who want to improve really just slow down for a season see what happens  Golf Fast bowling Tai Chi Chuan Golf club (equipment) Mixed martial arts Volleyball Parachuting Aikido Chinese martial arts Baseball Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Drag racing Internal ballistics Half-Life: Opposing Force Tiger Woods Tank Equine conformation Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Tennis Batting (cricket) Swimming Turok: Rage Wars M16 (rifle) Snooker Poker jargon Sling (weapon) Backstroke Wing Chun Boxing Billiards Andr__s Galarraga Babe Ruth Norway national football team CPU cache Lindy Hop Knife Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pump It Up Professional wrestling throws In The Groove (game) Radar Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Alex Ferguson Rifle RuneScape weapons Lightsaber combat Violin Motorcycle Weight training Archery Toronto Raptors Michelle Wie World Series Swingout Butterfly stroke Action potential SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Capoeira Baseball Stars Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Anchor Anti-aircraft warfare Taekwondo GunBound Martial art Diablo II Formula One regulations Leica Team Fortress Classic Batting average Freedom Force (computer game) View camera Types of bowlers in cricket Sniper Terminal ballistics Unreal Revolver Pole vault Pittsburgh Steelers Computer chess Timpani Linked list Detroit Tigers Neurofeedback Protoss M60 machine gun Fuzion Slow Train Coming Marathon (computer game) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Twelve leverage points Playoff format Guild Wars New York Giants Knight Rider Oakland Athletics Chicago Bulls

when using practice golf balls i just got some practice golf balls they are the hallow plastic ones with holes all over like a wiffle ball or a ping pong ball how far should i be hitting these what is the ration of distence between these and real balls how far would i need to hit one of these for it to compare to yards with a real ball you'll figure out the relation once you hit them for a while you'll know when you're hitting them solid instead of relating the practice ball distance to a real ball distance you might consider the opposite relate a real ball distance to the practice ball distance for example if you hit your pw yds with a real ball and find out you only hit a practice ball yds that's a to ratio see if that ratio holds up for all your clubs ultimately you want to maintain your yardages hitting a real golf ball doesn't matter how far you hit practice balls on a windy day you can forget about it the main purpose of those practice balls is to see your ball flight and keep your swing tuned practice balls will slice and hook draw and fade just like a real ball but exaggerated i wouldn't spend too much time hitting those practice balls just enough to keep the rust off your swing there's no substitution for the real thing  Golf Golf glossary Fast bowling Caddy Golf club (equipment) Tennis Table tennis Laws of cricket Golf ball American football Swimming Billiards Glossary of American football Croquet Baseball Cricket Football (soccer) Disc golf Plastic Ben Hogan Volleyball Batting (cricket) Field hockey Baseball statistics Archery Shotgun John Daly (golfer) Olympic Club Snooker Microeconomics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Double the Fist Softball Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology Michelle Wie Knife Eight ball Mouse (computing) Baseball Stars C-5 Galaxy Collision detection Terminal ballistics Sniper Vin Scully Circuit design Passer rating Transistor West Indian cricket team Babe Ruth Jon Secada Rathfarnham Bicycle Pinball Batting average Origins of baseball Beer Pong Satchel Paige Floorball Helicopter Rugby union positions Bullet Four square Hazeltine National Golf Club Major League Baseball television contracts Strap-on dildo Planetary orbit Piccolo Junior Saga Lucille Ball Light-emitting diode Lee Trevino USS Tunny (SS-282) Water polo Laws of the Game History of computer and video games Ultimate (sport) Anchor Magnus effect American football strategy Scale model Internal ballistics Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Mahjong Club (weapon) Solar cell Lindy Hop Swing bowling Pitcher Trigonometric function Rugby union Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Peter Shilton Hank Aaron Tee Roxette Soccer AM Rounders Rose (Doctor Who)

is this a good set of clubs i recently got a new set of northwestern clubs i was looking into them i was wondering is this a good brand ohhh looking some of these answers i should get new clubs lol depends on what you hope to accomplish northwestern is a fine set for a beginner but if you want to get serious about your game go with a brand like titleist taylor made callaway nike etc if you are serious i would also recommend going to a respected retailer like edwin watts to be fitted properly and to take advantage of their indoor testing range dick's sporting goods has this too further ask to demo a set of clubs that you tried at the store and felt comfortable with after a couple rounds on the range or the course you'll most certainly come to an easy decision about which set is best for you  Department store Golf club (equipment) Bicycle Sears Holdings Corporation Sport Strap-on dildo Curling Equine conformation Bicycle lighting Light-emitting diode Milwaukee, Wisconsin Football (soccer) Squash (sport) Violin Mattress Radio controlled airplane Nike, Inc.

im a new golfer and am not very good at all how can i improve i dont want to spend all the money to go all the time and my yard isnt big enough for hitting golf balls around yes buying the wiffle balls is a great idea but you should start with your short game it is the most important the short game consist of approach chipping pitching and putting you can practice your approach by placing an object in your yard and hitting the ball trying to get close to the hole and you should move it every once in a while so your not just stuck on one area chipping pitching are closer than your approach so you want to move up and practice not hitting it to hard chipping has no resemblance to a swing it is a putting motion pitching is a half swing and now last but not least putting now putting can either make you or break you a local course should have a putting green that you could use a good drill is that you get two real golf balls and putt one out and with the other try and get it as close as you can keep on doing this and you'll be really good after accomplishing this you can work on your tee shots and fairway wood shots i hope you find this helpful all this stuff is recent cause i'm taking lessons with a pro right now good luck  Golf glossary Fast bowling Baseball Stars Tom Watson (golfer) Poker jargon Baseball Tiger Woods Snooker Craps Caddy Billiards The Golf Channel The Big Break Cricket Pitcher Riviera Country Club 1957 World Series Batting (cricket) Softball Glossary of American football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 American football Volleyball Babe Ruth Rugby league Cleveland Browns Table tennis Shotgun Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Ryder Cup Laws of cricket Michelle Wie Mouse (computing) Ben Hogan Lee Trevino The Open Championship Greg Norman Fielding (cricket) Croquet Hazeltine National Golf Club Origins of baseball John Daly (golfer) Tag Pittsburgh Steelers Betting (poker) GunBound St. Louis Cardinals New York Giants Pinball Baltusrol Golf Club Textile manufacturing Tee Sandy Koufax English cricket team Knife New England Patriots Andre Agassi American football strategy Professional wrestling slang Indian Oil Cup 2005 2004 American League Championship Series Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 RISC Lindy Hop History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Cricket pitch 1986 National League Championship Series Arnold Palmer Ty Cobb Rugby union positions 2004 World Series Paintball Clarinet Hot Shots Golf (series) MegaMan Battle Network 5 Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Toronto Blue Jays World Series Drill bit USS Tunny (SS-282) Ian Baker-Finch Super Bowl IX Rugby union Winning Streak Olympic Club Extreme Programming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Squash (sport) Revolver Detroit Tigers Animal Crossing Water polo

in major golf tournaments is it improper to wear short pants apparently it's like degrees in ok and while everyone else caddies etc are wearing shorts all the players are wearing long pants the men are barred from wearing shorts one player whose name i can't remember wore them in i think the pga about years ago changing in a port a potty on the last hole in direct violation of the commissioner until a few years ago the caddies were not allowed to wear shorts in all the events but a couple of heat strokes took care of that i think that the masters still has a ban on caddy shorts but that tourney is in april so it isn't so hot the women can wear shorts or skirts or pants they are governed by the lpga and the rules are different plus i think it has the ability to sell tickets although there are some that you want to see covered as much as possible  Golf Caddy Michelle Wie The Open Championship PGA Tour Women's majors LPGA Professional golf tours Vijay Singh U.S. Open (golf) The Big Break Tiger Woods Annika S__renstam Skirt and dress Shorts Softball PGA European Tour Lee Trevino PGA Championship Bob Jones University June 2005 in sports Trousers Fred Couples Japanese tea ceremony Ice hockey Gary Player Social aspects of clothing Greg Norman Undergarment Davis Love III Sauna Nick Faldo Majors Hazeltine National Golf Club Ernie Els Official World Golf Rankings The Golf Channel Senior PGA Championship Basketball United States Golf Association Se Ri Pak May 2005 in sports The Masters Tournament Associated Press Athlete of the Year Match play Golf glossary Arnold Palmer Grand Slam (golf) Senior majors PGA Grand Slam of Golf Sam Snead Professional golfer June 2004 in sports Volleyball Golf club (equipment) Figure skating SpongeBob SquarePants Paula Creamer Football (soccer) Hot Shots Golf (series) The PLAYERS Championship Raymond Floyd Pantyhose Ryder Cup Penny Arcade (comic) FUTURES Tour Babe Zaharias U.S. Women's Open Championship (golf) French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools LPGA Championship Ian Woosnam Billiards Tobacco advertising Sudden death George Archer World Golf Hall of Fame Sport rowing Ultimate (sport) Floorball Scottsdale, Arizona The Sound and the Fury Baltusrol Golf Club Laserdisc Tennis Michael Campbell WGC-World Cup Cowboy United States Marine Corps Sports timeline Quizbowl University of Arizona HSBC World Match Play Championship New Zealand Open Las Vegas metropolitan area Tournament Phil Mickelson Gramophone record Culture of the United States

which of these balls is best for me titleist pro v nike one callaway hx tour i'm not the best golfer in the world but i like to use nice balls i average i'm currently hitting the nike powerlong and the bridgestone e which one of these balls is your favorite and which one do you think would work best for me your score is not what effects the kind of ball your play it is your clubhead speed a prov x would not be worth it to you if you have a clubhead speed below mph or mph for a prov x i wouldn't suggest the nike one black or platinum as there are better balls to get for the same price the callaway is a nice golf ball with a very soft face it doesn't require as much clubhead speed as the prov x does but the softer face does have its downsides the most obvious one is that it will get cut up the first time you use it the grooves in your golf club tear up the face and if you hit a tree or cart path the ball cover will be scuffed beyond use don't let me mislead you though the hx tour is a great ball i hope this description helps  Golf club (equipment) Golf Golf glossary The Big Break Champ Car Tire Nike, Inc.

is it a rule of golf that when playing ball matchplay of the difference in handicap is used no it's not a rule of golf though used to be the almost universal formula in match play we often get confused with the term a rule of golf which only covers those rules instituted by and regulated by the royal and ancient r a which governs golf in this country as far as i know the r a don't issue rules on things like stroke allowance but they did a few years ago suggest or recommend that the former be replaced by full allowance of the difference in handicap if they felt was wrong why they didn't go to as an experiment is beyond me as what they were saying in effect was that what they had been recommending for years or more was totally wrong it's only my opinion but as a middle handicapper with no bias matchplay comps tend to be won by low handicappers owing to their greater consistency over the round and over the competition the higher handicapper often gets stage fright receiving many shots and doesn't perform i had no problem receiving only of my shots in terms of it being fair the result in many cases now is that lower handicappers are discouraged from entering matchplay events as they have little chance of giving lots of shots if their opponent just plays his her game without boring everyone further this is because a handcap is issued based on a medal strokeplay round where matchplay shots are allowed on a hole by hole basis i e on hole you may beat your opponent by shots but you are only one hole up he can have a but he only loses the hole most of the clubs i know now use full allowance  Golf ELO rating system Snooker Golf handicap Match play Ryder Cup Lottie Dod Golf club (equipment) Badminton HSBC World Match Play Championship PGA Championship Golf glossary Go ranks and ratings Football (soccer) The Big Break Croquet Professional wrestling match types M16 (rifle) Ultimate (sport) The Open Championship Handicapping Abortion debate Michael Campbell Squash (sport) Volleyball Caddy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internal ballistics Tiger Woods Betting (poker) U.S. Open (golf) Inflation Laws of cricket Mixed martial arts Michelle Wie Fast bowling Sport Rugby union Playoff Firearm Drag racing Boxing U.S. Amateur Championship PGA European Tour Ice hockey Appeal 1896 Summer Olympics Gambling Norway national football team Football Drifting (motorsport) Slot machine National Football League Chess terminology Cricket FC Rostov Graduate school Baseball Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Divorce Hot Shots Golf (series) Stopping power Theory of conduct Abortion Ra (board game) Mahjong Hazeltine National Golf Club Ernie Els Sudden death Go (board game) Texas hold 'em Water polo American football FairTax Pinball Randomness Billiards Eight ball Quizbowl Australian rules football World Series Microeconomics RuneScape Backgammon Andre Agassi Paintball Simon Commission Racquetball Bowl Championship Series Draw poker

is this good for my age im and i can consistently drive the ball i normally hit the green in two on a championchip course by how far do you think that i would be able to drive the ball you probably haven't hit your growth spurt yet so i would assume you'll be taller and have more muscle mass by then this has the potential of adding or more yards the tour player are consistently out there around the mark what you need to decide is the direction you're taking is it accuracy or distance i'm not the longest hitter but have a good track record against those who are as much as clubs difference i keep it in play where they can be all over the place locally we have the long drive contests and although these guys can hit it out of the zip code area they really have no chance on a real fairway so seek more distance and if its for score strive for accuracy  Golf Volleyball Golf club (equipment) Golf glossary Riviera Country Club Baseball American football Billiards Home run Batting average Rugby league Rugby union Football (soccer) Toronto Blue Jays Cricket Glossary of American football Snooker Fast bowling Archery Laws of cricket Australian rules football Super Bowl X Fielding (cricket) Comparison of Canadian and American football Tag National Football League Planetary orbit Winning Streak Pete Rose Human height Croquet Batting (cricket) Softball Babe Ruth World Series Super Bowl XXXVI Tennis Super Bowl XXVII Rugby football Tour de France Super Bowl XXVI Brian Close Tris Speaker Water polo Fenway Park Table tennis Andr__s Galarraga National Football League Lore Baseball statistics Super Bowl XXXII Badminton Barry Bonds Canadian football Super Bowl XXI Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Reggie Jackson Super Bowl XXV 2005 World Series Ra (board game) Boston Red Sox Willie Mays Lacrosse History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Pittsburgh Steelers Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Caddy Gliding ELO rating system GunBound Stolen base Hank Aaron Action potential English cricket team Satchel Paige General relativity Super Bowl XIII The Big Break Gaelic football Dog agility Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XVIII Rounders Field hockey 2004 World Series John Daly (golfer) First baseman Super Bowl I Major League Baseball History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Bon Jovi 1919 World Series Team Fortress Classic Shogi Bowls Pump It Up Hurling Gravity Grunge music

why are women allowed to wear skirts long pants shorts but men can't wear shorts i'm talking about lpga pga yubi this is a golf question i guess you don't know what lpga pga is the lpga and pga tour are separate entities thus they govern themselves differently even if they were under the same umbrella i'd suspect that similar allowances would be made for the women what with the marketing advantages certain women bring to the sport when they wear less clothing no question that is a factor it wasn't until a few years ago that caddies on the pga tour were allowed to wear shorts but considering the tradition of the tour don't expect the same privilege to be allowed to the players  PGA Tour LPGA Professional golf tours Golf Caddy Women's majors Michelle Wie PGA European Tour PGA Championship Associated Press Athlete of the Year Annika S__renstam Jack Nicklaus Tiger Woods U.S. Open (golf) Se Ri Pak The Big Break Skirt and dress The Open Championship June 2005 in sports LPGA Championship Undergarment Cowboy United States Golf Association May 2005 in sports Lorena Ochoa The Golf Channel FUTURES Tour Tiger Woods PGA Tour Gender role Paula Creamer Official World Golf Rankings Golf club (equipment) U.S. Women's Open Championship (golf) Bob Hope Ryder Cup Senior majors Golf glossary Trousers PGA Grand Slam of Golf Gary Player Arnold Palmer Sports timeline Softball Babe Zaharias Lee Trevino Nick Faldo Kimono Davis Love III George Archer Majors World Golf Hall of Fame June 2004 in sports Japanese tea ceremony Florida State University Professional golfer Ernie Els Shorts Laserdisc Figure skating Clothing Coachella Valley Social aspects of clothing Bob Jones University Hakama Phoenix, Arizona Swimsuit Water polo Corporation Paul Runyan Las Vegas metropolitan area Coat (clothing) Sam Snead April 2005 in sports Skinhead Golfers with most LPGA major championship wins Greg Norman Raymond Floyd Nick Price Pantyhose Belly dance University of Arizona Adam Scott Toledo, Ohio Grand Slam (golf) Basketball Ice hockey Tom Watson (golfer) Culture of the United States Bob Charles (golfer) Riviera Country Club Cross-dressing Kilt Clemson University Padraig Harrington Password Fred Couples EA Sports Juan "Chi-Chi" Rodr__guez

on the pga tour how are tee times determined for the first two days first understand that pairings for the first two rounds for most events are created by a computer program that uses various categories for them one category might be former tour winners with full exempt status while another might be former tour winners playing on past champion status another is non winner with full exempt status yet another groups nationwide tour grads q school grads and monday qualifiers together and categories will overlap since there is never a perfect number of each to fill out a tournament i've never seen an actual listing of all the categories but i've read enough about it and studied it enough to feel confident that my response here is relatively on target the tour doesn't publicize these categories a few reasons a couple of which include the fact that sponsors and tour organizers have liberties with which to play in promoting certain pairings i e grouping tiger woods and rory sabbatini if they wish allowed and for the most part the general public really doesn't care how the pairings are configured events like the pga championship traditionally group the winners of the masters u s open and british open if indeed they are unique which it did again this week now regarding tee times golfers with better status get better tee times you'll never see woods tee off in the first or last group in short he's earned the plumb read mid morning early afternoon start times then tour organizers will follow a template to spread the most popular golfers around the course to maintain optimum traffic flow among the spectators so while woods might be teeing off on the first hole at am phil mickelson might start at am on by the time woods reaches the th mickelson will be long gone as will his gallery again this isn't the formula for all events variances will apply and occur what's most interesting to me is that while television networks funnel enormous dollars at the tour they have zero say in who tees off when currently the tour maintains complete control over that dynamic and for good reason as no one golfer should have any more advantage over another beyond what he has already earned via status  Golf The Open Championship PGA Championship Jack Nicklaus Vijay Singh U.S. Open (golf) Official World Golf Rankings Phil Mickelson Michelle Wie Gary Player Greg Norman Michael Campbell Tom Watson (golfer) Professional golf tours Nick Faldo WGC-NEC Invitational Majors Dog agility National Football League The Golf Channel Graduate school Lee Trevino Senior majors Baltusrol Golf Club August 2005 in sports Ernie Els John Daly (golfer) Hale Irwin THE TOUR Championship June 2004 in sports PGA Grand Slam of Golf Golf glossary ELO rating system Bob Charles (golfer) Playoff Hazeltine National Golf Club The Big Break The Championships, Wimbledon Caddy Women's majors ITV U.S. Amateur Championship Mercedes Championships Tour de France Sport in the United Kingdom LPGA Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Indianapolis 500 Annika S__renstam Sudden death Ian Woosnam Severiano Ballesteros Jeopardy!

why are three of golfs majors played in the usa tennis has grand slams played in four different countries aren't there any good enough courses in spain france australia etc even the unofficial ' th' major sawgrass is in america i know probably a silly question but just something that bugs me the american majors are unique and special enough to be highly respected and coveted the us open was created at the turn of the century by the snobbish upper class united states golf association which is not so different from the snobbish upper class of great britain's royal and ancient golf club but both of these organizations possessed enough respect to be able to call their tournaments national open championships with real authority the pga championship the rd major received high acclaim as the championship of the best professional golf association in the world the american pga has always been the best pro golf organization simply because americans made heroes of its pro golfers while other countries in the early th century considered a pursuit such as professional golf as befitting only nd class citizens other pro tours didn't receive near the respect until the latter half of the th century so the american pga has much more tradition going for it lastly the masters the th major is so highly respected worldwide because of it's heroic founder bobby jones and the incredibly unique and beautiful course it is played on augusta national it also certainly helps that all american majors have the vast financial backing of corporate america to ensure they are always played on the best golf courses money can buy the best evidence of how much money can play a factor is by comparing the men's and women's tours the women don't have near the corporate backing and therefore are constantly needing to replace a tournament that used to be considered a major the majors are not set in stone it's a matter of current public opinion believe it or not the british open and the pga have both suffered less respect for long stretches of time during the last years or so until arnold palmer began playing the british open early in his career most american pro's and the american media had written off that championship as too big a hassle to worry about the great ben hogan only played in one british open in his entire career which he won of course for years the pro's had to choose between the pga and british because they were played too close together to play both modern aviation eventually made traveling to europe much more plausible and eventually the tradition of the british open drew all of the great american pro's back to playing in it each year the british is here to stay now it will never lose its place as the co equal to the us open however the pga has lost its luster on several occasions especially since the pga of america hasn't been the parent of the american pro tour for nearly years now even now it is definitely viewed at a slightly lower level than the other majors within the next years it is possible another great tournament will gain notariety and shove itself in among the top the players is a possible choice maybe an unbelievable new course will be built by tiger woods that everyone falls in love with and he'll begin building a st rate tournament america loves it's heroes  Vijay Singh Greg Norman Official World Golf Rankings Senior PGA Championship Nick Faldo Ernie Els Professional golf tours The Masters Tournament Lee Trevino PGA Grand Slam of Golf Michelle Wie Sports timeline WGC-World Cup Norway national football team United States Golf Association Roger Federer The PLAYERS Championship Tom Lehman Sport in the United Kingdom HSBC World Match Play Championship Tiger Woods PGA Tour WGC-NEC Invitational John McEnroe Andre Agassi Severiano Ballesteros Association of Tennis Professionals Ian Woosnam Pete Sampras Phil Mickelson U.S. Amateur Championship ELO rating system Golf glossary Fred Couples Michael Campbell Gustavo Kuerten Western Open Bj__rn Borg Baltusrol Golf Club Leon White Sergio Garc__a World Championship Wrestling Padraig Harrington Ryder Cup Jos__ Mar__a Olaz__bal Sudden death Hazeltine National Golf Club Golf club (equipment) Mark O'Meara Scottsdale, Arizona The Big Break Rugby union Firestone Country Club Tom Watson (golfer) Playoff format Steffi Graf Ivan Lendl John Daly (golfer) Sport in Ireland Wales national rugby union team Raymond Floyd U.S. Open (tennis) Mark McNulty Kurt Angle Larry Nelson England national rugby union team Hale Irwin Hulk Hogan Jimmy Connors Eddie Guerrero Table tennis New York Giants The Golf Channel Mercedes Championships Florida State University Shawn Michaels Kim Clijsters
