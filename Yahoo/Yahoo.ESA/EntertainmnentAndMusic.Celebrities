will you please help me figure out whether lindsay lohan has implants look at these pics i have collected http bricksandstonesgossip com p comment the gap between them concerns me http celebritycosmeticsurgery blogspot com search label lindsay lohan this doc thinks they're fake and look at the white dress pic with side boob there is just too much mass too high http www defamer com hollywood gossip lindsay lohans breasts an expert weighs in this doc thinks they're fake too http www egotastic com entertainment celebrities lindsay lohan they just don't look natural in these pics you know they look too full and round like they defy gravity http www awfulplasticsurgery com archives html one of the pics used us weekly claiming she had work done on her chest but she was only and that is not legal right i saw the video of her that day and they do look a little unnatural but she couldn't have gotten implants at age http www awfulplasticsurgery com archives html when her arms go up they did but they don't do that anymore so explain that one http www awfulplasticsrugery com archives html her breasts look fake here but it is probably just her bra i love her so much and saw her new movie twice and she said herself her chest is real and that she didn't develop until she was and just cuz she has gotten lip injections doesn't mean she has a fake chest i am panicking here my brother said that when a chick with a big chest loses weight then the boobs got flat and saggy but that is not true b c lindsay's didn't they just got smaller and then when she gained weight again they got big again i beleive her and i love her the mystery is solved my cousin's husband is a cosmetic surgeon and told me that lindsay does have implants and it is very obvious to him but it is ok i love her anyway thank you for your answers and for not making fun of me well i didn't reall read all of that just your last bit and i kinda understand a little i guess i don't think she got implants because while she was fatter chunkier meatier her chest was fuller now that she has lost the weight i don't think her chest sags it is just smaller so i think it is impossible for her to have had implants because it doesn't make sense  Lindsay Lohan Breast Breast implant Brassiere Piccolo Junior Saga Hilary Duff Characters from Arrested Development Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Roswell UFO incident The Venture Bros.

is it possible to get a celebrity to sign something through mail or such specifically clive owen i have no chance of meeting clive owen in person but getting him to sign a poster for the new movie shoot 'em up would be one of my most prized possessions is there any way to do something like that thank you look honestly the chances are slim only a very few celebrities will do this the best way to enhance your chances is to mail the poster making sure to enclose a return container with ample postage and a very polite letter asking the celebrity to sign the poster personally to you they are more likely to sign something to a specific person because that lessens the chances of a profit being made by the recipient on their signature alone good luck  United States Postal Service Pretty Good Privacy E-mail Postage stamp Autograph Mail Winning Streak Game show E-mail spam Michael Owen Post office Terrell Owens Surveillance Public-key cryptography Horror film Mail fraud Viral marketing Free Republic Stamp collecting Neopets Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive Aristotle Envelope McFly Gosford Park Sinclair Research Ltd Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Objective-C Rodney Anoai Make money fast Live 8 Celebrity William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Postage stamps and postal history of the United States The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Clive Owen Postage due Order of Canada ZIP Code Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Wilfred Owen Chinese New Year $ale of the Century Patent About a Boy Princeton University Spam (electronic) Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Dr. No Autopen Babe Ruth Trust (Law) USA Consensus decision-making Yukio Mishima Whose Line Is It Anyway?

do you think jennifer lopez will ever get back the popularity status that she had five years ago i think she is a good performer and a good actress i just think that it is very unfortunate that the over exposure of her personal life may have killed her career she can definitely get it back and yes she was over exposed but in my opinion it's her marriage to marc anthony that killed her career she has become so timid since him and i just get this feeling that she's really not happy with him and that he's controlling  Jennifer Lopez Luke and Laura Spencer Marc Anthony Janet Jackson Self-esteem Latin music in the United States Abortion debate Hilary Duff Wicked (musical) Britney Spears Jennifer Parker Mark Antony Lorraine Baines McFly 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hip hop collaborations Remix Tina Arena Audrey Hepburn EastEnders Buttocks Rebirth (album) Musical theater Leo Wyatt It's Walky!

who are guitarists that never learned how to play the guitar i know that this question might seem very stupid however i'm almost positive that there are famous guitarists who was never taught how to play the guitar but they are still good at it i just want to know who those people are i think what your saying is that they taught themselves and that is the case with almost all guiter players there are several ways to play each cord and you will notice them all playing differently this is because they were not taught one way or the other they just do what works and sounds good it is called creativity  Violin Bass guitar Chord (music) Vibraphone Buddy Guy Drama Double bass Slide guitar Mandolin Harmonica Guitar Sampling (music) Marching band Capoeira Music of Ireland Transposing instrument Acoustic guitar Big band Twelve string guitar Eddie Van Halen Computer chess GuitarFreaks Les Paul Volleyball Tablature Alice Cooper Fender Telecaster Opeth Trey Anastasio Music lesson The Who Teacher Guitar/synthesizer Vibrato Dobro Electric guitar Vowel Franz Boas Brian May Dixieland Predestination Adam Jones Arabic alphabet Iron Maiden Billy Sheehan Brian Jones (musician) Alex Chilton Lonnie Donegan The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Hurdy gurdy Napalm Death Table tennis George Crumb Australian English Authentic performance Harp Instrument amplifier Robert Fripp Oud String instrument Backgammon Non-native pronunciations of English T.

why does zack efron keep acting like a year old i mean i have heard of targeting your audience but doesn't it seem a little bit strange to not want to try to attain an older age group by now seeing him and amanda bynes on the screen acting like year olds during promo commercial things is very disturbing to me not to mention pigeon holeing yourself to be viewed as an immature wussy the rest of your career ala justin timberlake and leonardo decrapreo because deep down on the inside he is a year old boy not only that but he like to have homo erotic dreams about simon cowell o gasp he seems so immature and annoying he just tries to be cool or something as for the 'target audience' thing he just wants to target little preteen boys and girlys and then rape them later i think it's probably his mediocre horrid acting that won't work for the older scene but his lame skills will work on younger kids who are extremely gullible into thinking he's an amazing actor  All That Adolescence Motion picture rating system The Fairly OddParents Kimi Finster Anime Statutory rape Ed, Edd n Eddy El Goonish Shive The Inside EastEnders Justin Timberlake Boy band Drawn Together I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alfred Hitchcock Salad Fingers Eric Cartman Asperger syndrome Robert Clark (actor) Punk'd Hey Jude Child American Idol Hip hop rivalries The Chemical Brothers The Young Ones (TV series) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Child sexuality Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Green Day Married... with Children Shaggy dog story Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Brit Awards Duran Duran Zoophilia Science fiction on television Scenes from a Memory Equine conformation Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain Milton H.
