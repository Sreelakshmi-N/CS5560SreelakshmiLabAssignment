nintendo wifi connector so obviously i just got a brand new usb for wifi play but i cant get the stupid thing to work so heres the deal ok after i selected what language i wanted it started to load when it got to about it asked me to insert the usb and it was going to connect it continues loading and then maybe at about it asks me to insert the the connecter into the usb o o its already in there so i press ok and its says there was an error help me please thanks pffft i dont want to call them pp lol they're my last resort nintendo customer support are incredibly good they are very efficient and effective other than uninstalling the software for the wifi dongle and reinstaling it and following the instructions in on the box to the letter its all you can do you may have had the very rare and unfortunate chance of getting a defective wifi adaptor in which case you will either need to return it for another one or call up nintendo for a replacement  Nintendo Entertainment System Universal Serial Bus Xbox Nintendo Revolution USB flash drive Xbox 360 PlayStation Portable Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection IPod Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo DS PlayStation 2 Wi-Fi Floppy disk Atari 8-bit family Dongle Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Saturn Atari 2600 Sega Dreamcast Apple Macintosh Voice over IP DVD Booting RS-232 PC Engine Nintendo GameCube Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis D-subminiature Commodore 64 Nintendo Modchip PlayStation 3 Bluetooth PowerPC Mozilla Firefox Secure Digital card Tungsten Handheld Compiler optimization Emacs PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay IMac Amstrad CPC Windows XP IBM PC keyboard Creative Nomad Sound Blaster RISC Washing machine PCI Express MIPS architecture Computer bus AmigaOS Computer software Antenna (radio) Blue screen of death ZX Spectrum Game Boy Common Unix Printing System Game Boy Advance Television N-Gage Memory Stick FireWire Apple Desktop Bus Quicksort High fidelity History of Microsoft Windows Intravenous therapy System/36 Unicode Port (computing) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sharp Zaurus Power Macintosh G3 ZigBee Automatic teller machine Knoppix Timeline of computing 1990-forward IPod shuffle Sinclair ZX81 Linux kernel Debugging Burroughs B5000 Atari ST Novell NetWare Computer virus Hash table Extreme Programming Hotspot (wifi) X86 assembly language Java Database Connectivity CPU cache Power Mac G4 Cube Sony Spyware Ethernet Serial port Embedded system

nintendo ds is not working i recently bought a ds light so i thought i will make my old ds into a gameboy i took of the whole top partion and made it look like a game boy advance now when i start it up it goes green then goes off i put it on the charger and put it on it goes green but then goes off anyone know how to fix it you can't just take something like that apart and snip a few wires and expect it to still work its a complicated piece of electronics it relies on the circuit being complete to work and don't even think about soldering the loose wires together that will just cause a short circuit and might destroy it even more possibly causing injury to yourself next time you want to try something like this look on the internet for instructions  Game Boy Advance Game Boy Nintendo Printed circuit board Bubble Bobble Nintendo GameCube Super Nintendo Entertainment System Soldering Fuse (electrical) Modchip Nintendo DS Game Boy Color Nintendo 64 Solar cell Digital circuit Apollo Guidance Computer Welding MegaMan Battle Network Pok__mon (video games) RISC Cleveland Browns Battery (electricity) Switch Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Operational amplifier The Legend of Zelda series Gas metal arc welding Super Mario Kart The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Golden Sun: The Lost Age Transistor CPU design Surface-mount technology Barbed wire Nintendo Revolution Poker jargon Game Boy Advance SP Professional wrestling slang Oscilloscope The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Glass Xbox Read-only memory Sega Animal Crossing New York Jets Carburetor Circuit design RS-232 Wave Race: Blue Storm Transformer Relay Mario Kart Super Circuit Yu-Gi-Oh!

if i downgrade my something psp will i loose internet abilities is it a bad idea to downgrade i keep hearing people talk about downgrading there psp what's the benefits what's the cons the second poster was right but to go into a little more detail yes if you downgrade to and stay there you wont have the internet however very few people stay at once they downgrade they usually update to a custom firmware which is only possible with sony the custom firmwares give you all the benefits of the sony firmwares so when you hear the cfw oea it means that it has all the abilities of the sony firmware plus the ability to homebrew which are applications made by people that dont have any legal affiliation with sony sony requires you to update your psp for newer games and with custom firmware you simply wait a couple weeks until someone comes out with an updated cfw that will work with the game the newest sony firmware is the newest custom firmware is m so any game that requires you to update to can be played with that cfw there are a few cons say a brand new sony firmware came out say you bought a game today that required a update it does take some time for the custom firmware guys to make a custom so you may wait a few weeks to be able to play it if you do a halfass job downgrading or updating your psp you can ruin it but there are so many psp forums ask questions until youre positive on how to do it i was very nervous about downgrading but once i found all the info i was very confident that i wouldnt have any problems  PlayStation Portable Verizon Wireless Copy protection PlayStation 3 Homebrew (video games) Universal Media Disc Regional lockout Nintendo DS Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories IPod Sega Dreamcast Sony Vorbis Wipeout (game) Patch (computing) Computer and video games Apple Macintosh Steam (content delivery) Domain Name System MAME Floppy disk GameFAQs Nintendo ITunes Mega Man Legends Championship Manager Sega Software testing DVD FairPlay ITunes Music Store The Sims 2 Street Fighter Alpha IGN Game Boy Console wars GamePark MMORPG Hot Shots Golf (series) Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible Tungsten Handheld Advanced Audio Coding Ford Motor Company Electronic Arts Counter-Strike BitTorrent Handheld game console Football Manager Microsoft Married... with Children Windows XP Syphon Filter Wheel of Fortune Game programming WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Debugging RISC Sony Computer Entertainment Internet fraud Apple Intel transition 24 Hours of Le Mans Customer relationship management Xbox GameSpot BlackBerry Something Awful RuneScape Mandriva Linux Poker jargon Health insurance Cheating in Counter-Strike Sender Policy Framework Final Fantasy XI Breath of Fire III Sony Corp. of America v.

playstation vs xbox pick one and tell me why i should choose that system both systems have pros and cons but i prefer the ps to start with it has the ability to output video in p format the highest definition currently available using a hdmi port in the back while it also supports component composite and s video outputs this gives the ps much higher capabilities for great graphics another great reason to get a ps is that it uses blu ray discs as opposed to the which uses normal dvds not only does this allow you to watch hi def blu ray movies but it allows ps games to be both higher definition and longer this is because dvds can only hold up to gigabytes while blu ray can hold up to gigabytes and hd dvd blu ray's rival can hold up to gigabytes despite what some people say the cannot play hd dvds without a special add on costing about the ps can play blu ray right out of the box the ps also uses the cell processor it has seven cores where as most high end pcs have only this allows for more onscreen objects motions characters and animations other features include tilt sensitive controller built in web browser free online gaming service built in hard drive on all models and support for bluetooth headsets keyboards and mice overall the ps hardware goes far beyond the capabilities of the the is currently the leader in the games department but with a few great games already out for the ps such as resistance and motorstorm and many more on the way such as lair warhawk and metal gear solid the ps is by far the best choice  PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 Xbox Xbox 360 Sega Dreamcast Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Mouse (computing) DVD Blu-ray Disc Laserdisc Atari ST High-definition television Computer and video games Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Amstrad CPC Bluetooth Mac OS X Sega Saturn Video game music Super Nintendo Entertainment System QuickTime Windows 2000 Computer IBM PC compatible History of computer and video games Personal computer Handheld game console Television Atari 8-bit family Windows XP Game controller TiVo Apple II family AmigaOS IMac USB flash drive Sound Blaster Windows Vista IPod PC Engine Commodore 64 Sega Hard disk Enterprise content management TurboGrafx 16 Amiga Microsoft Console wars Apple IIGS Modchip 64-bit Radeon X Window System Apple Computer ZX Spectrum Game programming Game programmer Mac OS X v10.4 Nintendo DS Resident Evil (video game) Pump It Up Counter-Strike Gmail Desktop computer SCART Console game Computer and video game genres Final Fantasy XI History of Microsoft Windows RISC Apple Macintosh The Sims 2 Digital rights management Game Boy PowerBook Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Entertainment System Screenshot Grand Theft Auto III H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Unicode GeForce 6 Series Intellivision Pinball NVIDIA Sprite (computer graphics) Copy protection IBM Personal System/2 Secure Digital card Def Leppard IBM PC

what's better psp or nintendo ds what are the pros and cons of each points to best answer im thinking of buying one of them but im not sure which one note in order to be eligible for the points you must list the pros and cons of each system psp pros design is really sleek casual gamers will be more enticed by psp s looks than by the ds third party support is very strong developers like to deal with sony over the other companies graphics are close to the playstation capability to play games along with movies and music has usb connectivity this has great potential analog stick allows for better gaming also same control layout as ps controllers will allow for easy ps ports or ps game sequels psp cons sony has a reputation for fragile devices and it doesn t seem too sturdy but this is just a thought not confirmed the screen does not have any protection so scratches are an issue sony does not have a very strong first party line up or even must have games they need a really big game that will lure people to the psp the battery life of the psp will be a very big issue at the moment it seems as though the batteries will allow for a little over hours with movies hours with games and to hours with music having a disc means that loading times will be a bit slower and these also contribute to the battery life being short everything in the pros sections contributes to this con the price many people will not want to lay down more cash for a handheld then what the xbox may cost of course you get what you pay for and the currently estimated usd price tag certainly is worth it even if many aren t willing to pay that much ds pros it has a unique design that is very attractive to the general public and also has a clamshell design to protect the screens the ds has two screens which will allow for very unique games the touch screen can also play as a virtual analog stick or mouse one of the screens is a touch screen this allows for unthinkable innovation and we hope to have some truly revolutionary games ds will once again use cartridges but this time they will contain much more size over gigabyte and no loading time battery life will not be an issue with the ds with around hours each time around the price of the ds will be quite low at the first party games of the ds are very strong games like metroid prime super mario x and animal crossing will surely make the psp jealous ds cons even with the sleek design of the ds it will not be as tempting to the mainstream gamer as the psp will there is no analog stick and with many gamers when playing a d game the analog stick is a must have no games have even come close to using the touch screen to its potential also if games do not set an option for lefties in games they will have a very hard time with the ds the graphics of the ds are much weaker than the psp the ds will have graphics close to or a bit better than the n while the psp will be close to the ps this is a very large difference not a direct con with this pro but an important one ds needs to draw in older audiences as well its image of a kids company does not help the ds at all the third party lineup for the ds is not very strong at the moment nintendo really isn t known for third party support and it is shown here again  Xbox Sega Xbox 360 Console wars Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Game controller Game Boy Advance Mouse (computing) Console game Sega Dreamcast Sony Computer Entertainment History of computer and video games USB flash drive N-Gage Platform game Universal Serial Bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Laptop Game Boy Advance SP Video game music Intellivision Action Replay The Legend of Zelda series Electronic Arts The Sims 2 Chrono Trigger TurboGrafx 16 First-person shooter Atari 8-bit family IBM PC compatible History of video games (Sixth generation era) PC Engine IMac Gradius Floppy disk Game programmer Wipeout (game) Apple Macintosh Worms (computer game) Console emulator GamePark History of video games (16-bit era) Hard disk MMORPG Commodore International Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Atari ST Boss (video games) Lemmings (computer game) Copy protection Poker jargon Bubble Bobble Modchip DVD Atari 2600 Crash Bandicoot MAME Sega Game Gear Atari Lynx Timeline of computing 1990-forward CD-i Sony The Sims Resident Evil 2 Spider-Man ATI Technologies Memory Stick DualShock ZX Spectrum Gameking Regional lockout Adventure game Counter-Strike Atari

why is region locking necessary others have said that it keeps the economies in check but it really limits the libraries for said consoles i think i would be more apt to shell out the for a ps if it were compatible with both my ntsc and pal psone and ps games basically it is there for a couple of reasons to help prevent piracy there are huge pirate markets in some asian countries i believe yeap to keep economies in check to make sure there is still a market for sales rather than people importing in their own dvds i do agree it is kind of stupid for starters consoles can be 'chipped' or previous playstaions could at least to get around certain restrictions and it really hinders people who would like to import game and dvd titles not avilable on the shelf there could be additional reasons but i guess economics is the big one  PlayStation 2 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 2600 DVD Sega Dreamcast Xbox Nintendo Entertainment System Atari 8-bit family Xbox 360 Commodore 64 Laserdisc PlayStation Portable Nintendo GameCube Windows Vista Modchip Amiga Warez PC Engine MPEG-2 PAL Copyright infringement of software Nintendo DS Liberalism Digital rights management Commodore 128 RISC Sega Master System ZX Spectrum Windows XP Nintendo High-definition television Sega 32X Nintendo 64 Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone Nintendo Revolution S__CAM PlayStation (original) ATI Technologies Television TurboGrafx 16 Computer and video games VHS MAME Colecovision Copyright Resident Evil (video game) Computer role-playing game NTSC Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Atari ST Poker jargon Videocassette recorder Karaoke Video game crash of 1983 Mercantilism MOS Technology MMORPG Metal Gear Solid Console wars Read-only memory IBM PC compatible Handheld video game Texas Instruments TMS9918 SCART Commodore C64 Games System Supply and demand Atari Airsoft Gradius History of Microsoft Windows Metroid Prime Datatype Home computer Advanced Squad Leader History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Free trade Square Co., Ltd.
