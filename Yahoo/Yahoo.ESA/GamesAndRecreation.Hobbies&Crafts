how do you sew a collar on a shirt using interfacing fabric i'm not sure if that is the right term but i m sewing a shirt that has an interfacing piece to attach the pattern is very unclear does anyone know about this thanks i just can't figure out the pattern should i just adjust it okay so i m pretty much an idiot i thought that the interface pattern was the whole thing not half of it if i cut it on folded fabric it produces a longer collar does that sound like the correct way lol that's kinda funny usually you cut the piece of interfacing the same size as the collar and just stitch it to the wrong side of the material of the collar then just sew the collar as normal the interfacing helps to stiffen up the collar and keep it in place  Textile manufacturing terminology Shirt Sewing Sewing machine Undergarment Knitting Mattress Floppy disk Kimono Bookbinding Skirt and dress Clothing Chemise Applique Upholstery Cross-stitch Casting Kilt Textile manufacturing Collar Suit (clothes) Academic dress of Oxford University IBM PC compatible Black tie Necktie Canadian Armed Forces Manual transmission Stocking Quilting Rigging Order of the Garter Blood on the Tracks Mars Exploration Rover United States Marine Corps Dress shirt Pattern (sewing) Carpet Equine conformation Tincture (heraldry) Beavis and Butt-head Climbing equipment Chainmail Comanche Kayak Starfleet ranks and insignia Glossary of nautical terms Clothing terminology Metalworking Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Reconfigurable computing Tennis shirt Embroidery Plastic Knife Tatting Shit Drill bit Salwar kameez TRS-80 Aloha shirt Antenna (radio) Earring Ironing Sea Scouts (BSA) Heavy metal fashion Basic English Trailer Park Boys Baseball cap Sniper MAD Magazine Numerology Dog agility Bonus Stage Diamond cut Negima Wrench STS-61 Clerical clothing Penis Clavicle Hat Suture Swimsuit Sternum Autopsy Horse tack Windows XP Binoculars Jack plug Bow tie Dog training Doctor (Doctor Who) Sword making Lace-making Glossary of climbing terms Dog Desk Blue-collar worker Katana Dog collar

hi i just built a model rocket and if i launch it how will i find it just incase it went into the woods what i used to do with my estes rockets was to add a tablespoon of colored chalk from marking string when the ejection charge went off that would provide clear marking of the apogee i then added a small streamer to the top of the parachute in neon color to increase the visibility and painted the rocket itself in neown colors or white to contrast with the ground or trees of course the simplest thing is to launch in a very large field to avoid the trees good luck and be safe  Model rocket Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Lightning Spacecraft propulsion Rocket Ejector seat Tag STS-51-L Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Galileo spacecraft Wood Solar eclipse Tesla coil Saturn V Colours, standards and guidons Solid rocket Vostok 1 Naval mine Avalanche Freedom 7 Model aircraft Marching band Hash table Mars Exploration Rover USS Tunny (SS-282) Space disaster Moonraker F-104 Starfighter Firework Apollo 15 Gliding Paragliding Objective-C Pikmin Robert Goddard (scientist) P-51 Mustang Campfire Plasma (physics) Billiards Black Trail blazing Edwards Air Force Base Space elevator Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Helium Advance Wars: Dual Strike M16 (rifle) Shell (projectile) Deep Impact (space mission) Floppy disk MS-06 Zaku II Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Gemini 9A V-2 rocket Laser Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Anti-submarine weapon Mushroom hunting Voskhod spacecraft Sputnik 1 Christmas tree Team Fortress Classic Quake III Arena Starsiege: Tribes Cheating in Counter-Strike Apollo 8 Tank CPU cache Aurora (astronomy) Rocket experiments in the area of Cuxhaven Piet Mondrian Neon Coffee Sundial Drill bit Artillery Drag racing Bachem Ba 349 Second Battle of the Atlantic Jupiter Apollo spacecraft Avro Arrow Drawing Rise of Nations Fluorescent lamp Estes Industries Half-Life Hang gliding B-47 Stratojet Color theory P-38 Lightning Combine (Half-Life 2) Gemini 6A Radio controlled airplane Scale model Occam's Razor Land mine Color Space Shuttle program STS-60

what are some uses for a sharpie marker i understand that a sharpie's ink is permanent i have a colour palette of sharpies and here are some things that i have done with them making shrinky dinks probably my favourite use for them drawing tribal inspired designs on old cds then hanging them like a wall hanging drawing my my bedroom mirror decorating a tee shirt the trick it to use short light strokes and heat set the design with an iron wash on gentle in cold water skip the dryer tie dye fabric tie use the item spray with rubbing alcochol until damp then go nuts with the sharpie spray withe the ra once your done to mellow out the lines then follow the directions for heat setting and care a tie dyed shirt takes a lot of ink from the pens so you're probably better off buying pens to use exclusivly for this purpose making a fauz stained glass object letting my friends decorate my desk labeling everything i own binder and laptop in enhancment rubbing alcochol removes outdated designs from hard non porous materials but if you leave it on too long there will always be a slight outline this doens't happen on glass though drawing faces on flashlight bulbsto make blackout more interesting fake tattoos for costumes using a sharpie on my skin has never cause me any harm what so ever a prank involving a loser and his car  Tattoo Textile manufacturing Paint Lighting Upholstery Casting Clothing Ink Glass Turquoise Sharpie (marker) Pottery Violin Climbing equipment Tire Genericized trademark Laser engraving Scarification Screen-printing Hangul Japanese tea ceremony Comanche Typewriter Textile manufacturing terminology Thermal power station Magnet Spark plug Printmaking Undergarment Leather Invisible ink Magic (illusion) Powder metallurgy Swimming Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hyperthermia Fire fighting Jute Air conditioning Floppy disk Cookware and bakeware Traditional animation Inkjet printer Autograph Friction Soldering Best Buy Happy Tree Friends Staining (biology) Wallpaper Microscopy Voynich manuscript Christmas tree Pen and ink T-shirt Dilbert Professional wrestling slang Fan (implement) Drill bit Great Teacher Onizuka Solar power Konica Minolta Book of Kells Iron-gall nut ink Mouse (computing) Embedded system Items in the Metroid series Seismic retrofit Laundry Fiberglass Surveillance Dry cleaning Bong Kilt Etching Hand grenade Incandescent light bulb Francis Bacon (painter) Dye Solar cell Irezumi Flag of Hong Kong Mattress Ceramics Skateboarding trick Ultraviolet Kitchen Houseplant IBM PC compatible Australian words Dog training Circuit design Hamster Chair

how is a crochet hook measured like anatomy of a crochet hook the sort please it depends for the overall length a tunisian hook will be measured for overall length the longer the length or the length of the entire hook plus the length of the attached cable is important depending upon the number of stitches that are planned to be carried the longer it is the more stitches that can be created a crochet on the double hook will follow this line of thinking for your average hook the length will matter to the crocheter overall a crocheter with small hand tends to like short hooks a larger hand tends to like hooks longer of course balance is also very important for the neck a bullion hook will have a long neck the longer the neck the more consistent the stitch look will be a bullion stitch can have as few as yarn overs to or more prior to yarning over and removing them all in one big swooping motion those hooks with short necks tend to make longer stitches look like inverted pyramid shaped stitches i urge crocheters to make two swatches of double crochet stitches to see this use one hook with a short neck and one hook with a long neck the stitches made with the long neck will be more uniform in construction finally when it comes time to measure a hook to determine what stitch size it will make most will measure by the size of the head but that's not giving you a true size since some heads are a bit more sculpted shaped than others the true measurement is the circumference around the neck just like the way knitting needles are measured in addition to the answer i provided to your other question a few days back http answers yahoo com question index ylt atjgw mwrc l u qymzpwlsy ix qid aasscan show profile info b b cd a cc ff d ef ff aaav i've recently discovered that anniesattic has a brand new booklet out on how to carve your own crochet hook i don't know if it has the answers you are seeking but it's worth investigating link is below in the source list section for the anatomy of a crochet hook check out the diagram featured on the home page to the cgoa hookcollectors group http groups yahoo com group cgoa hookcollectors the diagram was created by nancy nehring link http groups yahoo com group cgoa hookcollectors i hope this helps dee stanziano cyca certified crochet teacher owner of many types of crochet hooks  Knitting Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Knitting needle Sewing machine Drill bit Knot Yarn Equine conformation Anchor Bass guitar Handloading Mattress Violin Speed of light Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Tatting HyperText Transfer Protocol Aerial (dance move) Action potential Species Sin City Strap-on dildo Double bass Antenna (radio) Prostate cancer Suplex Hash table Professional wrestling throws Trombone Extreme Programming Lace-making Crossword Tire Dinghy Glossary of graph theory Gravity Textile Voynich manuscript Passenger car Bookbinding Bicycle frame Semi-trailer Password Eyepiece Slide rule Lilo & Stitch Many-worlds interpretation Harp Web crawler Professional wrestling holds Dynamical system Tai shogi Timpani Ship model Basketball Internal ballistics Shotgun Sword Charles Wheatstone Scientific method Quizbowl Menstrual cup Human penis size Supply and demand Brassiere Ethernet Trademark Redundant array of independent disks Compiler optimization Space elevator Great Pyramid of Giza Spark plug Transformer Kimono Drawing Electric guitar Guitar Domain Name System Weight training Mandible Optical fiber Tefillin Random walk Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Casting Dog agility Plame affair Legal research

how do you cut mm acrylic perspex and not using laser cutting i am trying to create my jewelry but all i have is clay ive heard from many people that make flat scene jewelry cut into shapes use acrylic plastic i know that not everyone is going to be like hmm i wanna make jewelry from acrylic lets go buy a laser machine not everyone has that kind of money and i also understand that not everyone is going to go buy a large saw blade or a jigsawblade because they can cut there hands fingers off what other options are there i see so many sites that use acrylic based jewelry that they cut has anyone ever seen the scene diamond with a sawblade how in the freak would you cut the tiny wholes shapes out with it and so evenly and and straight its almost impossible someone please help me out ive read everything you can try cutting it on either side and snapping it but how would you do that around a shape if you want examples go to kiki kannibals jewelry site or love bites and brushes please help to diy you will need acrylic that is less than thick and a sharp blade you'll also need a steady hand a lot of patience also the material will be weaker than if you go down the laser cutting route the reason a lot of people will reccomend using laser cutting services such as lovebites and bruises is because in some instances they are actually cheaper than buying the acrylic and cutting it yourself as they bulk order and bulk laser cut so for the price of a sheet of acrylic you might as well get it cut into your shape and sent to you  Knife Bulk vending Polymethyl methacrylate Knitting Solar cell Welding Plastic Woodworking Diamond cut Casting Laser engraving Table saw Glass Brush Space elevator Jewellery Laser Textile manufacturing Paint Lightsaber Gramophone record Manicure Airsoft Saw Dice Pottery Laserdisc Scissors Poker jargon Barbell (piercing) Floppy disk Cardboard Leaf Naruto jutsu Genericized trademark IMac Axe Screw Violin Mattress Tank Radio controlled airplane Drawing Table tennis Combine (Half-Life 2) Mouse (computing) Upholstery Guitar Polymer clay Microeconomics Diamond enhancement Metalworking Bassoon Terminal ballistics Carbon nanotube Diamond simulant Spark plug Brewery Anchor CPU design Katana Envelope Compact disc Volleyball Synthetic diamond Acrylic paint Little Britain Nail (anatomy) Illegal drug trade Sharpening stone Dinghy Filigree Traditional animation Body piercing Skateboarding trick Dairy Ford Motor Company Slide rule Typewriter Wheel of Fortune Computer Musical box Printed circuit board Sword Loudspeaker Gas metal arc welding IPod Ives Manufacturing Company Moonraker Diamond clarity Lego Plane (tool) Solar sail

which wool is good for sensitive skin i would like to knit myself a jumper but i find wool itchy next to bare skin as i live in a rural location i would need to buy it online can anyone recommend a really soft wool suitable for adults not baby pink can you also recommend a good website for sensitive skin and people with wool allergies the best natural fibers are alpaca llama and cashmere people who are allergic to wool generally are reacting to the lanolin in the wool alpaca does not contain lanolin and is generally hypoallergenic and it's cheaper than cashmere baby alpaca is even softer my favorite alpaca is a label called prime alpaca naturally colored undyed and peruvian tweed color twisted yarn from undyed naturally colored alpaca alpaca is revered in the high andes previously in peru alpaca fibers were only worn by royalty llama is similar to alpaca but it's not as widely available cashmere comes from the cashmere goat the cheapest cashmere yarns are imported and produced in china and inner mongolia one of the leading market producers of cashmere is italy which has quality cashmere yarns but the prices are a little higher other great alternatives if you're not allergic to wool are merino wool and merino wool blends one of my favorite yarns that i get from a supplier is a cashmere and merino wool blend other great soft blended yarns that i like are merino silk merino silk mercized or pima cotton and pima cotton silk pima and mercized cottons are very soft and a nice alternative for people who have sensitivities to wool and mohair silk is awesome but it can get pricey so the cheaper and more common option is to find a silk blend yarn i don't recommend mohair for sensitive skin even though both cashmere and mohair come from goats it seems that more people are sensitive and allergic to mohair if you do like mohair and are not allergic to it then make sure the you get kid mohair which is much much softer regular mohair can be coarse itchy and scratchy i don't know where you are but these us based sites are great because the prices are low and or they're for people who want to buy in bulk like for a sweater project http www discountyarnsale com great bulk prices http www knitpicks com they have their own line of yarns http www elann com http www smileysyarns com outlet of yarns basically  Yarn Domestic goat Knitting Textile Goat Mattress Spinning (textiles) Jute Llama Carding Allergy Economy of Mongolia Weaving Plastic Undergarment Upholstery Linen Peanut Cotton Tattoo Agriculture Peruvian cuisine Agriculture in Australia Livestock Hay fever Dye Wine Tariff Lama (genus) Hydrogen economy Eczema Stocking Fecal incontinence Biodiesel Inca Empire Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Petroleum Supply and demand Milk Lanolin World Wide Web Uranium Bulk vending Carpet Domestic sheep Bolivia Gobi Desert Economy of Bolivia Aran Islands Guinea pig Saxophone Indigo dye Pisco Industrial Revolution Gasoline Black tie Cloth Drill bit Alcohol fuel Leather Potato Flour Cat Airsoft Clothing Coeliac disease Nylon Rock (music) Dietary fiber Sling (weapon) Gramophone record Billiards Tofu Light-emitting diode IPod Free trade Motion picture rating system Electronic commerce ATI Technologies Volleyball Economy of Peru Coffee Uniform Resource Locator

craft ideas for women's handkerchiefs i found maybe oldish looking printed women's handkerchiefs when i was going thru my mom's belongings they are all different sizes and prints some with irregular or scalloped edging i'm not much into quilting what else could i do with them i love old handkerchiefs i've seen and made cute valances with them by laying them out partially overlapping with a point at top and bottom and tacking them together then the top point folds over the rod and you tack that as well you can add some cool old buttons or bows etc where they're tacked together if that's not suitable you can use them as pillow fronts either leaving them as they are or adding some embellishment since they're probably thin and maybe frail i'd mount them on sturdier fabric if you're lucky enough to have some truly gorgeous ones they can be beautiful framed or even used as a mat behind another work of art have fun with them  Mattress Upholstery Sewing Quilt Sundial Textile manufacturing terminology Drill bit Sailing Japanese tea ceremony Shirt Bicycle Brewery Knitting Colours, standards and guidons Quilting Dodge Charger Katana Parts of a sail Bed (furniture) Knife Otello Lava Saw Seismic retrofit Suit (clothes) Bicycle frame Floppy disk Rigging Kitesurfing Strap-on dildo Violin Door Guitar Poker jargon Chair Wood carving DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Traditional animation Printed circuit board Mouse (computing) Order of St. John Fiberglass Sword making Brassiere Amateur telescope making Canoe View camera AFI 100 Years series Dog Campfire Kylie Minogue Professional wrestling holds Bondage (BDSM) Japanese art Fan (implement) Anchor Fabrication (metal) Symmetry Sail Glossary of nautical terms Art Equine conformation Dinghy Paper size Glass Radio controlled airplane Cowboy DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Loudspeaker Black tie Rail tracks Boat building Spinnaker Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Piano Diving suit Curling Wire Recumbent bicycle Trousers James Kochalka Cello Applique Tank Christmas tree Paul Is Dead Snooker King Crimson Clothing Caprice Bourret Screw Avenue Q Comanche EastEnders Sega Saturn Carpet

where can i find out if a coin is authentic i have a very rare coin that i would like to know if it is authentic or not any ideas on a knowledgeable expert or business i can take or send it to a simple and quick option is to take the coin to a coin store or a coin auctioneer in your area most auctioneers and appraisers in your area can give you some guidance on coins they can give you good answer and will likely do it for free if it just one coin and you ask nicely you can also send it to a coin grading service just like any business some grading services are better then others ask how long they have been around and if they guarantee their grading the grading service will evaluate your coin and slab it place it in a hard plastic case this service can be expensive and often is tied to the value of the coin however once graded the coin can be easily sold or traded  Numismatics Money Coin collecting Coin grading Password Octopus card Auction Privatization Ra (board game) Medium of exchange Expert system Education in the United States Bulk vending IP (complexity) Probability Banknote 1933 Double Eagle Gold standard Grade (education) Gmail Seismic retrofit Grade (climbing) Autograph Philatelic investment Species Floppy disk Diamond Whitewater Gross domestic product Canadian dollar Education in Romania BASIC programming language Commodity markets Coffee AppleTalk Mortgage Trademark United States Postal Service Windows 2000 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Turquoise United States dollar coin Double Eagle (U.S. coin) Graduate school Microeconomics Password cracking Vending machine Plastic College admissions Sterling silver Hyperinflation Computer virus Simple Mail Transfer Protocol CPU cache British Civil Service Standardized testing Coin Online auction business model Voting system Glossary of climbing terms Education Extreme Programming Legal tender Enterprise content management 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bond Pottery GSM services Zero-knowledge proof Book collecting Slide rule Neopets Farthing (coin) Peer review Textbook Halliburton Massachusetts Institute of Technology Neologism Stopping e-mail abuse Nickel (U.S. coin) Secondary education in France Indentured servant Rupiah Poker jargon Meaning of life Test (student assessment) Retailer Coin magic Euro OpenDocument Bluetooth Fractional-reserve banking Contract Illegal drug trade Monopoly (game) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MetroCard Shroud of Turin

i want to make a quilt what do i do i suddenly decided i want to make a quilt but i have no idea how to do it or what i would need i want to make one for on my bed not on a wall can you tell me what some good sites i can look at that show clearly every step involved and some good sites for inspiration also what sort of fabrics are best a class is always the best way to learn to quilt but it isn't always possible there may not be any classes in your area or the expense may not be practical for you if you have the money to spend you're probably looking at for a series of four to six classes do some research in your area check the phone book for a local quilt shop it should be listed under quilting they will be your best resource they may offer classes often with discounts on fabric for your class project the lqs class is the best way to go because you're building a relationship with the people who work there and you'll always be able to go back for help even if they don't offer classes they may be able to tell you who does they can also put you in touch with your area quilting guild some quilt guilds are fantastic welcoming to new members and willing to help you learn unfortunately i wasn't that lucky since my guild was all about who's already been there for twenty years and they had no interest in anyone with different ideas you may also be able to take a class from a community college check with your local schools about adult education courses if a class is not practical for you then you need to teach yourself i recommend getting a couple of good instruction books like start quilting with alex anderson and the quilter's ultimate visual guide the first is a thin book that teaches you the basics with just six blocks the second books is more reference than instruction but it has a lot of information for beginners i also like quilt in a day eleanor burns their books are clearly illustrated and explain strip and chain piecing which are relatively new techniques in the last twenty or thirty years quilt in a day also has dvds available to go with their books a video is the next best thing to taking a class if you can't take a class but can afford a investment i'd suggest the book and dvd from eleanor burns called still stripping after years it contains beginner to intermediate level projects there are also videos available for free on the internet spend some time checking out hgtv's simply quilts videos the show is no longer being aired but you can watch segments online speaking of television shows check out your local pbs station quilt in a day has a show as does fons porter love of quilting there's also an online network called quilter's news network that has quilting shows all the time for block patterns you must check out quilter's cache there are over free block patterns with detailed illustrated instructions they are instructions for the blocks only so you'll need to learn a bit about piecing methods and sizing to figure out what you need to make an entire quilt but it's well worth the effort as far as fabric you really should start with cotton and use the best you can afford you can get quilting fabric at places like joann fabrics hancock fabrics hobby lobby and even some walmart stores they generally aren't the highest quality actually some of it is really awful and some is pretty good but the pretty good stuff tends to be more expensive at these stores than the really good stuff is at quilt shops if you have a quilt shop buy from them keep your local stores in business if you're on a budget shop their clearance section they all have them if you don't have a local quilt shop check out the many online shops my personal favorites are hancocks of paducah no relation to hancock fabrics and connecting threads which has several new lines of quilt shop quality fabric for about less connecting threads is also a great place for inspiration go to their books section and click on a title it will bring up the page for that book and under the photo of the book it says view inside images this will show you up to a dozen projects from that book another great place for inspiration is webshots or the many other photo sharing sites just go in and search for quilt finally do a google search for quilt and then click images at the top left you'll have thousands hundreds of thousands of quilts to look at  Quilt Quilting Mattress RISC CPU cache E-mail spam Neopets Compiler optimization Enterprise content management Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Teletext CPU design Wal-Mart Knitting Google Scientology beliefs and practices Mach kernel Extreme Programming The Star Wars Holiday Special Infantilism Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Genealogy PHP Plame affair Legal research Hash table Surveillance Expert system Avenue Q MMORPG Gaia Online Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Computer W.

maker of unique glass jewlery vials my friend's th birthday is comming up and i figured it'd be really neat if i did something unique for her she's a huge naruto fan and her favorite character is gaara so what i wanted to do was possibly have a glass necklace of gaara's gourd made and fill it with sand so she could wear it does anyone know someone who could do this or a shop where i could buy an item similar to it or if no one knows either of those things could someone tell me how much it could end up running me if i ended up having it custom made i figured the vial would be an inch inch and a half long max any help would be much appreciated look around anime store sites and see if you can find some cos play pieces that would be the easiest try www animenation com or www animecastle com to start with next try looking at bottles for sand art crafting stores carry these and you never know when you might just find what you need the last and most expensive option would be to find an artisan who specializes in glass blowing bring lots of pictures and an open mind you need to get close not exact any fan will identify close enough quickly  Akatsuki (Naruto) Gaara Gaia Online Characters of Naruto Uzumaki Naruto Naruto jutsu Rock Lee Hamster RuneScape skills Bong RuneScape weapons RuneScape quests Turquoise Violin Naval mine Trigonometric function Drill bit Opportunity rover Glass G.I.

crocheting scarf help i can crochet the first two rows but when i finish the second i dont know how to start the third it aways ends up back wards that is the nature of crochet when you start the third row you must turn the potential scarf over and start back essentially each row is the reverse of the previous one however if you are making something like a cap or a flat rug you keep going until you reach the size you want without turning it over and changing directions i could show you easier than explaining it but i hope it helps you good luck  Textile manufacturing Knitting Crochet Textile Swingout Pittsburgh Steelers Textile manufacturing terminology Atomic Kitten The Wall Cleveland Browns The Curse of Fenric New York Giants Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Peter Shilton Dai shogi Mario Lemieux Carolina Panthers Pink Floyd Knitting needle Indianapolis 500 Aerial (dance move) New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Jennifer Lopez New York Knicks Poker jargon Chu shogi 1957 World Series Winning Streak Skateboarding trick Betting (poker) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fast bowling Wheel of Fortune Knot Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Newcastle United F.C.

buy great knives online anyone know how to get an online business off to a good start my parents started theknivery com which sells all sorts of knives but they don't know how to get any business anyone got some ideas it's appreciated there are three suggestions i would make first of all i would encourage your parents to make their site more than just an online catalog what i mean is they need to add some content to their site lots of content they should add information that people are searching for like the history behind certain styles of knives swords etc pages about uses for particular knives how knives were are made etc that is just a few suggestions with brainstorming i'm sure they can come up with more the reason they should do this is because websites are ranked higher by the search engines if they are content sites if they provide information for web surfers who will then find their site when searching for that information here's a free ebook that you can download to help you understand the concept better it is called make your site sell http myss sitesell com angie html secondly they need targeted traffic that means visitors who are actually looking for knives not just people paid to read emails or click on ads to understand the importance of targetted traffic and how to get it http traffic sitesell com angie html lastly they need to look for places they can build incoming links to their site like forums you can type in knives forums and look for places where people are discussing knives or swords or whatever is relevant to the site that way you can join in the discussion and put their website address in their signature as a link some people may check it out just because they are interested but the main benefit is that you gain more relevance in the search engines with more incoming links to your site i hope this helps if you have more questions about what i mentioned feel free to contact me through my profile best of luck  Search engine optimization Web traffic World Wide Web Google search Website Spyware Internet fraud BitTorrent Gmail Cross site scripting Spamdexing E-mail spam Uniform Resource Locator Google Open access Spam (electronic) Neopets HTML Legal research Opera (web browser) HyperText Transfer Protocol Fark.com Advertising Online marketing Blog Ajax (programming) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act RuneScape cheats Stopping e-mail abuse PHP PageRank The Standard Representational State Transfer Web crawler Internet Web page LiveJournal Web design Open Directory Project Computer virus Search engine XML Phishing Mozilla Firefox Amazon.com Mozilla Application Suite Wireless Application Protocol Deep web Comparison of web browsers Denial-of-service attack Thumbnail gallery post The Internet Movie Database Wiki Internet censorship in mainland China Web hosting Science Knife E-mail Electronic commerce America Online Dictionary HyperCard Cyberspace Wget Internet privacy Pretty Good Privacy Link spam Anonymity History of the Internet Advance fee fraud Internet troll Arianne Aikido H2G2 Education HTML element Software agent Webcomic Web analytics SAML RuneScape Anonymous remailer Gross domestic product Social software Cloaking Hyperlink Martial art Orkut Proxy server Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System

i am looking for a strong glue so i can glue crystals beads etc to leather that will not turn rubbery i have tried alot of glues and i really want a glue that will bond and really hold and is not easy to pull off the problem with sewing them on is that perhaps they will need an industrial strength needle that is depending on the thickness of the leather have you tried plastic modelling glue the stuff dries instantly and is incredibly strong i'm sure you could get it from many art craft hardware stores around the type i have is bostik who specialise in glues and that type of stuff the glue container is small with a cone like lid if you want to look out for it good luck  Knife Bookbinding Leather Pottery Radio controlled airplane Comanche Polypropylene Knitting Floppy disk Upholstery Adhesive Hamster Atari ST Strap-on dildo Textile manufacturing Carnivorous plant Welding Textile manufacturing terminology Climbing equipment Tofu Violin Glass Earring Gag (BDSM) Sewing Manifold Box Screw Inhalant Piano Applique Concrete Fishing Carpet Tin can Wood Piccolo Junior Saga Gramophone record Dairy Gas metal arc welding Guitar Epoxy Pine Cyanoacrylate Semiconductor device Glossary of climbing terms Tanning IPod Japanese toilet Papier-m__ch__ Wood carving Ramen Shotgun Dialysis Model aircraft Polyethylene Inventory Organic peroxide Jute Solar cell Masonry Solvent Turquoise Lightning Carbon nanotube Tank Solar sail Bicycle frame Clothing Rigging Cross-country skiing Horseshoe Ice cream Fire extinguisher Ship model Aggregate (composite) Bong Computer Sheaf (mathematics) Table tennis Energy development Irrigation Japanese tea ceremony Tack Boat building Mattress Casting Castle of the Winds Printed circuit board Vermicompost Skateboard Cartridge (firearms) Singapore Police Force Mouse (computing) Bonsai Revolver Naruto jutsu

does anyone have any good ideas on how to make a scrapbook style coupon organizer i want to make something that will organize coupons according to what category they are in i e food household etc any ideas would be appreciated well buy a scrapbook with plastic pages used to put your scrapbook pages in instead put your coupons in them and label the plastic with the levels of the food pyramid put your coupons in the right plastic slip and if you have left over plastic put furniture coupons or even discount cards in them it would be a lot easier to keep track of them and it would be a lot spacier then categorizing them in food considering how many foods there are  Bond Tamper-evident Scrapbooking Floppy disk Charles Ponzi Hamster Fixed income Marathon (computer game) Plastic Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Retailer MapleStory Zero coupon bond Radio controlled car Loyalty program Price discrimination TurboGrafx 16 Music genre Fast bowling Rational pricing Staples, Inc.

any tips for picking the right pack to pull from a box of sports cards when i buy baseball or football cards from a store like wal mart or target how do i figure out which pack in a box has a card that's actually worth something my advise is to never buy packs from an open box the reason is there are actually people that make their living going from store to store to search those pack for the inserts high value card i am speaking from experience as i personally know someone who does this for a living he would search packs at walmart and target and then sell the cards online or to a card store he actually goes to about stores a day he even have a deal with a few card shop owner to search packs at their shop also the way he does it is by feeling the packs and also weighing the packs inserts jersey card etc usually are thicker or have a different texture of course i am not saying that you would never get anything of value if you buy packs from an open box because there are some high value card that just could not be differentiated with the regular card simply by feeling the packs or weighing them autograph for example but your odds are just worse another reason not to is that most serious collector would keep on buying from the box until they got the high value card insert and then stop buying so usually card shop owner or retailer would combine a few searched box into one box to make it look like a full box to conclude save your money until you could afford a full box buy the box and keep opening packs until you get the high value insert use the odds listed on the box you are suppose to get then sell the rest of the packs online and let someone else be the fool  Wal-Mart Surveillance Tesco Sears Holdings Corporation Poker jargon Retailer IPod Sega Saturn Gramophone record Internet fraud IBM PC compatible Vending machine Nintendo DS Textile manufacturing Yu-Gi-Oh!

has anyone ever made a photo quilt or a photo pillow i'm looking for instructions on how to make a photo quilt or a photo pillow the photo pillow uses quilt squares per side do you know of a website where i can get step by step instructions on how to make one there are two issues here how to get the photos onto the fabric and what pattern to use the pattern part is easy you can use any pattern with a space large enough for your photo you can use blocks patterns that have large center spaces or you can simply add sashing strips to the photos and assemble them however you like the first link below is to a website with over free quilt block patterns the second is to a bunch of photos of photo quilts you can use for inspiration as for putting the photos on fabric there are a few alternatives i would avoid the iron on transfer paper that you can get at most office stores the photo doesn't last either it fades or it peels it's fine for making a t shirt but i wouldn't use it in a quilt you can buy paper backed fabric that is made to go through your inkjet printer at many craft and fabric stores there are several different brands so be sure to read the instructions and choose what will work best for you some cannot be washed some need to be heat set before washing also check what kind of printer you have the kind of ink will affect how well it works on the fabric a word of warning these fabric sheets are not cheap you get three or four sheets for upwards of if you're going to use more than that i'd recommend making your own sheets using bubble jet set and bubble jet rinse to prepare the fabric iron a piece of freezer paper to the back of the fabric so it will go through your printer  Mattress Upholstery Computer printer Casting Textile manufacturing terminology Inkjet printer Quilt Textile manufacturing Symmetry CPU cache Knitting RISC Compiler optimization Oscilloscope Quilting Printed circuit board Applique Printmaking Japanese tea ceremony Typewriter Redundant array of independent disks Plastic Brewery Clothing Menstrual cup Medical prescription PDP-8 Konica Minolta Photocopying System/36 Dot matrix printer Tire ZX Spectrum Dairy Yohoho!

what materials do i need to make a dummy wedding cake the best way to make a dummy wedding cake is to get dense styrofoam in the shape you wish the cake pieces to be either round or square you then cover the styrofoam with royal icing this type of icing hardens very fast so you need to work quickly to get a smooth finish another way is to cover the styrofoam with marzipan icing which can be purchased rather than making it yourself you will then need to purchase the type of pillars you might want to separate the pieces or the cake or layer the pieces one on top of the other but in either case you need to ice the layer before you assemble the cake you will need to use royal icing as glue to stick the pieces together next you need to get a piping bag and tips to pipe your decorations onto the cake you should again use royal icing for this but can colour the icing used for piping to give it a more exciting look lastly you can add your cake top and pipe around the bottom of it to help it stick to the cake it might take a few tries but it is fun to make your own wedding cake  Polystyrene Cake Violin Pottery Casting Guitar Cookie Bong Wedding cake Cuisine of Denmark Mattress Christmas tree Bread Diamond Woodworking Marzipan Doughnut Skiing Glacier Enceladus (moon) Mochi Knitting Forge Glaze Drill bit Radio controlled airplane Kimono Billiards Tofu Nunchaku Ammunition Dairy Pastry bag Glossary of nautical terms Glass Wood carving Tire Spidey Super Stories Textile manufacturing terminology Mooncake Ice Seismic retrofit Climbing equipment Birthday Diving suit Brazing Vermicompost Chicago-style pizza Leaf Cookware and bakeware Dim sum GunBound Culture of Korea Repouss__ and chasing Katana Homestar Runner Upholstery Leather Manifold Double bass Shoe Soap bubble Carbon fiber Ice core Loudspeaker Chopsticks Brewery Textile manufacturing Anchor Chair Beehive (beekeeping) Sea ice Rigging Boat building Amateur telescope making Cross-country skiing Curling Dredge Stairway Classical order Baked Alaska Coffee Roswell UFO incident Land mine King cake Stainless steel Colours, standards and guidons Ice hockey Solar cell Kilt Quilting New York Giants Stucco Smoking pipe Stage lighting Harp

how long is a piece of string php echo this is a constant string php echo this is an interpolated string init string add string 'this' add string ' ' add string 'is' add string ' ' add string 'an' add string ' ' add string 'interpolated' add string ' ' add var echo where represents the compiled variable named string looking at these opcodes init string allocates an is string variable of one byte to hold the terminating null then it's realloc'd to five bytes by the first add string 'this' plus the terminating null next it's realloc'd to six bytes in order to add a space then again to eight bytes for 'is' then nine to add a space and so on until the temporary string has the contents of the interpolated variable copied into its contents before being used by the echo statement and finally discarded now let's rewrite that line to avoid interpolation and use concatenation instead php does this come out to a simple single opcode nope because the rules necessary to catch a heredoc's end token demand the same careful examination as double quoted variable substitution and you wind up in this case with seventy eight opcodes one init string add strings and a final echo that means a malloc reallocs and a free which will be executed every time that code snippet comes along even the original contents take up more memory because they're stored in distinct zval is string structures why does this happen because there are about a dozen ways that a variable can be hidden inside an interpolated string similarly when looking for a heredoc end token the token can be an arbitrary length containing any of the label characters and may or may not sit on a line by itself put simply it's too difficult to encompass in one regular expression if you're using apc you'll find just such an optimizer built in but not enabled by default to turn it on you'll need to set apc optimization on in your php ini in addition to stitching these run on opcodes back together it'll also add run time speed ups like pre resolving persistent constants to their actual values folding static scalar expressions like to their fixed results e g and simpler stuff like avoiding the use of jmp when the target is the next opcode or boolean casts when the original expression is known to be a boolean value it should be noted that these speed ups also break some of the runtime manipulation features of runkit but that was stuff you probably should have been doing anyway can't use an optimizer because your webhost doesn't know how to set php ini options you can still avoid of the init string add string dilema by simply using single quotes and concatenation or commas when dealing with echo statements it's a simple trick and one which shouldn't harm maintainability too much but on a large complicated script you just might see an extra request or two per second i found this answer by typing the question into my search box  Visual Basic Lisp programming language ALGOL 68 JavaScript Python programming language UTF-8 Java programming language Associative array Control flow Malloc Common Lisp Brainfuck C plus plus Quicksort Regular expression Objective-C Polymorphism (computer science) MUMPS Hash table Computer numbering formats Ethernet Static single assignment form Compiler Stack-smashing protection Redundant array of independent disks Exception handling Floppy disk Addressing mode Objective Modula-2 SHA hash functions Computer virus PL/SQL Optimization (computer science) Programming language Password CPU design IBM 1401 Unicode C Sharp Tcl Scheme programming language Emacs Quotation mark Halting problem Data General Nova EIA-708 Buffer overflow Prolog X86 RISC XML Pi-calculus Compact disc Central processing unit AWK programming language Icon programming language Windows XP Categorical list of programming languages Self-modifying code MOS Technology 6502 File Allocation Table Page table Object-oriented programming Microeconomics Shader Artificial neural network Fortran Bash Vector (spatial) X86 assembly language Boolean logic Abstraction (computer science) Internet Relay Chat Perl 6 Array Transmission Control Protocol Rabin-Karp string search algorithm Motorola 68000 PDP-8 Class (computer science) Microsoft Jet Database Engine Manifold

scale model car what kind of glue do i use for a scale model car can i use crazy glue use model glue it is specifically designed to work with those types of plastics you find in most model kits these days crazy or super glue will eat up the plastic and deform it so your model will either look warped or get ruined because pieces don't match up just so you know they make two kinds of model glue these days one has fumes that are toxic and should be used only with adult supervision the other is basically the same but non toxic fume wise and takes a few minutes longer to dry  Scale model Plastic Model aircraft Hamster Ship model O scale Welding Super Deformed Gundam Model robot Bong Radio controlled airplane Bullet Manifold Cyanoacrylate Chevrolet Corvair Floppy disk Airfix Fume hood Plastic model Inhalant Coconut crab Casting Harmonica Domain Name System Screw Leather Bicycle frame Solar cell Guitar Coupling (railway) Carnivorous plant IPod Ford Crown Victoria Transformer Multiple chemical sensitivity Testor Corporation Model car Peanut Chlorine Atari ST Radio controlled car Blade Liger Gramophone record E85 Laser engraving Tamiya Corporation Professional wrestling match types Beverage can stove Explosive material Piano Traditional animation Warhammer 40,000 Perl Fire extinguisher Suicide methods Chevrolet Camaro Embedded system Carburetor Tire Cello Porsche 911 Cross-country skiing M16 (rifle) Car handling Origami Illegal drug trade Gas metal arc welding Hand grenade Hydrochloric acid Pottery Table saw Photography Psilocybin Product Lifecycle Management Kashrut Lisp programming language Wright brothers Final Fantasy Geographic information system Mercury Cougar Toyota Camry Model-view-controller Symmetry Meccano Toy train Upholstery Adhesive Fixed-wing aircraft Otitis media Porsche 993 Slide rule Chopsticks Object-oriented programming Homebuilt aircraft The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Lego Ramen Sea-Monkey Superhero

does anyone know of a alternative to use for modeling dope trying to finish covering a balsa wood model ran out and car is in the shop thanks nick model dope is usually just gloss enamel so any enamel would substitute if the model is all balsa you could even use latex paint and then give it a coat of polyurethane or other varnish to make it shiny if you are making one of those airplane kits that have tissue paper over the wings you shouldn't use any water base paint as it would dissolve the tissue paper by the way nail polish is gloss enamel and comes in lots of colors so maybe you could borrow some from a friend or relative  Model aircraft Lacquer Radio controlled airplane Varnish Polyurethane Vitreous enamel Glaze Plastic Tooth enamel Casting Testor Corporation Titanium Pottery Wood Epoxy Tooth Rail transport modelling Laser engraving Mattress Brush Light-emitting diode Woodworking X-4 Bantam Manicure Latex Toilet paper Shellac Condom Doomsday argument Wood carving Leaf Solar cell Violin Polystyrene Cosmetics Leather Dodge Charger Rubber and PVC fetishism Homebuilt aircraft Fixed-wing aircraft Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Marilyn Manson Antimony Order of the White Eagle Primer (paint) Cloisonn__ Jute Portrait miniature BMW M5 Hydrogen American Pie (song) Lionel Corporation Hydrochloric acid Fire Nine Inch Nails Pennsylvania Railroad Ford Motor Company Gelatin Fluoride therapy Chromium Dental caries Shroud of Turin Scale model Cyanoacrylate M.C.

how do you knot stretchy jewellery cord b c whenever i attempt to tie the knot after stringing the beads the knot always unravels it's so frustrating if you are talking about stretch magic and those strong elastic cords you hold both pieces together between your pointer and thumb make sure you have a lot of string here to work with it makes it much easier you waste some but it is worth it then you pull the ends with your other hand and wrap both ends around your fingers your starting piont put the ends through the hole made around your fingers and pull the ends out and pull hard it also works best if you have a pointed object to stick in the hole you made and then pull tight so you get the knot very close to your bead after you made the knot you can double it if you would like or take each end in and pull apart to make the knot smaller then pull the knot into a bead to cover it up i hope this helps if not email me again and i will try again i make beaded jewelry on stretch all the time  Textile manufacturing Knot Violin Knitting Textile manufacturing terminology Rope Sling (weapon) Shoelaces Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Mouse (computing) Archery Harp Escapology Earring Bowline Guqin Chopsticks Magic (illusion) Climbing equipment Filigree Clarinet Glossary of American football Cello Wire Nunchaku Screw Knot theory Double bass Necktie Wood Naruto jutsu Sail-plan Menstrual cup Abacus Jewellery RuneScape quests Fast bowling Bong Bass guitar Sniper Bassoon Brazing Tefillin Hand grenade Avalanche Trapping Undergarment Internal ballistics Table tennis Glossary of nautical terms Woodworking Mattress Wire wrap Backstroke Parachute Hangman's knot Berimbau Shirt String instrument Barbed wire Basic English Equine conformation Salad Fingers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bow (music) Sitar Boy Scouts of America Badminton Sheepshank Pearl Guitar Cleveland Browns Horizontal bar Comanche Skateboarding trick Knots Landing BS 1363 Kitesurfing Flax Straitjacket String theory Professional wrestling throws Chess strategy and tactics Linked list Falconry Coin magic I Ching divination Leather New York Giants Plastic bag Drill bit Domestic AC power plugs and sockets

can you cook fimo twice i am making a hill with people on top and i want to know if i can cook the hill put the people on top and then cook the whole thing but i don't want to try because it can sometimes ruin it the answer to this depends a lot on several factors but bascially if you can make sure the temperature never goes above the temperature you're supposed to be using theoretically polymer clay can be baked for a very long time and baked repeatedly it can be hard to make sure that temp never rises though and certain brands of clay will darken more easily if baked longer than necessary like sculpey premo kato fimoclassic and even fimosoft would darken less and be stronger after baking too there are ways to protect the items you're baking though so that probably wouldn't be a problem as long as you buy and use a cheapie oven thermometer at grocery store as well many ovens don't actually heat to the exact temp shown on their dials or the temp can spike even after preheating also you don't mention the thickness of the items you'd be baking you shouldn't bake polymer clay itesm that are thicker than anywhere because they can crack you'd need to use an armature underneath like scrunched aluminum foil or a form like a bowl or something else underneath that could be removed after baking if you needed more than that thickness you can find loads of info on all these baking things on this page as well as strategies for avoiding darkening or scorching the clay etc http glassattic com polymer baking htm btw you can bake the items together or you can make them separately then join them after baking or you can make the people and bake them to harden then impress them into the raw clay hill and bake the hill then join them back etc how you'd connect the pieces would depend a lot on their sizes and how they'd fit together though if they were all baked you could join them with a part epoxy glue or even e if one were raw and the other baked you might want to use liquid clay instead then bake them together possibly also joining them with a wire or toothpick between for added strength check out this page for more on glues that can be used with raw and or baked polymer clays http glassattic com polymer glues diluent htm and look on this page for almost any other topic you'd like to read up on about polymer clay http glassattic com polymer contents htm hth and good luck diane b  Casting Welding Plastic Pottery Bread Cookware and bakeware Epoxy Pizza Aluminium Paint Brewery Coffee Explosive material Transformer Solar cell Bicycle frame Glass Knife Dairy Floppy disk Fiberglass HyperText Transfer Protocol Baking Domain Name System Printed circuit board Wok XML Pancake Thermal power station Mattress Seismic retrofit Motor oil Steel Gas metal arc welding Temperature Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Upholstery Theory of conduct Katana Barbecue Tofu Hash table Tire Paragliding Slow cooker CPU cache Opportunity rover Poker jargon Carbon dioxide Manifold Nuclear power Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fire fighting Polystyrene Horseshoe Equine conformation Violin IPod Carbon nanotube Polymer Strap-on dildo Ice cream Portland cement Handloading Drill bit Bacon Bong Adhesive Brazing Kosher foods Tissue engineering Glacier Photolithography Roswell UFO incident Magnetism Diving suit Legal research Geology of the Moon RuneScape skills Professional wrestling match types Alcoholic beverage Egg (food) Textile manufacturing Liquid crystal Cuisine of Denmark Motility Mokume-gane Sling (weapon) Shoe Cocaine Polyethylene terephthalate

why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle if it's a solvent glue the solvent stops it from sticking when exposed to air the solvent evaporates leaving the glue itself to stick this is why solvent glue smells so much you can smell the evaporating solvent the solvent spreads away from the glue so it can stick in the bottle the solvent still evaporates but it can't go anywhere so the glue doesn't stick to the bottle as eventually it reaches an equilibrium so solvent particles leaving the glue and re entering the glue mixture as there's more and more air in the bottle however there will be less and less solvent in the bottle so glue will become more viscous over a long period of time in an empty bottle  Solvent Adhesive Acetic acid Ammonia Concentration Perfume Ethyl acetate Water (molecule) Bong Dry cleaning Cyanoacrylate Opportunity rover Nuclear fallout Evaporation Polyethylene terephthalate Chloroform Chromatography Dimethylformamide Tetrachloroethylene Paint Coffee Vacuum Water Hydrogen peroxide Soluble Solution Reverse osmosis Printed circuit board Timeline of the Universe Viscosity Black hole Piccolo Junior Saga Brewery Benzene Navier-Stokes equations Colloid Water vapor Cross-country skiing Radio controlled airplane White phosphorus incendiary Air pollution Phase (matter) Distillation Micro-encapsulation Ocean thermal energy conversion Varnish Glacier Hawking radiation Laundry detergent Air conditioning Water resources Rain Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Clinker (boat building) Concrete Event horizon Diethyl ether Nail (anatomy) Weapon Tetrahydrofuran Lacquer Liquid crystal Mass spectrometry Ethanol Polychlorinated biphenyl Charles Goodyear Inhalant Dairy Instant coffee Petroleum The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Klein bottle Chemical equilibrium Multiple chemical sensitivity Action potential Aerosol spray Carburetor Tofu Dimethyl sulfoxide Stuck Together, Torn Apart Alcohol Incandescent light bulb Guitar Lightstick Homer Simpson Cocaine Alkane M__bius strip Hash oil Tissue engineering Alum Alcoholic beverage Floppy disk Honey Casting Solid solution Gilding

my kid has alot of yugio cards has yugio come and gone or are these a sellable collectable still people still collect and buy the cards the value of the collection will depend on which cards your kid has and the condition of the cards a good way to get a feel for the value of the ones you have would be to look on ebay and compare what you have to what has sold if you have just ordinary cards they probably won't be worth very much money however if you have one of the rarest ones it could sell for a pretty high price look under yugioh and yugio since people use different spellings when they list good luck  Philatelic investment Monopoly (game) Yu-Gi-Oh!

painting on fabric very basic questions i want to paint a rose on a thin synthetic fabric transparent chifonne i want it to look like watercolor it would be a part of my dance costume so it only needs to look good from far away it doesn't need to be a great masterpiece i found this website http www dharmatrading com that seems to have everything i possibly need but the question is what do i need i think i need a dye not a paint am i correct what is french dye what is jacquard silk dye maybe i should use something completely different what resist should i use if you have an answer to any of those questions i'd really appreciate it i have a lot of spare fabric pieces to experiment with first off if your fabric is synthetic like you say dye isn't going to work if the dye can't soak into the fiber it won't stay pretty much unless your synthetic is rayon you'll perhaps want to think about paint acrylics should work if you water them down and they should act like a watercolor wherever you purchase your acrylic paint you should be able to find what's called textile medium i can't remember if it's delta applebarrel or folkart that makes it but it costs about what it does is it will prevent your paint from cracking i would also recomment finding some way to keep the fabric not stretched but taut either seriously weighted down all around or push pinned at relatively close intervals with white paper or waxed paper underneath good luck to answer some of your other questions the jacquard silk dyes work beautifully and if you want a watercolor effect it is pretty much exactly what you want but it's designed for silk resists are best if you're doing a complete dye and want a specific area or design to remain the original color of the fabric resists are also good if you want to contain a design within an area but are really only necessary if you're painting with a really watered down dye  Plastic Textile manufacturing terminology Watercolor painting Dye Paint Textile manufacturing Weaving Knitting Textile Jute Yarn Undergarment Acrylic paint Indigo dye Carpet Diamond Leather Mattress Upholstery Sari Cloth Traditional animation Inkjet printer Casting Rubber stamp Silk Turquoise Fiberglass Batik Clothing Screen-printing Shroud of Turin Carbon fiber Bong Strap-on dildo Technicolor Photography Printmaking Rope Korean art William Perkin Light-emitting diode Zipper Wood carving Lapis lazuli Violin Parachute Tallit De Lorean DMC-12 Copy protection Chromium Wood Theory of conduct Pysanka Model aircraft Floppy disk Painting English longbow Tzitzit Titanium Bow (music) Ammolite Cross-stitch Cochineal Epoxy Pastel High-heeled shoe Staining (biology) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Crimson Brush Paper marbling Polymethyl methacrylate Paintball Metallurgy Kilt Bulletproof vest Kite flying Lacquer Hand grenade Printed circuit board Nylon Condom Pigment Han Chinese clothing Fan (implement) Headgear Hair coloring Reinforced concrete World Wide Web Handloading Economics Swimsuit Christo and Jeanne-Claude Book Intelligent design Dyneema Drawing

crochet and knitting help when you finish a afghan and you have strings hanging from the end how do you weave them thru so that when you wash it or use it they dont come back out it already been made so i cant just crochet them as you go thread a a plastic yarn needle it bends which makes it easier to maneuver with the end of the yarn gently weave the yarn into the back side of the afghan making sure not to pull it too tight lock the yarn by weaving back in the opposite direction pull a little tight and snip the yarn then smooth the afghan fabric so the yarn end pulls back into the afghan some people actually secure the yarn by tacking it down using a matching thread just to make sure it is a pain but it makes such a difference to the project that it is worth it ps congrats on finishing the afghan  Textile manufacturing Knitting Yarn Textile manufacturing terminology Crochet Weaving Textile Lace-making Knitting needle Upholstery Spinning (textiles) Stocking Professional wrestling holds Rope Wool Cloth Linen Horse Swingout Loom Jute Carbon fiber Knife Professional wrestling throws Felt Window blind Cashmere wool Mattress Domesticated turkey Clothing Sari Drill bit Tire Carpet Cotton mill Aerial (dance move) Glossary of American football Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling attacks Undergarment Canoe John Kay (flying shuttle) Sailing Cotton Suplex Alpaca Silk Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Windsurfing Suture Tatting Nylon Kimono Velcro Haircut Hydraulic machinery Sin City Horse tack Chair Condom Equine conformation Climbing equipment Menstrual cup Lathe Pottery Tights Sewing Jacquard loom Horse gait Poker jargon Badminton American Revolution Shotgun Rigging Glossary of partner dance terms Screw Floyd Rose Fly fishing Spinning Jenny Earring Soap Kitesurfing Heckler & Koch G3 Fecal incontinence Rugby union positions Motorcycle Ikat Braid Venipuncture Professional wrestling slang Hand grenade Piledriver (professional wrestling) Casting Internal ballistics Thread (computer science) Heckler & Koch MP5 Barbell (piercing) M16 (rifle)

why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the glue bottle okay i'm not disputing the fact that air makes glue dry and stick to stuff but even if you left the cap off the glue long enough for all the glue in the bottle to dry it still wouldn't stick to the bottle so i guess the real question is why doesn't glue stick to plastic because any time you put glue on plastic it doesn't really stick with very little effort the glue will come off the plastic so what's the property between plastic and glue that they don't stick to one another many glues don't stick to plastic but some do in general smooth materials like plastic especially teflon or metal are difficult to glue but porous materials like wood or paper or even fabric are easy to glue if you look at the surface of the paper with a magnifying glass you will see a lot of little bumps and dips the glue penetrates in there imagine what happens to the glue when it dries inside the pores it's acting like a bunch of little claws plastic surface is too smooth for a regular glue you need to use special glues that partially dissove the plastic and make it stick superglue works like this or epoxy resins  Plastic Printed circuit board Casting Wood Pottery Adhesive Manifold Electrophysiology Boat building Bong Hamster Screw Radio controlled airplane Epoxy Laser engraving Screen-printing Violin Textile manufacturing Sheaf (mathematics) M__bius strip Seismic retrofit Hand grenade Strap-on dildo Floppy disk Chopsticks Cookware and bakeware Polyethylene terephthalate Knife Stucco Cyanoacrylate Ice core Leather Drill bit Upholstery Guitar Model aircraft Ceramics Graphite-reinforced plastic Smoking pipe Fiberglass Deck (ship) Welding Internal ballistics Mouse (computing) Brush Reinforced concrete Printmaking Theory of conduct Homebuilt aircraft Cello Turquoise Billiards Corrosion Table tennis Cross-country skiing Ammonia Teflon Concrete Bicycle frame Weapon Fire extinguisher Stereoscopy Baby bottle Time Out of Mind Volleyball Textile manufacturing terminology Sandpaper Bottle Friction Roller hockey Building material Faster-than-light Recycling Waste management Cardboard Aerial (dance move) Carnivorous plant Tire Bullet Mattress Magnet Slide rule Etching Little Britain Amateur telescope making Polymethyl methacrylate Campfire Jute Explosive material Clinker (boat building) Timpani Carbon fiber Sol gel Organic peroxide Soldering

can i use nylon bead thread with crimp beads hi i am currently working on a project which calls for seed beads to be hung from a metal crown i am using beadalon bead stringing wire with crimp beads but i don't like the way it hangs because frankly it just kinda looks too stiff for my taste i am wondering if i could use some stretchy plastic or nylon type thread with crimp beads or will it slip out thanks i think the crimp beads would weaken or cut nylon or plastic same for thread try gluing the knot or glue the last bead on the string glue will wick into the center whole of the bead if you hold it up to the nozzle and squeeze out a drop of glue alternatives would be leather cord elastic or just some cording that you tie a pretty knot in the end  Glossary of climbing terms Textile manufacturing terminology Screw Knitting Violin Textile manufacturing Rope Climbing equipment Knot Guitar Nunchaku Comanche Suture Leather Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Harp Rigging Abacus Wire Die (manufacturing) Wood D-subminiature Gas metal arc welding Billiards Sail-plan Rosary Lawn mower Prayer beads Cello Sari Bookbinding Hangman's knot Necktie Lathe Radio controlled airplane Knife Undergarment Seismic retrofit Barbell (piercing) Switch Tatting Fishing Nylon Electric guitar Christmas tree Grommet Aluminium Textile Internal ballistics Clothing Tassel Piano Blasting cap Tire Escapology Drill bit Clinker (boat building) Mattress Glass Shotgun Dental brace Hand grenade Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sewing machine Protection (climbing) Shoelaces Carbon nanotube Whip Disentanglement puzzle Chopsticks Plectrum Jute Yarn Barbed wire Basic English Glossary of firefighting equipment Hilt Wrench Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Soldering Guqin Punk rock Diving suit Lane Beehive (beekeeping) Suicide methods Nishi (Tribe) Carpet Fiberglass Applique RuneScape skills Jet (lignite) Reef knot Gramophone record IPod Avalanche

my yr old says he really wants to start collecting and playing warhammer k i'd like to get some info please he knows which armies he'd like but what's a good size army for a complete beginner and do you recommend any particular brand of creature what is the usual cost of this size of army as a mum should i be aware of anything unsuitable scary etc for him is a good age to play this game he has played with older friends at their houses anything else you think would be useful for a beginner to know you can start playing the game with nothing more than a single squad of soldiers which is usually models and costs between and i usually recommend that all beginners do this and even moreso for the younger beginners because it gives you a chance to get to grips with basic painting and modelling techniques and to learn the basic elements of the rules a typical club level army is points all models have a points value depending on how effective they are so two point armies will be roughly equal in capability even if one is numerically superior to the other a point army varies in cost depending on the choice of army and whether you buy new models or acquire old models second hand on ebay is a conservative estimate and it wouldn't be unusual for an army to cost twice this however i know that you could get an army for half this if you were prepared to buy someone else's badly painted old models from ebay well i was when i first started playing i'm now so you can see how addictive it can be the parent company games workshop is well aware of the concerns of parents and carers and takes this into account in most of its publications i never had nightmares from reading the rulebooks myself and my first army was composed entirely of skeletons that said the imagery can be pretty graphic including illustrations of self harm codex witch hunters especially torture mutilation violence and stuff that is known to afficionados as gribbliness that isn't to say don't buy it quite the opposite i'm a full time writer artist with two young sons of my own and i whole heartedly believe that despite this imagery that can shock casual browsers at first glance the hobby is an immensely beneficial one if you'll forgive me i'm going to copy and paste an answer i gave on mumsnet the parenting forum in answer to a similar question most warlike games and in this i include action man gi joe and toy weapons of all sorts involve one good side usually represented by invincible hero characters thwarting one bad side usually represented by powerful but stupid evil characters no one really gets hurt and or injured and it's home in time for tea and medals tabletop wargames stand as a stark contrast to this now the following points apply broadly to all such wargames historical and otherwise but i'll mainly apply the points in detail to the warhammer stable of games warhammer and its sister game warhammer both have a strong context that is a back story that makes the battles fought make sense in both cases the context is a world or a whole galaxy for wh k torn apart by almost constant warfare these worlds are portrayed as bitter terrible places to live where every day is uncertain plagues and monstrosities stalk that land and even death is no end to the constant battle yes this holds a certain grotesque fascination for young boys but no one in their right mind would want to live there in fact it provides an instant and salient lesson of a world where war and conflict is allowed to become the principle political tool of government secondly the battles themselves teach the players that no amount of magic armour or clever tactics can save you from the whims of chance it doesn't matter how many hours you spent painting your general or how beautiful that regiment looks on the tabletop if the dice go against you you're dead meat war it reminds us might be an adventure but it's an adventure that some people don't come back from to expand a little on the wargaming community yes if your only exposure to it is through reluctant forays into games workshop it can seem to be dominated by pony tailed beardies with an unhealthy lara croft heavy metal fixation just remember that there are many more players who aren't in gw because they have jobs to go to a much better idea of the social cross section can be found by going to a wargaming club night there is a national parent organization for wargaming clubs in the uk the gaming club network that sets a code of conduct and sponsors crb checks for club supervisors visit any of these clubs and you will find yes the pony tailed geeks but you will also find doctors lawyers postmen security guards students bank managers accountants dentists psychiatrists computer programmers and film stars will smith and robin williams are both big fans of warhammer and you'll also find children and you'll also find an environment where those children can compete with men three or four times their age as equals yes it is mostly men as i'm sure most of you are more than aware there just doesn't seem to be the same appeal to most women although the proportion of gamers who are women is increasing year on year and some of the world's best miniature painters are women do a google search for victoria lamb for evidence i could go on about what i believe are the positive benefits of wargaming but i'd be here all day suffice to say that examples include craft skills negotiation probability theory diplomacy strategy and a surprising amount of advanced physics while i'm here i'll also speak up in defence of the games workshop staff they are practically unique in that they work for not much more than minimum wage because they passionately love what the company does yes they are all crb checked it's a mandatory pre requirement to work at the shop they will try very hard to answer your questions but they are also working hard to prevent the little s dropped off by parents who think gw is a free creche from nicking the stock and they get a little testy after the twentieth person that day comes in looking for a copy of world of warcraft take note gw does not sell computer games no not even the ones based on their own intellectual property minimum wage part timers remember if you want to speak to someone who has a bit of decent customer service training ask if the manager of deputy manager is available alternatively you can phone their mail order line or visit their online store gw has one of the highest standards of mail order customer service in the world  City of Heroes

simple quilt ideas i'm trying to think of ideas for my next quilt i'm a beginner and have only made a crazy quilt before i would like to do something a little more challenging then a crazy quilt but haven't found anything does anyone have any ideas thanks if you're not quite ready for pieced blocks yet you might want to try something like a trip around the world quilt that's just a bunch of squares all the same size which are sewed together in a pattern that's concentric it ends up being a sort of diamond shape actually a square on point in other words a row of yellow squares then a row of blue squares then a row of purple squares or any color combination you want to make that pattern even more interesting you can also use various shades and tints of each color for the squares rather than just the same fabric and color for them all in other words for blue squares you could use a number of different fabrics each of which reads mainly blue but may have any kind of pattern on it or some other colors they'll usually all go together quite nicely and still be seen mostly as blue when that technique for choosing fabrics is used the quilt is often called a scrap quilt though the concept could be used for almost any type of pieced quilt another easier thing to do is something like you've already done maybe sewing strips of different fabrics together on their long sides to create a long enough unit to go all the way down the length of a quilt do at least or of those long pieced units then sew them to each other on their long sides with a single long strip of fabric in between many of the african or strip quilts are made that way and can look really cool the next thing to do in complexity would be to begin making some of the simpler blocks then joining them together in a quilt with or without lattices between simpler blocks are those which have only rectangles in them like basketweave or rail fence or that have only squares in them like nine patch and some which have squares along with a few half triangles half triangles are a lot easier to do than quarter square triangles or long skinny triangles you can look up quilt examples of any of those names i capitalized above using google's image search to see loads of examples and probably even get specific instructions so start on this page http images google com imghp tab wi then just fill in the window with something like trip around the world quilt or rail fence quilt be sure to use quotation marks around any words that must appear in a certain order then click search images hth and have fun diane b  Wallpaper group Symmetry Quilt Textile manufacturing terminology Mattress Quilting Pascal's triangle CPU cache Lattice (group) Billiards Knitting Flag RISC Applique CPU design Minesweeper (computer game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Fischer Random Chess Kimono Undergarment Colours, standards and guidons Sudoku Compiler optimization Cellular automaton Triangle Transposition cipher Antenna (radio) Casting Yohoho!

is there an way to make silk fabric sturdy i am looking to make a peice of silk fabric stand up straight for an art project thanks for your help the iron on fusible interfacings work quite well but depending on what you are making with it do you have the shape that you want it to be molded you can use watered down white glue to stiffen up fabric it won't be wearable anymore the stitch on interfacings tend to come in heavier strengths so depending on how much you need to stand up you may wish to go this route how thin of a silk are you using what i would do personally would be to take the silk to the fabric store not walmart but a real fabric store and ask the ladies at the cutting table which interfacing will fuse without making the silk look bad if the silk is really thin the fusing may stain the silk good luck  Carpet Mattress Knitting Cloth Glass Kimono Upholstery Parachute Casting Plastic Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Metallurgy Strap-on dildo Christmas tree Powder metallurgy Clothing Leaf Colours, standards and guidons Knife Jute Chair Dry cleaning Sword making Pottery Silk Supernova Sundial Boat building Carbon fiber Model aircraft Bicycle frame Transformer Fiberglass Cross-stitch Sewing machine Nuclear fusion Yarn Welding Crinoline Bulletproof vest Wearable computer Floppy disk Ship model Fuse (electrical) Skirt and dress Shell (projectile) Hakama Carbon nanotube Cannon RISC Spider Iron Embroidery Christo and Jeanne-Claude Headgear Knitting needle Tire Undergarment Wood Bong Diving suit Reinforced concrete Typewriter Hot air balloon Tissue engineering Polystyrene Hand grenade Magnesium Clinker (boat building) Piano Buddhist art Bookbinding Fabrication (metal) Rapid prototyping Seismic retrofit Magnetism Pump It Up Screen-printing Circuit design Screw Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tier One Canoe Sock puppet Cookware and bakeware Geodesic dome Moth Embedded system Solar cell Synthesizer Roof Shroud of Turin Suture Teen Girl Squad Order of St. John Sewing

how do you create a d cartoon i want to figure out how to make a d model of a cartoon and then be able to paint it but the problem is i don't know what materials or tools i need to make it i've been seeing them just this white material it' smade out of but i don't know what it is if you're thinking of a simple d cartoon type figure you can use various types of clays for making those among other things the traditional animation type of figure or object is made with plastalina or a similar clay which is already pre colored that type of clay never dries but stays flexible forever so it can be moved repeatedly for animation shots it's a higher quality of the type of heavy colored clay that kids have used for generations if you're wanting to just make a non flexible cartoon type figure though that will get hard you can use a polymer clay or an air dry clay you can usually do a lot more with polymer clays than most air dry clays but they do need to be baked in a home oven at a low temp for about minutes or so air dry clays will dry instead of curing and that would usually take about a day and the item would shrink somewhat if you want to look into polymer clays i'd suggest starting with a brand like premo which is a strong clay after baking even in thin areas but is still relatively soft when it's unbaked other strong brands would be fimoclassic kato and cernit the sculpeys would be weaker fimosoft would be in between in strength various brands should be available at craft stores art supply stores and online with polymer clays generally the color is built in by using pre colored clays which can be mixed together to create most any color but white or any color polymer clays can also be painted over with a couple of coats of acrylic paint or you can color the clay itself by mixing artists oil paints they come in little tubes or alcohol inks among other things into it the baked clay painted or not can also be given a gloss shine with various acrylic sealers you may have seen the white colored sculpey that comes in a lb box rather than the small packages of white you can use that stuff in the box but just be aware that it's the most easily breakable of the brands types of polymer clay if you want much more info about polymer clays how to use them what all they can do which is a lot more than making little sculpts lessons and links to photo examples check out at least these pages at my online polymer clay encyclopedia http glassattic com polymer kids beginners htm click on sculpting http glassattic com polymer sculpture htm click on whimsical in the websites section for all the other pages at the site look here http glassattic com polymer contents htm hth diane b  Casting Paint Plastic Pottery Drawing Gesso Traditional animation Sculpture Epoxy Light-emitting diode Leather Wood Lacquer Polystyrene Knife XML Cookware and bakeware Transformer Chocolate Solar cell Building material HTML element Polymer Genericized trademark Thermal power station Flour Tofu Glossary of sculpting terms Macromedia Flash Drill bit Mattress Polyethylene terephthalate Strap-on dildo Circuit design Portland cement Objective-C Cascading Style Sheets Hamster Radio controlled airplane Carburetor Hydroponics Polymerization Ajax (programming) Computer Gramophone record Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Model aircraft Illegal drug trade Typewriter Titanium Textile manufacturing terminology Bass guitar Irish dance Ceramics Solar power Yu-Gi-Oh!

tips on sewing stretch interlock fabric i've never sewn stretchy material before and i did a practice dress with extra material my problem was that there was no stretch on the places that i made hems and sewed pieces together when i put the dress on the seams broke because the fabric needed to stretch in some areas and it couldn't do i need stretchy thread how do i fix this problem i have a sewing machine that i am using its a year old could that be the problem am i using the right setting i have like settings sorry for all the questions in one thanks for any advice you can give me or sites that have tips on them i sew my daughter's competition ice skating outfits and while i am not an expert by any means i have a lived with stretch material for years now first one problem that you may have is that you have only two way stretch material take you material in hand and pull and then turn it and see if it pulls just as much on the other side the opposite side but the what's the word ahhhh adjacent side anyway some fabric will stretch almost equally on all four sides and some wont if they aren't then have two way if you do have two way you can still make this into a dress you just need to look at which way you want your stretch to go for instance you don't need your stretch to go from your shoulders to your knees you need it to around your body so just take in cutting your pattern unless it is a pattern fabric and that might pose some problems next when you do sew it you don't need stretchy thread you can get by with a regular not serger machine and just use a zig zag stitch this stitch allows for the stretch and will stop most of the breaking but sew it one way then flip it and sew it the other way to finish the seam this will make it more comfortable to wear and stronger as well some of the other answer mentioned a serger and oh my goodness yes i serger will make your life so much easier but if you don't have a serger it really is still possible to work with stretchy fabrics if you have a ball point or a stretch needle in and there is a special rolling foot that makes it much more sane also you get less problems with grabbing if you use that roller foot best of luck to you  Sewing machine Textile manufacturing terminology Mattress Textile manufacturing Upholstery Sewing Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Drill bit Kimono Bookbinding Softball Carpet Stocking Glossary of climbing terms Knife Swingout Kilt Fast bowling Professional wrestling throws Figure skating Rail terminology Applique Strap-on dildo Backstroke Earring Shoe Volleyball Fencing Shaggy dog story Floppy disk Screw Breaststroke Glossary of ballet terms Swimsuit RuneScape quests Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Punt (boat) Wound Cross-stitch Crochet Leather Equine conformation Diving suit Billiards Diving Embroidery Rugby union Climbing equipment Rope Golf Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Glossary of partner dance terms Skirt and dress Comanche Kayak Weaving Kasparov versus The World Glossary of American football Condom Suture Suplex Metalworking Canoe Shroud of Turin Craps Casting Woodworking Fan (implement) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Violin Lace-making Fecal incontinence Tatting Anchor Corset Wire Double bass Roller hockey Front crawl Baroque chess Chess strategy and tactics Fabrication (metal) Pottery Sari Aikido Mouse (computing) Yarn Glossary of nautical terms CPU design Professional wrestling aerial techniques Lindy Basic

how can i put a regular sticker on a coffee mug and make it dishwasher safe and functional my kids want to decorate a mug with stickers however they also want to use the mug which requires washing it my thought is the stickers will come off in the wash there is a product you can buy at the craft store called glaze that will keep the stickers in place and allow you to gently hand wash the mug as well  Dishwashing Pottery Tattoo Textile manufacturing Dishwasher German car number plates Mug Label Tea Automatic teller machine Houseplant Dairy Menstrual cup US and Canadian license plates Kitchen Glass New Kid on the Block Japanese toilet Toilet humour Neighbours Vehicle registration plate Japanese tea ceremony Topps Hard disk Sento Christmas tree Bike lane debate Arts and crafts Cookware and bakeware Glaze Weaving The Commons Cheese Futurama (TV series - season 5) Washroom Scrapbooking Vista Way Animal Crossing Morphology (linguistics) Upholstery The Inside Hot Coffee mod Dead End Kids Magical thinking Bong Soy protein Breakfast In-N-Out Burger Singlish Humphrey Bogart Science fiction on television Minor Discworld concepts Metal leaf Ablution Bus stop Wallpaper group Single malt Scotch Condom Coffeehouse Beer Friends Yerba mate Wudu Detective Instant coffee Priesthood (Mormonism) Bulk vending Wal-Mart Derbyshire lead mining history Window Fountain Initial D Force Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Doughnut Genericized trademark String (computer science) Clothing Cocoa Greasy spoon Porcelain Yohoho!

what is fingering yarn i crochet knit and was wondering what fingering yarn was fingering yarn refers to yarn of a certain weight it is often also called sock yarn weight in yarn just refers to the thickness also known as gauge of yarn fingering weight yarn usually knits up in us mm needles if you have yarns in the same weight category there might be a slight difference in gauge one may be on the thinner side and one may be a bit heavier on the thicker side this variance is due to various manufacturers also although this won't affect your gauge but just in case you're wondering you may get different balls of yarn in different weights say fingering that look like they are the same thickness and gauge and the package says each ball of yarn is g but the yardage is different this is because certain fibers and fiber blends weigh differently so with all the possible variants it's important for you to knit a swatch to check your gauge with your yarn and count the number of stitches and rows per inch a good pattern will tell you the gauge needed if you don't get the right gauge you will end up with an ill fitting garment check the labels of the yarns the labels always give you gauge and may tell you if it's fingering or baby yarn the craft yarn council of america has a chart of the standard weight system http www yarnstandards com weight html info and profiles of yarn can be found in this yarn directory http www yarndex com source s http www yarnstandards com weight html http www yarndex com  Knitting Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Yarn Knitting needle Crochet Wood Tire Knot Weaving Cartridge (firearms) Uniform Resource Locator Stocking Textile Gramophone record Shotgun Knife Leather Guitar Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Baseball (object) Clarinet Jute World Wide Web Cashmere wool Bicycle frame Gauge (bore diameter) Wool Handloading Clothing HyperText Transfer Protocol Timpani Table tennis Internal ballistics SAML Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rope Web server Digital Spinning (textiles) M16 (rifle) Pressure Transmission Control Protocol Cloth Dialysis Optical fiber Domain Name System Equine conformation Diving cylinder Fiberglass Ethernet Sewing machine Normal distribution Coupling (railway) HTML element Tatting Wget M60 machine gun American football Billiards Terminal ballistics O scale Drill bit Explosive material Piano Rail gauge Lace-making Cookware and bakeware Volleyball Mahjong Cross site scripting Diamond cut Table saw Golf club (equipment) Narrow gauge Radio controlled airplane Mozilla Firefox Dodge Neon Audio tape length and thickness Cotton mill Bicycle Transport Layer Security Spark plug Standard gauge Undergarment Computer numbering formats Baseball HTML Weight training Mossberg 500 Whois Sport rowing Softball

what is the difference between knitting and pearling i have always wanted to know knitting is when one needle goes in up and behind the stitch you're working and purling is when the needle goes in down and in front of the stitch you're working people use knitting combined with purling to change the texture of the piece they're working on for example if you see a ribbed scarf it's usually done by knitting and purling and repeating the pattern it's easier to understand if you see how it's done there are great little videos at www knittinghelp com  Knitting Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Sewing machine Knot Crochet Aran sweater Knitting needle Lace-making Keffiyeh Cross-stitch Kimono Clothing Sewing Felt Linda Purl Aran Islands Applique Stocking Happy Days Pottery Mattress Filet lace VHF omnidirectional range Yarn Carpet Gramophone record Violin Drawing Casting Dodge Neon Strategic management Chainmail Undergarment Lilo & Stitch Sonata form T-shirt Embroidery Humphrey Bogart Suture Berlin wool work Prostate cancer IBM PC compatible Johan Sverdrup Wood carving Mahjong Cyberspace Textile Classical music era Trousers Solar variation XERF Upholstery Triangle (instrument) Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Digital camera Gy__rgy Ligeti Necktie Dynamical system Remix Football (ball) Rib Instrument Landing System Computer animation Double bass Black tie Strap-on dildo Kilt The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa Gag (BDSM) Velvet Laconia, New Hampshire Fugue Computer-supported collaboration Sociocultural evolution Symmetry Sternum Musical form Volkswagen Golf Xingyiquan Conway's Game of Life Dog Music Striped bass Magic (illusion) Grace Cossington Smith Magic (Discworld) Wallpaper group Autostereogram Pink Floyd Cloth Red Hot Chili Peppers Tea Epidural __mile Durkheim Brian May Hubert Selby Jr. Pearl Plunderphonics

i was just wondering do you have to have a liscence to start an online store if you live in a state that has sales tax you have to have a tax license and then if you sell to anyone in your state you have to collect tax and turn it over to your state at certain intervals they will tell you if you don't collect any tax you still have to show them that you did x amount of business but didn't sell to anyone in state that's the only kind of license you would need when it's federal income tax time you do have to declare all of your earnings and you should get a tax preparer to help you or at least a friendly irs agent to show you the right forms to use you should ask your state revenue office if there are certain rules that apply to minors doing business  Tax FairTax U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax protester Income tax United Kingdom corporation tax Value added tax Flat tax Income statement Progressive tax Microeconomics Property tax Limited liability company United States Department of the Treasury Tax resistance 401(k) United States Postal Service Real estate broker Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Accounting methods Prohibition GNU General Public License Copyleft Article One of the United States Constitution Life insurance Tax avoidance/evasion Wal-Mart Inheritance tax Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Dividend Government of Maryland Unemployment benefit Cigarette Primerica Financial Services Corporation Productive and unproductive labour Insurance Public domain Variable universal life insurance Moonshine Social Security (United States) Alcoholic beverage Stamp duty Self-employment Monopoly (game) Surplus value Capital gains tax Retailer Earned income tax credit Cable television Postage stamp Trademark Hybrid vehicle Galactic Civilizations Poll tax Income Salary cap Tesco Nike, Inc.

how can i make find cubes of crushable white foam this is an odd query but i'll try to explain where it's coming from i am looking for a way to create a material or find retail kinda like styrofoam but crushable like a dried mud ball weird huh if anyone is a star trek fan and remembers the episode with the kelvens who turned people into crystalline cubes actually cubes with their corners hacked off that's what i'm trying to re create they were white seem to have started as cubes and looked rather like sponges but they crumbled when you squeezed so that's it quite a challenge i think but you just never know who's got the knowledge you need thanks all i can hardly wait to give your idea a try artistpw thanks and i'll post here how it turns out hi i remembered them too i was able to get a little video of this episode by going over to www startrek com and doing a search on 'kelvan' and from there it let me see a little video of that episode that showed those cubes the material sort of looks like pumice stones that are used to remove calluses but those are too hard to crush in your hand you would just need to find the material to make the items from you might be able to do this perlite looks a lot like styrofoam granules but it is a rock product that has a lot of uses and you can get it from garden centers you could probably mix some perlite up in a medium like a flour and water paste like that which might be used for paper mache you would probably want to cook the paste to make it thicker and then mix the perlite in i'm thinking of a thick paste sort of like the flour mixture made for cream puff type pastries but without the sugar eggs or fat after heating you could probably mix in a drop or two of campho phenique for its preservative properities i've used this for making pastel sticks and it works well to prevent mold from forming on a gum tragacanth solution but it can't take heating i don't know how permanent you might want to make these but i think as long as you dry this out well you would run into any problems with moldering and the items might be able to be crushed in your hand you might be able to dry items made with this concoction in a slow oven at about deg f i'd probably experiment with this mixture before going to the trouble of making a mold once you have your compound to mold you could sculpt a cube like this using a clay like plastlina and get a mold making compound check out the compleat sculptor website for a lot of supplies to make molds and if you check out the wetcanvas website the sculpture channel has at least one step by step article that has directions for making a mold from a d object wetcanvas is a wonderful online artist community and basic membership there is free there are currently more than worldwide members you can browse the site as a guest if you want too hope this helps and at least gives you some ideas email me if you want and i can try to help more i like trying to figure stuff out like this  Casting Brewery Plastic Polystyrene Bread Pottery Coffee Tofu Plaster Hydroponics Flour Glass Ice cream Opportunity rover Cookware and bakeware Japanese cuisine Sugar Houseplant Strap-on dildo Sand casting Origin of life Thermal power station Cuisine of Denmark Cheese Soap Polymer clay Japanese tea ceremony Fire extinguisher RuneScape quests Pancake Bulk vending "Weird Al" Yankovic Carbon dioxide Tea Cuisine of the Philippines Sculpture Dairy Star Trek Customizable Card Game Explosive material Pastel Puff pastry Enzyme Callus Textile manufacturing Iron Wood Jewish cuisine Drawing Idli Sun Food preservation Woodworking Fecal incontinence Legal research Origin belief Soldering Microwave oven Vermicompost Citric acid Hamster Charles Goodyear Paint Psoriasis Ice Gas metal arc welding Sugarcane Dumpling Soy protein Jet engine Chocolate Diatomaceous earth Theory of conduct Nutrition Renewable energy Bengali cuisine Drill bit Kosher foods Water (molecule) USB flash drive Motorcycle Fire fighting Sushi Google Pasta Extreme Programming Code: Lyoko Cuisine of Brazil Cake Sudoku Characters in the Smurfs Bong Homestar Runner Little Britain Diablo II
