how do you start a fire by rubbing two sticks together is their certain materials that i may need to start the fire without matches or a lighter only sticks and tinder making a fire with a stick is as much art as science and a dash of luck there are types of wood traditionally used for making fire with a stick i'm only remember one of them however and that wood is willow these woods are soft and that is important what you do is to make a sort of bowl in a bit of wood pressing the stick into the bowl you rub the stick against the part on the gound to create a little dust collect that dust and then start rubbing the sticks in the back and forth also known as a drill until the friction ignites some of the new dust you have created put that spark onto the dust you created first and slowly blow on the spark to get it to grow into a flame reality check unless you are going to practice a lot a lot this is not a functional way of making fire if you are going to impress someone they will be more impressed if you actually have a fire so have a back up the flint and steel mentioned previously has the same drawbacks you need the partially burned cloth to catch the spark or else you are wasting your time the use of a magnifying glass is also very difficult to do and it is easier to use a plant that has a wood exterior and soft interior that easily breaks with little pressure the use of the bottom of a coke can is more effective for fire making than the magnifying glass and you will need to use chocolate or butter as a polishing compound before attempting to start the fire it is an excellant parabolic reflector and you need only get the distance right to get a good heating to combustion hope this helps i prefer willie pete hydrogen peroxide and other things to rubbing two sticks together  Campfire Internal ballistics Explosive material Survival skills Fire Drill bit Casting Bong Pottery Spark plug Thermal power station Internal combustion engine Plastic Textile manufacturing Knife Diesel engine Naval mine Glass Hand grenade Fire extinguisher Coal Nuclear weapon design Welding Brewery Fire fighting Firearm Barbecue Coffee Wood Amateur telescope making Titanium Motor oil Mattress Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Alkane Tank Solar power Organic peroxide Incandescent light bulb Equine conformation Hydrogen peroxide Strap-on dildo Lathe Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Table saw Hydrogen Microeconomics Cartridge (firearms) Energy development Petroleum Oxyacetylene Spontaneous human combustion Rocket fuel Robot Master Volcano Weapon Hydrogen economy Ammonia Firework Magnesium Cocaine Stage lighting Hindenburg disaster Violin Tinder Two-stroke cycle Nuclear explosion Wood fuel Cleveland Browns RuneScape skills Carbon dioxide Alcohol fuel Fusion power Cannabis (drug) Bullet Seismic retrofit Plaster Glossary of wildland fire terms Furnace Haloalkane Carburetor Ammonium nitrate Jet engine Passenger car Timpani Billiards Upholstery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Steam engine Bicycle brake systems Shoe

is it better to put dry ice on the top of an ice chest or on the bottom with the foot on top hi brian if you put only dry ice in the cooler you will have frozen everything so a small block of dry ice in the bottom keep it wrapped in the paper you buy it in cover the dry ice with at least inch of regular chip ice then add your food drink and a little more chip ice on top the dry ice will prevent the regular ice from melting as quickly is used for drinks and no dry ice in that one we've camped for a week this way normally we use one cooler with the dry ice for meat and food that absolutely needs to stay cold a second cooler the first time you may want to check the dry ice cooler frequently foods near the bottom may start to freeze slightly so you'll need to pull your dinner food out and into the drinks cooler in the morning to make sure you don't have a frozen meatsickle for dinner  Ice cream Death Valley National Park Coffee Tofu Poker jargon Diving suit Food preservation Cooler Basement Carbon dioxide Gatorade Water (molecule) Climate of the United Kingdom Drowning Sea ice Ice age In-N-Out Burger Sento Fecal incontinence Vermicompost M16 (rifle) Bong Glossary of climbing terms Dim sum Milkshake Domesticated turkey Pizza Severe weather terminology (United States) Mr. Freeze Freezing Carburetor Textile manufacturing Lake Hemp Polyethylene terephthalate Desert Peruvian cuisine Water Avalanche Cuisine of the Philippines Soft drink Glacier Tea Cloud Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark Cha chaan teng Wine Hamster Fancy rat Ice Little Ice Age Diseases of the honeybee Winter storm Freeze drying Drill bit Iditarod Ramen Wok French fries Ice hockey Bread Air conditioning Dairy Yosemite National Park Items in the Metroid series Russian cuisine Professional wrestling throws Happy Tree Friends Hamburger Pliocene Futurama (TV series - season 2) Pea Meal Japanese tea ceremony Stanley Cup Champagne (beverage) Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Brazil Urinary incontinence Japanese cuisine Overclocking Alcoholic beverage Fog Fishing Pottery Hyperthermia French cuisine Mars Sandwich Cider Sushi Food storage Standard enthalpy change of fusion Maize Cruising (maritime) Fish and chips

what are some ways to stay cool while camping in the summer my kids insist on camping this summe before school starts back the only problem is that it is degrees go to a river you can't beat a cool flowing river for staying cool you could rent an rv with ac and go to a place with electric hookups but you ought to be doing stuff with your kids even when you are not in the water many river valleys are ten to twenty degrees cooler than the rest of the countryside your kids will enjoy the water a lot as well and you will not have trouble entertaining them or getting them to sleep at night the rv might not be a bad idea anyway if you are not skilled with open fire meals and you do not have a camp stove it also eliminates the need to go buy about other things you have to have for camping and will not know you needed till after dark the first night some of the things you might forget that are important for camping sun block bug spray toilet paper for tent camping extra blankets they can realy make for a better nights sleep and i have had a sleeping bag taken in the river before lighting i recommend a couple flashlights for trips to the potty or exploration and two train lanterns that will burn all night on one tank of oil don t forget the oil and batteries plenty of ice and plenty of water put all the blankets on top of your coolers during the day pack meat in a separate cooler from drinks and snacks if you can or in a plastic container buried under everything else freeze everything you can before you pack ecept your first meal plan a uncooked meal at lunch time and start fires half an hour or more before you plan to cook a large laundry soap jug is best for keeping hand wash water on the outskirts of camp one with a spigot works the absolute best just refill with river water lawn chairs and fun noodles are a good idea you do not need a chair for everyone but at least one per adult and one more is a good idea fun noodles are cheap and they do not leak like blow up water toys last but not least time out at the river is ten thousand times better than time out any place else  Cruising (maritime) Kitchen Textile manufacturing Autonomous building Solar power Portable stove Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cha chaan teng Thermal power station Coffee Emergency preparedness Ice cream Japanese tea ceremony Breakfast Ramen Water Community emergency response team Korean cuisine Social rule Genericized trademark Plastic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Customs and etiquette of Japan Cuisine of Denmark Fire fighting Mercury Atlas 6 Avenue Q Carburetor Japanese toilet Milk Tea John McDouall Stuart Daylight saving time Bong International response to Hurricane Katrina Carbon dioxide Ocean's Twelve Blood (computer game) The Suffering (game) Knots Landing 2003 North America blackout Fecal incontinence Fire extinguisher Siphon Hamster Hydrogen economy Futurama (TV series - season 2) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Poker jargon 613 mitzvot In-N-Out Burger The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fuel cell Philmont Scout Ranch Sewage treatment Sento Dundas Square Mattress EastEnders Camp Lazlo Hiking The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items P-47 Thunderbolt The Fairly OddParents E85 The Contender (television series) Death Valley National Park The Amber Spyglass Fishing RuneScape quests Pitaten Meat Loaf Tank The Life and Times of Juniper Lee German cuisine Blankets (graphic novel) USS Tunny (SS-282) Urban beach Fossil fuel power plant Urinary incontinence Renewable energy Climate of the United Kingdom Insomnia Meal Sauna 2005 Iditarod Hamburger Bicycle lighting Shawn Michaels Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve </TEXT>
