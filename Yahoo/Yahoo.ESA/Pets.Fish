fish seems to be dying i have feeder goldfish for over two years one is slightly larger than the other and seems to have always had a few health problems but usually bounces back with time this time he really looks bad and seems to be suffering he is twisting and twirling around in the tank and has been face down tail up in the gravel since last night he is still using his gills but it looks like the end is there something i can or should do to ease his passing the most humane way to euthanize goldfish or any other pet fish is to use oil of clove it's usually available at any health food vitamin store just ask as sometimes they keep it behind the counter i paid for my last bottle clove oil when added to water anesthesizes the fish and puts them to sleep here are the directions put your sick dying fish in a gallon bucket pail or jar filled with clean dechlorinated water usually water from their tank and or pond take a small jar with a lid and fill halfway with water add to this small jar about drops of the clove oil put the lid on the small jar and shake vigorously you want the oil to mix with the water as much as possible this is what you call emulsifying the oil once the clove oil is mixed extremely well open the small jar and pour the water oil mixture into the the bucket pail with the fish gently stir so the oil water mixture is completely mixed with the water but don't scare the fish the fish will slowly fall asleep and gill activity will cease after about minutes go check on your fish watch it for at least minutes to make sure the gill movements are completely still that the fish has in fact died this procedure is recommended by vets and humane societies in fact some vets use this method to do surgery on expensive fish such as koi of course they use less drops and when these anesthesized fish are placed back in fresh water no clove oil they usually recover from their slumber quickly people say to kill their fish by other means but all those other ways bring needless pain and fear to those tiny fishey lives freezing slow freezing causes ice crystals to form in their bodies they are extremely painful to the fish especially if it was happening in the dark of a freezer would you want to go through that putting them into rubbing alcohol yes it kills them instantly but the alcohol burns their gills so much it's liks someone pouring rubbing alcohol down your nose and throat burns all the way down needless pain for these little critters of god cutting their heads off don't you all remember the french guillotine they banned it for its inhumanity for a reason squashing them how would you like to be squashed being flushed does flushing really kill them immediatly maybe yes maybe no it does put them in a terrible environment in the deepest dark just think how you would like to be flushed down a toilet suddenly plunged into ice cold water whirled and sucked downward into darkness not knowing where you were gonna end up then plunging into acidic water a sewage system filled with who knows what rats excrement you can't breathe you can't see the last few minutes of your life are utter agony utter turmoil you don't know what you did wrong you honored your god for years with loyalty and this is how they reward you as you slowly suffocate to death in the innards of some city's sewer system shame on those who flush live fish down toilets shame on you do the humane thing use clove oil to treat your fishy friends to a humane death ken  Sewage treatment Cat Blood (computer game) Breastfeeding Tea Bong Water Poker jargon Ice cream Autonomous building Sento Cocaine Sin City Carbon dioxide Carburetor Shaggy dog story Tlingit Urinary incontinence Dairy Sea-Monkey Flush toilet Japanese toilet Brewery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Capital punishment Food preservation Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Coffee Fish farming Polychlorinated biphenyl Naruto jutsu Fancy rat Ecco the Dolphin Fire fighting Suicide methods Siphon Mayonnaise E85 Fire extinguisher Conspiracy (TNG episode) Thermal power station Ferret Prostate cancer Kain (Legacy of Kain) Toilet humour Hamster Drill bit Happy Tree Friends Acne Rebreather RuneScape quests Sake The Shining (film) Marine aquarium Tocopherol Hydrogen peroxide Simone Weil Toilet Wine Professional wrestling throws Drowning Internal ballistics Shark Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kosher foods Beer Kashrut Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Immortality Menstrual cup Tattoo Sulfuric acid Aquarium Axolotl Sleep Yoga Sutras of Patanjali First aid Plastic Traumatic brain injury Glossary of climbing terms YuYu Hakusho Angel Sanctuary Methamphetamine Diving Peanut butter Water (molecule) Pneumonia Futurama (TV series - season 5) Whaling CPU cache

how could you prevent sickness i had a sick fish in the tank but i got it out close to its death he wouldn't eat anything and would swim only at the top right past the fish flakes then he would come down and lie down a bit on the bottom then come back up is this contagious if it is what can i add into the water to prevent it from reaching into my other fish first rule when you spot a sick fish take it out and keep it in another tank i call those hospital tank next change of the water in your original tank this helps to dilute the poor quality water which probably cause your fish to fall ill and reduce the concentration of parasites or bacteria in your original tank water and hopefully your other fishes in the tank doesn't catch them it's hard to diagnose what disease your fish is suffering but he probably has some form of swim bladder problem since he's lying down at the bottom from that i suspect it could be some kind of internal bacteria infection you can try dosing general anti bacteria you can buy from the aquarium shop hopes this helps  Pneumonia Foodborne illness Common cold Shark Sea-Monkey Infectious disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sewage treatment Asthma Urinary incontinence Bacteria Fish farming Rocky Mountain spotted fever Diarrhea Chronic fatigue syndrome Disinfection Medicine Psoriasis Aquarium Disease Legionellosis Virus Guinea pig Prostate cancer Multiple sclerosis Malaria Discus (fish) Clownfish Intravenous therapy Poker jargon Vitamin C Tuberculosis Dairy Water purification Cyanide 2001 anthrax attacks Bladderwort Iron Sexually-transmitted infection Crohn's disease Halitosis Decompression sickness Swimming Seine (fishing) Thermal power station Sleeping sickness Traumatic brain injury Paracetamol Tooth enamel Oily fish Livestock Carnivorous plant Escherichia coli Sickle-cell disease Smallpox Swimming pool Anthrax Siphon Solar power Omega-3 fatty acid Crayfish Rabies Allergy Rebreather Factory farming Ebola Lake Fish Minamata disease Cancer Body piercing Stingray H5N1 Hypoglycemia Salmon Sodium hypochlorite Tsetse fly Gas bladder Folic acid Ecology Fancy rat Radiation poisoning Clinical depression Acne Goldfish Diseases of the honeybee Nutrition DDT Bipolar disorder Fishing

we have a piece of coral my husband got snorkeling can we put it in a freshwater aquarium well yes you can but no you shouldn't coral even if boiled to a sterile salt free state will cause the water hardness to rise to levels unhealthy for fresh water fish this is due to the fact that coral is made up of calcium and that calcium will slowly dissolve into the water when the hardness reaches levels deemed unsafe the coral will have to be removed this is harmful because you will subsequently lose a substantial amount of nitrifying bacteria in your aquarium and this will cause an ammonia spike and possibly a nitrite spike afterwards if you have a high fish load which will be quite stressful to the fish in short coral is not a good idea as a freshwater decoration hope this helps you jason c  Marine aquarium Aquarium Fishing Sewage treatment Coral reef Water purification Water (molecule) Eutrophication Hard water Cyanide Reef tank Coral Calcium Water Tooth Crayfish Fish farming 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Milk Carbon dioxide Fish Goby Fugu Tofu Ammonia Dead Sea Poker jargon Sulfur Desalination Disinfection Ecology Algae Geology of the Grand Canyon area Ich Freshwater angelfish Nuclear power Zambezi Chlorophyta Effects of global warming Cocaine Biogeochemical cycle Nitrogen Brewery Aluminium Nutrition Osmosis Sea-Monkey Bacteria Thermal power station RuneScape economy Tlingit Atkins Nutritional Approach Goldfish Sodium hypochlorite Insulin Iron Shrimp farm Dishwasher Octopus Hydrogen economy Methamphetamine Saltwater intrusion Salt Fjord Terraforming Tooth enamel Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tilapia Bone Sulfuric acid Sea level rise Tattoo Swimming Drowning Pufferfish Hydrochloric acid E number Weathering Vegetarianism Jellyfish Ultraviolet Industrial wastewater treatment Soil pH Vitamin C Deluge (prehistoric) Dredge Cheese Great Salt Lake Titanium Soap Intravenous therapy Danio Hamster Wood Seismic retrofit Fly fishing Earth's atmosphere Food preservation Ozone

should i turn the lights off in my aqurium at night and why well should you keep the lights in your bedroom on at night i suppose you could but it wouldnt be very pleasant for your fish p there is also the factor of algae growth but if you care about keeping your fish heathly you absolutely have to maintain a healthy biorythm for them fish need adequate amounts of rest and predictable day night cycles to stay healthy just as humans do for algae growth and to save you money on bulbs it is recommended that you leave the light on no more than hours a day it would be best if you were able to turn on your light shortly after sunrise and turn it out at dusk to let your fish sleep on a natural schedule but since that probably isnt practical i would recommend letting them wake with the sunrise turn on their light sometime midmorning or even early afternoon but only if its dark in your house and you need it on otherwise youre just wasting your money on electricity its dark in our house so our ruykin's light is on from about am till pm also you should set a lights out time for your fish and stick to it i know that sounds absurd but trust me it will pay off in happy healthy long lived fish our fish gets lights out no later than if we are using the room and cant keep it dark after we cover his tank with a blanket until we go to bed the only other thing is to be sure to turn lights on and off gradually try lifting the hood before turning it on and off this way the light increases slowly and decreases slowly when we turn out our fish's light at night i make sure there is also a light on in the room to help ease him into the change this is because fish have no eyelids and a sudden light going on or off can really shock them good luck with your fish  Daylight saving time Sleep USS Tunny (SS-282) Cannabis cultivation Fish farming Sewage treatment Weight training Eutrophication Incandescent light bulb Mattress Marine aquarium Insomnia Light pollution Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Future energy development Theory of conduct Economy of the United States Urinary incontinence The Dunciad Weather lore Blankets (graphic novel) 2003 North America blackout Dairy Capitalism Capercaillie RuneScape economy Battle of Jutland Ecology Knife Dieting Keynesian economics Autonomous building Oh My Goddess!

doing water change to manage ammonia levels do i condition the whole gal or only i was reading that for normal changes you add back water conditioner for not only the amount you replaced but for the whole volume of the tank i am assuming this advice is for changing water in an established tank i am changing my water based on ammonia levels being too high have only had the tank up and running for about days so i dont know if the water conditioner i added has worn off or not just wondering if i need to recondition the entire gallons even though i am only putting in a fresh gallons or is that advice for ppl doing less frequent water changes thanks there is already a young ruykin goldfish living in the tank so although i would prefer to avoid changing the water and thus disrupting the cycling process i cannot just ignore the ammonia level since that could prove fatal for the fish s a water change is a water change if you are treating for ammonia or waste in the tank or just routine maintence when you are saying conditioner i am assuming that means dechlorinator with aqua plus or most any other dechlorinators you cannot overdose this stuff but i'd say they are telling you to put in the amount of the whole tank to make you run out of thier product faster is all conditioner dechlorinators are usually applied one capful for every gallons but if you happen to put in like it's not going to hurt anything you'll just run out of it faster is all if you want to get great service to all your aquarium answers go to fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv follow up kii it's pretty simple in this case you cannot let that water sit cycling or not while the ammonia builds up it's going to take a week to ten days before the ammonia portion of the cycle clears it could take longer then that as well you just do your water changes like you normally would and if you change out water again the next day say your ammonia went up after you did a change you just pour your water treatment into the new comming water the people or bottle telling you treat for the whole tank are wrong you do not have to do this nor do you need to go buy that amquel hit either if you change out of your tank volume if you have a gallon tank then you changed out gallon and just put a capful of your conditioner in the gallons and you are set to go that's it you don't have to treat gallons of water for gallons of capacity the conditioner has no effect on your cycle or bacteria at all so it doesn't change anything other then dechlorinates the water thats all there is to it treat the amount you are adding in only  Marine aquarium Aquarium Hydrogen economy CPU cache Microeconomics Goldfish E85 Water Biodiesel Autonomous building Polychlorinated biphenyl Ammonia Brewery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Decompression sickness Sea-Monkey Dairy Theory of conduct Fire fighting Fish farming Supply and demand Fossil fuel power plant Toyota Prius Bong Town gas Water purification Tax Motor oil Carburetor CPU design Anaerobic digestion Thermal power station Eutrophication RISC Central processing unit Psoriasis Ocean thermal energy conversion Biochemistry Carbon dioxide Compiler optimization Nitrogen Reef tank Wine making Rum Nutrition Refrigerator B-47 Stratojet Gasoline Seismic retrofit Milk Keynesian economics Dry cleaning Web crawler Dialysis Final Fantasy magic Bipolar disorder Internal ballistics Windows 2000 Axolotl Electrophysiology Sake Law of value Motorcycle Radioactive waste Hydrogen Cray-1 Circuit breaker Gross domestic product Cyanide Explosive material Panama Canal Alternative biochemistry Space Shuttle program Debugging Cancer Energy development Insomnia Growth hormone treatment English grammar Terran (StarCraft) Nuclear power Menstrual cycle Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Champagne (beverage) Origin of life Rebreather Betting (poker) Fuel efficiency Alcohol fuel Vitamin C Diazepam Marathon (sport) Tank locomotive

i keep dreaming about goldfish anyone know why last night was the third time in a month that i had a goldfish dream and in every one of them at least one of the fish has died anyone got any idea what this dream means my guess you are feeling guilty for all the goldfish you've had that have died perhaps you've just recently learned that goldfish don't even breed until they're years old and their life expectancy is normally years depending on the type the book of world records had a koi that was years old and you know now that most of your fish were still just babies when they died  Goldfish Koi Aquarium Neil Gaiman God Emperor of Dune Samuel Goldwyn Jon Secada Habbo Hotel Carp Cyprinid The Catcher in the Rye Cliff Richard Journey (band) Don't Believe the Truth The Cat in the Hat Philosophical skepticism Agriculture Play School Hall & Oates Garfield Paris Hilton American Dad!

is there anything else i can get for my pond other than goldfish hi i've got a pond in my garden made from an old water tank its quite deep and narrow though reasonably long it siits above ground against a wall shaded by trees surrounded by bricks with potted ferns around its edge it contains a lily and a papyrus in pots and some floating oxgernators as well as a filtration pump with the outlet at the surface to splash the wateer and oxygenate it a bit it is currently home to goldfish one inches one and another inch one that has a problem with swimming he sits on the bottom all day i was wondering if there are other smallish fish we could get for other than the goldies or if we could put newts in as well i heard that frogs eat fish sometimes and besides i dont think it would be very good for them cos' its a big drop to the paved ground on one side and we have a dog we live in london uk it doesnt get that cold in winter though the pond surface freezes i think minnows would be cool theres a upturned pot with little holes in the tank that i think they'd like to dart in and out of dont they need running water though our pond has some circulation but its not great no offence but koi are just big goldfish to me pretty but i'm after something different no one has newts then i'd love to put some axolotls in but i think they're carnivorous and would probably munch my fish that depends in large part on where you live since this pond is above ground it's really influenced strongly by air temperature and unless you live in southern fl or points south you can expect it to freeze some during the winter i would loook to native species of fish from your area small minnows darters sunfish and the like if you do live in a fairly southern region you could probably add something like white cloud mountain minnows with no problem at all mm  Goldfish Aquarium Koi Water garden Frog Brewery Solar power Irrigation Sea ice Axolotl Water (molecule) Climate of the United Kingdom Lake Dead Sea Carnivorous plant Smelt Drill bit Danio Severe weather terminology (United States) Coffee Great Lakes Bladderwort Sewage treatment Fishing Thermal power station Ice cream Swimming pool Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Poker jargon Seismic retrofit Ozone depletion Ecology Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Geography of Chile Hydroponics Glossary of firefighting equipment Lake Burley Griffin Ozone hole Swimming Water Houseplant RuneScape quests Quang Ninh Province Thermoregulation Sea-Monkey Tag Rebreather Grand Teton National Park Spark plug Yosemite National Park Hamster Fog Elis Prefecture Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fish farming Motor oil Diving suit Gar RuneScape Mini-Games Pond Shark Fire fighting Weather lore Mario series enemies Bong Geography of Africa Ozone layer Carburetor El Ni__o Tea Pacific Ocean Bocas del Toro Province Professional wrestling throws Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Tetrapod Dinosaur Dam Rathfarnham Aquaculture Sundial Space shuttle main engine Zion National Park Lighting Bird migration Equine conformation Krill

need suggestions for setup of gallon aquarium tank i have a gallon aquarium that i would like to set up for angelfish and guppies so far all i have is the tank i'm ready to purchase the other components filter air pump heater etc and would like suggestions as to what i need to have in order to maintain this tank i'm thinking of a rena filstar xp cannister filter and a rena air pump g as the filter and air pump what should i consider as gravel what should i consider as plants what should i consider other items i may not have thought about can you help me thanks so much in my opinion the first thing you should consider carefully is if you are going to use live or fake plants this might seem like a minor detail but nothing could be further from the truth in order to have a successful planted tank you need to consider what the plants need to live they need light to photosynthesize no way around that not just any light will work we are talking about watts of k k spectrum light per gallon this gets costly quickly also they need co fish exhalation is nowhere near enough co injection can be quite expensive or quite cheap depending on if you use compressed co or diy co injection both types require equipment used to dissolve the gas into the water keep in mind that by agitating the water surface like with bubble stones you are allowing most of the dissolved co to escape back into the air additionally plants thrive best with special substrates a product called 'eco complete' works well here some people even swear by under gravel heaters this causes convection pulling nutrients down to the roots also consider the cost of the plant packages retail bundles of aquatic plants available planting a tank is not simply putting live plants into an aquarium i am not trying to scare you away from planting your tank hopefully my post will prevent some frustration and or wasted money while it can get costly i feel that by planting your aquarium you are creating a healthy beautiful home for your fish the following are some links to references which i found helpful when planting my tank http www floridadriftwood com store asp http www aquariacentral com articles planted aquarium shtml http www plantedtank net forums http www aquariumpros com faqpro plants shtml http www thekrib com plants co co narten html  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Reef tank Autonomous building Solar power Brewery Hydroponics Energy development Biodiesel Cannabis cultivation Hydrogen economy Ocean thermal energy conversion Diesel engine Rebreather Dairy E85 Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Goldfish Fish farming Carbon dioxide Sea-Monkey HyperText Transfer Protocol Fuel injection Tilapia Solar cell Carnivorous plant Water Cross site scripting Siphon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Water purification Carburetor Alcohol fuel Wind power Photosynthesis Dialysis Printed circuit board Eutrophication Glossary of firefighting terms Ajax (programming) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Nuclear reactor Coffee Transformer Solar panel Incandescent light bulb Hydraulic machinery Pump Textile manufacturing Scuba set Nuclear power P-47 Thunderbolt World Wide Web Transistor Ice core Discus (fish) Ecology Tank HVAC Petroleum Uniform Resource Locator Sugar beet Town gas Swimming pool Wind turbine Air conditioning Gasoline Antarctic krill Dwarf gourami Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Torpedo Illegal drug trade Motor oil Infusion pump HTTP cookie Pebble bed reactor Renewable energy Bong Basement Japanese tea ceremony Inkjet printer Saturn V Simone Weil Kissing gourami Commodore 64 Supercharger Glossary of firefighting equipment Diving suit Sun Vickers Valiant XML

can blunt trauma cause swim bladder a toddler got into my fish tank with the net and my fish has been floating upside down ever since three full days now at first i thought it was dying from being scared or hit with the net now i'm thinking it has swim bladder the question is was that caused by the incident with the net or is it just a coincidence would this have happened regardless it's one of the less expensive fancy goldfish i read a post on another forum that cited an aquarium owner's manual saying swim bladder can be caused by rough handling if that's the case i wonder if it's curable like other forms of swim bladder disorder now its fins are falling apart it's been a bowl by itself for over a day now so it couldn't be the minnow biting it i thought i noticed damage to the fins when i first found it floating but i couldn't say for sure now that damage has gotten much worse there are clearly sections of the tail fin missing and it's frayed is this the symptom of some disease can fish ever recover from such damage as you have guess i think it's swim bladder problem too but i never encounter any situation where rough handling lead to to swim bladder problem i would think it was probably a coincidence i believe it would have happen even if the toddler didn't mess up the tank what i believe he did was probably to stir up the gravel in your tank thereby loosening all the waste trap in the gravel that the additional bio waste probably mess up your water really fast and over loaded your filter the bad water could give rise to the swim bladder problem if you have thick gravel there is the possibility that there might be low level of hydrogen sulfide due to anaerobic metabolism this will also cause serious problem if it's present and release to the tank water due to a disturbance of the gravel if your gravel is mess up these are the possibilities as for treating swim bladder problem you could refer to this http www arofanatics com members dragonfly sg swimbladderproblem  Sewage treatment Urinary incontinence Aquarium Carnivorous plant Brewery Fishing Hydrogen sulfide Coral reef Chronic fatigue syndrome Kidney Bladderwort Prostate cancer Equine conformation Ecco the Dolphin American lobster Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shark Swimming Rebreather Urinary system Hypoglycemia CPU cache Autism Dead Like Me Gar Swimming pool Nuclear power Abortion Goldfish Tocopherol Tobacco smoking StarCraft: Uprising Tank 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Pok__mon Abilities Shrimp farm Gas bladder Debugging Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Mental illness Scientology beliefs and practices Dissociative identity disorder Unreal Halitosis Schizophrenia Floppy disk Asthma Sea-Monkey Cancer Multiple sclerosis RMS Titanic Post-traumatic stress disorder Alzheimer's disease Atlantic herring Apollo 13 Flush toilet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Obstetrics Shaggy dog story Salmon Intracranial pressure Nutrition Marine aquarium Conker's Bad Fur Day Anorexia nervosa Fish farming Carburetor Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coeliac disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alcoholism Mosquito Cantonese cuisine Dairy Autonomous building E85 Pneumonia Parkinson's disease Insulin Acute renal failure Thermal power station Tag Coffee Dog Bacteria Spina bifida DragonFly BSD

my beta fish aren't eating i think they are two males and i only just got them i noticed that everytime they reach for their food round and red ones bloodworm maybe they either miss it or it either floats back out their mouth and they can't be bothered going for it again it's common for newly bought bettas to refuse to eat for a few days they are getting used to their bigger tank new decorations new water chemistry and so on everything has been completely hauled over for them so they need awhile to adjust their systems to the new environment before they will eat another reason is that bettas are picky eaters and usually don't like changes in food that they've been fed for a long time the pet store has probably been feeding them the same stuff for ages and now they don't want to switch this is easily cured however just give them a couple of days and they will start eating the new food don't worry about your bettas starving they can go up to a week without food completely unharmed  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Sea-Monkey Shaggy dog story Insulin Hamster Dwarf gourami One Piece minor characters RuneScape quests Minor Harry Potter Beasts Gar Halfbeak American lobster Taboo food and drink Food preservation Fugu Cannabis cultivation Goldfish Breastfeeding Shark The Amazing Race Elephant Chicken Sewage treatment Environmental vegetarianism Axolotl Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Dairy Binge eating disorder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tlingit Guinea pig RuneScape skills Garfield Aquarium Anorexia nervosa Vitamin Fecal incontinence Carburetor Sin City Chinese New Year Livestock Koi Bird MapleStory Bread The Pet Sounds Sessions Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape locations Fancy rat RuneScape economy House Mouse Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Comanche Gray Wolf Raw food diet Domestic rabbit Clownfish Tomato Bird migration Ecology Salmon Nile crocodile Dieting Eastern Front (World War II) Russian joke Carnivore Gold standard Stomach cancer Chocolate Neopets Locomotive RuneScape Mini-Games Thermal power station Wheel of Fortune Equine conformation Chopsticks Fire-control system Lutefisk Red Squirrel Frog Acorn Lisa the Vegetarian Sea Otter Wall Street Fish farming The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cheese Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Ron and Fez Mountain Gorilla Fire fighting Kelly Clarkson Drawn Together Brown Bear Pork Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology

how do i clean my glass gallon aquarium i just bought a gallon aquarium and whoever used the glue to attach the glass walls together was a little sloppy and got glue on the glass walls how can i get it off i know you can't use soap but water isn't getting it off the glue is or at least better be silicone and really the only way to remove that is with a razor blade using a solvent might disintegrate the sloppy parts but it could also compromise the integrity of the part you want to remain that holds the glass together  Aquarium Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Solvent Coffee Goldfish Razor Fishing Printed circuit board Genericized trademark Knife Sandpaper Biodiesel Soap Hard water Dishwashing Soldering Hamster Reef tank Dairy Menstrual cup Shaving Inhalant Adhesive Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Upholstery MEMS M60 machine gun Osmosis Ethyl acetate Semiconductor device Bong Autonomous building Chlorophyta Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cross-country skiing Concentration Champagne (beverage) Paint Stucco Washroom Combine (Half-Life 2) Fenway Park Detergent Roof Disinfection Mikoyan MiG-29 Water Tilapia Electrophysiology Fossil fuel power plant Georgia Aquarium Beard Seismic retrofit Shampoo Cyanoacrylate Fish farming Soap bubble Cookware and bakeware Shedd Aquarium Clinker (boat building) Water cannon Professional wrestling slang Fiberglass Monterey Bay Aquarium Laundry Vacuum tube Wound Dialysis Vinegar Leeboard Oxygen sensor Table saw Liquid crystal Sento Chainsaw Cello Concrete Tire Domestic water system Japanese toilet Surface Brewery Anarchist symbolism Obsidian Paramount Canada's Wonderland Zebra Danio Violin Silicon Printmaking Vitreous enamel Tattoo Glasses Jellyfish Mosaic Glossary of climbing terms Cast iron Window

how do i get my water in my fish tank to clear up it's always cloudy is this a tank you've recently set up cloudiness is natural for the first few months what's happening is your tank is cycling when your tank is mature you'll have bacteria that will break down the wastes your fish produce one of these wastes is ammonia which is poisonous to your fish one type of bacteria will use the ammonia as it's food source and convert the ammonia to nitrite which is also toxic then another type will take over and convert the ammonia to nitrate which is nontoxic in moderate amounts but right now you don't have the amount of bacteria to convert these completely so the bacteria are in a rapid reproduction mode to take advantage of the extra food sources it's this bacterial bloom that makes the water appear cloudy once there enough bacteria that all the ammonia and nitrite are being converted the tank will clear on it's own but until then you'll need to do partial water changes in order to keep the ammonia and nitrite at levels the fish can live in rather than doing large changes it's better to do small frequent ones about twice a week or once a week using a gravel vacuum to clean all the debris out of the gravel you'll also need to be careful that you don't overfeed your fish only give them what they can eat in minutes twice a day if any food is left after the minutes are up use a net to remove it decomposing food also produces ammonia you should be aware of they symptoms of ammonia and nitrite poisoning so if your fish start to show these you'll know to do a water change when the levels get high enough the fish will start swimming at the top of the tank and look like they're gasping for air they may also sink to the bottom and be very inactive staying in one place they'll stop eating and with ammonia poisoning the fins may spilt and look frayed here's some additional info for you also see the rest of these sites there's a lot of good info for new fishkeepers http www fishlore com cloudywater htm http www fishlore com nitrogencycle htm http www firsttankguide net cycle php  Sewage treatment Eutrophication Biogeochemical cycle Nitrogen Bacteria Cyanide Hydrogen economy Ammonia Foodborne illness Fish farming Rebreather Brewery Diseases of the honeybee Fugu Carbon dioxide Ecology Carnivorous plant Energy development Water purification Autonomous building Nitrogen cycle Biochemistry Nutrition Shrimp farm Biodiesel Alcohol fuel Ocean thermal energy conversion Sodium nitrite Dairy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tooth Refrigerator Carburetor Nuclear power Ice core Cellular respiration Water pollution Hamster Food preservation Photosynthesis Soil life Fossil fuel power plant Chlorophyta Sake Town gas Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dialysis Methanol Amyl nitrite Plankton Nutrient Aquarium Domestic rabbit Water (molecule) Swimming pool Domain Name System Bong Solar power Tooth enamel PHP Scuba set Ozone Tofu Omega-3 fatty acid Ozone depletion Toyota Prius Hemp Algal bloom Menstrual cup Mercury (element) Orca Thermal power station Cloud Swimming Shark Insulin Seine (fishing) Helicobacter pylori Aluminium Compost Waste management Dry cleaning Agricultural wastewater treatment Ozone hole Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9

how can gold fish live without food my mom has a pound and she quits feeding the fish near winter and then turns off the pump they sit their and float around not eating anything for the whole winter how can they survive for like months without food and in the freezing water i also heard a story of a women who would freeze her fish every time she went on a business meeting then when she got back she would unfreeze them and they would still be living i was told this at the pet shop so i think it's an accurate story first your mom's fish when the water gets cold the fish are the same temp as the water and just go into a state of semi hibernation we can't do that here because it's too cold but many parts of the country can overwinter carp with no problem many of our northern fish do exactly the same thing there are usually enough insects around until the water freezes over for them to eat for quite a while and they also will munch off algae in the pond how specifically you overwinter carp varies considerably from region to region the second story is totally made up when you freeze a fish its heart stops and it dies it cannot be resuscitated someone was pulling someone's leg  Koi Goldfish Carp Antarctic krill Fish farming Salmon Frog Lake Burley Griffin Fishing Fugu Bird migration Shrimp farm Winter Deluge (mythology) Tilapia Aquarium One Piece minor characters Aquaculture Freezing Terri Schiavo Sea ice Hypothermia Taboo food and drink Garfield Shaggy dog story Treehouse of Horror V Sea-Monkey Great Lakes Neopets Gray Wolf Myxobolus cerebralis Shark Common carp Carbon dioxide Inuit Fisheries in Hong Kong Kodocha Zebra Danio Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Acorn Krill Marine aquarium Philip J.

i just got a fish tank i dont have the gravel or anything yet but i have the tank and filter and hood i want to start the cycling process now should i only fill it like of the way and do i have to turn the filter on for this to work if i want to put gravel from another tank can i wash it off first and how much do i need per gallon i can get some from petsmart where i work this is going to be freshwater probubly with some electric yellow cichlids or some other small africans ok when i say im going to add gravel i mean for cycling not for the whole bottom i dont know fish i dont do that at work cycling with fish is slower and less efficient than cycling without them the only reason you need the fish is for the ammonia they produce with their wastes a perfectly good alternative is household ammonia as long as it's pure no fragrance or surfactant as a nice bonus the household ammonia doesn't suffer permanent painful gill damage from the cycling process what you do to really simplify it is start with a full tank and running filter pour some ammonia in the amount depends on the size of the tank but it's probably anywhere from a couple of spoonfuls to a cup adding some used gravel from an established healthy tank will kickstart the cycle by introducing some of the bacteria you need so they just have to multiply and spread rather than grow from scratch use a couple of big handfuls stored in a nylon stocking which the bacteria can easily travel through but is also easy to reach in and pull out when you're done start testing your water regularly like every other day or so with ammonia and nitrite kits you don't need the expensive master kit partway in you'll have to start feeding the growing bacteria colony spoonfuls of ammonia and testing for nitrates when you have zero ammonia zero nitrites and slowly rising nitrates your tank is cycled for specific numbers and directions check out this article http www aquahobby com articles e fishless php the forum at that website is full of friendly experienced people who will talk you through the process if you ask for help good luck and enjoy your tank  Marine aquarium Ammonia Fish farming Dairy Dry cleaning Hydrogen economy Eutrophication Biodiesel E85 Sea-Monkey Autonomous building Biogeochemical cycle Internal ballistics Brewery Sake Fossil fuel power plant Menstrual cup Thermal power station Nuclear power Tilapia Electric motor Water Energy development Textile manufacturing Soil pH Fire fighting Carnivorous plant Casting GunBound Tlingit Microeconomics Menstrual cycle Nitrogen Tank CPU cache Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Billiards Plastic Hydrogen sulfide Bong Illegal drug trade Polymerase chain reaction Fusion power Ammonium nitrate Sun Sugar Transformer Diesel engine Galactic Civilizations Radio controlled airplane Compiler optimization Glacier Fugu Bicycle Refrigerator Hash table Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Foodborne illness Hydrogen vehicle CPU design Domestic rabbit Water (molecule) Water purification Drag racing Town gas Supply and demand Vermicompost Ocean thermal energy conversion Circuit design Nutrient Poker jargon Soil life Anchor Fishing Hard disk Biochemistry Neopets Quicksort Jet engine Hybrid vehicle Items in the Metroid series Milk Cruising (maritime) PHP Saturn V Explosive material

is it easy to maintain a big fish tank i was thinking of buying a saltwater tank and wanted to know about fish and all the stuff it can be fresh water and i need suggestions on fish that will fit i already have a gallon freshwater hi there my suggestion start with freshwater it sounds like you're just starting out and freshwater tanks are easier for beginners you can go to sites like the ones below to learn about keeping a healthy tank and kinds of fish that will work well together and yes the larger the tank the easier it is to keep believe it or not larger tanks because they have more water in them are more forgiving of beginner mistakes just don't overstock take your time and do it properly start out with a very light fish load and build when you've learned how to keep a stable tank  Aquarium Marine aquarium Fish farming Fish Cruising (maritime) Fly fishing Tank Discus (fish) Reef tank Sea-Monkey Goldfish Sewage treatment Crayfish Shrimp farm Paragliding Zebra Danio Parachuting Dry cleaning Hydrogen economy Ecology Yacht Autonomous building Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tetrapod Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Stock car (rail) F-16 Fighting Falcon Fishing Water Saltwater intrusion Platypus Sawfish (fish) Dinghy Cessna T-37 Tlingit Brackish water Fire fighting Live-bearing aquarium fish Swimming pool Gar SS Andrea Doria Fugu Jellyfish Angling Goby Motorcycle E85 Eutrophication History of Victoria Tilapia Sockeye salmon Tank classification Rise of Nations Saturn V Sailfin Molly Messerschmitt Bf 109 Tank landing ship Hamster Water (molecule) USS Yorktown (CV-5) White Cloud Mountain Minnow Lake Shark T-34 Dairy Gill Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Freshwater angelfish T-72 Stingray Australian bass Saltwater Crocodile Fish migration Violin Craps Airbus A320 Striped bass Sturgeon Aquaculture Amateur astronomy P-47 Thunderbolt Anti-tank Warm-blooded Dwarf gourami M16 (rifle) Osmosis Cloaking device Japanese tea ceremony Mussel Trout P-38 Lightning Chinook salmon M4 Sherman Blood on the Tracks Novelty (locomotive) Aquifer Combine (Half-Life 2) Halfbeak Irish dance Carburetor

i have a red tail cat fish and i already know how big he's going to get what i really need to know from someone that has experience with this particular fish is how often do i have to feed it he's already about inches long and i prefer to feed him shrimp or goldfish if i feed him until he doesn't want anymore do i feed him again the next day or should i feed him until he's full every other day he's now eating goldfish at feeding time once a day i really need some advice from someone who's not guessing but has experience feeding a red tail until he's full is probably not a good idea small daily feedings or a slightly larger feeding every other day will suffice as a top predator they will over eat at a moments notice one or two goldfish a day is plenty you might also try some crickets or crayfish for variety i hope you have plans for a very large aquarium in your future also i'd advise moving the fish into the larger quarters while you can still net him when one of these bruisers gets to be ' long they become very hard to handle and can deal a nasty cut with their saw like pectoral fins they will also tear up a regular aquarium net before you can move them and nets that will hold them the game fishing kind are likely to damage the fish you only have of rapid growth to address these issues so some planing is in order tropical fish hobbyist didn't include them on their list of tank busters for nothing  Goldfish Gar Aquarium Sea-Monkey Fishing Koi Clownfish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goby Poker jargon Stingray Zebra Danio Crayfish Fauna of Australia Unreal Coral reef Krill Oceanic Whitetip Shark Antarctic krill Kissing gourami Orca Shark Tetrapod Freshwater angelfish Shrimp farm Parrotfish Equine conformation Organic farming Halfbeak Bat Spider Batoidea Discus (fish) Moult Volleyball Aquarium (album) Terminal ballistics Filefish Muskellunge Grunion Seabird Octopus Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Salmon Model aircraft Fish farming El-Fish Murray Cod Marine aquarium Fancy rat CPU cache Garfield Hamster Oarfish Guinea pig Textile manufacturing Sonic Adventure Cuisine of Denmark RuneScape quests Goldeen Tarantula Cuttlefish Biological pest control Humpback Whale Brine shrimp Finding Nemo Fish Radio controlled airplane Thresher Shark Internal ballistics The Strangerhood Fast bowling Antenna (radio) Whaling Boeing 747 Whale shark Flyingfish Seine (fishing) Lake Burley Griffin Sushi Predation Ichthyosaur Firearm Breastfeeding Game programming Leopard Tilapia Domestic rabbit Europe Bengali cuisine Danio American lobster Dog agility Whale Cable television Marathon (computer game) Nile crocodile

which on would you choose i cant decide coral beauty or flame angel i think there may be to much red color in the tank so there for i would say coral beauty but there is already an orchid dotty back which is purple so what would you pick both are beautiful fish the only problem when choosing a dwarf angel or any angel for that mater is you can only have one per tank i personally like the rusty angels because everyone has a coral beauty or a flame so its a cool fish to have when someone sees it and it looks like a coral beauty but with more red blue and orange if you found a flame and a coral beauty in a store that you like id look at which one looks nicer and has more defined color you cant go wrong with either but once again you can only have one per tank another really nice dwarf angel is the multicolor pygmy angel these are very nice but have a high price tag if your tank is large enough to go for a larger angel my personal favorite is the imperator angel but these fish need a tank of at least gallons preferably more the color change they go through from babies to adults is amazing here is a site that shows them in both stages http www liveaquaria com product prod display cfm pcatid anyway i hope this helps and doesnt make you decision harder i love angelfish so i have so many tankis just so i can keep various species good luck and im sure you will be happy with whatever choice you make  Discus (fish) Marine aquarium My Little Pony Pysanka CPU cache Color Freshwater angelfish Atomic Kitten Dragon Booster Sea-Monkey Orchidaceae Reef tank Hydrogen economy Pitaten Utilitarianism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Microeconomics Los Angeles Kings Butterflyfish Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Brewery Aquarium Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Mary Jane Watson AFI 100 Years series Timeline of alternative rock Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Fantasmic!

i would love to breed guppies but i dont want to spend a fortune are there any cheap ways to do this breeding guppies really is just as simple as most people say it is but if you really want to be serious about it there are a few considerations tank requirements you need to have two tanks at least gallons in size the first one should be cycled and all settled ready for your new guppies the second should be filled with water and have a sponge filter running it should also gave a heater and lots of hiding places for the babies set up both tanks and keep the temperature in both about f guppies will do well in that range ph hardness and other water conditions are not very important to guppies they tolerant a very wide range of parameters feeding for the adults you need to feed a good basic flake food as well as the occasional treat of frozen foods buy a couple of them to swap between blood wroms mosquito larvae brine shrimp are all good for the babies you need baby brine shrimo to feed for the first few days and some cruches flake to start mixing in after that yes you can just crush the flake you use for the adults the fish get male for every females no need to get many after all you expect to breed plenty most you find at pet stores will already be pregnant so if you are really serious about getting just the right color you will need to by from a serious breeder or be prepared to work at it a while the mating just put them together and they will do the rest once the female is very gravid pregnant move her to the empty tank and leave her there until she has the babies once she has them you can more her back to the main tank feed the babies fairly often times a day isn't too often and change of the tank water every days the larger the babies get the more often you will have to change water until the babies are adults raising the babies feed the babies fairly often times a day isn't too often and change of the tank water every days the larger the babies get the more often you will have to change water until the babies are adults install a tank divider in the baby tank as soon as possible and once you can tell males from females start to seperate them most serious breeders end up using two tanks so you might want to plan on that in the future seperate them as soon as possible also do not give up on the water changes they are critical for proper growth i cannot stress this enough culling culling is removing undesirable fish from your stock remove any deformed fish you see as soon as you see them it's not uncommon to have a few deformed fish humanely kill these as you certainly don't want them breeding once the babies are nearly grown you will be able to pick out the best looking male and best lookig females this is where color choice comes in you will most likely have fish of two or three different colors return you original fish and the extra babies to the pet store or donate them to another fish keeper to a school whatever place your best male and three best females in the now empty main tank and let them do what come naturally then you will start the whole process over while you are raising the babies you will have babies from one of the other females too if not both of them you will have to choose set up another tank for them or leave them with the adults to do as well as they can your call as you can see you could end up with tanks all over the house in no time at all so be aware you can't keep them all lol after a few generations you will need to add fresh breeding stock to your line try to find a really good looking male that fits your colors and breed him to some of your females for fresh genes in the line doing this every so often will improve your fish and prevent problems from too much inbreeding inbreeding fixes traits in the line both good traits and bad traits so bring in new stock from time to time if you really fall in love with guppy breeding you will really want to be a member of the ifga international fancy guppy association they can teach you so much more than this basic over view and the members are a great source of really superior breeding stock you can find their website online hope this helps a little and good luck with your breeding efforts if i can help further feel free to email me mm  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dairy Discus (fish) Marine

cloudy betta water one of my bettas just had a water change days ago it's extremely cloudy i did add a new decoration it's like a cave in the tank but i rinsed it off with hot water really well before i put it in his tank should i change is water again or will he be ok he's building a bubble nest so he doesn't seem to mind but i don't want him to get sick or anything my other betta's water is fine though he's in a gallon unfiltered tank and i do full water changes every days are you changing your water like you would in a bowl changing out the entire contents or just a partial change what is the size of the tank i don't think this is really a cycling effect just yet though typically cloudiness in the water is probably the hot water heated up the cave and has interacted with your tank water is what i think or you overfed him betta's are very very hardy fish and unless you get extremely toxic readings he should be ok i have a biowheel gallon set up at work i change out a gallon once a week when i first populated it with the betta white clouds and zebra danios the water never really got cloudy and the ammonia soard up to almost ppm and noone died from that i did do a partial water change but it stayed pretty high for about five days check your ammonia levels just to be sure if he is building up his bubble nest i'd say odds are he's quite a happy betta right now and nothing to worry about you can learn more at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv follow up this particular case wouldn't likely be associated with a bacterial bloom this sounds like water not dechlorinated or too much feeding being that you don't have the tank filtered i think you should get a really small filter and that will assist you in keeping the water quality a little better but i don't think he's stressed if he's building his bubble nest i think he's quite happy actually  Brewery Sewage treatment Aquarium Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Carbon dioxide Bong Fish farming Dishwasher Sun Tea Solar power Carburetor Ammonia E85 Water (molecule) Cocaine Cider Zebra Danio Sake Danio CPU cache Water Cloud Goldfish Hard water The Amber Spyglass Sea-Monkey Axolotl Dairy Biodiesel Autonomous building Diseases of the honeybee Fossil fuel power plant Water purification Rebreather Shrimp farm Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Sugar beet Fire fighting Refrigerator Eutrophication Polychlorinated biphenyl Climate of the United Kingdom Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Coffee Global climate model Decompression sickness Champagne (beverage) Electrophysiology Tank Bread Vinegar Dialysis Sento Nutrition Japanese tea ceremony Singlish Fire extinguisher Theory of conduct Dwarf gourami Houseplant Hydrogen sulfide Solar variation Chocolate Explosive material Drowning Common cold RuneScape quests Discus (fish) Portland cement Apollo 8 Electronic amplifier Climate change Hydroponics Motor oil Loudspeaker Supply and demand Ecology Sonoluminescence STS-59 Analog-to-digital converter Hamster Microeconomics Swimming pool Town gas Natural gas Lighting Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Nuclear power StarCraft: Uprising Cannabis cultivation Gasoline Seismic retrofit

was it wrong to spaz on my bf for almost killing my fish i asked my boyfriend to feed my fish and later on that day i saw lola's bowl full of food pellets like a human handful that you would give a child if it was cereal i started freaking out and screamed on him about how stupid he could be and why would a tiny fish need that much food my fish only needs or pellets or at the most i told him a little bit but did not specify an exact amount because just weeks ago he almost killed my father's group of fish that he has in an outdoor pond that was when i explained to him how much food fish need to be given so i thought he would've remembered from that incident he acted like it was no big deal but i've had lola since october and he's grown on me yes it's a he he's purple and has a slight swish to his stroke is my attachment to my fish crazy or does anyone else feel the same way about their fish was it wrong for me to scream on him wouldn't it have been just as bad as if lola was a dog a pet is a pet regardless of species and everyone who's a good pet owner gets attached to their pet i got a goldfish when i was about years old for free when a pet store in my neighborhood opened when the goldfish died years later i cried i'd say your attachment to your fish is just fine and being protective of it is also just natural the fact that this has happened before with your boyfriend with him feeding your dad's fish and since it seems that he doesn't care he did wrong i'd say the reprimanding from your end was certainly justified it should be common sense that a tiny fish doesn't need a handful of pellets if he didn't remember the incident that happened before chances are that he just doesn't care or perhaps he did it on purpose of course that's just speculation nobody knows but him either way though i'd say to never trust him to feed another animal of yours fish dog whatever  Goldfish Garfield Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Kodocha Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ferret Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guinea pig Badly Drawn Kitties Ranma __ characters Shark Social rule Poker jargon Dog Ron Weasley Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Fancy rat The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist RuneScape quests Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kim Possible Hamster W.I.T.C.H.

digging fish i have a goldfish that keeps sticking pointing it's head and face at the gravel it says there untill you make it move or something scares it help goldfish love to redecorate this is one of the biggest fears with goldies because they sometimes swallow the gravel this is why some goldy keepers opt for large river rocks for their substrate have you looked closely enough to see if it's picking up pieces of gravel and placing them back down what's it doing while it's face down in the gravel you haven't said whether it's acting or looking sick so if it is just digging that's what goldies do just keep an eye out from time to time to see if he's carrying them and or possibly swallowing the gravel you may need to change out your substrate if you think he may be swallowing the gravel  Sin City Gravel Tag Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goldfish Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Dead Like Me Characters of The Sandman Mario series enemies Goldie Erosion Punt (boat) Anchor Shaggy dog story Wa shogi Blue Peter Jurassic Park III Opportunity rover Garfield The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Glacier Taikyoku shogi Happy Tree Friends Cliff Richard Comanche Trapping 2005 European Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Tilapia Big Dig Kefalonia Mount Everest Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina RuneScape quests Tori shogi Collecting fossils Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Parting of the Ways Pok__mon Snap Glossary of climbing terms Atlantic herring Swiss plateau Aquarium 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Diving Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Pok__mon Abilities Diving locations The Jam Time Out of Mind Shen Gong Wu Carcassonne (board game) Pachypodium ambongense Aquifer Peter Shilton Snake Young adult literature Canal lock Muslim ibn Aqeel Kerikeri Glossary of nautical terms U.S. Highway 66 The End of the World (Doctor Who) Macquarie Perch Volleyball The Contender (television series) Characters in the Smurfs Textile manufacturing Olduwan Poker jargon Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Pink salmon Chopsticks Jason Voorhees Murray Cod Piccolo Junior Saga Mining Blue Ridge Parkway Dredge Mario American Dad!

sw tank alge blooms 'red sand' help appreciated i have a saltwater fish tank reef tank it is a gallon with lbs fully cured live rock from an established tank and lbs agronite lbs live sand and lb live sand from another established tank i have a skimmer running hrs and a fluval i was getting set up for the 'cycle' and i starting adding small amount of pure ammonia for days until my am ppm was at i never saw any nitrites but my ammonia has been dropping and my nitrates are up to a nice ppm now that nitrates have shown up for the last days and my ammonia is now at i have a few questions if my ammonia is dropping now at why is my nitrates showing and i never seen any nitrites my sand is having some light 'alge blooms' of red its like the sand is sorta turning red why is this and is it ok is my tank cycled did i kind of clone a tank should i add a fish or to keep ammonia in there a cleanup crew i already have hermits and snails thanks it all depends on what bacteria were on the live rock and in the live sand there are two groups of bacteria involved in the process one which converts the ammonia to nitrite and another which converts the nitrite to nitrate if both groups are low you'll get the three separate peaks but since you started with a good source of living bacteria the ones in the second group nitrite to nitrate may have been able to keep up with the amount of nitrite those from the first group were creating if this were the case you wouldn't have noticed any nitrite red or reddish brown if red this may be cyanobacteria see photo http www sloreef com bojan cyanobacteria files cyanobacteria jpg red slime algae and you don't want this in the tank it's feeding off the nitrate that's being produced and if you're using tapwater to mix the salt there is probably phosphate in the tank as well cyanobacteria doesn't like high flow so use a powerhead to direct current at problem areas do some water changes to lower the nitrate level and use a phosphate absorbing pad that you can cut to fit the filter if you've been using tapwater it would be better to use reverse osmosis water the culligan self serve dispensers in some stores are this or get an ro filter for home use or at least mix this with the tap water to reduce the amount of phosphate if a reddish brown this is more likely diatoms http www saltcorner com sections guest algaepage brown diatoms diatoms jpg and this is natural in a new tank you'll still need to control the nutrients but the snails and hermits will help control this they won't eat the cyanobacteria the tank's cycled only when nitrate is the only compound of ammonia nitrite and nitrate that you're able to detect since you're there it would be okay to add one or more fish depending on their size start with species that would be smaller and more peaceful then build to the larger more aggresive species of the fish you intend to keep just go slowly and add fish per week you may also want to increase the size of the cleaning crew these will also help clean the  Fish farming Nitrogen Plankton Hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen economy Carnivorous plant Photosynthesis Biogeochemical cycle Water purification Explosive material Uranium Biodiesel Nitrogen cycle Carbon dioxide Ozone depletion Hydrogen Cyanide Ammonium nitrate Ozone hole Soil pH Algae Diatom Water (molecule) Shrimp farm Water E85 Soil life Algal bloom Lake Earth's atmosphere Coral reef Reef tank Brewery Ecology Chlorophyta Fire fighting Ice core Fertilizer Dairy Energy development Electrophysiology Nitric acid Alkane Food preservation Mineral Thermal power station Sea-Monkey Antarctic krill Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Autonomous building Sodium nitrite Rebreather Ham Milk Ocean thermal energy conversion Sulfuric acid Transformer Illegal drug trade Osmosis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina CPU cache Internal ballistics Bacteria Geology of the Grand Canyon area Carburetor Cellular respiration Nutrition Coal Hamster Salton Sea Nuclear fuel cycle Drill bit Origin of life Ozone Alternative biochemistry Sun Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Tank Chlorine Cell (biology) Aluminium Curing Cannabis cultivation Lake Burley Griffin Biochemistry Solar variation Foodborne illness

sharks florida clear water hi when i was i want to florida and went to clear water beach there was like big things in the sea like a block shape and you were only alloud to swim between those lines i think they had nets attached to them under water aswell were they there so that people dont swim out to far and the life gards can keep a better eye on you or to stop sharks swimming in if it is to stop sharks are they usually in that area i live in the u k and recently a great white shark has been spotted a few times by cornwall so recently they have been playing the movie jaws on the t v which has reminded me to ask this question thanks for your answers x sharks can swin anywhere there is water the markers you describe are to let swimmers know not to swim beyond them for safety reasons sharks are all over the place in florida but it really isn't anything to worry about too much since they are not really aggressive towards people if people truly knew the number of sharks in the water no one would ever go to the beach the lifeguards will warn you if there are sharks in the area  Shark Jaws (film) Swimming Swimming pool Great White Shark Lifeguard Diving Dolphin Oceanic Whitetip Shark Tag Basking Shark Ecco the Dolphin Kitesurfing Personal flotation device Jaws 2 Great White (film) Drowning Surfing Jumping the shark USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Rip current Megalodon Episodes of Lost (Season 2) USS Indianapolis (CA-35) Plesiosaur Card Sharks Whale shark Shark Tale Aquaman Giant squid Sperm Whale Paintball Orca Stingray Flag Adult Swim Orlando, Florida Camp Lazlo USS Tigrone (SS-419) Triathlon Backstroke Bull shark Finding Nemo Hammerhead shark Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign Diving suit Naval mine USS Picuda (SS-382) Jackass: The Movie The Strangerhood Mass noun Jennifer Lopez Seine (fishing) Epistemology Johnny Weissmuller Australian salmon History of swimming 2005 English cricket season Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Storm surge Volleyball Speedo Mosasaur Treehouse of Horror XI ECHL Krill Bocas del Toro Province Capital punishment Blacktip Reef Shark Fish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an USS Whale (SS-239) Railway signalling Mercury 4 Water polo Phaedo Singlish Arab-Israeli conflict Everglades National Park Trilobite Tuatara Speedo (suit style) Shark Bay, Western Australia Sandbar shark Happy Tree Friends Broward County, Florida Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Diving locations Palm Beach County, Florida Amusement park 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Beach Breaststroke USS Seadragon (SS-194) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Creatures in Bionicle Pittwater Council Ultimate (sport)

freshwater aquarium help please i am buying a gallon aquarium for my room and i need help i have a siamese fighting fish and i am planning on buying blind cave fish a medium pleco a corydora or two a couple of dwarf gouramis and blue gouramis a coolie loach and an angelfish small what is your advice should i cool it with the angelfish or is this a good thing to work with for the most part the grouping of these fish is not a good choice for a gallon set up there are a few problem's you'd run into you could run an aquaclear to provide the necessary filtration but then you're going to run into the compatibility issues problem most common plecos will grow to around inches there are some that stay smaller but the primary logic in people buying one is for algea control and this is not necessary plecos are an armored catfish and bottom feeder they only eat algea if there is no other food source present problem the gourami and betta are both labryinth breathers and i'm sure it's just a matter of time before they get into it in a ten gallon tank problem an angelfish is a cichild therefore very territorial and will be aggression on your other fish and stress them i feel the real issue here though is space a ten gallon tank doesn't provide enough space for this grouping to be comfortable with each other you're coolie loach slipped my mind is probably going to grow to be at least six inches too and will become cramped in a gallon tank if you were to change this tank over to a long then you have better possibilities at least to get the gourami in and probably the coolie the angel i still don't think is going to work and that pleco isn't needed but if you insist on having one he'll need to be in a gallon tank when approaching adult size i know this might not be in your budget but the grouping isn't going to work out to be honest the cories would be ok if you have other questions you can get extensive help at fishless cycling com just use the link on my profile jv  Dwarf gourami Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Aquarium Kissing gourami Clown loach Gourami Marine aquarium Tilapia Freshwater angelfish Autonomous building Reef tank Fish farming Floppy disk Loach Hard disk Poker jargon Perciformes Toyota Prius Goldfish Clownfish Hydrogen economy E85 Equine conformation Sea-Monkey Extreme Programming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Intelligent design Suckermouth Catfish Cichlid Biodiesel Alcohol fuel Halfbeak Elephant Philosophy of language Thermal power station History of Singapore Hamster Crayfish RISC YuYu Hakusho Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gar Weekly World News Donald Rumsfeld Strap-on dildo Panama Canal B-47 Stratojet CPU cache P-47 Thunderbolt FLCL Shrimp farm Axolotl Fishing RuneScape economy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cruising (maritime) Sex and the City Battle of the Bulge Theory of conduct Microeconomics Coming of Age (TNG episode) Marine angelfish Transformer Sewage treatment Central processing unit Whaling Ethics History of the tank Scientology beliefs and practices Rei Ayanami RuneScape quests Ecology The nature of God in Western theology Logic Milton H.

do betas need special food i have seen things like beta bites and beta chemicals in the pet stores are these just gimmicky items geared towards the ignorent consumer or do betas actually need to be eating special beta bites and be doused in chemicals in order to maintain health i keep my beta in a gallon tank with a couple crabs and a snail the tank has some conditioning salt added at water changes about a table spoon for the gallons of water in the tank i dont mind buying special food and chemicals for the beta because i want its living conditions to be as good as possable but i dont want to be a sucker and buy things i dont need either your betta does need special betta food mainly because he is a carnivore and requires a high protein diet unlike that of most other tropical fish some bettas will tolerate regular tropical fish flakes but only the real betta foods like bloodworms or betta bites hikari bio gold pellets provide him with the nutritional value he needs however you are completely right in saying that most of the betta medication betta housing and betta water conditioner products out there are complete gimmicks bettas have been increasing in popularity as pets but the individual fish are very cheap so pet stores try to reap a profit off the associated items instead for betta medication it's usually just regular medication that has been heavily diluted melafix and bettafix are great examples bettafix is just melafix watered down and i do believe it's quite a bit more expensive for betta housing pet stores take advantage of the betta's hardiness and sell things like pretty betta bowls that hold a fraction of the amount of water your betta would really thrive in the peace lily in a vase setup is a prime example it sells for a lot of money looks very nice but is a torture device for bettas as for betta water conditioner and betta salt and other so called necessary products it's the same stuff that's in all the other bottles just sold for a higher price the pet stores are targeting those new betta owners who don't know much about betta care there are quite a lot of them nowadays and think to themselves hmm i don't know which water conditioner to get better get this specialised betta one just to be safe you get the idea  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hamster Microeconomics Marine aquarium Organic food Nutrition Fish farming Hydrogen economy Plastic Fugu Dieting Healthy eating Shrimp farm Sewage treatment Brewery Uranium Rice Japanese tea ceremony Sears Holdings Corporation Fancy rat Vegetarianism Veganism Breastfeeding Health insurance RuneScape skills Carnivorous plant Gross domestic product MapleStory Illegal drug trade Publicly funded medicine Coffee Alcohol fuel Insulin Trademark Milk MMORPG Biodiesel E85 Tilapia Diabetes mellitus Ecology Guild Wars Tocopherol Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Energy development Mosquito Final Fantasy XI Tax Sugar Solar power Pharmaceutical company Ferret Pet skunk Protein Tofu Kosher foods Inventory Raw food diet Dairy Dwarf gourami Famine Nuclear reactor Hypoglycemia Chocolate Food preservation Vitamin C Fish and chips Life insurance Hydroponics Neopets Ice cream Discus (fish) Shark Surplus value Environmental vegetarianism Gaia Online Capitalism Inflation Edible salt Insurance Atkins Nutritional Approach Food RuneScape Sea-Monkey Taxation in the United States Supply and demand Economy of the United States

bringing a fish home for college break i want to bring a fish to college with me but i have to drive fly home for breaks because i know i shouldnt leave the fish there even if it is just a goldfish or beta fish any suggestions on how to get it home hi laura if you can do the entire journey by driving it would be better for the fish you will need a battery powered double air pump a couple of new buckets half fill both buckets with tank water in one transport your fish with an airstone running but nothing else in there ensure it is safely stowed preferably on the floor in front of the passenger seat secured with cushions so it cannot move also ensure you have suitable 'breathable' cover over the top such as netting secured with elastic bands it would be good if you could keep it as dark as possible so perhaps cover with a towel in the other bucket of tank water place the filter so as to preserve the beneficial bacteria on the media any tank ornaments plants gravel finally place the other airstone in this bucket you are ready for the off depending on how large the volume of water you may need further buckets it's best to try to keep as much of the original water as possible dismantle pack the tank fish last thing before you leave unpack rebuild the tank first thing on arrival hope this is some help good luck drive carefully it sounds a big ordeal but it's really easy just takes some time to organise once you have done it once it will be a breeze your fish is obviously well loved  Aquarium Sewage treatment Sento Brewery Energy development Dairy Marine aquarium Cruising (maritime) Solar power Anchor Seismic retrofit Glossary of wildland fire terms USS Yorktown (CV-5) Stock car (rail) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydrogen economy Cannabis cultivation Autonomous building Mars Exploration Rover Fossil fuel power plant Professional wrestling throws Redundant array of independent disks Tractor USS S-35 (SS-140) Protoss Vacuum cleaner Fast bowling Novelty (locomotive) USS Tunny (SS-282) Airport Armoured warfare Wildfire Flush toilet Fishing Sea-Monkey Glossary of firefighting terms Yerba mate Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hard disk Menstrual cup Locomotive Fish farming Comanche Fountain Aerial (dance move) RuneScape locations USS Thresher (SS-200) International response to Hurricane Katrina Fire fighting Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Water purification Automobile Textile manufacturing Volleyball Fugu E85 Terran (StarCraft) Paragliding Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy SS Andrea Doria Tlingit Upholstery Eldfell RuneScape quests Mosquito Combine (Half-Life 2) 24 Hours of Le Mans Tilapia Solar cell Baseball Professional wrestling match types Street-Legal Tidal power Final Fantasy: Unlimited GunZ The Duel Panama Canal Ocean thermal energy conversion The Star Wars Holiday Special B-47 Stratojet Tunisia Campaign Drag racing Airbag Chevrolet Corvair Advance Wars: Dual Strike Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Gas compressor Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shen Gong Wu Elevator Operation Market Garden Aerial firefighting

can anyone tell me if they've experienced aggression in their goldfish tank i recently placed a rhyukin and a common goldfish in my gal tank with my fantail at first they got along however after a day or so they started chasing my fantail around a little then my fantail became so timid and avoidant that he actually got sick i have since removed him and treated him he's looking better perhaps he was already sick and that's why they singled him out or are they just incompatible i would like to put him back in the tank but i don't want to stress him out again does anyone have any advice i'd like to second the person above me on their comment about butting for eggs i once added a new fish to my goldfish tank and witnessed some horrific aggression however these were the same species and one turned out to be a male which was bullying it was actually trying to get the other one which was female to release her eggs once she did everything settled down i found out that adding a female to warmer water then what she is used to can cause her to spawn when faced with a rampant male however i am not sure if this is the case for you you have mixed breeds and i think that your goldfish is simply being aggresive they can swim much faster than a fancy and will eat all the food before your fantail can get any stress can cause a fish to become sick and this is when they are most at risk of developing a disease i would seperate your fancy fantail from your common goldfish and rhyukin and keep him in a seperate tank or donate him to a friend who has a similar breed but your fancy can live quite happily on his own he does not need a tank mate and will probably be glad of the space i hope this has helped  Sea-Monkey Clownfish Chicken Platypus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Seabird Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bottlenose Dolphin Discus (fish) Gray Wolf Salmon Kakapo Decompression sickness House Mouse Fancy Crane Aquarium Murray Cod Halfbeak Tilapia Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Psoriasis Sonic the Hedgehog Bird Acne Fish farming Ostrich American lobster Sewage treatment Swimming Social rule Livestock Diseases of the honeybee Zerg Tasmanian Devil Iowa class battleship Krill Mallard Hedgehog Samuel Goldwyn Vegetarianism Bipolar disorder Sleeping sickness Fugu Koi Cat Lake Burley Griffin Octopus Red Squirrel Gar Crohn's disease Spider Fantail Common cold Mountain Gorilla Mark I (tank) Shrimp farm Monogamy Sexual reproduction Neil Gaiman Mario series enemies Kodocha Factory farming Osteoarthritis Zebra Danio Leatherback Sea Turtle Guinea pig Health insurance Neolithic Revolution El-Fish Development of Darwin's theory Albatross USS Yorktown (CV-5) Eggerland series RuneScape quests Canary Brewery Carp Grunion Minor Harry Potter Beasts Poker jargon Plant breeding Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Frog Myxobolus cerebralis Urinary incontinence Tarantula GoldenEye 007 Antarctic krill Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Aerial (dance move) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Emu

i want a friend for my beta fish what fish could live in his environment i wnat a friend for my beta fish something that could live in his environment and could you tell me how to take care of his friend like with a link or something thanx if your betta is in a bowl or a vase no other fish can live with it other fish require filtration and oxygenated clean water and most need a heater if you have a gallon tank with a filter and heater you could get some neon tetras but that is about it in a bowl or vase you could add some ghost shrimp but they may or may not be eaten by the betta be sure to avoid hyperactive nippy fish and fish that have long flowing fins if kept together permanently one will kill the other goldfish get more than a foot long and will only last a month or two in a bowl no goldfish should be kept with bettas nosoop u for more betta help check out the forum in my profile edit you cannot permanently keep male and female bettas together they should only be housed together for breeding purposes and they must first be properly conditioned to breed and then can only be together for a couple hours at a time until they spawn edit most plecos get about feet long so be sure to research each fish you plan to buy so you don't end up with a huge fish in a small tank  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Aquarium Goldfish Discus (fish) Marine aquarium Dwarf gourami Autonomous building Sewage treatment Brewery Sea-Monkey Koi Reef tank Japanese tea ceremony Shrimp farm Fish farming Murray Cod Tilapia Clownfish Bong Steam (content delivery) Kosher foods Apollo 13 Shark Dam Carburetor Fishing Coffee Fugu Halfbeak Thermal power station Gar Fossil fuel power plant Insulin Gmail Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Axolotl Seine (fishing) Cannabis cultivation Rebreather Humpback Whale Vacuum tube Livestock Hamster E85 Goby Marine biology Solar power Samovar Platypus Tetrapod Atlantic herring Water heater Whaling Lake Burley Griffin Cantonese cuisine Eutrophication Water garden Gaia Online Bird Helium Myxobolus cerebralis Water purification Zebra Danio Chinook salmon Dry cleaning Angling Biodiesel Hydroponics Decompression sickness Water resources Flush toilet MMORPG STS-50 Domestic rabbit Diving cylinder GunZ The Duel Whale Tooth Sushi Seismic retrofit Seabird Wetland Tidal power Acne Menstrual cup Salmon Customs and etiquette of Japan Fire fighting Fancy rat Veganism Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Canary Diabetes mellitus USS Tunny (SS-282) BZFlag Kakapo Nile crocodile Home repair

do people but water half way for their goldfish for mor oxygen if u have a filter do u still need to do that people only do this when they make the mistake of buying a bowl for their goldfish and realize it because their goldfish start gasping for air at the top bowls usually get smaller towards the top so the idea there is the less it's filled the more surface area you have so more air however if you have a proper sized tank and decent filter you do not need to do this  Goldfish Aquarium Brewery Thermal power station Carburetor Hard disk Bong Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment Mattress Scuba set Lung Dry cleaning Fast bowling New York Giants Diesel engine Types of bowlers in cricket Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fountain Diving cylinder Water purification Coffee Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting equipment Slow sand filter bed Flush toilet Siphon Coriolis effect Ecology of Hong Kong Motor oil Rebreather Marine aquarium Super Bowl XXVII Fire fighting E85 Soap bubble Tank Motorcycle Air filter Filter (optics) Air pollution Space Shuttle program Gas metal arc welding Carbon dioxide Ozone depletion Koi GunBound Gar Cheating in poker PNG Norouz American Dad!

why do people keep their beta fish in such a small bowl it seems cruel to me it seems cruel to me the fish can't even swim around they take them home from the pet store and keep them in the same small bowl pet owners should educate their customers you are right the small cups and tiny bowls often used fr display of bettas in shops makes a horrible home for a betta it is a fact that those cups and bowls were never intended to be a long term home for the betta just a holding place until it is sold which is usually less than a week if the store orders correctly it would be nice if stores would educate people buying bettas but that would require the stores to be educated and that's not the case in too many stores really it's up to the buyer to educate themselves and too many will not do so all you need to do is look at some of the answers you have gotten before mine to see how many people don't bother to educate themselves about bettas while a batte can be kept in a gallon bowl and most breeders like myself find that to be the best way to handle large numbers of bettas a filtered and heated tank is certainly far better for the typical pet betta owner mm  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dairy Discus (fish) Domestic rabbit Pet store Goldfish Gaia Online Aquarium Brewery Orlando, Florida Coffee Hamster Commodore 64 Japanese tea ceremony Bong Pet skunk Marine aquarium Password Sea-Monkey Sears Holdings Corporation Microchip implant (animal) Billboard Hot 100 CPU cache Supply and demand Microeconomics Stanley Cup Dog Real estate broker Argos (retailer) Floppy disk Shopping Database Carburetor Swimming pool Inventory Bikini Bottom Dilbert Tea Dwarf gourami RuneScape economy Bayesian inference RuneScape Random Events Atari ST Sento Atari 8-bit family Starbucks Cigarette Fast bowling ITunes Music Store Animal Crossing Retailer Solar power Oakland Raiders Cricket Taxicab Software testing Dobermann Vehicle registration plate Quizbowl Bulk vending RuneScape locations Customs and etiquette of Japan Pet Uranium DirectShow Steam (content delivery) Puppy mill Nuclear power Internet fraud Best Buy CPU design The Pet Sounds Sessions Game show UK Singles Chart Cat Pysanka Fish farming Guinea pig Expert system Dot-com Supermarket Labrador Retriever Filling station Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Hydrogen economy Leicester City Centre Chopsticks Warranty Ramen Pet Sounds Compact audio cassette Laserdisc Dog training Tesco Contract Bird Animal euthanasia Pixel Brassiere

betta feeding i just bought a male betta for my daughter the people at petsmart told me that i should only feed it one or two grains of the betta food every two or three days since bettas have a problem with obesity the food itself says to feed every day my daughter is already horribly attached to her fish and i would hate myself if something happened to it can anyone with betta experience knowledge give me a little insight thank you i do have him in a tank with a filter and live plants i've had fish before just not this particular breed i know he won't live forever but i want to give him the best and longest life possible a betta's stomach is about as big as his eyeball you can give him little grains of betta food daily or every other day he'll eat as much as you feed him though so if you overfeed he will a get chubby and b excess nutrients will pass through him and foul the water a few things you should know if you really want to keep your betta as healthy and happy as possible for as long as possible you should get him at least a gallon tank with a filter and heater with thermostat he will be healthiest in water that stays stable at a temp somewhere between and degrees fahrenheit get into a habit of regular partial water changes every week using a gravel vac to clean a portion of the tank's gravel each time and be sure to remember to condition the new water and have it the same temp as the water in the tank as drastic temperature changes stress the fish and make him more susceptible to disease a tank is superior to a bowl for a lot of reasons first it's impossible to keep the water in a bowl at a stable temp there are no small tank or bowl heaters with thermostats just heaters that will raise the temp degrees from ambient which means if your house is degrees the betta will be and if your house goes up to on a hot day the betta will be not so good also bowls and smaller tanks don't really cycle that is they don't develop the biological filter the bacteria colonies that keep wastes from building up and making the water toxic you have to change too much of the water for a true cycle that means wastes build up rapidly and the water can get pretty toxic long before it looks bad so definitely at least a gallon tank is the minimum a betta needs for a healthy life and then be prepared the betta is the hamster of the aquatic pet they do not live very long years is usually the best you can hope for i've heard of people who say they've had them longer but that's unusual i think part of the problem is that they're awfully inbred breeders inbreed constantly to get those flashy tails and colors so i think they come with some built in health issues  Marine aquarium Hamster Sewage treatment Diseases of the honeybee Domestic rabbit Ecology Goldfish Dairy Eutrophication Shrimp farm Dog Water Nutrition Thermal power station Cat Fish farming Discus (fish) Vitamin C Carnivorous plant Coffee Livestock House Mouse Raw food diet Brewery Solar power Factory farming Fugu Sea-Monkey Biodiesel Chicken Guinea pig HVAC Obesity Apollo 13 Energy development Myxobolus cerebralis Krill Foodborne illness Alcohol fuel Fossil fuel power plant Agriculture Axolotl Carburetor Tilapia Tobacco smoking Breastfeeding Health insurance Hard water Veganism Vegetarianism Dry cleaning Tocopherol Stomach cancer Nuclear power Dam Hydrogen sulfide Sorghum Hydrogen economy Water (molecule) Refrigerator Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Reef tank Kashrut Carbon dioxide Organic food Hydroponics Fish Honeybee Dieting Animal testing Gray Wolf Chronic fatigue syndrome Plant breeding Equine conformation Rebreather Insulin Water purification Ozone depletion Koi Fancy rat Green Revolution Pet skunk Chopsticks Sexual reproduction Tooth enamel Welding Menstrual cycle Plutonium

female bettas and other fish what kind of fish are good with female bettas are african dwarf frogs good tank mates for them my original plan was to have female bettas and maybe an adf or in the tank it's a gallon adf get along great with beta's male or female you can keep several females together however do not keep more than one male per tank as they will fight to the death we have had female bettas in with platy's and mollys successfully we however have a much larger tank the amount of fish you mentioned would be a nice fit in a gal just be sure you have allowed time for the tank to cycle develop a bio filter of positive bacteria before adding all the fish you can speed that process by purchasing a product called cycle at petsmart petco another tip to remember is that betas are surface breathers so it is essential that they be able to reach the surface to breath also make sure to remember to do your weekly water changes where you vacuum the gravel and remove of the water and then add fresh water along with a product to remove chlorine etc such as stress coat and you will have a happy healthy set up  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sewage treatment Brewery Dairy Aquarium Fish farming Marine aquarium Dry cleaning Dwarf gourami Biodiesel Water purification Hard disk Floppy disk Glacier Spider Mark I (tank) Thermal power station Carbon dioxide Ecology Bong Fugu Sea-Monkey GunBound Sailfin Molly F-16 Fighting Falcon Motorcycle Hydrogen sulfide Autonomous building Halitosis Insulin Goldfish Fire fighting Rebreather Water Eutrophication Solar power Jet engine E85 Rice Tank Faster-than-light Ozone depletion Fossil fuel power plant Elephant Gas metal arc welding Carnivorous plant Sonar Corrosion Water (molecule) Sugar beet Final Fantasy magic Hamster Drill bit Breaststroke Glossary of firefighting equipment Motor oil Sugar Dinghy Panzer I Galileo spacecraft Shrimp farm African clawed frog Wetland Ozone hole Swimming pool Chlorine Helium Milk Toyota Prius Coffee Diving Plastic Welding Butterfly stroke Swimming Fishing Rail terminology Sun Polymerase chain reaction Development stage Electrophysiology Tank landing ship Ecco the Dolphin Mitsubishi Zero Dead Like Me Leatherback Sea Turtle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Platypus Software testing Clownfish CPU cache B-24 Liberator Antarctic krill Shark Microeconomics Panzer II RISC Menstrual cup

my daughters guppy s tank is turning green every time we put water in help yeah after days the water turns green and she cleans it out what should i do my daughters yahoo answers name is vampire love sounds like an algae growth problem is the tank in direct sunlight the best way to keep algae growth to a minimum is to cut down on the amount of light going into a tank either move it to where it gets less sunlight or shut off the lights more often so that the tank gets less light adding more live plants will also help as the plants will use up the nutrients the algae needs to grow there are also creatures she can get to help eat the algae but algae eaters will usually not eat all the algae in a tank they just help keep the growth down to a minimum a little algae growing in a tank is not the end of the world the fish really don't mind it and it's not detrimental to their health tell her not to panic and clean out all the water if she has an algae bloom just cut back on the light and do frequent water changes to minimize the algae if she wants algae eaters my top recommendations would be otos fish bristle nose plecos fish apple snails ghost glass shrimp red cherry shrimp or ramshorns snails siamese algae eaters fish are good as well but they can be hard to find and hard to tell from other types of fish that aren't as good at eating algae and they stop eating algae as they grow older and they get aggressive as they age  Eutrophication Marine aquarium Algae Sea-Monkey Nutrient Fish farming Plant Lake Shrimp farm Veganism Coral reef RuneScape skills Diatom Sunlight Chlorophyta Venus Flytrap Discus (fish) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fugu Animal Tilapia Chinook salmon Halfbeak Carbon dioxide Green alga Agriculture Solar power Tobacco Cantonese cuisine Algal bloom Hamster The Time Machine Polar Bear Irrigation RuneScape quests Photosynthesis Biodiesel Solar panel Coral Krill Autonomous building Cell (biology) Carnivorous plant Acorn Omega-3 fatty acid Christmas tree Fancy rat Roman eating and drinking Lichen Marine biology The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Coffee Wine Passive solar Eye Cyanide Cuisine of Denmark Aquarium Leaf Potato Vegetarianism Guinea pig Lake Burley Griffin Japanese tea ceremony Water garden Yellow Salmon Reef tank Ecology Light pollution Light-emitting diode German cuisine Tea Rail terminology Red Vs.

why is my guppy acting like this i have guppies i was watching them before i went to bed last night i noticed that when of my guppy swam close to the other one the other one curved his body and started to jerk what does that mean i hope i am making sence are they both males if so they might be fighting or play fighting mine will often do a similar sort of thing it starts like this one male guppy will chase the other around for a while then the first will turn and face the second and they will hover or swim facing each other for a bit then one will dart forward to the side of one trying to nip its fin the other will bend its body into a curve to try to protect its fin and pull it out of reach and either jerk away quickly or swim around to try to nip the other guppy's fin either they will swim around in a little circle for a minute both with their bodies bent trying to nip each others' fins or one will give up and turn around and swim away and the chase will resume it's usually more play fighting than serious as none of my guppies have ever had seriously nipped fins or injuries and they do it all the time they are just very aggressive boys don't worry if they clamp their tails while they are in fight mode either it's not a sign of illness or stress they are just protecting their beautiful tails from being nipped if one is a male and one is a female they should not behave like this mating behavior is shown by the male guppy chasing the female and poking his nose at her gravid spot the dark spot just behind the curve of her belly they will mate by him rolling under her with his gonopodium pointy anal fin extended this is very quick and rarely actually seen you usually just see the male chasing the female around and poking at her gravid spot and sometimes flashing extending his gonopodium  Aerial (dance move) Cat Diving Bottlenose Dolphin Platypus Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Equine conformation Dog Unreal Puma American lobster Orgasm Poker jargon Breaststroke Glossary of ballet terms Professional wrestling throws Atlantic herring Suplex Front crawl Swingout Shark Dog training The Legend of Zelda series enemies Drowning Professional wrestling attacks Welding Parachuting Cheetah Elephant Fish anatomy Shaggy dog story Nile crocodile Dolphin USS Thresher (SS-200) Frogman Motility Electrophysiology Spider Anatomical terms of location Boxing USS Trigger (SS-237) Swimming House Mouse Orca Conker's Bad Fur Day B-47 Stratojet Xenomorph Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Whale behaviour Spanking Snake Tag Gesture Humpback Whale Nip/Tuck Eye Milton H.

snails in aquarium yesterday i purchased a x x aquarium set it up with live plants and gravel and a filter etc etc put all the water in and let it run overnight to start the runnning in period this morning i lifted the lid off to find two tiny little snails in the tank they're currently very small i'd say no longer than mm at the most maybe even mm anyway first what should i do with them are they likely to breed how soon and also are they in danger at all due to the lack of algae and bacteria in my tank please help i've just had a closer look at them they have shells that are long like ice cream cones with like a spiral around it they seem to have black and brown yellow dots on their shell any indication of a breed they are good for your tank they clean up left overs and help contriol algae i like them in my tank i do not do live plants cause i always kill them so i don't get any in that way so to get started i kept my eye open at the fish store and ask for a few when i saw them once i had a few they took care of themselves by breeding of course once i had them in one tank it was easy to move a few to the other tank people say that they breed like crazy i have never found that to be a problem some fish will learn to eat the small ones and the egg patches they lay helping keep them under control i think that also their population is controled by the amount of waste and algea in your tank as a side note do not put a penny in your tank hard metals are bad for all life in your tank if you decide you do not like snails there is a special liquid at the fish stores that will kill only the snails i believe it is safe for all fish but read the label to be sure or ask i have never used it because i like them so i do not know all the details on it  Sea-Monkey Marine aquarium Fugu Sewage treatment Aquarium Discus (fish) Algae Snail Water purification Fish farming Motorcycle Brewery Fishing Goldfish Hamster Halfbeak Clownfish Carbon dioxide Roman eating and drinking Octopus Dairy Biodiesel Autonomous building Coral reef Ice cream Danio Koi Hydroponics Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) BZFlag Reef tank Fire fighting Antarctic krill Frog Egg (food) Nuclear power Atlantic herring Agar plate Hydrogen economy Pysanka Kissing gourami Japanese tea ceremony Carnivorous plant Animal Tag Beetle Floppy disk Textile manufacturing Energy development Cantonese cuisine Life in the Freezer Money Freshwater angelfish Food Seabird Dog Fuel cell Water Fancy rat Japanese toilet Sento Hydrogen vehicle Battle of Tarawa Diseases of the honeybee Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cyanide Salmon Tlingit Operation Market Garden Dry cleaning Smoke-screen Kodocha Water pollution Shrimp farm Tofu Eutrophication Guinea pig Egg (biology) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Bong Seine (fishing) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kosher foods Spider Terminal ballistics Zerg Hydrogen sulfide American Alligator Eye E85 American lobster Drill bit Casting Lake Potato

what type of fish i can have in my fresh water pond it all depends on your size personally i have a gallon pond with inch long goldfish in it it will soon contain almost gallons i'm playing with the measurements right now and more goldies it's entirely indoor will have a small waterfall and will be planted with low light hardy plants goldies typically end up taking about gallons each when they reach the foot long stage so guessing that the other two will be a foot long gallons is a minimum on the high end of the scale for all five fish and if the other two don't survive at least the three originals have an absolutely beautiful massive place to live in  Goldfish Aquarium Fish farming Fossil fuel power plant Koi English unit Tilapia Water garden Shrimp farm Japanese tea ceremony Panama Canal Volume Power station Marine aquarium Biodiesel Gallon Lake Swimming pool Ecology Pond Fuel efficiency Thermal power station Sewage treatment Potomac River Smelt Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ton Houseplant Water (molecule) Carnivorous plant Imperial unit E85 Fire extinguisher Ocean thermal energy conversion Bladderwort Softball Murray River U.S. customary units Dairy Illegal drug trade Alcohol fuel Drill bit Homebrewing Ship model Gasoline Hydrogen economy Gardening Lighting Volleyball Inertial confinement fusion Town gas Density Autonomous building Eyepiece Metrified English unit Stairway Windsurfing Transformer Pansy River Mattress Pachypodium baronii Nuclear power Chatsworth House Barrel (storage) Economy of Algeria Irrigation Hydroponics Largest organism Parallax Aquifer Iowa class battleship Goldeen Yacht Antenna (radio) Concrete Cannabis cultivation Hamster Milk Orlando, Florida Murray Cod Temperature Metrication in Canada Cross-country skiing Shotgun Carbon dioxide Tide Explosive material Iceland Maui Lacrosse Dog agility Sea ice Optical fiber Solar power Bong Thermoregulation Garden Firework

how long for silicone to dry i made some caves for my cichlids by using aquarium safe silicone to glue rocks together how long should it sit before i add it to the tank it's been days now it should be plenty dry now if you used normal amounts normal would be to ' thick lines or spots if you used huge globs that were very thick and wide and deep it could take weeks smell it it puts off an acidic smell as it dries when that is gone it is finished drying thanks for the idea also i never thought of doing something like that i like to make different stuff for my tanks also the decorations in the store lack imagination  Dairy Tofu Carbon dioxide Textile manufacturing Solar cell Discus (fish) Brewery Dry cleaning Aquarium Corrosion Hamster Fishing Pottery Cichlid Silly Putty Electrophysiology Cave diving Seismic retrofit Sento Ramen Tire Castle of the Winds Transformer Drill bit Second Battle of El Alamein Casting Bread The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe RISC Snowball Earth Tilapia Diving suit Knife Pok__mon Abilities Straw-bale construction Pachypodium habitats Thermal power station Comanche Japanese tea ceremony Nuclear fallout Water purification Rice Dialysis Leather Paint Illegal drug trade Menstrual cup Freshwater angelfish Hemp Carlsbad Caverns National Park Japanese toilet Geology of the Moon Cyanide Glass Compost Fancy rat Floppy disk Silicon Tank classification Campfire Sulfur Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Basil Pebble bed reactor Space Shuttle external tank Mattress Fish and chips Guinea pig Epcot Semiconductor Coriander Fire extinguisher Geology of the Grand Canyon area Cruising (maritime) Friction Food preservation RuneScape skills Tooth enamel Upholstery Jute Ammonia Tank Cave Battery (electricity) Flood geology Sulfuric acid Battle of Kursk Wheel of Fortune Swimming pool Gelatin Volcano Sushi Polydimethylsiloxane Sugar beet Mount Pinatubo Polyethylene terephthalate T-34 Origin of life Gramophone record

does anyone know how to cement a watergarden or pond so it doesn't leak we have a koi fish pond in our front yard but it has been leaking for over months so i would like to know how to do the cement part so it will no longer leak you will have to drain it first and then let it dry completely cement it as if you were just putting it in you should have lined it so it wouldn't leak though so after you fix the leak make sure to put a liner in it of some kind my cousin used an unused farmer's chemical tank that a local store let her have and cut the top off it made a great size pond for her small back yard but you can get a liner made especially for ponds that will work and no more leaks  Dairy Pond Shrimp farm Rigging Sushi Concrete Hemp Murray River Knife Battles of Lexington and Concord Floppy disk Textile manufacturing Rail terminology Urinary incontinence USS Tunny (SS-282) Thermal power station Elis Prefecture Koi Fish farming Hydrogen economy Bassoon Fisheries in Hong Kong Glossary of firefighting equipment Swimming pool USS Vestal (AR-4) Goldfish Rail tracks Nuclear power Rathfarnham Sewage treatment Sittingbourne Aquarium Bus models used in New York City Transit Ice cream Hay Carbon dioxide Nine Inch Nails Menstrual cup Animal Crossing Variable USS S-37 (SS-142) New York Connecting Railroad Teller-Ulam design USS Aylwin (DD-355) Plame affair Ernest Harmon Air Force Base SS Andrea Doria Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Super Bowl XVIII Memory leak St Albans Cathedral USS Nautilus (SS-168) Biological warfare Panama Canal Locks Super Bowl I The Emancipation of Mimi Casting Poker jargon Oxyacetylene Lechaina Killifish Town gas Geodesic dome Roof The Sims 2 Downing Street memo Four square Krag-J__rgensen Bengali cuisine Glossary of American football Hebburn Jackass: The Movie Water garden Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Illegal drug trade Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Heinkel He 112 Honda CX series DuPont Stream Passive solar Tier One Achtung Baby Naruto jutsu Page table Drainage Armored Core Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XVII Operation Market Garden USS Saury (SS-189) Residual-current device Basement Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Flax Fossil fuel power plant Greenland Dock Super Bowl XVI Marching band

can i house female bettas in a gallon tank i know females can live together obviously males cannot in larger tanks i've even seen them housed together peacefully at pet shops instead of in the little cups it seems if you keep a large enough group it diffuses their aggression but i thought gallons might be pushing it this can work with enough plants as already mentioned but there is no guarantee some betta females are nearly as aggressive as males and can even kill other females it works best when they were raised together then they don't pick on each other much the other and better possibility would be buying betta imbellis crescent betta instead of betta splendens they look like the wild forms of betta splendens albeit smaller and are called peaceful bettas for a reason the males won't kill each other when they fight but not because they are really more peaceful but because they are smaller weaker and don't protect such a large territorium even other possibility is to buy some mouthbrooding bettas like betta picta they are not as colourful but they are really peaceful and even should be kept in small groups with a number of both males and females but still plants are important for all bettas out there  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Poker jargon Dairy Tilapia Fire fighting Dwarf gourami Tarantula Hamster Leopard Elephant Lion Sexual dimorphism Brewery Marine aquarium Combine (Half-Life 2) Free trade Nuclear power Domestic rabbit Treaty of Versailles Liger Spider Mountain Gorilla Domestication Clownfish American lobster Tank Hydrogen economy Tiger Chris Kanyon Sesshomaru Unreal Fish farming Arab-Israeli conflict British Army Cosmic Era human enhancements Non-aggression principle Hyperreal number Single Transferable Vote House Mouse Aquarium Platypus Axolotl Sea-Monkey Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Canary Betting (poker) Toyota Prius Agriculture Tank classification Species Gourami Surveillance Conifer cones Banana Gas turbine Antioch, Pisidia Nuclear warfare Democratic peace theory Playoff Brit Awards Craps Corporation Discus (fish) Non-human animal sexuality Internal ballistics Rave Master Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Biodiesel Sento Monogamy Centre Province, Cameroon Gray Wolf U.S. Electoral College Fossil fuel power plant Mallard Guinea pig Legend of Mana Greco-Bactrian Kingdom International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Autonomous building Iraq disarmament crisis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina First Maori War Thermal power station Winter War Mark I (tank) Dragons (Pern) Chamarajanagar Erwin Rommel Al-Aqsa Intifada F-16 Fighting Falcon Cooking weights and measures Gallon Fancy rat Final Fantasy XI Solar power Nickname Animal communication Panthera hybrid

why did clownfish die i had two percula clownfish for a year and a half they died suddenly a few weeks ago i noticed the smaller fish one morning swimming rapidly sideways with a whitish face and he died minutes later i tried to feed him before he died but he wouldn't eat he was heading towards the filter so i shut it off so he wouldn't be sucked up after he died i promptly removed the dead fish and the other one seemed fine i was very distraught over the fish dying so i forgot to turn the filter back on the next morning the other fish still seemed ok so i turned the filter back on he immediately began acting as the other fish had before he died and was also soon dead within minutes what could have caused this i'm confused because i had them for quite a while with no problems whatsoever they seemed to be very happy and active when they were alive i want to know because i'm thinking of replacing them but am hesitant to because i'm not sure what went wrong this could have been a water quality issue but it may have also been a parasite that produces the condition called clownfish disease brooklynella which is somewhat confusing because fish other than clownfish can get it i would try to rule out a water quality problem first because it's easier to remedy test or have a pet store test for you the ph ammonia nitrite and nitrate levels in the tank and also the temperature and salinity if all these check out as within normal ranges ph ammonia and nitrite nitrate temperature o salinity fish only or reef i would suspect the parasite you an check the photos in this link to diseases of marine fish http home pacific net ph sweetyummy disease html for brooklynella and others but also click on the name brooklynella where it appears in red names in red will open a link to another page with more photos and information about the condition if this is the cause you should not have any fish in the tank for at least weeks to allow time for the parasites to die for lack of a host reef setup you couls also drain all the water and refill the tank with freshwater which ould also kill the parasites but it will also kill the bacteria that cycle the wastes as well as any inverts in the tank if you habe fish other than the clowns you should remove these as well and treat them in a separate tank with a medication containing formalin  Clownfish Sewage treatment Fish farming Eutrophication Aquarium Diseases of the honeybee Coral reef Ecology Shark Thermal power station Dairy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ammonia Reef tank Traumatic brain injury Shaggy dog story Percula Clownfish Asthma Tidal power Cyanide Dialysis Carburetor Tuberculosis Biogeochemical cycle USS Tunny (SS-282) First aid Hydrogen sulfide Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Fugu Dead Sea Fishing Foodborne illness Water purification Hydrogen economy Malaria E85 Dam Poker jargon Snake Fossil fuel power plant Items in the Metroid series Brewery Insulin Hypoglycemia Cirrhosis Virus Common cold Dry cleaning Aquaculture Autonomous building Hard disk USS Yorktown (CV-5) Finding Nemo Water Kidney Krill Biology Fancy rat Water (molecule) Great Barrier Reef Drowning Antarctic krill Mosquito Chronic fatigue syndrome Rebreather Carbon dioxide Sea-Monkey Ozone depletion Global warming and agriculture Immortality Nuclear power Nerpa Heartworm Medicine StarCraft: Uprising Hamster Toyota Prius Medical prescription Nitrogen Sonar Marine biology Schistosomiasis Characters of Naruto Dead Like Me Halitosis Salmon Energy development Agar plate Atlantic Ocean Salton Sea Baylisascaris

can bettas be in the same tank with goldfish and guppies do you actually have your goldfishes with your guppies i raise mine in seperate tanks i've tried unsuccessfully in the past to combine them in the same tanks but goldfishes are pretty aggressive to fishes other then themselves they nonstop harrassed my guppies and my betta to death i have since raised the goldfishes and guppies in seperate tanks it wasn't always like that when the goldfishes were about the same size as the adult guppies they were fine but as the goldfishes got steadily bigger they got more aggressive so be wary of that in the future i've also unsuccessfully raised male betas together with my guppies they leave the females well enough alone but do nip and tear my male fancy guppies tails i have also seperated them thankfully the guppies tails are growing back i bred them for their coloring and was really disappointed when half of their tail was gone male betas are very much independent breeds of fish they do in fact do fine with bottom feeders such as a pleco if you have female betas you can place them in the tank i had my friend raising his female beta with his mollies he was also unsuccessful in keeping his male beta with the mollies as it incessently harassed them also just place your beta in a pretty tank it can be small a one gallon's plenty suitable good luck with your fish other people's comments were also on the money goldfishes do well on their own diet whereas guppies thrive on tropical fish food and betas have their own as well goldfishes do prefer colder temperature of water whereas tropical beta and guppies prefer warmer temperatures besides that goldfishes are the dirtiest fishes to raise they secrete a slime that other fishes won't be able to survive for long as in past a couple of months ever try to clean their filters cleaning the goldfish tank's filter is like ugh the grossest work i do ever happy fishing  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Aquarium Discus (fish) Fish farming Tilapia Gray Wolf Brewery Clownfish Guppy American lobster Seabird Antarctic krill House Mouse Poker jargon Dry cleaning Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Platypus Pocket cruiser Bottlenose Dolphin Hamster Shrimp farm Mosquitofish Social rule Samuel Goldwyn Dog Marine aquarium Nuclear fallout Sexual selection Murray Cod Biodiesel Thermal power station P-38 Lightning Autonomous building Swimming pool Live-bearing aquarium fish Fugu Garfield Pet skunk Goldeen Diseases of the honeybee Hydrogen economy Tuatara Leatherback Sea Turtle Humpback Whale Gay slang Reef tank Nile crocodile Orca Krill USS Tunny (SS-282) Houseplant American Alligator Halfbeak Tigon Myxobolus cerebralis Dairy Xenomorph Tank locomotive Striped bass Pittsburgh Steelers Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Kakapo Lake Burley Griffin Peafowl Stereoscopy Geography of Chile Brave New World Cloud 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fish Sea-Monkey Dwarf gourami Tank Guinea pig Bird migration Bread Zebra Danio Seine (fishing) Canary First Battle of the Atlantic Gaia Online The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Chicken E85 Ecco the Dolphin Fin Whale El Ni__o The Perishers Textile manufacturing RuneScape locations Chinook salmon

aquarium plants i was wondering if i could put any regular plant in an aquarium with fish without the plant harming the fish because i have regular plants in pots that i would rather see in an aquarium than the kinds you buy in the store so i was hoping i could put them in my aquarium nope aquatic plants are of entirely different species than plants that grow outside of water and have different methods of absorbing nutrients sorry even those that are grown submerged roots in water leaves out by stores have to adjust and have a lot of leaves die out before they manage to recover and grow leaves that can handle being immersed in water if you don't want to pay money to buy your plants from the store go down to the nearest pond or lake and scrounge some plants up from the bottom just make sure you give them a good rinse in a weak bleach solution and then quarantine them for a week or two before you put them in with your fish so you don't introduce any aquatic pests or diseases into your aquarium  Hydroponics Houseplant Goldfish Coral reef Textile manufacturing Fish farming Fishing Tilapia Irrigation Sewage treatment Flowering plant Wetland Poker jargon Weed control Fish Myxobolus cerebralis Carnivorous plant Comfrey Shrimp farm Zebra Danio Brewery Autonomous building Eutrophication Maize Japanese tea ceremony Cannabis cultivation Discus (fish) Invasive species in Australia Elodea Water garden Bonsai Lake Gypsy moth Aquatic plant Carp Introduced species Tomato Plant Crayfish Beaver Soil pH Taro Sugar beet Hamster Agriculture Great Lakes Water Jellyfish Bladderwort Weed Green Revolution Eucalyptus Hydrogen peroxide Leaf Dairy Koi Coffee Nutrient Sea-Monkey Nuclear power Invasive species Root Frog Chlorophyta Salmon Carbon dioxide Hemp Fern Acorn Halfbeak Hippeastrum Cycad Hydrogen economy Apple Brook trout Kelp forest Mattress Environmental concerns with electricity generation Suckermouth Catfish Ivy Aztec Gar Wheat Live-bearing aquarium fish Organic farming Peach Tetrapod Energy development Ecology Tillandsia Water purification Tea Hop (plant)

can fish mix breed with each other like dogs for example like for example can a red zebra cichlid breed with an electric yellow cichlid it might be impossible for a say cichlid to breed with a gourami but what about the same kinds but different groups thanks all it depends on the species and how far apart they are if you want to know if two different types of fish can cross breed your best bet is to look up the latin names of the fish if the first part of their latin name is the same then they can cross breed if they are different then probably not for example guppies and mollies which are both freshwater livebearers can cross breed although the fry are not always viable this is because they are both members of the poecilia family guppies poecilia reticulata mollies poecilia latipinna but neither guppies or mollies can cross breed with platys or swordtails even though those are also freshwater livebearers however platys and swordtails can cross breed with each other platys xiphophorus maculatus swordtail xiphophorus helleri below is a site that lists a lot of the latin names of fish along with their common names and will help you see what fish can cross breed with other fish  Live-bearing aquarium fish Green swordtail Guppy Southern platyfish Sailfin Molly Poeciliidae Cichlid Xiphophorus Discus (fish) Hybrid Tilapia Freshwater angelfish Oscar (fish) Gourami Halfbeak Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Salmon Mixed-breed dog Jack Dempsey (fish) Dwarf gourami Perciformes Dog breed Zebra Danio Brackish water Fish farming Shrimp farm Kissing gourami Killifish Piranha Fish Lake Burley Griffin F1 hybrid Yellow Seabird Aquarium Cod Rift Valley lakes Mosquitofish Lake Tanganyika Livestock Lake Malawi Golden Retriever Goby Species German cuisine Perch Louis Agassiz Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Zambezi Monster Rancher monsters Great Cormorant Working animal Marine angelfish Fish migration Fly fishing Animals in space Batoidea Gar Galaxiid Domestication Jack Russell Terrier Common Tern Gray Wolf Parthenogenesis Roseate Tern Tung Chung Cattle Chocobo Sandwich Tern Border Collie Fishery Double-crested Cormorant Fish and chips Roman eating and drinking Nile perch Chicken Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Murray Cod Sexual selection Fisheries in Hong Kong Australian Shepherd Shark Plant breeding Sex-determination system Peruvian cuisine Fishing Platypus Horse Dobermann Lion Mussel Bird migration Pocket cruiser Australian Kelpie Goldfish Marine aquarium Macquarie Perch German Shepherd Dog Breakfast Dr. Seuss

new white spots on male goldfish i just noticed white dots on teh tops of the pectoral fins of my male goldfish i dont think they werent there a few weeks ago or a few days ago so im assuming this is ich or are these typical male spots like the ones on this gill plates its kinda strange theyre on both fins in the same area are these just at the very front of the pectorals as in this photo http www bristol aquarists org uk goldfish info sexing fs htm goldfish normally breed in the spring and sometimes in the fall outdoors but if yours are in a tank and they have lighting no cues by length of daylight and you have an air conditioner they have little sense of when the spawning season should be so it might be possible that these are breeding tubercles especially if you know this is a male and he's showing them on the gill covers as well having ich show up in the same areas on both fins and nowhere else would be quite a coincidence but it could be possible  Goldfish Aquarium Fish anatomy Oarfish Discus (fish) Zeidae Shark Marine aquarium Oceanic Whitetip Shark Bottlenose Dolphin Kissing gourami Marine angelfish Perch Tank Capercaillie Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dragonet Daylight saving time Cadillac Eldorado Goldeen Combine (Half-Life 2) Snooker Cat Billiards Ostracoderm Rocket propelled grenade Equine conformation Goby Lumpsucker Barreleye Australian salmon Emu Bird migration Lanternfish Aphid Koi House Mouse Shrimp farm Roswell UFO incident Microphone Color Gar Lion Horse Unreal Ridgehead Fugu Coelacanth Murray Cod Vehicle registration plate Knight Rider Lighting Mechanical Animals Dog Live-bearing aquarium fish Rainbow trout Clownfish Angler Solar power Batoidea Dog show Temporal bone Domain name Motorcycle Solar eclipse Danio Utah Sperm Whale Yellow Neil Gaiman Carburetor Tire Diving suit Domain Name System Whale shark Panzer II Automobile Blue Whale Dolphin The Price Is Right Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Jeopardy!

will two beta fish hurt themselves if they can see eachother i have this little bowl thing my sister kept her fish in it's basically two halves of the same bowl seperated i know that if you put the betta fish in the same tank they'll kill eachother but if i put two in the seperate sides without putting a divider i e construction paper between them are they going to hurt themselves by bashing against the wall or anything this is really not a good idea firstly yes they will hurt themselves if they can see each other all the time they may ram their heads against the wall or they may get stressed out and start tail biting also having to see another male betta all the time is extremely exhausting for a betta because he'll be flaring and patrolling his water all day and won't get the rest he needs what's more bettas are great jumpers and if one of them ever escapes over the divider into the other one's section it won't be pretty secondly the amount of water you'll have them in sounds tiny it's true that bettas can survive in small amounts of water but they certainly won't be happy bettas need at least gallons of water each and the water needs to be heated at a constant temperature of degrees f so you'll need to get a heater as well it's cruel to put a betta in such a small unheated amount of water  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Entropy Temperature Aquarium Autonomous building Marine aquarium Goldfish Brewery Furnace Equine conformation Pittsburgh Steelers Fire fighting Thermal power station Fish farming Diesel engine Shark Hydrogen economy HVAC Wind turbine Jet engine Carburetor Thermoregulation Terran (StarCraft) Battle of Tarawa Theory of conduct Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Tenshinhan Sun Wood Pink Floyd Elis Prefecture Solar power Items in the Metroid series Fossil fuel power plant Spacecraft propulsion 2000 Australian Grand Prix Phase (matter) E85 Apollo 13 Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fire extinguisher EastEnders Water heater Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Seismic retrofit Swimming pool USS Tunny (SS-282) Faster-than-light Japanese toilet Internal ballistics Corona Slayers Natural disaster Dog agility Energy development Mars Exploration Rover Japanese tea ceremony P-38 Lightning Glossary of firefighting terms Flood geology Microeconomics Explosive material The Wall Heat capacity Panama Canal Rugby union positions Diseases of the honeybee Steam engine Movie projector Bong Contrail Cube (film) USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Axial compressor BASE jumping Oxygen sensor Tacoma, Washington Pikmin Blood (computer game) Fast bowling Bladderwort Dam Project Orion Customs and etiquette of Japan Dragon Booster Final Fantasy magic Nuclear thermal rocket Hard water USS Taylor (DD-468) B-47 Stratojet 1957 World Series Sonar Heinkel He 100 Marathon (sport) PID controller Partition function (statistical mechanics) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory USS Thresher (SS-200) Solar panel

could my goldfish get sick from a dead algae eater i have had an algae eating fish for about two years now and he recently died of some kind of infection that caused the fish to occasionally get a white film on him i took the algae eater out of my gallon aquarium tank and buried him but in the tank i also have a rather large goldfish and what i'm wondering is is there any type of infection or disease that my goldfish could catch from being in the same tank with a dead algae eater and if so what kinds of medicine could i put into the water any help would be appreciated thanks avoid medications unless you have signs of a specific illness the first thing you need to do is get a master test kit they are around but well worth it test for ammonia nitrite and nitrate i would recommend these tests any time you have a mysterious death in your fish tank if they all come back at or near zero then you shouldn't have much to worry about closely observe for signs of illness but you should be fine  Marine aquarium Aquarium Fish farming Goldfish Pneumonia Cyanide Eutrophication Samuel Goldwyn Sewage treatment Shrimp farm Cancer Biogeochemical cycle Common cold Reef tank Nutrient Sexually-transmitted infection Death Eater Coeliac disease Koi Biodiesel Decompression sickness Gar Hypoglycemia Coral reef Vitamin C Sea-Monkey Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Spanish flu H5N1 Diabetes mellitus Antiviral drug Fugu Urinary incontinence Color First aid Prostate cancer Biological warfare Anorexia nervosa Lake Burley Griffin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fish Ulcerative colitis Homeopathy Supernatural Medicine Cytomegalovirus Diarrhea Timeline of AIDS E85 Nitric acid HIV test Hydrogen economy Helicobacter pylori Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Ebola Influenza Danio Asthma Funeral Virus Mojave people Rabies 2001 anthrax attacks Tuberculosis Ammonia Algae Brewery Halfbeak Kashrut Tilapia Chagas disease Myxobolus cerebralis Krill Chlorophyta Shark Charles Darwin's illness History of medicine Computer virus Traditional Chinese medicine Infectious mononucleosis Multiple sclerosis Sickle-cell disease Glossary of firefighting terms Infectious disease Foodborne illness Stomach cancer Antarctic krill Pharmaceutical company Insulin Malaria Myocardial infarction Syphilis Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marburg virus Chronic fatigue syndrome El-Fish Cirrhosis

friends for my fighting fish pls help my brother recently got a betta from his friends and he doesnt want to take care of it much so i will be the one to do so the tank its in is about gallons big it has no filter so its a still water environment im thinking of getting a filter as well as a few other fishes and snails to keep the betta and me some company maybe about more i know not to put male guppies or goldfish or colorful fish in the tank with the betta cause they'll pester him and he'll kill them lol so here are my questions feeding the fish betta pellets which are microscopic times a day is fine is that right any suggestions for fish i can put would a filter be better for the betta preferable the cheaper lower maintenance fish p should i get a bigger tank pls answer all help is appreciated thanks your feeding seems about alright but if the pellets are microscropic it probably wouldn't hurt to give it more filters are always a good idea but i think that for a betta it isn't necessary i've had friends and heard of people that had bettas without a filter and they did fine i would consider that a personal choice that you should make based on how much money you are willing to spend and how much time and energy you have to devote if you want to get more fish i would definetly go with a bigger tank if you got other fish plus your betta that would be fish in a one gallon tank is overstocked a bigger tank would give more room so they wouldn't be threatened to attack eachother over space that would be your best bet try getting a gallon tank that would give your fish idea room and you could also have the room to add a few more fish if you wish in the future if your going to have to get a bigger tank getting a filter would make alot of sense more fish and more water should be properly circulated don't purchase more fish then what you can care for and don't get yourself in to deep financially if you want cheap maitenance it's not cheap to keep an animal so if you want to keep it cheap i wouldn't reccomend creating a large aqaurium there is chlorine testing ph level testing gravel proper plants food filters and other things in the cost just don't get yourself in to deep because with animals it's hard to get yourself out good luck  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Brewery Biodiesel Aquarium Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Fish farming Goldfish Water purification Autonomous building Theory of conduct Nuclear power Organic farming E85 Axolotl Solar power Shark Shrimp farm Dairy Single-stage to orbit Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Inflation Microeconomics Space Shuttle program Veganism Thermal power station Dry cleaning Zerg Tilapia Motorcycle Poker jargon Fire fighting Economics Ecco the Dolphin Reef tank Light-emitting diode Antarctic krill Hydrogen vehicle Koi Ozone depletion Dwarf gourami Ozone layer Cannabis cultivation Domestic rabbit Extreme Programming Galileo spacecraft Diving Gar Deflation (economics) Alcohol fuel Solar cell Piccolo Junior Saga MS-06 Zaku II Simone Weil The nature of God in Western theology Ecology Environmental vegetarianism Whale Hydroponics Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Electrophysiology Nuclear reactor RuneScape Random Events Thermal depolymerization YuYu Hakusho Biology Hamster Environmental concerns with electricity generation Seabird Rei Ayanami Samuel Goldwyn Health insurance Jon Secada Friends Tank Social rule Coffee Energy development Stereoscopy Garfield Biodiversity Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 RuneScape skills Terminal ballistics Meaning of life Hardware random number generator Strap-on dildo Loudspeaker Theodicy P-47 Thunderbolt

the other day i noticed that there were thousands of tiny little white worms in one of my aquariums all i have in that aquarium is a red clawed crap and ive been feeding him bottom feeder pellets i think ive been way over feeding him so this might be one reason why there were worms i cleaned the tank very well and there isnt anymore but im worried that maybe they were some weird parasite or something they are very tiney like the biggest were maybe a quarter inch long white but appeared a little brownish in areas where there were alot of them and they clung to the glass and the gravel what could they be these worms are harmless they are from overfeeding and leftover food left at the bottom of the tank and or from not doing partial water changes doing of water change per week x if there is no filter these worms are harmless and can easily be removed from doing water changes and from feeding less after couple water changes they should be all gone and the next time you feed hours remove all the leftovers hope this helps wt  Fish farming Marine aquarium American lobster Aquarium Discus (fish) Goldfish Atlantic herring Axolotl Seabird Pet skunk Gar Textile manufacturing Dracunculiasis Guinea pig Clown loach Hamster Dairy Shark Tilapia Krill Brewery Breastfeeding Shrimp farm Chicken Thermal power station Clownfish Filter feeder Salmon Fancy rat Foie gras Bong Vermicompost Sewage treatment Myxobolus cerebralis Diarrhea Animal Dry cleaning Acorn worm Lamprey Annelid Bird migration Koi Reef tank Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Laserdisc Zebra Danio Cochineal Leech Roundworm Capercaillie Kissing gourami Antarctic krill Computer virus Corydoras Pikmin Lionel Corporation Sandworm (Dune) Carbon dioxide GunBound Bladderwort Honey Heartworm Refrigerator Whale shark Ascariasis Bat Mydoom Domesticated turkey Hydroponics Kashrut Hard disk Computer worm Freshwater angelfish Goby Crayfish Fossil fuel power plant Diseases of the honeybee Conspiracy (TNG episode) Brachiopod Lobster Philip J.

should you do water changes in general pond maintenance i am used to keeping fish tanks yes you should especially for smaller ponds the pond plants if you have them may remove some of the nitrate it's a plant fertilizer but when their leaves die it also produces wastes and the same for fish they eat and produce wastes as well good pond maintenance will lower the potential for algae along with using floating plants like water lettuce and water hyacinth and floating leaved plants like water lilies to create shade just as you would turn off aquarium lights doing water changes with tap water may also add back some calcium magnesium sodium and other minerals used by the organisms in the pond although how much will depend on the degree to which your water has been softened just remember to add a dechlorinator as you would in an aquarium if you have fish or inverts  Sewage treatment Aquarium Hard water Fish farming Reef tank Soil pH Nuclear power Carnivorous plant Ecology Chlorophyta Autonomous building Sodium chloride Koi Cyanide Desert Hydroponics Dead Sea Water purification Dishwasher Photosynthesis Coral reef Irrigation Sodium carbonate Hydrogen economy Goldfish Water garden Sea-Monkey Carbon dioxide Tilapia Terraforming Fertilizer Tofu Casting Lake Shrimp farm Illegal drug trade Wind turbine Acorn Eutrophication Milk Sulfur Arable land Pond Transformer Nutrition Power station Solar power Thermal power station Caliche Biogeochemical cycle Crayfish Biodiesel Sugar beet Electric motor Discus (fish) Nuclear reactor Algae Incineration Veganism Renewable energy Dairy Fossil fuel power plant Aquatic plant Polychlorinated biphenyl Fugu Ammonia Pebble bed reactor Jellyfish Lighting Brewery Zebra Danio Aluminium Hemp Gardening Environmental concerns with electricity generation Hydrochloric acid Bacteria Ion exchange resin High-voltage direct current Halfbeak Thermal depolymerization Rebreather Fish Aquaculture Textile manufacturing Salt Industrial wastewater treatment Cannabis cultivation Fire fighting Fishing Acetic acid Lemnaceae Leaf Sodium Energy development

betta fish tank help i broke my air stone and i want to know if i could still use the filter to keep my fish alive until i get another air stone yes of course airstones are not needed in aquariums alo they do help and can look atractive and you could just run the airtubing in to the tank and have bubble instead of lots just till you get a new one maybe get and keep one as a spare gg  Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dwarf gourami Reef tank Marine aquarium Monterey Bay Aquarium Clownfish Fish Autonomous building Sea-Monkey Shedd Aquarium Brewery Danio Sewage treatment Georgia Aquarium Goldfish Kissing gourami Finding Nemo Fish farming Robot Master E85 P-51 Mustang Stock car (rail) El-Fish Space Shuttle program Fishing Swimming pool New England Aquarium Gourami Live-bearing aquarium fish Discus (fish) Goa Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Zebra Danio SpongeBob SquarePants Halfbeak Cetacea Depleted uranium Tank Gar Stingray Seine (fishing) Tank locomotive Goby Siphon Mark I (tank) Belle Isle Aquarium Atlantic herring Cyanide White Cloud Mountain Minnow Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Octopus Cruising (maritime) Jellyfish California Academy of Sciences Crayfish Seahorse Sylvia and Gerry Anderson Economy of Japan F-16 Fighting Falcon USS Yorktown (CV-5) Biodiesel Timeline of alternative rock Ich Clown loach Battle of Kursk Engine cooling Cell (biology) Dry cleaning Rebreather Apollo 13 B-24 Liberator Carbon dioxide Corydoras Watercooling BZFlag Beret Green swordtail Hydrogen economy Armoured warfare The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fordson tractor Glossary of firefighting equipment Sake Oscar (fish) Energy development M.A.S.K.

why do my angel fish keep dying for no reason at all my angel keep dying but the other fish are fine whyis this angel fish are really gentle fish by that i mean slight changes can be detrimental which you have witnessed you should have either one angel to an aquarium or more than angels are cichlids and like most cichlids if you keep just or in the same aquarium the strongest one will make the others miserable angels do very well in a group with or more angels in a large aquarium with at least gallons of water that is at least deep angel fish like brakish water which is inbetween fresh water and salt water you should add a little salt to their water remember they are delicate and their water has to maintain stability in order for them to survive the disease that they get is called hole in the head unfortunately once they get it there really isn't a cure but since your other fish are doing fine this is probably not the reason they are dying unless you are noticing that they have holes in their heads also i suggest not wasting your money on water testing supplies if you have a petsmart in your area petsmart provides free water testing and if you have problems they'll tell you how to fix it most definetely the other type of fish in your tank could be a reason for their deaths as well be sure to pick the fish in your tank by their compatibility  Aquarium Marine aquarium Tilapia Fish Reef tank Brewery Water Fish farming Fishing Goldfish Dairy Tofu Fire extinguisher Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Brackish water Live-bearing aquarium fish Shrimp farm Nuclear reactor Freshwater angelfish Jellyfish Ecology Lake Tanganyika Discus (fish) Lake Malawi Energy development Salmon Sea-Monkey Oscar (fish) Sewage treatment Poker jargon Shedd Aquarium Hydroponics Zebra Danio Microeconomics Thermal power station Cyanide Ozone depletion 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Hydrogen economy Crayfish Clownfish Gar Vitamin C Carburetor Carbon dioxide Fugu Textile manufacturing Drill bit Georgia Aquarium Ozone hole Wetland Autonomous building USS Wake Island (CVE-65) Biodiesel Jack Dempsey (fish) Dwarf gourami Fish and chips Condom Aquifer Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Cessna T-37 Shark Monterey Bay Aquarium Aral Sea Transformer Water (molecule) Coral reef Opportunity rover Professional wrestling throws Kidney Equine conformation Vinegar Ich Vegetarianism Depleted uranium Seismic retrofit Cancer Blood Glacier Lake E85 Nuclear weapon design Dishwasher Pitaten Goby Food preservation Domestic AC power plugs and sockets USS Yorktown (CV-5) Whale Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Coffee Aquarium (album) Concrete Orca Environmental concerns with electricity generation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Movie projector Nuclear power

saltwater tank question i have a gallon tank with stand and recently decided to go from freshwater to saltwater so to start my reef fish tank up i need lbs of sand lbs of live rock now i need to know what kind of heater for a gallon tank i eventually want soft corals as well but not until months or so so my tank is fully cycled what type of light is best for the top of my tank are x ' what type of protein skimmer filter powerheads and will i need a sump thanks in advance lots of questions so be prepared for a rather long answer first though you don't mention if your stand is iron or wood but if it's iron i would suggest getting a plastic tablecloth to cover it if the salt gets on the metal it will corrode if it's wood it should be solid wood not the pressboard i knew someone who had a gallon on a pressboard stand and it developed a small leak which seeped into the wood and softened the glue holding the pressed wood together you can guess what happened next saltwater is expensive enough to warrent buying a new stand or protecting the one you've got so your tank isn't damaged now to your actual questions substrate you're correct in getting pounds you preferably want something made of aragonite to help keep the ph from changing i like the smaller shell material that carib sea puts out it doesn't have to be live sand either some folks like crushed coral but the particle size is bigger than i like and it tends to have a lot of dust that never rinses completely out another very fine grained material is oolitic aragonite looks like small white balls and aragonite sand here's an idea of the materials available http www caribsea com pages products dry aragonite html while it's possible to keep a marine tank with regular aquarium gravel or no substrate the aragonite will keep the ph from falling below it should be especially if you want a reef tank you can buy the substrate dry or as live sand which supposedly contains the nitrifying bacteria i haven't been a fan of the pre bagged live sand as the bacteria needed for the tank are aerobic and there's no telling how long bags have been sitting on store shelves i've also seen a few of these bags with red slime algae growing in them and i doubt that's something you want to introduce these also cost about twice as much as the dry if you find a store that sells live sand by the cup out of their tanks where there's aeration you can use this to seed the tank just keep an eye on any fish in that or connected tanks you want to avoid buying if you see fish that appear unhealthy you don't want to introduce any parasites or diseases to your tank either live rock this gives the tank a more natural appearance provides hiding places for the fish and inverts and increases the biological filtration if you use this the bacteria in the live rock will also seed the substrate which is why i said that live sand isn't necessary not to mention you get all kinds of cool critters that hitchhike into your tank for best filtration the general rule of thumb is lb of pacific origin rock per gallon or to lbs of atlantic or carribean rock per gallon the pacific is more porous so less is needed to produce the same results although many people like the figi live rock i also like the atlantic carribean aquacultured rock to me it provides more color sooner than the pacific since any organisms the require good light or high circulation at the bottom of the pile may die i recommended getting dry base rock also called reef or lace rock or travertine for the bottom then placing good quality live rock at the front and top the organisms from this will colonize the dry rock where the proper conditions exist for them heaters for a saltwater tank gallon or larger i'd suggest getting and putting one on each end this will provide more even heating and your tank has a back up if one gives out and they eventually will figure the correct size as watts per gallon divided by heaters if you need to heat the water more than degrees above the room temperature go one size higher lighting for a gallon a compact fluorescent or t system should be fine for many of the corals and anemeones sold but do some research on the species before you buy some need even higher levels and should have metal halides or a combo for the best success for a saltwater system i would recommend at least of the tubes be k and the others either s or actinics this gives the coloration of a reef about feet underwater and gives the proper wavelengths necessary for organisms that use photosynthesis i use the coralife compact fluorescents with the blue twilight feature on my smaller tanks the twilight isn't necessary for most tanks but it make the tank look like it's lit by moonlight and is thought to benefit corals filter it's possible that you may want to just use your old filter if it's properly sized filters at least x x the tank volume per hour check the gallons per hour rating if you need a new one or are looking to upgrade there are lots of choices and what you'll need will really depend on budget what you're trying to keep and personal preference i'd consider the best to be a refugium or wet dry trickle filter as a sump as these provide extra water volume for the tank as well you can do one of these without needing to drill the tank if yours isn't predrilled but it would better to have the sump above the main tank in this case so you get at least one direction using gravity flow but this will also mean a slightly lower water level to accomodate water in the plumbing if the electric fails having a second tank gives you more surface area for a biological filter and you can use macroalgae to remove some of the nitrates if you do a refugium with gravity flow into the main tank you'll be able to produce copepods and small shrimp which will get caught in the gravity flow and provide occassional treats for your fish if you keep the sump and main tank on opposite hr photoperiods this also make the ph more stable has to do with products of photosynthesis next best would be a canister followed by a biowheel then a standard hang on tank unless you're using a fine sand or oolite substrate you can also use an undergravel filter to supplement filtration but i'd suggest powering it with a reversible powerhead to blow the water up through the substrate prevents stuff from building up under the filter and clogging it the more surface area you get for bacteria the better your biological filter will function so the canister will probably have the next most area to the refugium or wet dry the canister has the advantage of being the only filter that forces water through the media rather than allowing unfiltered water to bypass the media as it becomes clogged the downside of these is that you have to break down the filter to clean so it's somewhat more inconvenient the biowheel is considered a good choice for added biological filtration but don't discount traditional filters like the aquaclear filter which have a large sponge filter to add surface area while these can clog and allow unfiltered water to bypass media if you don't clean the media regularly the media however is much more easily accessed than that of the canisters and these are less expensive as well another thing to consider is circulation of the water in the tank if you use a wet dry refugium or canister you'll probably only use oneor more powerheads so wastes from the opposite side of the tank make it to your intake to be removed with a biowheel or traditional hang on you can get two filters for about the same price and place them so they are closer to all the sources of wastes powerhead s to provide more water circulation in hard to get to places and to keep particles in suspension for filter feeders and the filters red cyanobacteria red slime algae doesn't like high current so an extra powerhead or two is one thing you can use for prevention this also helps circulate dissolved oxygen to the bottom of the tank even though you want extra circulation you also want some areas of the tank with higher and lower areas of current for the animals to choose their own level of preference protein skimmer this isn't required but will make a difference in water quality for sensitive fish and inverts you can get these in venturi models my preference but more expensive or models which need an air pump and wooden airstone the wood produces finer bubbles than the traditional airstones effectiveness here is related to the height of the column through which the bubbles rise with longer being better these are great for removing organic materials that raise your nitrates before they become nutrients for algae most people on this forum like the coralife skimmers some of the other items you'll need to have on hand salt mix if you're only keeping fish you can go with one of the less expensive brands of synthetic sea salt if you get any invertebrates shrimp snails crabs corals anemones etc switch to a better quality mix before you add them these cost a little more but you won't need to be using additives for the trace elements they need either hydrometer this measures the amount of salt that's dissolved in water there are two kinds you can get one made of glass that floats on the surface more accurate but easy to break and a plastic container that has a needle that rises and falls as the amount of salt changes less accurate bubbles attaching to the needle gives false readings for fish only you want the specific gravity to read if you're keeping inverts you want it to be water testing kit minimum of ph ammonia nitrite nitrate i like the api saltwater master test kit it has all the tests listed above with more for nitrate and ph since you'll continue to monitor these after the tank has cycled cleaning supplies elbow length gloves gravel vacuum gallon bucket large plastic container and powerhead for mixing the salt to be done well ahead of water changes algae scraper razor blades for coraline algae and diatoms that like to attach to the glass water conditioner for removing chlorine or chloramine from your tap water unless you plan to use a reverse osmosis filter or buy ro water which is the preferred water source if you use tapwater i would also suggest buying a phosphate removing pad that you can cut to size for whatever filter you choose public water supplies are permitted to add a small amount of phosphate to the water as a method to prevent pipe corrosion unfortunately it acts as an algae fertilizer the following are optional but strongly suggested glass cover this reduces evaporation and keeps the fish inside the tank if you ever go to a metal halide lighting system though it can overheat your tank chiller if you use metal halide lighting and even the cfs put out some heat or the water temperature regularly gets above o for corals or anemones fish can take a little more heat you may need to invest in a chiller to keep the tank cool the water temperature should ideally run of before going out and buying all this i would suggest some additional as if this weren't enough reading to see what you're getting into by keeping saltwater i did research for almost years before i set up my first saltwater tank and i had about years of freshwater aquarium experience already rushing into a saltwater setup usually doesn't give you good results and the equipment and fish are a little too expensive to be finding out in a few weeks you got something that's not appropriate for what you want for your tank i'd also recommend a good reference book for some research either of these would be a good one to start with the new marine aquarium by michael s paletta microcosm ltd isbn or the conscientious marine aquarist by robert m fenner microcosm ltd isbn here's an excellent web site where you can check out for more info on keeping saltwater http www wetwebmedia com although your gallon may seem large to you just be aware that marine fish tend to be more aggressive and territorial than freshwater community fish more like cichlids in their personalities plus the organisms are less tolerant of poor water conditions so the stocking level for a saltwater tank is much lighter than for freshwater plus the fish tend to be larger in size although there are a few smaller species and peaceful ones as well i started my first saltwater tank in a gallon and added a second gallon six months later marine tanks a bit addictive good luck with your tank

goldfish black areas torn tail i have a young goldfish who has always been very healthy but the past days i have noticed blackish areas on the edges of his fins and a couple of tiny spots on his side also his tail seems to be torn at the ends his fins etc are all ok and he appears very active and eating ok i did add a new fish who didnt get on with him and they fought a bit i didnt see him do the damage but i'm not sure of he did or not could he be sick ammonia and nitrate nitrites are fine i would add a small amount of non iodized plain or kosher salt just to help with the healing and to kill any disease or fungus waiting to infect the wounds the general rule is one tablespoon of salt per every five gallons of water but if you want to be slightly more conservative that would probably be fine too salt is great for helping fish heal and it generally just helps them function better when used as a treatment in situations like these  Sewage treatment Shark Marine aquarium Goldfish Kashrut Kosher foods Eutrophication Aquarium Food preservation Ammonia Diarrhea Spider Psoriasis Hamster Bread Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Salt Cirrhosis Sea-Monkey Curing Prostate cancer Myxobolus cerebralis Tocopherol Diseases of the honeybee Shrimp farm Sodium chloride Nutrient Iodine Cyanide Chronic fatigue syndrome Nitric acid Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Edible salt Vegetarian nutrition Drill bit Rabies Unclean animals Foodborne illness Sexually-transmitted infection Duesberg hypothesis Potassium nitrate E number Diabetes mellitus Pansy Tofu Paget's disease of bone Dutch elm disease Idli Equine conformation First aid Elis Prefecture Koi Cantonese cuisine Hypoglycemia 613 mitzvot Tuberculosis Nutrition Internal ballistics Fancy rat Fish anatomy Mouth ulcer Biogeochemical cycle Wetland Vitamin C Natural health Urinary incontinence Insulin AIDS Silver Fugu Nitrogen Oarfish Australian salmon Space habitat Potassium Goldeen Omega-3 fatty acid Ham Ammonium nitrate Great Salt Lake YuYu Hakusho Vegetarianism Gray Wolf Danio Eldfell Eczema Vegeta Rehydration Jewish cuisine Veganism Sodium nitrite Coeliac disease Dog Traditional Chinese medicine Dead Sea American Alligator

why is my fish eating sleeping and swimming upsidedown when i interned at the denver aquarium we had a fish that ate and swam upside down which had a neurological issue in the brain or it could be your species of fish as stated by most other answers upside down catfish or a particular species of goldfish that has swim bladder problems it also can be an infection in the intestines or kidneys really it is best to allow the fish to recover or to give it time due to the difficulty in diagnosing the poor guy you could also try feeding the fish peas if the fish has intestinal blockage or in other words difficulty excreting poop the peas will serve as a laxative to help it poo hope that helps and sorry about your fish  Urinary system Gar Myxobolus cerebralis Stomach cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Feces Folic acid Crohn's disease Octopus Fishing Toilet humour Fish farming Traumatic brain injury Sawfish (fish) Dyslexia Fish Foodborne illness Stroke Coral reef Human physiology Chronic fatigue syndrome Insulin Shark Soul food Cuisine of the Southern United States Multiple sclerosis Cancer Salmon Seabird Aquaculture Vitamin C Bladderwort Glycogen storage disease type I Clomipramine Gas bladder Prostate cancer Schistosomiasis Pneumonia Autism Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Aquarium Neurology Diabetes mellitus Autoimmune diseases Breastfeeding Cantonese cuisine Diarrhea Lake Burley Griffin Krill Coma Fugu Whale Cirrhosis Trichinosis Guinea pig Roundworm Cystic fibrosis The Wack Pack Obesity Nutrition Urine Hematophagy Whaling Aphasia Brain Cerebral palsy Wilson's disease Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Denmark Conker's Bad Fur Day Cichlid Baylisascaris Kidney Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aloe Orca Terri Schiavo Gastroparesis Recapitulation theory Live-bearing aquarium fish Autonomic nervous system Stingray Paracetamol Tilapia Bottlenose Dolphin Marine aquarium Poliomyelitis Botulism Dolphin Fish and chips Tuberculosis Digenea Vegetarian nutrition Fibromyalgia Cyanide

bio wheel filter questions hi there i was just wanting to know what would be a good bio wheel filter for a gallon aquarium i am planning on having a moderatly planted aquarium with in of substrate rocks and d wood and small community fish tropical would it be okay to put smaller bio wheels on each end of the aquarium or will that cause to much turbulence thus releasing all of my co also has anyone ever tried putting some of those bio balls in the back of a bio wheel filter just wondering if it would even work giving me name brands would be appreciated i know i've been asking alot of questions lately but no i am not a novice that will be spending on something i'll stick with for a year lol i have always had aquariums right now i have three g two g and a g i just wanna make sure i do my right the others were all trial and error hi yes that will work fine i did the same thing in a gal and plants grew fish multiplied and had cover for hatches as for bio balls i never used them i use marineland brands completely best choice you can make also use underwater heater as the turbulence is faster a good thing to remember when starting any tank is to let it run completely set up excluding fishes for hrs check the ph and temp and make adjustments add chems and then add each species of fish separately and over time use the bacterial vac it is a tube that you use without any motor i can explain this more if you need i use the vac weekly but only on the settings ie plants rocks shells etc best wishes on your fishes and i think you will enjoy it more if you will use your gal and hatchery tanks to proliferate your new tank and always ask your pet store about the community acceptance of different species go wild have fun fish are cool  Marine aquarium Aquarium Brewery Autonomous building Motorcycle Thermal power station Hamster Reef tank Sea-Monkey Textile manufacturing Shrimp farm Fish farming Poker jargon Tank Sewage treatment Fishing E85 Discus (fish) Shedd Aquarium Biology PID controller 1957 World Series Goldfish Floppy disk Mouse (computing) Krill Coffee Extreme Programming Carburetor Octopus Cannabis cultivation Fossil fuel power plant Dog agility IBM PC compatible Amateur telescope making Fancy rat Great Lakes Recumbent bicycle Biodiesel Galileo spacecraft Mars Exploration Rover Filling station Coral reef Goby Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) T-72 Hard disk Three-phase electric power Clownfish Diesel engine Mantis shrimp New England Aquarium Axolotl MAME Beer Ecco the Dolphin Nuclear power Drag racing Robert Ballard Irrigation Hot Wheels Redundant array of independent disks BMW Novelty (locomotive) Wheel of Fortune Biodiversity Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Dairy Georgia Aquarium Danio Tesla coil Swimming pool RuneScape skills Finding Nemo Mark I (tank) Pachypodium habitats Killifish Solar power Switched-mode power supply Halfbeak Futurama (TV series - season 5) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Rail terminology Alcohol fuel Cigarette Stock car (rail) Insect Radio controlled airplane Chevrolet Corvair Hydrogen economy RISC Crayfish Zerg CDC 6600

how long does it take for bettas to mate i have two males and one female betta the two males seperate of course there is one male who puffs up a little and chases her and does a dnace in front of her but she always swims away is that normal this is the first time together too the other male will do nothing sometimes she'll chase him and he'll run off or swim off is this normal in the start it sounds like your fish are not in breeding condition i would suggest you keep all of them in separate containers and condition them well for a few weeks you will know they are ready to breed when the male makes a bubble nest and the female is pump with eggs and her egg spot is showing that's when you put them together once they are in proper condition they will breed in a few hours here's how i breed my bettas i have been breeding bettas for show and for sale for over years and this system works well for me breeding tank a gallon makes a good breeding tank for bettas place in on a dark surface and set it up with no gravel or decorations use a small sponge filter and a heater maintain the heat at the temperature is not really that critical using a hood is a good idea to hold in heat and moisture conditioning condition the male in the breeding tank condition the female in a separate tank and be sure they cannot see each other feed well on frozen or live foods alternating with flakes or pellets for at least a week the female should be plump with eggs and the male should be flaring and showing his best color maybe even building a bubble nest spawning drop the water level in the breeding tank to about deep place the female in a bowl or other container next to the breeding tank so that the male can see her as soon as there is a good bubble nest in the breeding tank add the female check for eggs in the bubble nest every few hours you know they are finished when the female is hiding from the male and he no longer leaves the nest to chase her down he will also not be trying to attract her to the nest at this time remove the female from the breeding tank if they fail to breed within a few hours go back and repeat the conditioning steps for a week eggs and fry the eggs will hatch in days at first the male will collect the babies and return them to the bubble nest this is normal once you see that the babes are able to swim in a normal fashion remove the male now is the time to start feeding the babies feed them newly hatched brine shrimp micro worms or vinegar eels feed several times a day for the first week to days at that time you can start adding some powdered flake food to their diet and begin increasing the water level in the tank care the babies need very clean water do a or more water change every day and be sure to remove any uneaten food or dead babies that you see keeping the water clean and changed very often is one of the major keys to success be sure you cull the brood culling is to remove unwanted fish remove any deformed fish right away and destroy them rearing and selection eventually you will need to split the batch as they will over crowd the gallon removing the females to another tank is the best way the males can stay together without a problem continue to feed quality foods of increasing size working your way up to frozen or adult brine shrimp and continue to do large daily water changes once they begin to develop color you should cull based on color keep the color you like and remove the rest even if you started with two reds you will get a few that are not red or are not evenly colored if they are near adult size a shop should buy them from you or at least give you some store credit be ruthless keep only the very best to breed with next time around the males can stay together basically for their entire lives as long as you never separate them once separated even for a day they will begin to fight so keep that in mind best of luck and stick with it you'll have baby betta before you know it mm  Dairy

why dont ppl read the question i have been using this site for like three days and already i am fed up with how many useless responses and answers that are clearly contraindictated by the qestion itself for example i ask how to help cycle my tank and inform readers that the fish is already in it and has been without problems for two days now what answer do i get you should get feeder fish to put in the tank if they do fine you know its ok to put your fish in well obviously if this person had been paying a sliver of attention that is of no help great idea for someone whose fish isnt in the tank duh i say that i have a budget of five dollars for a new fish item i recieve a recommendation for purchasing a kit i dont know why these ppl bother writing such a lengthy response without taking the time to absorb the question but it is a waste of space time and reading i suppose this is just a request for all of those out there who are at fault please dont respond unless you are prepared to give a helpful answer i am sick to death of going through all five daily questions asking the same thing rephrased hoping to get an intelligent response also when seven ppl answer a question that wasnt asked chances are good that anyone who truly knows what they are talking about is going to see a long list of responses and decide that their answer isnt needed for once i wish i could just post something and answerers would pay close attention to detail and give a well thought out and educated response based on the information given just hoping maybe a few ppl will read this and decide to spare some poor asker all the frustration thank you everyone who took the time to encourage it helps to know that i am not the only one annoyed by some ppl on here and thank you also for all the offers to help with questions through email cetus thanks you as well well i think that getting a bad answer or something that is not clear is not a good thing for the most part most of us that answer regularly or have education and experience in these things give good answers on here i have to say there are quite a few people that give vague crap ass answers and i apologize for them even wasting your's and my time looking back at your q's first question about the cycle fivespeed gave you the correct answer on that yes there is a difference because a bowl doesn't usually have a filter and gravel in there it doesn't provide oxygenation and the proper surface area to really cycle it out a bowl really shouldn't be used to house any fish really because of space issues and filtration do you see pet stores sell and display fish in them yes but it's temporary really and shouldn't be used at home for long term housing question about the ryukin again fivespeed gave you the ba there i really can't add anything else to that to help explain any different the inchers you see at walmart are grown out in ponds and they reach this size rather quickly at that size they are usually about months old question kii do petsmart employees know what theyre talking about fish question i am planning on going to petsmart and asking some questions about my ruykin i wouldnt ask walmart but is petsmart any better in everyones experience are they generally well educated in their department additional details hours ago we have no small pet stores nearby and i have been asking on answers but on questions such as age of a certain size ruykin nobody seems to know i could easily ask them what the age of the fish they purchase is tho magicman gave you the best input however fivespeed already told you the age about your ryukin kii the real problem here is that when you ask what is the age of a fish it's not like a child where you can log in the birthdate or something in most fish fish will grow differently and unless you raised the fish it's whole life yourself it's just going to be a guesstimate even if you went to petco or walmart the danger with going to walmart is the opportunity of you being targeted for sales of things you don't necessarily need and i am sure they will try to sell you something the only thing looking at this information you should be directed to buy would be a filtered tank if all you have is a ryukin then you don't need to worry about a heater so much but you really need to get a filtered tank for it sorry but that's the facts of the case i can't tell you something different and not be distorting the truth as you can see on the last question magicman again gave you the best answer there now yeah like i said in the beginning i nor magic or fivespeed can control people posting crap that isnt true i can only just say sorry there are morons in the world but i don't have the power to keep them off here or deny them the rights to demonstrate thier superior stupidty i will say that there sure are some answerers in here that need to be muted or booted out of here for expressing information that is false and inaccurate yet they will continually post it it's as if thier online ego gets a kick out of misleading people instead of using the brain god gave them i can say in closing when you do get stupid answers just put it where you put all your used toilet paper thats what i do because i feel the advice i see and the toilet paper are the same thing and take action accordingly you can email me anytime you need if you have questions and you can get better help at fishless cycling com just use the link on my profile jv  Plame affair Theory of conduct Wal-Mart Internet troll Microeconomics Scientology beliefs and practices Killian

i've heard of giving a pea to your fish to heal him well what does it cure i think i've heard of it curing gull bladder issues but i have no clue also how does it work do you have to break it up into smaller peices so that the fish can eat it easier my fish don't have any health issues but i was wondering peas act as roughage and cleanse out your fish's digestive system they take care of most digestive problems like constipation or swim bladder disease preparing a pea for your fish is simple you must use frozen peas as canned and fresh ones have preservatives and pesticides respectively place the pea in a dish of tank water or dechlorinated water and microwave for seconds leave to cool and then remove the shell of the pea cutting its insides up into tiny pieces that your fish can eat you should only feed your fish about a third to half of the pea depending on how large your fish is it's also recommended to fast your fish for a couple of days before feeding the pea since it is not part of many fishes' natural diet and they might need to be fasted a little before they are hungry enough to eat it  Hamster Food Pea Fishing Dietary fiber Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Salmon Cuisine of Denmark Carnivorous plant Stomach cancer Nutrition Cuisine of the Philippines Kosher foods Tofu Foodborne illness Seabird Fugu Egg (food) Dairy Sewage treatment Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Soul food Natural Hygiene Pea soup Food preservation Organic food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bong Raw food diet Brewery Vitamin C Fancy rat Peanut Cantonese cuisine Chicken Tomato Coffee Adjustable gastric band Sauerkraut Hypoglycemia Myxobolus cerebralis Polychlorinated biphenyl Shrimp farm Foie gras Menstrual cup Vegetarianism Fish farming Tlingit Mosquito Coeliac disease Milk Veganism Pok__mon Abilities Jewish cuisine Folic acid Schistosomiasis Shark Casting French fries Sea-Monkey Ham Breakfast Cancer Cuisine of the Southern United States Soup Vegetarian nutrition Roman eating and drinking Bird Obesity Agriculture Fish and chips Krill Bladderwort Marine aquarium Cuisine of Malaysia Food storage Diabetes mellitus Pig (zodiac) Axolotl Water Goldfish Passover Fasting Thermal power station Tilapia Bacon Battle of Pea Ridge Bengali cuisine Dieting Animal French cuisine Coconut crab Gelatin

have a new somewhat imcomplete aquarium enough money for one thing which is the most vital fish in tank i have a ten gallon for my ruykin we have the aquarium filter water conditioner plants gravel food and a net the question is this i can afford either an aerator which the filter seems to do an ammonia test kit a nitrite test kit or bacteria to jumpstart the cycle of the tank bear in mind the fish has been in the tank for two days now he is doing great by the way i think an ammonia test kit would be the most beneficial but what are your opinions five or so dollar budget feel free to suggest a different product oh and a thermometer is on the tank as well ok i am sorry but i am not sure how to elaborate on this point this is the problem with yahoo answers enough money for one thing maybe not he is a rescue fish and is was all we could do to get what we have sorry but a baby ruykin can live in a gallon easily for a few months regardless of what anyone says and really given a choice between the poor fish dying in walmarts tanks living in a toxic gallon bowl while i save for a gallon or getting a clean gallon immediately i think its rather obvious what the fish would go for and considering he is doing wonderfully and would be able to live in a bowl for years i really doubt a few months in a filtered gallon will kill him so i would really appreciate some serious answers i dont want the dramatic you put him in a tank oh hes definately gonna die because thats stupid and we all know it i do intend to upgrade him and please give me help within my budget thank you thank you magicman and ninjaaa its refreshing to get a well edjucated answer from someone who has actually paid attention to the question the ammonia test kit is right by a long shot nitrite test kit can be a good idea but it's not as important as the ammonia test kit and often the bacteria you buy in stores is totally worthless since it is often handled improperly and is actually dead when you buy it carbon or charcoal will not handle the amount of ammonia your fish will produce so you need to monitor it and do water changes until the tank cycles in a few weeks obviously adding another fish tot he tank would be a horrible idea since it would only make more ammonia i'm sure you know that over time your fish will outgrow your gallon and you will either need to find him a new home or get a larger tank but if its a small ryukin you have a year or so before that's a problem sounds like you have done your research well you are right on target mm  Sewage treatment Aquarium Hydrogen economy Eutrophication Biodiesel Microeconomics Autonomous building Cyanide Ammonia Carbon dioxide Fish farming Biogeochemical cycle Brewery Dairy Sea-Monkey Dry cleaning Water purification Hydroponics Biochemistry Toyota Prius Hydrogen vehicle Cannabis cultivation Hyperinflation Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bacteria Poker jargon Illegal drug trade Omega-3 fatty acid Refrigerator Goldfish Consciousness Jumpstart 3rd Grade Tilapia E85 Fugu Hydrogen sulfide Thermal power station Hypoglycemia P-47 Thunderbolt Gross domestic product God Emperor of Dune Energy development Ocean thermal energy conversion M16 (rifle) Nuclear power Keynesian economics Milk Ecology Menstrual cycle Autism Halitosis Town gas Sun Nitrogen Beer Houseplant Fossil fuel power plant Hubble Space Telescope Homebrewing Discus (fish) Fire extinguisher Alcohol fuel Photosynthesis Water (molecule) Tank CPU cache Tax Space Shuttle program Oplan Bojinka Soil life Apollo 13 Urea Origin of life Explosive material Hydrogen Cellular respiration Depleted uranium B-47 Stratojet Coffee Artificial consciousness Expert system Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chopsticks Cessna T-37 Economics Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Ashton-Tate Bipolar disorder Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina

catfish on the way out overheating i have two large inches long at least years old catfish in my tropical tank yesterday i noticed that the tank temperature had risen to deg c and one of the catfish was charging about the tank bumping into things i turned the thermostat right down and then back to normal and the temp has stabilised at around deg c however the catfish is clearly a goner still moving a little but eyes going opaque and a strange pale band around his body could the overheating be responsible for his condition of is it just coincidence i think the thermostat contacts must have welded because the temperature has remained at deg c since i reset the dial i did a water change at that temperature and checked the water ph and levels of nh n and no everything was normal but the catfish died however there have been no more casualties thanks for your interest sounds more like ammonia poisoning do a water change with a gravel vac make sure the water going in is the same temperature as what is in the tank don't use water changes to change tank temperature  Heat Thermal power station Thermostat Refrigerator Solar power Aquarium Thermoregulation Hyperthermia Carburetor Autonomous building PID controller E85 Fish farming Fire fighting Ammonia Water (molecule) Temperature First aid Aluminium Sun Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carbon dioxide HVAC Climate of the United Kingdom Welding Welsh language Geography of Africa Tropical cyclone Clear Lake Dishwasher Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Gas metal arc welding Goldfish Fever Climate change Seismic retrofit Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sea level rise Pok__mon Abilities Hypothermia Degree Fahrenheit Phase (matter) Helium Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Tesla coil Tilapia Fossil fuel power plant Sewage treatment 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Thermistor Ultraviolet Snake Marine aquarium Armored Core Slow cooker Titan (moon) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Kosovo War Ocean thermal energy conversion Burglar alarm Homeostasis Cheating in Counter-Strike St. Louis County, Missouri Corrosion Brewery Energy development Fancy rat Combustion Glossary of firefighting terms Apollo 13 Items in the Metroid series Bird migration Relay Negative feedback Ceramics Titanium Gas tungsten arc welding Motor oil Catfish El Ni__o Severe weather terminology (United States) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Fishing Car handling Ozone depletion Mark I (tank) Circuit breaker Dead Like Me Relative humidity Brewing National Weather Service Floyd Rose Coral reef Vacuum cleaner Bi-metal USS Seadragon (SS-194) Laika Gas absorption refrigerator Autism

marine fish i'm looking at setting up x x tank but not sure what lighting to go for if i use flouresent tubes comes with will this be enough to keep corals anemamies and fish or should i invest in arcadia series as these are quite expensive for fish the amount of lighting doesn't really matter the corals and anemones also giant clams it does since all these have photosynthesic bacteria in their cells and need enough light intensity to produce their own food the extra of which provides food for the host the depth of your tank won't allow much light to penetrate to the bottom if this is a standard fluorescent tube regardless of the number you have at the very least you'll need to use a compact fluorescent or t system but adding some metal halides even a small one in combination with the cfs would be better for the distance the light needs to travel to the bottom what fivespeed suggested with the light meter is the best way to be sure that your corals are getting enough light the output wattage you have doesn't matter nearly as much as the amount of light received lumens along with intensity you also need to have the correct wavelengths since only a few are used for photosynthesis there's also color temperature to consider this refers to the color produced by heating to different temperatures have you ever noticed that when you take a photo using film indoors that the color looks off by turning everything orange under normal household bulbs this is due to the color temperature of the film which is balanced for the color temperature of sunlight which is warmer aquarium bulbs also have differences for color temperatures which involve how close to the water's surface the light would be since the deeper you go the more light that's lost in the red end of the spectrum so the color looks bluer reef lighting of k simulates what it would look like around feet underwater which is a good depth and light coloration for corals there's also an actinic which is a deeper blue almost to blacklight which shows off the photosynthetic organisms by making them appear to glow this can be used to simulate a dawn or dusk by themselves if they're on a separate circuit and enhance the colors of the corals when the ks are also on there's also tubes which are a combination of k and actinic but they don't operate separately see the links below and additional links to articles at the top of each page for more info on lighting for saltwater tanks  Reef tank Incandescent light bulb Light-emitting diode Fluorescent lamp Ultraviolet Photosynthesis Marine aquarium Color temperature Lighting Solar power Light Ecology Sun Color Glass Coral reef Carburetor Aquarium Compact fluorescent lamp Headlight Carbon dioxide Brewery Bicycle lighting Solar cell Plasma (physics) Houseplant Laser Stage lighting Tank Diamond simulant Algae Marine biology Cannabis cultivation Transformer Diode Mercury-vapor lamp Swimming pool Rayleigh scattering Sewage treatment Gamut Thermal power station Temperature RGB color model Swimming Leaf Renewable energy Clownfish Sea-Monkey Diamond Vacuum tube Fluorescence Microscopy Opportunity rover Electrodeless lamp Tire Solar variation Acne Antarctic krill Items in the Metroid series Planetary habitability Plant Gas metal arc welding Coral Spectroscopy Explosive material USS Tunny (SS-282) Nuclear power Eye Planetary nebula Nuclear weapon design Optical fiber Cyanide Ocean thermal energy conversion Television Stereoscopy Technetium Hydrogen economy Drag racing Infrared Energy development Electrophysiology Hydrogen Firework Heat Liquid crystal display Scuba set

my golfish isnt eating well and has some black stuff on the end of his tail hey whenever i try to feed my golfish flake food he either eats it and digests it which is fine or he'll eat it start doing this wierd thing with his mouth then he'll throw it up again what else should i feed him also i just noticed that theres some black stuff right at the end of my goldfish and its not trailing crap because i know about that can anyone tell me what this it doesnt look like something that can come off just like its embedded into the tail like a design or something thanks in advance with all of that eating and regurgitation i am willing to bet that there is some waste built up in your tank just to be safe you should test for ammonia nitrite and nitrate if these come back at zero or close to it then i wouldn't worry about your fish too much if any of those three are high you need to siphon out your tank more often and go light on the food the black that you see could be genetic a fungus or chlorine ammonia burns i am leaning towards genetics until you tell me your test results  Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Ammonia Biogeochemical cycle Goldfish E number Cat Fish farming Siphon Vomiting Ant Animal Aluminium Hydrogen economy Nitrogen Autonomous building Fugu Sea-Monkey Hamster Snake Craps Food preservation Aquarium Genetically modified food Eutrophication Insulin Flush toilet Carnivorous plant Mosquito Internal ballistics 1919 World Series Poison Cyanide Shark Reef tank Nitric acid Red Hot Catholic Love Factory farming Nutrition Hydrogen sulfide Food Explosive material Discus (fish) Soil life Shaggy dog story Fungus Organic farming Dry cleaning Digestion Koi Silver Sodium nitrite Termite Philip J.

what water treatments do i need for aquarium fish hi i've bought a foot fish tank with large goldfish in it off ebay about weeks ive only ever had one tiny goldfish before who ive successfully put into the tank but with him ive never treated the water he was just in an old fashioned bowl which im told now is a big fishkeeping faux pas obviously as its been two weeks its time for a partial water exchange but ive been told to treat my tap water and test it im pretty dumb and have no idea what to use or what im testing for can anyone tell me more and where i can buy some treatments preferably lower end of the budget though i have a teensy budget wow there are some pretty windy opinions here this is what i think you need to purchase a siphon have the store manager give you a lesson on how to use it or im email me and i'll walk you through it use the siphon to vacuum out all the crap out of the gravel it sounds like your tank is already established were the goldfish living in this same tank when you purchased the tank or are the fish new if the tank has only been running since you purchased it then your tank is still cycling you might want to purchase a master test kit this will allow you to monitor ammonia nitrite and nitrate keeping yourself informed of your tank's water qualtiy will help prevent any major problems down the road when it comes time to fill your tank back up use a dechlorinator most are in liquid form follow the instructions on the bottle you can also leave the water sitting out for the chlorine to evaporate but if your local water treatment plant uses chloramine you will have to wait much longer magicman taught me that chloramines have a half life of about hrs at ph and degrees this means that if you set your water out to age for hrs and the city puts chloramines in your water it will not be safe to add to the tank without water conditioner the cheapest way to dechlorinate your tank is to purchase sodium thiosulfate crystals this is the main ingredient of dechlorinator and for a few dollars you can dechlorinate thousands of gallons it is pretty hard to find but you could probably order some off the internet email me if you have any questions  Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Ammonia Water purification Sea-Monkey Aquarium Siphon Hydrogen economy Polychlorinated biphenyl Autonomous building Brewery Chlorine Cyanide Flush toilet Hydrogen peroxide Solar power Rebreather Dairy Axolotl Water (molecule) Thermal power station Prostate cancer Ocean thermal energy conversion Illegal drug trade Water Cannabis cultivation Fish farming Microeconomics Nitrogen Japanese tea ceremony Chlorination Computer Carburetor Mattress Decompression sickness Charles Ives Sulfur Nuclear power Dishwasher Battle of the Bulge Desert Discus (fish) Wine making E85 Bottled water Cruising (maritime) CPU cache Diabetes mellitus Renewable energy Internet fraud Fire fighting Food preservation Sewer Hydrochloric acid Alum Reef tank Asthma Coffee Titanium Rocket fuel Mercury (element) Cocaine Surveillance Sugar beet CPU design Biogeochemical cycle Hyperthermia Pretty Good Privacy Hydropower Japanese toilet Rail terminology Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Salt Fossil fuel power plant Opportunity rover Urinary incontinence Aluminium Single-stage to orbit Electrophysiology Textile manufacturing Pebble bed reactor Acetic acid Nuclear reactor Fugu Extreme Programming Toyota Prius Gasoline Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Motorcycle Tag

i have live plants in my gallon tank with goldfish is it essential to have a light i have fantail goldfish and rather large plants in my tank i would like to maintain my plants as best as possible do i have to get a light for my fish the fish don't require a light over their tank as long as they have enough light in the room to distinguish between day and night but plants can't survive without one the plants need to make their food by way of photosynthesis which is a light dependent reaction if you don't provide adequate lighting the plants will die and foul the water if you don't want to provide a light it may be better to use plastic or silk plants than live ones also be aware that goldfish will eat the leaves of some aquatic plants or they'll uproot them as the search through the gravel for food if you want live plants i would suggest using java fern java moss or anubias as these don't seem to be something most fish care for and these have lower lighting requirements so a standard aquarium light will be bright enough for them to grow  Goldfish Houseplant Carnivorous plant Photosynthesis Plant Tilapia Sewage treatment Leaf Solar power Biodiesel Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Ecology Kissing gourami Autonomous building Hydrogen economy Discus (fish) Moss Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide Fish Hydroponics Koi Fishing Fish farming Clownfish El-Fish Brewery Tetrapod Veganism Biodiversity Fern Iowa class battleship Hamster Neutrino Gar Embryophyte Aquatic plant Nuclear power Bottlenose Dolphin E85 Simone Weil USS Yorktown (CV-5) Vegetarianism Nutrient Cannabis cultivation Salmon Energy development Agriculture Clown loach Thermal power station Water garden Dwarf gourami Shrimp farm Epiphyte Capercaillie Stoma Town gas Eutrophication Bonsai Axolotl Botany Sugar beet Cyanide Airport Solar panel Light-emitting diode Flowering plant Light pollution Nuclear reactor Chlorophyll Bamboo Sunlight Dairy Angling Fossil fuel power plant Tofu Tank Sorghum Irrigation Algae Antarctic krill Renewable energy Gas metal arc welding Halfbeak Gasoline Banana Chicken Chlorophyta Animal Swimming pool Coffee Vitamin C Filling station Bladderwort Gypsy moth 2003 North America blackout

has anyone seen that commercial with the yellow pufferfish if you have i'd really like to know what the name of that specific fish is i'm not familiar with the commercial but this website should have the puffer http www thepufferforum com forum ug php v pufferpedia you can look through the photo pages and see what the name is and by clicking on the photos you can bring up a page on their care just be aware that although puffers look cute they're aggressive fish that should be kept in a tank by themselves for many of the species you can't even keep two of the same type together some live in freshwater others saltwater and some are brackish which is a mixture of salt and freshwater they're sensitive to water quality and have special dietary needs the majority get fairly large so if you're thinkng of getting a puffer just consider the size that it may get  Marine aquarium Fugu Pufferfish Fish PHP Brackish water Angling Fishing Shrimp farm Fly fishing Tetrodotoxin Halfbeak Website Fish farming Gar Discus (fish) Goby Saltwater intrusion Sewage treatment Jamaica Bay Dog Dead Sea Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cross site scripting Crocodile Hamster Peruvian cuisine Fauna of Australia Uniform Resource Locator Crayfish Tilapia Circuit breaker HyperText Transfer Protocol Sockeye salmon Sturgeon Reef tank Phishing Clownfish Kashrut Tetraodontiformes Stingray Cajun cuisine Aquifer Gill Roman eating and drinking Agriculture Yacht Baltic Sea OpenBSD Common carp Murray Cod Porcupinefish Mussel Aquaculture Perch Vegetarianism Eastern Freshwater Cod Living fossil Florida World Wide Web Zambezi Fish migration Corydoras Digital photography Sawfish (fish) Jellyfish Ant Macquarie Perch Color Biodiversity of New Zealand Striped bass Saltwater Crocodile Diatomaceous earth Carp Batoidea Myxobolus cerebralis Walleye Ajax (programming) Sulfur Mineral Osmosis Danio Cascading Style Sheets Finding Nemo Lake Blog Chlorophyta Snapping turtle Wget Pok__mon Abilities Tlingit Platypus Brown Trout Tetrapod Aspidogastrea PNG Clown loach Photographic film Combat Mission (computer game series)

how can you tell whether a fish is male or female it is a goldfish by the way i have is very fat and gold the other has turned silver and is only slightly bigger than when i bought it for gold fish the only thing way to tell is to look at the underside of the body between their tail and their bottom set of fins the female will look slightly concave sunk in while the male will be rounded out it is not easy to see when they are small ats the fish get to inches long you can begin to see the difference at little easier  Equine conformation American lobster Goldfish Fish anatomy Goldeen Kissing gourami Bottlenose Dolphin Muskellunge Ulna Skateboard Amateur telescope making Batoidea Shark Mattress Textile manufacturing Clarinet Humpback Whale Vegeta Chair Sailfin Molly Angler Butterfish Grass carp Saxophone Clownfish Grunion Ostrich Punt (boat) Scapula Firework Collision detection Puberty Gar Atlantic herring Backstroke Zeidae Tibia Table tennis Radius (bone) Whale Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Snowshoe Curling Flyingfish Black sea bass Poker jargon Parrotfish Wheel of Fortune Stingray Fish Barreleye Yellow Windsurfing Sperm Whale Tetrapod Mouse (computing) USS Flying Fish (SS-229) Mortar (weapon) Stone Age Mazda Miata Golf club (equipment) Terminal ballistics P-61 Black Widow Lionel Corporation The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Anatomical terms of location Garfield Sexual selection Coelacanth Roach Anglerfish Skateboarding trick Butterfly stroke Koi Sexual attraction Pipefish Cheetah Loch Ness Monster Fin Whale Lancetfish Trapping Cetacea Ford Thunderbird Fishing Frogman Viz (comic) U.S. five-dollar bill Sabertooth fish Avro Lancaster Fin Drill bit Volleyball Lewis Gun Japanese tea ceremony Wood Drag racing Stairway Sento Horse M16 (rifle)

our fish died what's the reason for it i cleaned the tank last night and put the anti chlorine and dr wonder fish disease specialist then i found our fishes dead this morning and when i took them out their fins and tails are almost melting and some of their body parts are falling like leaves what's wrong what is the dr wonder stuff too much of the wrong thing could kill a fish instantly like that i suspect the dr wonder i do not beleive in medicating the tank with water additives anti biotic food is best all meds added to the water kill the biological filter for one you really need the use of a microscope to diagnose exactly what ails your fish so you don't medicate with the wrong stuff if you do not know the exact amount of water in the tank you are likely overdosing for example my gallon tank actually holds about gallons of water the rest is taken up by substrate and large river rocks if i dosed for all gallons i would be putting in too much medication the trick to keeping any fish is consistancy consistant regular water changes that also keep the water temperture consistant as well as ph to some degree keep the ammonia and nitrite at zero and nitrates under ppm at all times consistant filter cleanings about once a month and refurbish carbon regularly keep everything the same as you can and the fish will live long happy lives if fish get sick the first thing you do is change water of the time the illness is water related fish health is totally dependant on the health of the water foul water equals stressed or sick fish learn to watch the fish's behaviour when they are healthy if they stop acting that way and start acting differently then suspect the water needs a big changing hope this has shed some light  Marine aquarium Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ammonia Dairy Aquarium Common cold Fish farming Water purification Chronic fatigue syndrome Ecology Brewery Insulin Discus (fish) Hydrogen sulfide Hypoglycemia Water Omega-3 fatty acid Biogeochemical cycle Dry cleaning Eutrophication Clinical depression Decompression sickness Rabies Prostate cancer Folic acid Bipolar disorder Shark Cyanide Vitamin C Fugu Sea-Monkey Medicine Marathon (sport) Cocaine EastEnders Sodium chloride Biological warfare Diving The Amber Spyglass Health insurance Healthy eating Whale E85 Stomach cancer Tocopherol Duesberg hypothesis Quarantine Foodborne illness Textile manufacturing Lake Acne Hamster Disease Charles Darwin's illness Chlorine Poker jargon Tooth enamel Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Multiple sclerosis Dietary fiber Thermal power station Orca Gasoline Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Reef tank Swimming Pneumonia Hydrogen economy Swimming pool Autonomous building Electrophysiology Diabetes mellitus Caffeine Air pollution Hard water Escherichia coli O157:H7 Utilitarianism Water (molecule) Coronary heart disease Sexual orientation Drowning Nutrition Nitrogen Cancer Fire fighting Drug abuse Asthma Nutrient Fish Radiation poisoning Biology Biodiesel Nuclear fallout

what kind of fish can i add it is a gallon tank well filtered and taken care of i has a foot midas cichlid a large red snook and a large jack dempesy and a common pleco too big to be eaten and i would like to add one more nice sized fish but i don't know what to put in the tank i like oscars but everybody has one and cat fish would get beaten up so any help would be good and if i do find a fish where could i order it large enough that it won't be eaten every web site only sells the good fish as juvenilles i dunno any large cichlid you add to that tank is going to create major problems the midas and jack already have the tank staked out as their personal territory and any fish added will get beaten to death whoever suggested adding a flower horn is way out of line they are one of the meanest most vicious cichlids out there if the jack and the midas don't kill him he will eventually kill both of them the only possible way to add a big cichlid to that tank would be to wait until just before lights out for the night do a water change and move all of the rocks and decorations around to new locations acclimate the new fish and turn out the lights for the night the new locations for rocks and decorations will confuse the old residents and maybe allow the new fish to claim a territory the fresh water also makes it seem like a new location for all the fish sometimes this works sometimes it doesn't watch them closely all the next day for signs of agression sometimes the dominant fish is so agressive nothing changes his attitude toward other fish  Cichlid Discus (fish) Tilapia Oscar (fish) Marine aquarium Aquarium Eric Bischoff Clownfish Freshwater angelfish Sea-Monkey Lake Malawi Brewery Hamster Lake Tanganyika Major League Baseball television contracts SS Andrea Doria Fish farming Roxette Shark Mick Foley Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shen Gong Wu Japanese tea ceremony GunBound Minor Harry Potter Beasts E85 The Lovely Bones Rum Animal Crossing Tofu Dionysus Reef tank Sin City USS Tunny (SS-282) Leopard Textile manufacturing Shrimp farm Theory of conduct Phrygia Goldfish Midas Pysanka Gar Gray Wolf Plagues of Egypt Sid Vicious World Championship Wrestling Flax Sheepshead Betting (poker) Fugu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Homer's Enemy Tom Waits Yugo Battle of Tarawa Leon White Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ron and Fez Dodge Charger Creatures in Bionicle Paul Is Dead Characters in the Smurfs Rei Ayanami RuneScape Random Events Ecco the Dolphin Seine (fishing) Extreme Championship Wrestling StarCraft Episode VI Daredevil Kosher foods Chicago Cubs Spider Roman eating and drinking Miss Saigon Cantonese cuisine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jack Dempsey (fish) Death Note USS Yorktown (CV-5) Louis Agassiz Operation Market Garden Loudspeaker RuneScape skills Glossary of nautical terms Cruising (maritime) Live-bearing aquarium fish The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Torquay United F.C.

how often should one really clean exchange water in a fish tank i have some very healthy and happy fish in a simple community tank it has a great filter and the water appears clear yes the bottom is slightly discolored do i really need to do water change every week it really depends on the total volume of the tank the total mass of your fish the presence absence of plants and the quantity of food that is fed if you want to stretch it out to two weeks you can do it if your tank is fairly lightly stocked and you go easy on the food you might want to have your nitrates tested once every few months  Sewage treatment Fish farming Marine aquarium Brewery Bong Dairy Dry cleaning Thermal power station Water purification Explosive material Fishing Eutrophication Shrimp farm Reef tank Discus (fish) Sea-Monkey Great Lakes Septic tank Biodiesel E85 Aquarium Breastfeeding Axolotl Hamster Water Goldfish Sustainable agriculture Stock car (rail) Atlantic herring Clownfish Chinook salmon Carburetor Ecology Seabird Cannabis cultivation Kashrut Bread Insulin Fugu Hypoglycemia Depleted uranium Rebreather Tooth enamel Tofu Hydrogen sulfide Organic farming Textile manufacturing Veganism Hydroponics Desert Internal ballistics Kosher foods Heat Omega-3 fatty acid Sugar beet Apollo Command/Service Module Energy Carnivorous plant Soil pH Energy development Wood Ammonium nitrate Myxobolus cerebralis Ice core Coffee Mercury (element) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Autonomous building Hardware random number generator USS Tunny (SS-282) Fish Violin Algal bloom Internet troll Wetland Domestic rabbit Anchor Wildfire Krill Ocean thermal energy conversion Stomach cancer Fire fighting Fancy rat Uranium Vitamin C Tank landing ship Oily fish Livestock Motor oil Rocket fuel Vermicompost Diseases of the honeybee Liquid crystal Gustavus Franklin Swift Sonar Japanese tea ceremony Economy of the Philippines Nitrocellulose Synthesizer Bofors 40 mm gun

my guppy died suddenly mysteriously ok so i have a gallon tank with guppies surpae tetras and blackskirt tetras i change water about times a month and i feed them twice a day it's been like that for about months now and all of them had been perfectly fine and happy i think until yesterday then this morning when i went to feed them one of the guppies was dead and not just dead but with a hugh black hole in his stomach and the other guppy had his tailed ripped a little bit the ph and temperature and other things are fine and i think it's either that the guppies attacked each other or the tetras attacked the guppies or possibly the dead guppy caught a disease i don't know about but every one of them looked healthy just last night what was going on in my fish tank last night while i was asleep i don't know what's happened to my guppies and also one more question should i buy more guppies b c i've heard that guppies like to live in groups of at least help please you don't mention if the dead guppy was a male of female if a female this could have been related to a birthing problem in either case it could have also been an internal infection but the huge hole was probably made by the other fish after your fish died minor fin rips are common and i doubt was related to the problem that killed your fish since you don't see any problem with the other fish it's really impossible to say if any other fish have a disease or not all you can really do at this point is carefully watch your fish for any signs of a disease guppies will do fine alone or in groups you don't have to buy more mm  Paul Is Dead Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Shark USS Yorktown (CV-5) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Pocket cruiser Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Theory of conduct Fish farming Nerpa Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fugu EastEnders Aquarium Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Phaedo RuneScape quests Myxobolus cerebralis Breastfeeding Ecco the Dolphin Guppy Fish Have I Got News For You Dead Like Me Cat Physical paradox The Beatles discography Smallpox American Alligator Foodborne illness Vampire Opie and Anthony Brewery Marine aquarium Supernatural Creatures in Bionicle Cliff Richard The Shining (film) American Pie (song) Coeliac disease Tocopherol The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Rabies Thermal power station Goldfish Marilyn Monroe Duesberg hypothesis Legionellosis Dairy 2001 anthrax attacks Fishing Nile crocodile USS Tench (SS-417) Tasmanian Devil Blue Whale Sea-Monkey Cardinal tetra Bubonic plague Death Axolotl Piccolo Junior Saga Mammal USS Tunny (SS-282) Entropy Gar Orca Characters of Lost Stomach cancer USS Wasp (CV-7) USS Trigger (SS-237) P-47 Thunderbolt Steven Wright Shrimp farm Charles Peace USS Threadfin (SS-410) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amber Spyglass Gypsy moth Pneumonia Phoebe Buffay's songs Spanish flu Vitasoy Jumpstart 3rd Grade Saturn V Pontiac's Rebellion Good Morning, Vietnam Debugging Whale Cytomegalovirus Poker jargon Ron and Fez Diseases of the honeybee Jam (TV series)

to remove or not to remove the under gravel filter ugf that is the question i clean and maintain aquariums for a living today i visited a new customer for the first time they have a gallon tank this is really deep x x it looks like two longs stacked on top of each other poor oxygen exchange is just the beginning of this tanks problems it has two filters one is an under gravel filter it also has a tetra whisper power filter similar to the current pf there's a large school of black neon tetras and black skirt tetras additionally there is a small school of three julli cory cats there were five originally but two died one black neon also died recently this is what prompted the call three deaths in a week the tank is in an advertising agency and they want it to look good they like the black and white theme the tank has a moderate amount of brown algae on the walls artificial plants and not much on the gravel a slight white haze indicated a bacterial bloom testing the water i found ammonia at ppm it was borderline definitely not ppm no nitrites the nitrates were at the thing that troubles me the most is the ph is very low even after a water change it still showed at best from the tap it was no surprise that i sucked enormous amounts of brown and black debris from the filter plate as i exposed a little at a time and cleaned of it it was the grossest thing i've seen smelled in a while i plan on doing the other half next week i didn't want to do too much at once and cause a mini cycle i also know there's plenty more filth down there and it will still be there after cleaning for a second time i want to avoid tearing down the tank and removing it it may very well pollute the water so badly i'd have to restart it obviously it would be bad for the fish do i clean it the best i can and let it be this is my first plan perhaps with regular maintenance the ugf will be fine i have customers with ugfs that are fine and would yield little debris if i cleaned the filter plate because of very frequent water changes ugfs do work if you take care of them this one wasn't taken care of at all i would remove the ug filter and have them get an aquaclear i know it sounds big but you can adjust the flow so that it is not so bad this tank needs a large filter since they aren't going to be giving it good care they should be able to get a for around i would run the little hang on the back filter while the larger one runs for the first or weeks you should just continue to clean the tank doing water changes once a week until nitrates go to near zero i would also make sure to place a large carbon pillow in the ac to adsorb all the funky smells and to clear the water up edit one of my tanks has a ug filter and it works great for me too but i also take care of it as you do  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Brewery Hydroponics Eutrophication Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Fish farming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Water purification Aquarium E85 Hydrogen sulfide Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Carburetor Hydrogen economy Biodiesel Tank Biogeochemical cycle Cyanide Glacier Shrimp farm Extreme Programming Ocean thermal energy conversion Transformer Nuclear reactor Nutrient Dry cleaning Ammonia Carnivorous plant Poker jargon Diesel engine Pebble bed reactor Dialysis Motor oil Dairy Discus (fish) Water Hamster Desert Gasoline Reef tank Lake Motorcycle Sea-Monkey Ozone depletion Rebreather Tofu Energy development Bong Hard water Natural gas Dishwasher Goldfish Nuclear fallout 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chlorophyta Lighting Loudspeaker Japanese tea ceremony Air pollution Hard disk Moon Ozone hole Chernobyl accident Drill bit MS-06 Zaku II Solar power Sulfur Sugar beet Gas metal arc welding Geology of the Grand Canyon area Textile manufacturing Halitosis Mattress Swimming pool Water pollution Fancy rat Antarctic krill Heat exchanger Slow sand filter bed Alcohol fuel Theory of conduct Upholstery Welding Tooth Environmental concerns with electricity generation Terraforming Dodge Neon Hydropower

question about betta's if bettas are so territorial how do they produce it s been bothering me i need to know male bettas siamese fighting fish are intolerant of other males most females will tolerate other females if the aquarium is large enough the reproductive cycle of the betta is fascinating male bettas will build a bubble nest of their saliva this next can be several inches across and extend up to half an inch out of the water then the male wraps himself around the ripe female and squeezes the eggs out of her and fertilizes them as they fall he then picks them up in his mouth and blows them back into the nest if the female doesn't leave after her eggs are all extruded the male may beat her up frequently ripping her fins in about hours the eggs hatch at first the male tries to put the babies back into the nest then as the babies become free swimming in about days he must be removed or he may eat them i understand that in thailand these fish live in water that is fairly cloudy and muddy so they are not as aware of each other as they are in our clean small aquaria and that's why they can breathe air with an organ somewhat similar to our lungs beautiful fish and smarter than people think they are relatively easy to train  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Clownfish Halfbeak Tilapia Spider Bird Goldfish Egg (biology) Sea-Monkey Grunion American lobster Kakapo Nile crocodile Octopus Dwarf gourami Leatherback Sea Turtle Atlantic herring Shark Tarantula Platypus Sexual reproduction Coconut crab Kissing gourami Gar Elephant Bong Salmon Carbon dioxide Fishing Drowning Textile manufacturing Percula Clownfish Gourami American Alligator Sex Live-bearing aquarium fish Sea Otter Bottlenose Dolphin Menstrual cup Killifish Paper wasp Harmonica Myxobolus cerebralis Aquarium Emu Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Swimming Seabird Parthenogenesis Breaststroke Chicken Sawfish (fish) Marine aquarium Mallard Non-human animal sexuality Cat Grasshopper Cantonese cuisine Ostrich Batoidea Professional wrestling holds Zerg Cuisine of the Philippines Hamster Marine biology Tuatara Krill Siphon Scuba set Jellyfish Tofu Swimming pool Whale shark Zeidae Sailfin Molly Freshwater angelfish Oral sex Sea turtle Diving Kosher foods Tetrapod Goby Dragonet Rhea (bird) Flute Hermaphrodite Murray Cod Sushi Combtooth blenny Egg (food) Frog Soap bubble Parrotfish Aphid Glossary of firefighting equipment Chris Kanyon Breastfeeding In vitro fertilisation Condom

what types uv fish live the longest besides betta fish actually betta don't live that long it really all depends on how much care and attention you give your fish making sure that you give it the proper living conditions that its specie requires will help with longevity i believe that goldfish are said to be one of the longest lived aquarium fish that there is up to years some exotic fish such as arowanas also live for a long time as for tropical fish regularly kept i'd say cichlids would be next then again they vary from a few years to up to years or more  Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cichlid Tilapia Goldfish Gar Discus (fish) Live-bearing aquarium fish Biodiversity Fish Lake Tanganyika Coral reef Jack Dempsey (fish) Krill Fly fishing Brackish water Fishing Freshwater angelfish Dwarf gourami Lake Malawi Zambezi Seabird Oscar (fish) Bird migration Marine aquarium Orca Clownfish Humpback Whale Largest organism Insulin Eel life history Angling Danio Murray Cod Gourami Pet store Fauna of Australia Zebra Danio Livestock Bottlenose Dolphin Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests Shrimp farm Bird Tropical year Japanese tea ceremony Dam Halfbeak Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Marine angelfish Seahorse Fishery Color Zodiac Fishing rod Florida Keys Bat Tetrapod Year Pet Salmon Mattress Mong Kok Georgia Aquarium Bonsai Parrotfish Sturgeon Common carp Autonomous building Anopheles Gambling Samuel Goldwyn Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Penis Louis Agassiz El-Fish Wetland Lazarus Long Myxobolus cerebralis Introduced species Michael Chang RuneScape Random Events Filefish Tuna Fish farming Guinea pig Suckermouth Catfish Marine biology Shedd Aquarium Spinner Dolphin Green swordtail Nutrition Pygmy Killer Whale Iceland Houseplant Great Lakes Thermoregulation Sexual selection Yacht Shark

i have a fish and hes growing a ball of hair on the left side of his face what the heck im thinking some kind of fungus or something but hair is growing on the side of his face i dont know what to do its a white fish growing white hair its soooo weird i've never seen anything like this this could be a fungus but it could also be a bacterial condition called columnaris you can usually tell the difference because columnaris has a more circular outline while fungus is irregular one of the best medications for columnaris is nifurpirinol see if your fish store has furanace or binox both of which have this as an ingrediant the fungus usually only attacks a fish as a secondary infection if the fish is weakened or has an injury see this link for more info about both conditions the fungus is called saprolegniasis in the link http www fish disease net diseases htm  Fungus Cell (biology) Urinary incontinence Mycosis Medicine Nail disease Dandruff Pneumonia Virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Death Honey fungus Candidiasis Volleyball Fish farming Vegetarianism Cardiovascular disease Common cold Cirrhosis Prostate cancer Ant AIDS Acne Wood Sexually-transmitted infection Baldness Hamster Mycology Diseases of the honeybee Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Nail (anatomy) Malaria Balance disorder Disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Foodborne illness Biological warfare Food preservation Canker Beauveria bassiana Shark Biology Wheat Bacteria Spanish flu Gypsy moth Magnaporthe grisea Stem cell Stomach cancer Food Sewage treatment Syphilis Traumatic brain injury Breast Puberty Chlorophyta Medical analysis of circumcision Conjunctivitis Rose Psychosis Dutch elm disease Aspergillosis Agar plate First aid Guinea pig Infectious disease Ebola Antibiotic Shrimp farm Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ergot Animal Bioluminescence Traditional Chinese medicine Fancy rat Radiation therapy Domain Name System Banana Lichen Soil life Otitis externa Helicobacter pylori Chemotherapy Psychedelic mushroom Alexander Fleming Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Athlete's foot Penicillin Baylisascaris Ta__no Oak Omega-3 fatty acid Transformation (genetics) Ulcerative colitis Apple Human lung Uniform Resource Locator Vaccine Homeopathy

i have a male and a female betta how should i breed them the water needs to be a little warmer than usual but not hot and a little pinch of aquarium salt helps keep both fish healthy the male often kills the famale during or after mating he has to squeeze the eggs out of her and in this process she sometimes drowns fish drowning yes because they are surface breathers she will eat the eggs if you leave her in the tank so if she survives remove her immediately and give her special care for a few weeks some people divide their fish tanks with clear barriers so the males and females can see each other but are separate until the time is right when the male has a good bubble nest built and she has ripe eggs if the barrier is low enough they will be able to jump over to get to the mate good luck  Kakapo Goldfish Leatherback Sea Turtle Aquarium Clownfish Platypus Sea-Monkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bird Fugu Spider American lobster Salmon Halfbeak Emu Ant Octopus Chicken Cantonese cuisine Seabird Marine aquarium Discus (fish) Tarantula Hamster Egg (food) Shark Humpback Whale Dwarf gourami Life in the Freezer Tilapia Fishing Live-bearing aquarium fish Tuatara Osprey Sexual reproduction Hemp Tofu Albatross Dairy Antarctic krill Coral reef Fish farming Monogamy Zerg Kosher foods Drowning Beetle Cuisine of the Philippines Orca Fish Sewage treatment Nuclear fusion Murray Cod Ostrich American Alligator Jewish cuisine Nile crocodile Mosquito Pysanka Red Squirrel Sexual dimorphism Gharial Wine making Swimming pool Cyanide Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sea Otter Anopheles Freshwater angelfish Dinosaur Parthenogenesis Percula Clownfish Mallard Thermal power station Brewery Frog Mango Omega-3 fatty acid Great White Shark Non-human animal sexuality Minor Harry Potter Beasts Roman eating and drinking Reef tank Egg (biology) Condom Jellyfish Bubble Bobble Sailfin Molly Earthworm Zebra Danio Great Bustard Water (molecule) Rhea (bird) Hermaphrodite Myxobolus cerebralis Pikmin Angling African Fish Eagle Gray Wolf Sex

how did my betta run away i remember reading that betta can commute from one body of water to another but can't imagine it being anything but an emergency measure the weather outside yesterday was up to but his cubic foot bowl is in the shade we try to entertain him all the time but he quickly bores of that if there is not food included we gave him pellets in the morning and in the evening i have looked in every nook and cranny in rooms of the house and i can't find my friend anywhere i drained the tank and rinsed out all his shells the only thing i can think is some kid came in looking for trouble and decided the fish was it but my wife is sure nobody got in while she was working her apple tree i'm sure no cats got in he most likely jumped out of his tank bettas are terrific jumpers and yes in the wild they are able to jump from one rice paddy field to another do you have a lid on your tank if not that's probably the reason it's not your fault for mistreating him or anything bettas will almost always jump it's a natural instinct and if there's nothing over their tanks they will probably end up on the floor you probably should remember to keep a lid on next time sorry  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Show jumping Rice Dog agility Guinea pig Japanese tea ceremony Domestic rabbit Fire fighting Japanese toilet Tea Sea-Monkey Goldfish Car washing techniques Animal Crossing E85 Garfield The Catcher in the Rye Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 John Cage Fish farming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Customs and etiquette of Japan Hamster John F.

should i give up on my betta fish i've had a double tail betta for months now and since day i've been struggling to get rid of what i think is a swim bladder disorder his abdomen is swollen and has problems staying balanced i've tried feeding him less even used an antibiotic called kanaplex i change his water weekly and put acquarium salt in his tank this has been going on for the months i've had him i suspected he might have had an internal parasite since he darts around a lot and tries to scratch his gills a lot so i tried treating him for ick i'm not sure since i don't see anything on him but he's has not gotten better and recently is getting much worse just the other day i saw that his fins were extremely torn up and shredded half his lower tail is gone there's nothing plastic or sharp in the tank that could've done this his gills are even having a hard time closing and he's gotten much more lethargic he hardly moves much anymore should i just give up and euthanize him don't euthanize the fish your first mistake was treating the fish when you didn't know what it had medications are very hard on fish so all the treatment has probably made him worse what do you keep him in for best health you should have in him a tank that's at least gallons and has a small filter and heater keep the water temp around f to f giving him perfect conditions will help strengthen him enough to help him get over whatever he has two things to try for the next few days epsom salt bath mix one tbsp of epsom salt with a gallon of water put the betta in for up to mins do this tomorrow as well fasting don't feed your betta today or tomorrow laxatives after tomorrow give your betta a pea frozen works best soak the pea in hot water until room temp then remove the skin and feed bite sized pieces of the pea to your betta use a toothpick is needed if you don't see improvement in a few days email me for farther help  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fancy rat Shrimp farm Marine aquarium Thermal power station Electrophysiology Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Shark Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aquarium Coffee Fish farming Prostate cancer Tetrapod Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Brewery Myxobolus cerebralis Multiple sclerosis Hyperthermia Dairy Diseases of the honeybee Tofu Diarrhea Sea-Monkey Swimming pool E85 Fire fighting Procrastination P-38 Lightning Equine conformation Menstrual cup Fugu Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chicken Bladderwort Intersex surgery Acne First aid Asthma Krill Dialysis Gastroparesis Gramophone record Allergy Bipolar disorder Autonomous building Cantonese cuisine Aerial (dance move) Water purification Folic acid Drowning Extreme Programming Cuisine of Denmark Pneumonia Radiation therapy RuneScape quests B-47 Stratojet Pea Temperature P-47 Thunderbolt Corrosion Leather Gar Spider Axolotl Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Terminal ballistics Cruising (maritime) Cat Magnesium sulfate Internal ballistics Solar power Common cold Hydrogen economy Unreal Theory of conduct Anorexia nervosa Carnivorous plant Stingray Childbirth Atlantic herring Milk

underwater filters yeah yeah i know those hang on top filter or w e are better then underwater filter i have a gal hang on top filter and i dont want another one because it would look weard i just need to know if those underwater filters are any good i'm pretty sure you mean an undergravel filter they are old technology but they are great for growing beneficial bacteria they are not very good at chemical filtration but your hotb filter will be able to do it well enough if you decide to get one you should get power heads to really get it working well instead of an air pump the key to an undergravel is regular maintenance you will not want to skip water changes and you might want to tear the whole thing down once every months for a thorough siphoning  Sewage treatment Filtration Marine aquarium Aquarium Water purification Brewery Coffee Fume hood Reef tank Air filter Borehole Bong Dry cleaning Ozone Solar power Siphon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Water pollution Unreal Irrigation Energy development Loudspeaker Wine making Scuba diving Fountain Water supply Swimming pool Hard disk Gas mask Cholera Slow sand filter bed She Loves You Diving Particle (ecology) Thermal power station High-voltage direct current Autonomous building Diesel engine Vacuum cleaner Beer Glossary of firefighting equipment Yerba mate Motor oil Nephron Fossil fuel power plant Submarine Photosynthesis Drainage B-47 Stratojet Ultraviolet Hydroponics Water Dead Sea Biofilter Original Amiga chipset Scuba set Agar plate Dredge Textile manufacturing Kidney Crucible Carnivorous plant Flush toilet Cryptosporidium Tank Stereoscopy Biodiesel Hydrogen economy Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Bacteria Urine Glossary of wildland fire terms Renal physiology Steam engine HVAC First Battle of the Atlantic Air pollution Cocaine Cave diving Cannabis cultivation Golf Nuclear fallout Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Hydropower NEWater Paragliding E85 Renewable energy Hall & Oates Underwater MS-06 Zaku II U.S. Navy SEALs Hydrogen sulfide Welding Diving suit Rebreather Light-emitting diode Super Mario 64 Incandescent light bulb

strings growing out of anarcharis elodea egeria i don't know what the difference is between these names but i have one of them lol anyway about days ago i noticed that all of my anarcharis plant started developing these strings about inches long coming out of them what is that either it's very good or very bad i've had the elodea for more than weeks why does it all of a sudden start producing roots i'm so curious it starts producing roots after you bought it because previously it had been quickly grown in its warehouse environment and whatever roots it may have grown were ripped out when it was packaged for sale and then shipped around a lot and probably only lived a short time in the fish store so it's never had a chance to settle into a permanent environment and so now it's feeling at home and had a chance to set in or grow roots which btw is where we human beings get the same saying that infers we have finally found a home so that it's growing roots is a good thing  Elodea Shaggy dog story Opportunity rover Social rule The Cure Ecco the Dolphin Equine conformation K' Billboard Hot 100 Sorghum Stone Age Objective-C Hair Kender Microeconomics Animal Houseplant Hydrilla The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Simone Weil The Amber Spyglass Organic food Deforestation Sewage treatment Customer relationship management Hard disk Hash table Wonderland (McFly album) Surplus product Topps Randomness Breastfeeding The Roots Species Textile manufacturing Norway national football team Community Supply and demand Plant Linked list Tenshinhan Atari 2600 Tina Turner Auxin 1957 World Series Password Discus (fish) Doomsday argument Hamster Video game controversy Humanist Movement Guinea pig 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Sam Walton Biology Street-Legal Star Trek Customizable Card Game Ecology Gross domestic product Java programming language Christmas Shifting cultivation Human Britney Spears The Emancipation of Mimi Time Out of Mind Good Times Computer Dairy American lobster Inventory Wheel of Fortune Sydney Riot of 1879 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee $ale of the Century The Martian Chronicles Neolithic Revolution Napier's bones TLC Halting problem Law of value Best Buy Ojibwe language Root Emacs Statistics Biodiversity History of Victoria Origin of language Joy Division (band) Internet fraud PHP Lisp programming language Paul W.

what kind of fish should i get i was thinking of buying my yr old a pet fish that i will help him care for he wants a goldfish like the one elmo has on sesame street and i don't want a big aquarium i want fish and a small fish bowl easy to care for and keep clean but my husband says that goldfish die to easily and that my son would be crying so what is a good fish to buy of course i would feed the fish thanks for the info we have a miniture chihuhua now and i have never had fish so i don't know you're going into this all wrong if you want something that doesn't need much maintenance then you don't want a bowl bowls need to have water changes every days so that means twice a week you'd be putting the fish in another container dumping out all the water rinsing the rocks in a strainer to rinse out poop and food wiping down the bowl filling it back up again with conditioned water that is the same temp as water that was in the bowl then putting the fish in again not to mention a bowl is not healthy for any fish the only fish that can really survive in a bowl okay is a betta which still aren't great choices because they prefer water temps around f if your son really wants a goldfish and you want something that is low maintenance i suggest getting a gallon tank a filter for a tank slightly larger i'll make suggestions with price estimates lower and then letting your son pick out the decorations then cycle the tank and after the tank has cycled take your son to pick out one fancy goldfish these are the round bodied goldfish only one will fit comfortably in a gallon and slim bodied or common goldfish like you win at a fair get way too big for a gallon then take the fish home float his bag in the tank for an hour adding a little of the tank water to the bag halfway through after the hour is up use a net to scoop him into the tank so you don't get the store water in the tank gallon tank no hood whisper filter i recommend one for gallon tank possibly cheaper net gravel master test kit to read up on cycling go here http www kokosgoldfish com fishlesscycle html good luck  Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Biodiesel Japanese tea ceremony Sea-Monkey Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Brewery Thermal power station Dairy Fish farming Poker jargon E85 Fancy rat Dishwasher Bong Social rule Hamster Menstrual cup Microeconomics Carburetor Hydrogen economy Tea Nuclear power Toilet humour Fossil fuel power plant Milk Extreme Programming Cannabis cultivation American Dad!

beta fish question how is it that these fish can survive in such small containers with no filtration etc i go to the pet store and they're all just sitting in these tiny plastic cups how is this possible wow it never occurred to me that they breathe like us lol that's so neat it's simply for convenience in pet stores say you have male bettas for sale and since they're territorial they can't be kept in a tank together it would be terribly impractical to have each one in his own gallon heated and filtered tank especially since bettas are popular and sell fast however there are many myths floating around about bettas and how they like to be in tiny bowls and are perfect at room temp ect it's not true this all started because during the dry season the rice paddies betta live in sometimes dry up however this does not mean they're living in puddles or muddy footprints some even live in slow moving streams although everyone seems so eager to provide them with a tiny living space so they don't get scared no one seems to eager to provide them with a heater so the don't get cold bettas naturally live in water around f lifespans in bowls and vases is around a few months to yrs lifespan in a proper home is yr to see for yourself what they really live in take a look here http www brents com organization vacationimages v photos baliimages images rice paddy view from jpg  Aquarium Marine aquarium Coffee Hamster Tea Brewery Bong Rice Dwarf gourami Sewage treatment Cannabis cultivation Goldfish Thermal power station Autonomous building Portable stove E85 Sake Japanese tea ceremony Fish farming Dairy Axolotl Temperature Drill bit Japanese toilet Milk Sea-Monkey Reef tank Tilapia Tofu HVAC Hydrogen economy Ice cream Frog Solar power Fossil fuel power plant Mars Exploration Rover Sauna Digital photography Apollo 13 Food preservation Stereoscopy Renewable energy Fire fighting Flood geology Tlingit Noah's Ark Glass Cigarette Alcohol fuel Fire extinguisher Kitchen Fishing Samovar Rum Ramen Cat Menstrual cup Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Drowning Operation Barbarossa Sega Dreamcast Shrimp farm Fancy rat Irrigation Dragon boat Gaia Online Solar eclipse Sushi Water heater Laserdisc Drainage Compost Basement Kylie Minogue Phase (matter) Floppy disk Water purification Glossary of firefighting equipment Filling station Rail terminology Dry cleaning Biodiesel Dishwasher The Late Show with David Letterman Rice University Cuisine of Brazil Solar panel Bonsai ITunes Compact audio cassette Gmail Customs and etiquette of Japan Tank RISC Radioisotope thermoelectric generator

compatible fish okay so i am planning on upgrading my tanks in about a month and in two days i am going to get more fish so they can ajust to eachother while they are young i want opinions about the fish in my tanks such as if you think they will get along am i overcrowding and if you think i have a cool combo of fish first tank is a g with ghost shrimps sunset platy orange fancy guppy lyre tail guppy and zebra danios all male i am going to add sunset platy fancy guppy and ghost shrimp all female i will then upgrade the tank to g i know the fish might breed so i will have a g for the fry incase do you think this is a good combonation tank is a g with two australian rainbows peppered corydoras and otocinclus i am going to add albino corydoras and clown plecostomus they will then be upgraded to a g tank good combonation remember i just want opinions i have already read up on these fish but you cant trust everything you read i would say the rainbows should be in an even larger tank than a they might get by if it's a long but a tall wouldn't give them much swimming room a gallon or larger would be better for these the oto could probably use more of his kind as well to school with i would hold off moving the otos and clown pleco until the tank has had a chance to cycle since these are both sensitive to water quality be sure to give your pleco some driftwood in the tank for the smaller tank what you already have in the is a little overstocked rather than move these into a new with even more fish why not move them into the gallon once the other fish have been moved out if you keep the same gravel that's in the tank now you wouldn't have to wait for the tank to cycle and add enough danios to get the total number up to the compatibility in both tanks is okay  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Zebra Danio Danio Clownfish Tilapia Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Platypus Shrimp farm Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Axolotl Fish farming Lake Burley Griffin Brewery Aquarium Discus (fish) Guppy Live-bearing aquarium fish Toyota Prius Shark Gar Tank Myxobolus cerebralis House Mouse Sailfin Molly Poker jargon Goldfish Dwarf gourami Pearl Danio Halfbeak Lion Cuisine of Denmark Mark I (tank) Suckermouth Catfish Shrimp M4 Sherman Aqua Teen Hunger Force Hard disk Salmon Fish Tung Chung Krill Fishing Clown loach MS-06 Zaku II General Dynamics F-111 Grunion Freshwater angelfish Hamburger Carp Panzer II Leopard tank Roman eating and drinking Fire fighting Sewage treatment Chinese New Year Hydrogen economy Wine making StarCraft: Uprising Cajun cuisine Messerschmitt Bf 109 Three Mile Island USS Tiru (SS-416) Autonomous building Seal Beach, California Squirrel Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour Solar power Hurricane Rita Rainbow Islands E85 American lobster Dairy Goby Swimming pool Orlando, Florida Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy Zerg Tag Curry Pok__mon Abilities Bay de Verde, Newfoundland and Labrador Junkers Ju 188 Pocket cruiser Peruvian cuisine Mikoyan MiG-29 Short Sunderland CPU cache Transformer Livestock Refrigerator SS Andrea Doria Mosquitofish Fossil fuel power plant Australian bass Fancy Crane Captain Thunderbolt Trout Inca Empire

how long to cycle marine tank i have a set up and just put in two damsels how long to cycle the time will vary are you using live rock or live sand inthe tank these will cut the time since they already have the bacteria you're trying to establish you can also shorten the time a little by raising the temperature but how high you can go will depend on what's in the tank if it's just the fish you can probably go up to o or so if you adjust the temperature slowly and have good areation if you have live rock with nice inverts you may not want to go over o in general the process can take from just a week or two with the live rock or sand to weeks without whenever the nitrate is the only product detectable no ammonia or nitrite you're finished note because damsels other than chromis are aggressive and territorial it can be a problem to add other fish to the tank after they've been the only fish in it for a month or so they'll have claimed the entire tank as their territory  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Nitrogen Fish farming Hydrogen economy Brewery Water purification Nitric acid Solar variation Eutrophication Polymerase chain reaction Nitrogen cycle Sodium nitrite Shrimp farm Ice core Transformer Hydrogen sulfide Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Explosive material Shark Photosynthesis Dairy Gas turbine Reef tank Fish Fossil fuel power plant Menstrual cycle Uranium Gasoline Thermal power station Water Drill bit PID controller Electrophysiology Tank Nuclear reactor Extreme Programming Curing Town gas Tidal power Ammonium nitrate E85 Fire fighting Omega-3 fatty acid Alternative biochemistry Sake Pottery Jet engine Flood geology Aquarium Cyanide Potassium nitrate Alternative fuel Titanium Biodiesel Operation Barbarossa Coral reef Brewing Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Soil pH Earth's atmosphere Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Yom Kippur War Ceramics Ham Dry cleaning Plankton Tank locomotive Alkane Nuclear fusion Methanol Keynesian economics Oxyacetylene Phase (matter) CPU cache Cellular respiration Tofu Rebreather Food preservation Iron Hubble Space Telescope Pebble bed reactor Anchor Hebrew calendar Desert Soil life Internal ballistics Patton tank Ecology Bacon Compost Sun History of the tank Battle of Kursk Refrigerator

why does my single betta's face get puffy for no reason i have a single male betta and whenever i glance over to his tank his face is all puffy its as if to make himself look bigger i think this may be a sign of aggression but i only have one betta so why is he acting like he is getting ready to fight does this mean something else you have the right idea the males and females will both do this it's called flaring when they open their gill covers and spread their fins and they are trying to warn other fish that if they're not in the mood for a fight they'd better back off chances are he's seeing his reflection in the side of the tank or the glass of the heater and he thinks it's another male betta too much of this can cause him to be stressed so it might be a good idea for you to try and figure out what he's flaring towards and use plants they can be fake ones or a tank background so he doesn't see the reflection as often  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sean Combs Poker jargon Dwarf gourami B-47 Stratojet T-64 Blur Aquarium Chris Kanyon Ecco the Dolphin Tank The Emancipation of Mimi Marine aquarium History of the tank Fire fighting Mercury Atlas 6 Operation Barbarossa Conspiracy (TNG episode) Goofy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baldness Equine conformation Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Thermal power station Tenshinhan Gourami Professional wrestling holds Halfbeak Shark Solar power Fish anatomy Betting (poker) EastEnders Yom Kippur War Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Weekly World News Fish farming World Championship Wrestling Shen Gong Wu Glossary of partner dance terms Armoured warfare The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases SS Division (motorised) Wiking Rail terminology Gulf War Waterworld American lobster The Ashlee Simpson Show Frankie Goes to Hollywood Evidence of evolution Miss Saigon Tamil language Eye contact Solar collector Autonomous building Mark I (tank) The Temptations Jodeci French Defence Octopus Cannabis cultivation Rent (musical) Clownfish House of Leaves Water heater Bad Wolf Fantasy (Mariah Carey song) Hydraulic machinery Clown loach Avenue Q Rocket propelled grenade Combine (Half-Life 2) Battle of France Nickname Street-Legal Discus (fish) Warrior (World of Warcraft) Polish September Campaign Missy Elliott Vowel Kakapo Reef tank American Conservatism Lens (optics) Moe Szyslak Ruy Lopez Ra (board game) Kasparov versus The World Parthenogenesis Lifeboat Battle of Mokra Fish Nas (rapper) The Kinks StarCraft: Uprising The Who Clinical depression Tier One The Notorious B.I.G.

is the cycle from ammonia to nitrite to nitrate in a fish tank any different than what happens in a bowl just wondering if the pattern of a spike in ammonia then in nitrite and finally to nitrate happens in a bowl as well as a tank or is there something different about a tank that makes it more dangerous than a bowl if it is very different how can i ensure that my fish is safe without a water test kit he was a rescue fish and it was all i could do to afford the tank my mom insists that all the water testing isnt that necessary that usually goldfish do just fine and just watch him but i dont know if the bowl is large enough and you only do partial water changes you should see the same pattern unfortunately most bowls don't have a large water volume or a filter so you need to do frequent water changes they also don't have much area for gravel and since the gravel and filter media are where the bacteria live you usually never get a full cycle before the tank needs to be cleaned again so except for right after a water change there's almost always ammonia and or nitrite present so it's actually the tank that's safer since there's more area for gravel and you should only need to do partial water changes addition one way you can use to tell if the ammonia or nitrite is getting too high is to watch the behavior of your fish they may begin by gasping for air at the surface of the water even though you provide a filter or aeration in the tank they'll do this all the time not just when you're near the tank and show the same behavior by begging for food they may also sit at the bottom become lethargic and lose their appetite if you see these signs a water change may be in order see these links for assitional signs of ammonia and nitrite poisoning http freshaquarium about com cs disease p ammoniapoison htm http freshaquarium about com cs disease p nitritepoison htm  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Biogeochemical cycle Eutrophication Sodium nitrite Aquarium Hydrogen sulfide Ammonia Fish farming Goldfish Dry cleaning Nitrogen Autonomous building Bong Brewery Water Carburetor Shrimp farm Rebreather Cyanide Sea-Monkey Japanese tea ceremony Nitric acid Motorcycle Nitrogen cycle Curing Dairy Amyl nitrite Fossil fuel power plant E85 Thermal power station Hydrogen economy Agricultural wastewater treatment Airport Sterilization (microbiology) Ocean thermal energy conversion Diving cylinder Bacteria Water purification RuneScape quests Water (molecule) Soil pH Explosive material Ultraviolet Tank Biodiesel Refrigerator Flush toilet Fire fighting Axolotl Carbon dioxide Food preservation Foodborne illness Nitrous oxide Plankton Cocaine Fast bowling Anorexia nervosa Chopsticks Slow sand filter bed Ice core Bayesian inference Hydroponics Cellular respiration CANDU reactor E number Town gas Glacier Nutrient Ecology Glossary of wildland fire terms Koi Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Duesberg hypothesis Swimming Nuclear power Potassium nitrate Electrophysiology Diving Ammonium nitrate Soil life Desert Cannabis cultivation Septic tank Fountain Sun Origin of life Ecco the Dolphin Swimming pool Domestic rabbit Carnivorous plant Polarization Drainage Factory farming Fugu Earth's atmosphere Atlantic herring Nuclear fallout Copper First Battle of the Atlantic

why do i keep killing my fish i have bought gold fish and have killed them all within hours of having them i dont understand what i am doing wrong i let the water set for a day before putting them into the bowl and fed them do you have to put something else in there just to keep the goldfish alive i thought that you could just put them in the bowl no each goldfish all species needs gallons each and will need proper filtration and will grow inches each the bowls are useless for all fish to live in  Aquarium Shark Marine aquarium Whaling American Dad!

do you have to have soil to keep plants alive i have a few plants that are just in the gravel and have been for a few days they seem fine so far how long can they live with no soil no co but a shitload of light no but it will depend on the plant some types should have their roots completely out of the water and some do better as floating plants if you have fish they do respire so they take in oxygen and give off co for your plants they have easy access to water of course and the main minerals plants need nitrate phosphate potassium calcium are supplied by the fish food and water you add to the tank which is one reason it's not good to use distilled water and your fishes' wastes one mineral that's usually in short supply though is iron it helps if you use an aquatic plant fertilizer that contains this to prevent the leaves from yellowing the light is needed for photosynthesis but also for movement of water containing minerals through the plants as photosynthesis occurs and oxygen is given off more water is needed for the process to continue the water is used in the plan's cells and is split into hydrogen and oxygen with the oxygen being released through the leaves and the hydrogen going to carbohydrates or cell structures think of this as water being pulled through the plant to make these or to be released and the water molecules being connected to each other through their chemical bonds as one molecule is used the rest get pulled along which means more water and all the nutrients in it is constantly being pulled absorbed into the root system as long as the lights are on this is what happens  Carnivorous plant Sewage treatment Nutrient Carbon dioxide Soil pH Sulfur Water Biochemistry Rebreather Sulfuric acid Fertilizer Water (molecule) Aluminium Potassium Stoma Phosphorus Nutrition Hydroponics Oxygen Ammonia Leaf Biogeochemical cycle Solar power Cell (biology) Eutrophication Chlorophyta Mineral Alkane Acetic acid Soil life Iron Glucose Hydrogen economy Sugar beet Hydrogen Redox Plant Cyanide Hydrogen sulfide Houseplant Root Ethylene Alcohol fuel Aquarium Thermal power station Fire fighting Enzyme Insulin Fuel cell Carbon dioxide sink Explosive material Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Alcohol Uranium Renewable energy Moon Chemistry Hydrogen peroxide Water purification Signal transduction DNA repair Salt Origin of life Fish farming Chlorophyll Global warming and agriculture Earthworm Phosphate Nitrogen Carbon Titanium Protein Irrigation Corrosion Wetland Bone Brewery Vermicompost Battery (electricity) Biodiesel Hydrochloric acid Compost Eye Carbon cycle Nuclear reactor Sugar E number

goldfish just sitting in bottom corner of his tank new tank new fish any advice weve had our fish for four days and he just got put in his new gallon from a gallon bowl last night when we put him in he immediately set out exploring not swimming fast like he was scared but picking at the rocks and plants and just swimming around this morning he is just sitting in the bottom of the aquarium he could be asleep but its am so i doubt it so my question why might this be he was energetic last night the only thing i can think of is the cats were evidently watching him this morning he was swimming around today before that but they are only kittens and hes never had any bad experiences with cats right now i have his tank covered with a blanket for privacy and have been keeping the cats away dont know if its better to keep the cats away from him or let him get used to them s thanks for any advice i have a lid and have conditioned the water what gets me is that he was not acting the least bit stressed when he got in there even while we were floating him it just looked like he wanted to get out and explore his new home which is just what he did i know fish are hard to read but i swear he was not scared he was excited and he spent a couple of hours swimming around before we turned out his light so it just seems odd that today he doesnt want to swim around yet but maybe he was up all night exploring and is resting now who knows right now his light is on in his tank so he can tell that its day time in no uncertain terms our living room is kinda dark and he has a blanket over his tank so he isnt distracted it occured to me that maybe last night with his light on he couldnt see what was outside his tank well and now that he can he is being more timid what do you think oh and his water is right around degrees we didnt have time to cycle for days or weeks but we did the cycling of the filter and prepped the water floated his bag and added tank water gradually to the floating bag over the course of like min to let him adjust to any change in ph we couldnt cycle the tank for a long time cuz he was a rescue fish and was in a gauranteed more toxic bowl than the tank thought that might be useful info you seem to have done a good job of acclimating your new fish to the new tank fish will often show different behavior when put into a new environment whether it be excitement or just trying to find out where the nearest cover is in case there's a predator they don't see and the period of inactivity may be just as natural while they get used to a new water chemistry and activity going on around them or staying immobile so the cats don't attack he's probably never seen one before so doesn't know if these might be a predator you don't need to worry about your fish being up all night exploring becasue once the lights go out goldfish will rest they aren't like some catfish or others which are more active nocturnally i would keep the tank uncovered and let him get used to the cats if you keep a cover over the tank and there's no light underneath his day night cycle will be thrown off if there is a light the blanket may trap too much heat goldfish prefer cooler water if your fish is large enough it may have produced enough ammonia in the tank that this is starting to affect him you also want to make sure you aren't overfeeding him only give him the amount of flakes or pellets that he can eat in minutes twice a day if there's any extra food after the minutes are up you should remove it with your net as uneaten food decomposes it also produces ammonia plus you will be wasting the food and you'll need to clean the tank more often for their health it's best if you vary his diet a little goldfish especially yours since it's a deep bodied type which are prone to problems with constipation and swim bladder disorder should get plenty of fiber in their diets you can give him some cooked green peas with the skins removed dark leafy lettuce or slices of zucchini or cucumber shredded carrot or small sections of oranges the vegetables should be cooked slightly or frozen then thawed so the plant cell walls break down and are easier for him to eat so whenever you have any of these for yourself consider sharing a little with your fish also see the article below  Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Hamster Cat Sewage treatment Domestic rabbit

safe aquarium rocks and how to test hi i was wondering if the rocks that i have been getting from the bank and bottom of my creek is safe for an aquarium i am planning on using them for cave making in my g some are thin and flat round thick and square is there any way to accurately test them thanks in advance there are a few tests you can do first you should get them cleaned up so it's the rocks that you'll be testing not anything growing on them put them in some hot water and scrub them a little with an old toothbrush or something similar then let them air dry once they're dry put a few drops of vineger on them and see if they fizz and produce bubbles if so these have carbonates in them and they'll raise your ph these wouldn't be good to use unless you have cichlids that need higher ph water rinse the vinegar off then put them into a clean container of water for about a week after the time is up look to see if there's an oily film on the water if you can it's also a good idea to test the ph of the water they were in a pet store can also do this and compare this to the ph of the water source if the ph of the water the rocks were in in below and your water shource isn't you don't want these in your tank some sandstones contain small amounts of pyrite fool's gold and this will make your water too acidic other than the rocks you've eliminated with the above tests they should be okay to use  Carbon dioxide Brewery Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Hamster Nuclear power Polyethylene terephthalate Bread Sugar beet Bong Aquarium Energy development Origin of life Tooth Textile manufacturing Acetic acid Vinegar Cookware and bakeware Sento Discus (fish) M16 (rifle) Death Valley National Park Drill bit Wok Poker jargon Casting Sulfuric acid Pebble bed reactor Japanese tea ceremony Renewable energy Thermal power station Heinkel He 100 Internal ballistics B-47 Stratojet Ice core Opportunity rover Knife Tofu Anchor Dairy Mineral Sulfur Dishwasher Goldfish Solar power Fire extinguisher Glacier Diving suit Welding Zambezi Flat tax Porosity Rebreather Nuclear weapon design Menstrual cup Pyrite Biodiesel Four square Tilapia Plastic Ramen Mattress E85 Flood geology Desert Water (molecule) Omega-3 fatty acid Jellyfish Hydroponics Survival skills Geology of the Grand Canyon area Gilding Autonomous building Cheese RuneScape skills Novelty (locomotive) Carbon nanotube Automobile emissions control Gas metal arc welding Campfire Hemp Dialysis Heinkel He 112 Motor oil Carbon dioxide sink Oscilloscope Wine making Tuff Halitosis Carlsbad Caverns National Park Delaware Basin Scuba set Hydrogen economy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sedimentary rock Flax Compiler optimization Glossary of firefighting equipment Billboard Hot 100

when changing water can i use settled water does the water i add in my tank has to be treated with conditioner what if the water is settled to answer this correctly you'd have to contact your water company to find out what's used to treat the water if they use chlorine this will go away if you let the water sit out for hours since it doesn't last very long more water companies are switching to chloramine which is a combination of the chlorine and ammonia molecules if this is what's used you need to treat this with a conditioner which is made specifically to remove or neutralize chloramine if you use one that's just for chlorine or one that only says that it breaks the chloramine bond you'll be releasing ammonia toxic to fish into the tank  Sewage treatment Ammonia Water purification Sodium hypochlorite Chlorine Haloalkane Biochemistry Hydrogen chloride Chlorination Bleach Brewery Hydrogen peroxide Polychlorinated biphenyl Hydrogen Air conditioning Water (molecule) Alternative biochemistry Hydrogen economy Marine aquarium Titanium Halomethane Alkane Carbon dioxide Ozone depletion Hydrochloric acid Ethylene Ozone hole Refrigerator E85 Rocket fuel Swimming pool Aldehyde Poison Aquarium Sea-Monkey Rebreather Escherichia coli O157:H7 Alcohol Swimming Chemistry Corrosion Ammonium nitrate Protein Disinfection Wood pulp Fossil fuel power plant Natural gas Chocolate Gas mask Base (chemistry) Water Insulin Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Alum Mustard gas Heat Acetic acid Cocaine Menstrual cup Aluminium Formic acid Myxobolus cerebralis Iron(III) chloride Ozone layer Phosphine Explosive material Helicobacter pylori Electrochemistry Ammonium Phosphorus chlorides Alkyl Methanol Fire fighting Fountain Smoke-screen Hydrogen bond Dry cleaning Sterilization (microbiology) Embalming Refrigerant Omega-3 fatty acid Amine Maser Sulfuric acid Giant squid Sucralose Triclosan Intermolecular force Diving Cellular respiration Cracking (chemistry) Residual-current device Ultraviolet USS Tunny (SS-282) Acne Switch SAT Protein sequencing

male and female betta i just bought a male and am thinking of putting in a female as well as i'm told that males are only aggressive against other males however the woman at the aquarium store told me that if there is only one female then they probably won't mate and i don't want them to is this true don't believe what you hear in stores although technically what you were told is true if you put a male and female together when they're not prepared to mate there's a good chance one will kill the other and females are just as likely to kill males they need to be conditioned for spawning before they should be put together and after the eggs are laid the female has to be removed from the tank males will fish with males or with females if you want to keep multiple bettas in a tank you can keep females together as long as you have at least gallons of water per fish so they aren't overcrowed you have at least females although would be better you introduce them at the same time or at least the first three and any following in groups of amd you give them plants or other hiding spots females are somewhat aggressive but not as much as males usually they will develop a pecking order among themselves but once this is established most will only flare or nip if if another female gets out of line there is an occasional female that can't be kept with others so you should monitor their interactions for the first week or so  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Clownfish Discus (fish) Kakapo American lobster Goldfish Marine aquarium Platypus Social rule Tarantula Fugu Tilapia Dwarf gourami Chicken Ostrich Hermaphrodite Parthenogenesis Spider Orca Bird Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual reproduction Sex Poker jargon God Emperor of Dune Leatherback Sea Turtle Mountain Gorilla Bottlenose Dolphin Sea-Monkey Halfbeak Reef tank Dragons (Pern) Lodge Committee AMD Life in the Freezer Sexual dimorphism Non-human animal sexuality Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Live-bearing aquarium fish Zebra Danio Frog Danio Windows XP RuneScape skills Camel Fish farming Aphid Lion House Mouse Polygyny Grunion Dairy Ammunition Red Squirrel Nerpa The Dalek Invasion of Earth Ocean's Twelve Chess strategy and tactics Gar Swinging Combine (Half-Life 2) Sexual selection Shaggy dog story Rail terminology Aye-aye USS Amberjack (SS-219) Ruy Lopez Ra (board game) Infertility Tenshinhan Monogamy Nile crocodile Great White Shark Anopheles RuneScape Random Events Pysanka Animal communication Seabird Paper wasp Shark Big Brother (USA TV series) Final Fantasy magic Fossil fuel power plant Kiwi Seahorse Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Yusuf al-Qaradawi In vitro fertilisation X86 assembly language Cruising (maritime) StarCraft: Uprising Baboon Fish Anglerfish Jennifer Lopez Clown loach Rei Ayanami Mark I (tank)

ammonia just recently got a gal tank my bf has previously owned fish and said we had to have the tank running for at least weeks before we got fish it was running for about days and he said it should be ok so we picked up german blue rams swordtail koi bala sharks danios and sucker fish i cannot remember the specific name on those well the fish were doing ok for the first couple of days tomorrow will be week since we have had them but he said it was looking like they had ick we started treating the water with some tablets from petsmart and it wasn't helping last night he did a test on the water and said the ammonia is at i'm almost positive he said i know this is really bad this morning one blue ram and koi were dead are the rest of my fish going to die as well and how do i get the ammonia down is there anything i can do to save my other fish you need to do a partial water change asap i'll write more later but you need to start on this when you add the new water try to get it as close in temperature to what's in the tank now and remember to add the dechlorinator your tank has way too many fish at the moment the fish produce wastes including ammonia which is toxic to them in relatively small amounts the more fish or larger they are the more ammonia that's produced in an established tank there are bacteria that will convert the ammonia to nitrite also toxic then to nitrate but in a new tank you don't have any of the bacteria yet and it will take weeks to get it established until then you should only have hardy fish in the tank you also have fish that aren't a good mix rams are very sensitive to water quality so that's why they were among the first to die bala sharks will grow to inches and require a lot more space than a gallon to keep i think the swordtail koi you're talking about are swordtails with orange and white coloring not actual koi which get to around feet long so these would be okay but like to have a little salt added to their water about tablespoon per gallons danios are schooling fish and should be in larger groups the suckers could be plecostomous will get if the common pleco but there are varieties like rubbernose and bristlenose that only get to around you might be able to keep one pleco in the tank but the adults are territorial so you should only have one if it's an otocinclus these are small only about inches as an adult but should be in groups of they're also sensitive to water quality and shouldn't be added for about months after starting your tank if these are chinese algae eaters these will grow to around and only eat algae as juveniles as adults they're aggressive and they eat the slime coat off other fish in the tank leaving them open to infections or killing them from the stress imo these shouldn't be in any tank for now i would recommend returning any survivors other than the danios you'll probably need another water change tomorrow and changes for the next few days until you can get the ammonia level under is where fish begin to be stressed keep these in the tank to provide the ammonia for the bacteria to establish once the water tests show zero ammonia and nitrites you can add fish per week until you have the tank stocked again please read the following links http freshaquarium about com cs disease p ammoniapoison htm http www fishlore com nitrogencycle htm http www fishlore com cloudywater htm  Sewage treatment Fish farming Eutrophication Hydrogen economy Danio Biodiesel Ammonia Shark Sea-Monkey Aquarium Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Goldfish Koi Biogeochemical cycle Nitrogen Bacteria Water purification Autonomous building Hamster Pneumonia Zebra Danio Axolotl Nutrient Hydrogen sulfide Bread Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Brewery Foodborne illness Carbon dioxide Ecology Tocopherol Halitosis Fish E85 Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Acne Agriculture Dairy Lake Explosive material Rebreather Fossil fuel power plant Helicobacter pylori Carp Houseplant Photosynthesis Dog Duesberg hypothesis Urea Hypoglycemia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Livestock Biochemistry Dead Sea Terraforming HIV test Sake Food preservation Aluminium Guinea pig Fancy rat Refrigerator Iron Urinary incontinence Omega-3 fatty acid Hydroponics USS Tunny (SS-282) Cat Nutrition Lake Burley Griffin Orca Disinfection Veganism Gasoline Spacecraft propulsion Chinook salmon Great White Shark Thermal power station Water Milk Fire fighting Folic acid Beer

breeding guppies what do i need to know about breeding guppies such as water changes and temp and other stuff is there such thing as having to much gravel in tour tank my tank is gallons also does any one how much baking soad is needed to raise the ph you will not need to raise the ph if your using tap water and water conditioner guppies will breed very easily but it is what you do that will determine the result of the fry for breeding if your serious you will need to get a spare gallon with a ton of live plants get a group of males and female guppies add them to the gallon and allow them to do there thing female livebearers have the ablity to store sperm so unless you petstore and wholesaler seperate the sexes when you get a female from a petstore chancs are that it is pregnant so even if your males die you will not need to go and get another male as the females can store sperm and drop fry for about times without a male anyway female livebearers are on cycles they will usually release fry every days but it will vary from fish to fish when you see the female is hiding for cover swimming with its tail alittle down and starting to wiggle that usually when you move the fish to the gallon and allow her to release her fry in there then you can move her back into the main tank but put her in a breeding trap for a day to recover remember that adding stress will cause the fish not to release her fry when you have fry in the gallon they dont require much but you will need a sponge filter what changes i do by hand with a cup and a spyhon but very slow and carefully they will eat hikari first bites but remember not to feed them too much  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Live-bearing aquarium fish Goldfish Fish farming Marine aquarium Tilapia American lobster Aquarium Sexual reproduction Clownfish Domesticated turkey Brewery Salmon Spider Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Parthenogenesis Carbon dioxide Biodiesel Fossil fuel power plant Dairy Halfbeak Sewage treatment Chicken Fugu Tank Bread Tlingit Hamster E85 Dry cleaning Kakapo Thermal power station Hydrogen economy Tofu Leatherback Sea Turtle Fire fighting Mosquito Fishing Menstrual cycle Myxobolus cerebralis Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina French fries Sea-Monkey Solar power Water purification Platypus Infertility Water Internal ballistics Sponge Shrimp farm Equine conformation Dwarf gourami Autonomous building Pok__mon Abilities Cannabis cultivation Stereoscopy Coffee RuneScape Mini-Games Bladderwort Ocean thermal energy conversion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breaststroke Domestic rabbit Krill Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sperm Whale Alcohol fuel Squirrel Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Animal Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Concrete Fertility awareness Triathlon Birth control Pocket cruiser Agriculture Saturn V IAR 80 Species USS Yorktown (CV-5) Mark I (tank) Glossary of firefighting terms Swimming pool Rugby union Gar House Mouse 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Sailfin Molly Have I Got News For You P-47 Thunderbolt Environmental vegetarianism

what kinds of plants can i put in my reef tank to lower nitrates and phosphates i would agree with the caulerpa and needing to prune it if you don't it will take over your tank some states may not allow all types of caulerpa because of it having been found in coastal waters where it's not native but is competing with native plants another choice is chaetomorpha which is a good phosphate absorber if you don't want to put the algae into your tank if you can find an old aquaclear filter and a decent light you can make a mini algae scrubber refugium yourself that hangs on the tank and your water circulates through it http www wetwebmedia com hagenrefugart htm even these plus water changes may not be enough if your source water contains nitrate and or phosphate you can use reverse osmosis water available at target and super walmart stores which has neither or get a phosphate removal pad you can cut to fit your filter  Marine aquarium Water purification Sewage treatment Fish farming Rebreather Fossil fuel power plant Carnivorous plant Eutrophication Solar power Ammonium nitrate Aquarium Photosynthesis Biodiesel Nutrient Coral reef Sulfuric acid Algae Reef tank Uranium Dialysis Brewery Water Plankton Desert Solar panel Irrigation Water resources Reverse osmosis Scuba set Phosphate Soil pH Pruning fruit trees Tank landing ship Turquoise Fire fighting Autonomous building Common Unix Printing System Ecology Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tobacco Plant Charcoal Tank Air conditioning Cannabis cultivation Cell (biology) Sugarcane Carbon dioxide Ice core Nauru Thermal power station Shrimp farm Mattress GunBound Fertilizer Mineral Ocean thermal energy conversion Acid rain Veganism NEWater Sugar Motor oil Nuclear power Sulfur Hydrogen economy Discus (fish) Coffee Osmosis Diatomaceous earth Hydroponics Green Revolution Nephron Biochemistry Coral Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Phosphorus cycle Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Ammonia Scrubber Cruising (maritime) Stoma Town gas Battle of Tarawa Biogeochemical cycle Water (molecule) Fume hood Vacuole Nuclear fuel cycle Rum Filter (optics) Light pollution Sugar beet Fusion power Internal ballistics Beer Introduced species Kidney Cross site scripting

green fern in tank we have a tropical tank with no live plants in but there is something growing on the ornaments like a green fern plant it grows quickly and spreads any ideas what it is and how to get rid of it thanks the fern like appearance is a give away that's often called black beard algae and is very difficult to get rid of in a tank the best option is to remove all items it is growing on and treat them in a weak bleach solution then scrub the items well under running water to remove any remaining algae and to wash away the bleach then allow them to dry well before returning them to the tank event his is no guarantee of completely removing the algae from your tank but it will remove the majority and with several such cleanings you may be able to eliminate it entirely algae killing chemicals will possibly kill it but not entirely and it will certainly come back futher they are harmful to the tank and will in the long run only make matters worse please avoid them entirely mm  Water purification Plant Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Coral reef Biodiesel Dishwasher Polar Bear Dishwashing Textile manufacturing Sugarcane Wood pulp Menstrual cup Devonian Disinfection Carbon dioxide Fern Photosynthesis Embryophyte Sea-Monkey Fossil fuel power plant Chlorophyta Washing machine Sodium hypochlorite Sugar beet Eutrophication Hydroponics Reef tank Fish farming Irrigation Ecology Geology of the Grand Canyon area Hydrogen peroxide Hamster Houseplant Chinook salmon Sterilization (microbiology) Brewery Alternation of generations Bong Weed control Kryptonite Thermal power station Gilding Shrimp farm Film developing Dairy Coffee Black pepper Gaia theory (science) Agriculture Snowball Earth Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Coral Leaf Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nutrient Dry cleaning Diaper Gypsy moth Cyanide Ricin Comfrey Autonomous building Mach kernel Jute Hemp Gal__pagos Islands Green alga Marine biology Aquarium STS-114 Final Fantasy XI Bhopal disaster Extinction Chlorine Single Transferable Vote Kissing gourami Mosquito fern Lake Renewable energy Epiphyte The Legend of Zelda series races Lichen Water garden Coir Hydrogen economy Organic peroxide Cannabis cultivation Ozone Cyanobacteria Sugar Flue gas desulfurization Biological warfare Algal bloom Carnivorous plant Florida Keys StarCraft: Uprising Terraforming

help with breeding betta's please right at the moment i have a male betta females are on their way and i should have them by the end of next week i have spare bowls that i think they could breed in one is litres and one is litres i want to know how to tell when they are ready to breed the best way to set the tanks up which tank size is best and how many females to put in with the male ps both tanks are without heaters or filters would adding a swan mussel in there help as i wont use filters i'm afraid your idea will not work you are going to need considerably more tank space than you currently have available as well as sponge filters and heaters for the breeding tanks i have been breeding bettas for over years and this is how i do it breeding tank a gallon makes a good breeding tank for bettas place in on a dark surface and set it up with no gravel or decorations use a small sponge filter and a heater maintain the heat at the temperature is not really that critical using a hood is a good idea to hold in heat and moisture conditioning condition the male in the breeding tank condition the female in a separate tank and be sure they cannot see each other feed well on frozen or live foods alternating with flakes or pellets for at least a week the female should be plump with eggs and the male should be flaring and showing his best color maybe even building a bubble nest spawning drop the water level in the breeding tank to about deep place the female in a bowl or other container next to the breeding tank so that the male can see her as soon as there is a good bubble nest in the breeding tank add the female check for eggs in the bubble nest every few hours you know they are finished when the female is hiding from the male and he no longer leaves the nest to chase her down he will also not be trying to attract her to the nest at this time remove the female from the breeding tank if they fail to breed within a few hours go back and repeat the conditioning steps for a week eggs and fry the eggs will hatch in days at first the male will collect the babies and return them to the bubble nest this is normal once you see that the babes are able to swim in a normal fashion remove the male now is the time to start feeding the babies feed them newly hatched brine shrimp micro worms or vinegar eels feed several times a day for the first week to days at that time you can start adding some powdered flake food to their diet and begin increasing the water level in the tank care the babies need very clean water do a or more water change every day and be sure to remove any uneaten food or dead babies that you see keeping the water clean and changed very often is one of the major keys to success be sure you cull the brood culling is to remove unwanted fish remove any deformed fish right away and destroy them rearing and selection eventually you will need to split the batch as they will over crowd the gallon removing the females to another tank is the best way the males can stay together without a problem continue to feed quality foods of increasing size working your way up to frozen or adult brine shrimp and continue to do large daily water changes once they begin to develop color you should cull based on color keep the color you like and remove the rest even if you started with two reds you will get a few that are not red or are not

guppies in gallon hi i have a gallon that i posted on criagslist com that i was looking for some community fish for it i have got responses for guppies though the guppies are too young to identify the sex yet they said so my question is how many guppies can i put in there it has gallon filtration and we would like to have a few other fish with them like panda cories and a bristlenose pleco or otocinclus the tank has been running for over a year we recently rehomed some goldfish that were in it to add on to my question should i only get males or can i do a mixture i don't want to overpopulate it also how old do guppies need to be before you can sex them thanks by the way the tank has a heater and the water stays around f if i get both males and females were the tank over populate also i was thinking of instead of the pleco and the ottos get female balloon sailfin mollies you are completely right blue if you get several males and females eventually some of the fry will live and sooner or later youwill have tons of guppies in the tank unless of course you have no hiding places and plenty of adult fish in the tank then you may not have that problem if you don t want fry the best choice is all males no chance at all of any fry that way usually you can sex guppies by the time they are weeks old but it can take a little longer to be positive of the sex you can usually tell them apart a week or two before they can actually breed so if you want a batch of young very carefully you can remove the one's that look like males asap and not have fry in the tank then once they are older swap the males hback to the tank after removing the females as for how many in the tank easily mm  Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Brewery Condom Abortion debate Tilapia Sailfin Molly Gasoline Fish farming Pocket cruiser Mark I (tank) Anal sex Wine making Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cruising (maritime) Alcohol fuel Stock car (rail) Intersex surgery Age of consent Reef tank Live-bearing aquarium fish IAR 80 Gender role Guppy Extreme Programming Demographics of the United States French fries Clownfish Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Hydrogen economy Tofu E85 Parthenogenesis Dwarf gourami Sexual selection Fishing Sex assignment Refrigerator car Rum Cessna T-37 Intelligent design movement Vickers Valiant Platypus Biology and sexual orientation Koi Homebrewing Gender-neutral language Nerpa Homosexuality and transgender Biodiesel Fish and chips History of intersex surgery Sexual reproduction Social rule Autonomous building Honey Sauna Fugu Kakapo British Rail Class 42 Gay slang Have I Got News For You The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Bread Tank Milk Samuel Goldwyn Burma Campaign Water heater Fossil fuel power plant Nuclear power Bob and George P-38 Lightning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston song) Mercury Atlas 6 History of nuclear weapons Hard water USS Yorktown (CV-5) Transgender Gar Bacon Intelligent design Orgasm Seabird Wheel of Fortune Sexual intercourse Shrimp farm Boeing 747 Tarantula Red Squirrel Concrete Gender identity Short Sunderland Pornographic actor

my pond fish are eating ants that fall in is that healthy if you have goldfish and or koi it's not a problem at all both of those types of fish are omnivirious that means they eat plants and animals i have a pond with koi and goldfish the koi actively hunt insects and the bigger koi the inchers eat anything that land during the day i've seen them eat ants japanese beetles a favorite mosquitos mosquito larvae anything that lands on the water is fair game though i haven't seen them eat a hornet or wasp yet we've had a drought around here and i see hornets and wasps land on the edge rocks and plants all the time to take a drink i imagine if they do grab a hornet they'd get stung before they would be able to crush it with their chewing plates remember koi and goldfish both have bony type plates further down their gullets that they use to break down pellets and bugs that's why when they eat pellets you'll see them gobble some then take a break below while they stand still making chewing motions i have cannas around my pond and japanese beetles love to eat them each afternoon i'll go out and catch the japanese beetles and throw them hard at the water so they can't fly off the koi will fight over them at night i have lights around the pond the low voltage kind and also the low voltage spotlights i've gone out quietly and i've spotted the koi and only the koi swimming skimming the surface actively hunting the surface for any bugs that land on the water so don't worry about ants your fish are meant to eat bugs it's adds protein to their diet it's also gives them fun the fun of the chase good luck with your pond you can see some photos of mine on my site http yahoo com kenrnoto ken  Goldfish Beetle Koi Mosquito Insect Biological pest control Spider Poker jargon Animal Crossing Water garden Hornet Happy Tree Friends Gypsy moth Garfield Fauna of Australia Bee Pikmin Camp Lazlo Aerial (dance move) Frog Ant Shrimp farm Domestic rabbit Wasp Evidence of evolution Fish farming Shaggy dog story Sewage treatment Coconut crab USS Wasp (CV-18) USS Thresher (SS-200) Tooth USS Yorktown (CV-5) Carnivorous plant Diving Paper wasp USS Wasp (CV-7) Dairy Magikarp The Fairly OddParents Game show STS-59 Animal Veganism Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Conker's Bad Fur Day Pok__mon types Humphrey Bogart Vegetarianism Discus (fish) Taboo food and drink Honeybee USS Enterprise (CV-6) Wrigley Field Gar The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Hamster USS Tunny (SS-282) Naval mine USS Wahoo (SS-238) Timon and Pumbaa Shadow Warrior Fancy rat Diseases of the honeybee Asian tiger mosquito Pond Parachuting Ecology USS Washington (BB-56) World Series Japanese tea ceremony RuneScape economy Ramen Battle of the Philippine Sea Caterpillar Bladderwort Acorn Jellyfish Hematophagy Roman eating and drinking Ecco the Dolphin USS Anderson (DD-411) Carp Chopsticks Ladybird Tea Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an FLCL GunZ The Duel

water change can somone tell me exactly what happens to the water and chemistry in the water if a tank does not have it's water changed for about six weeks or longer how does it affect the beneficial bacteria already in the tank does it make them stronger or kill them ditto to sir ghapy he's got the ba here i just want to suppliment one thing on his outstanding analysis in addition to the ph shifts and the lack of minerals from not having routine water changes you also are going to have extremely high nitrate built up assuming your tank is cycled out properly your beneficial bacteria should stay the same the bacteria all needs surface area to grow on and the substate usually gravel sometimes sand can house some but the majority of it will reside in your filter media i cannot think of anyone that has a home tank with actual dirt in it so analyzing this from that prespective wouldn't yield as good results though ponds and rivers that prespective is right on plants do not directly influence your ammonia levels but rather nitrate consumption as this is part of most fertilizers and an excellent fuel source to assist them in photosynthesis planted tanks are great because not only do plants help consume some of the nitrates it also puts oxygen back in in order to employ plants as a nitrate control measure though you'd have to have so many plants in there you'd probably not be able to even see your fish what will happen if you do not change water at that rate is you are going to have a massive nitrate build up again assuming your tank is properly cycled to begin with and like sir ghapy said the ph is going to begin to lower due to the compounds left in that tank decomposing nitrate when going above ppm begins to effect the fish's overall immune system and leaves them much weaker and susceptible to disease i am not sure why someone would let a tank sit like that for six weeks i feel bad if i let mine go for ten days and don't change i don't see this killing your beneficial bacteria it may cause your water to become cloudy as it would trigger a growth but no place to grow if your surface area is already occupied to capacity and those high nitrates in addtion to damaging your fish's immune systems would be a haven for an algea infestation jv  Fish farming Explosive material Carnivorous plant Carbon dioxide Marine aquarium Eutrophication Soil pH Photosynthesis Bacteria Ammonium nitrate Ecology Global warming and agriculture Water purification Desert Chlorophyta Alkane Biodiesel Hydroponics Nitrogen cycle Hydrogen sulfide Water Energy development Ozone depletion Biogeochemical cycle Future energy development Shrimp farm Soil life Renewable energy Ultraviolet Organic farming Solar power Motorcycle Sulfuric acid Tooth Deforestation Water (molecule) Cyanide Microeconomics Soil Immune system 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Milk Psoriasis Environmental concerns with electricity generation Tooth enamel Cannabis cultivation Fertilizer Aluminium Dead Sea Tobacco Autonomous building Free trade Foodborne illness Nuclear power Weight training Houseplant Zerg Ice core Effects of global warming Protein Gasoline Anorexia nervosa Sulfur Methamphetamine Titanium Compost Uranium Fossil fuel power plant Omega-3 fatty acid Economy of the People's Republic of China Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Rebreather Ocean thermal energy conversion Chlorine Tide Acetic acid Drowning Sun Coronary heart disease Green Revolution Thermal power station Manitoba Hydro Coral reef Inflation DNA repair Salton Sea Insulin Climate change

how do you get rid off blue green algue from my fish tank i have a four foot tank with good air good filtration and the lighting is right but i just carnt get rid of the blue green algue ok assuming that the tank was allowed to age before the fish were introduced then your problem more that likely is overfeeding and or insufficient water changes the fish should only be fed once a day and only what they will eat in two to three minutes if food falls to the bottom then it is to much as for the water changes you should change weekly preferably with a shiphon tube that you stick into the gravel so that you can remove the mulem uneaten food and fish excrement that collects on the bottom speaking of the bottom of the tank you should have about two inches of gravel and sand so that the biological filter will have enough room to grow important organisms to convert no to no the filter system that you have would idealy turn the tank over twice in one hour ie gal tank gal per hour pump i know that this sounds like alot but it really is not just remember not to feed to much and change the water oh yes one last thing if your tank receives natural light then try to move it from the light source as it will give you fits with alage a healthy tank with strong fish can be left up to two weeks with out food or water changes when you are on vacation i hope this helps i have worked in breeding shops for many years  Sewage treatment Aquarium Marine aquarium Brewery Fish farming Thermal power station Discus (fish) Goldfish Water purification Bong Hamster Antarctic krill Irrigation Fossil fuel power plant Cannabis cultivation Fugu Dairy Refrigerator Solar power Shark Space Shuttle external tank Carbon dioxide Reef tank Coffee Fume hood Breastfeeding USS Tunny (SS-282) Dry cleaning Hydroponics Kidney Autonomous building Apollo Command/Service Module Koi Axolotl Seabird Insulin Sea star Fancy rat Flush toilet Tank Domestic rabbit Domesticated turkey Stock car (rail) Fluorescent lamp Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma American lobster Omega-3 fatty acid Chinook salmon USS Vestal (AR-4) Ecology Salmon Novelty (locomotive) Hydrogen economy Light-emitting diode Tofu Stomach cancer Dialysis Motorcycle Carburetor Whaling Sears Holdings Corporation Drainage Biodiesel Cat Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Water pollution Sugar E85 Tooth Livestock Vermicompost Honey Tilapia Cantonese cuisine Chicken Water supply Krill Nuclear fallout Dredge Photosynthesis USS Thresher (SS-200) Textile manufacturing Veganism Atlantic herring Equine conformation Myxobolus cerebralis Airport M16 (rifle) Wave power Slow sand filter bed USS Trigger (SS-237) Mnemonic Albatross Roman eating and drinking

how do you tranfer goldfish into a new tank i have goldfishes since they were very little and now they are really big so i m thinking of switching and tranferrinmg them into a newer bigger tank however i ve heard that if you tranfer them like normally they end up dying and stuff can someone tell me how to tranfer my goldfishes i think it's great that you're making a new home for your goldfishes that have outgrown their old home for the bigger tank have you set it all up yet if you haven't you should use some of the items in your old tank to help set up your new tank what kind of filter system are you going to use undergravel or above gravel everyone has their own preferences but for me i prefer undergravel i believe they set up the biological cyle much better now if you do have an undergravel filter set it up in the new tank put in a few gallons of dechlorinated water dechlorinate the water before adding anything that's highly important you do not want to kill any of the good bacteria you add then you can take some of your gravel from your existing tank and put it in your new tank keep it wet though you want to maintain the bacteria colonies that are present on the gravel that will give you a headstart on setting up the bio cycle in the new tank then you can put your new gravel on top of the old gravel but remember to rinse the new gravel a couple of times until the water runs clear before putting it in the new tank once the gravel is in then you can add new decorations and also any old decorations from your existing tank and don't clean your old decorations unless they are really heavily covered in algae why there'll be good bacteria on them too and you want to transfer that to the new tank also now if they have a lot of algae on them just wipe it off with a clean paper towel don't use any cleaners with it just use the paper towel and your fingers hand that's all the good bacteria will remain in the nooks and crannies and cracks then you can move in your airstones and whatever else you have now the new tank should be about half full with water right because you added water earlier the next step is to add a couple of gallons of water from the existing tank why that water is what the goldfish are used to living in it has all the minerals bacteria protozoans phytoplanton algae etc and with a lower water level it will be much easier to catch the goldfish goldfish can be fast check the temperature of the new tank it should be within degrees of the old tank if not you can wait a bit while the new tank water adjust to the room temperature or you can add some hot or cold water dechlorinated to hasten the process while your waiting for the new tank's water to get closer to the old tank's water in temperature you can fill a large pail or a couple of pails with water you'll need to fill the rest of the new tank remember you'll need to dechlorinate this water too if you have city water if you have a private well you shouldn't have to dechlorinate because your water should not have chlorine in it like mine oh when you fill these buckets don't do all cold water nor all hot water mix it up so the water coming out of your faucet is as close to room temperature as possible getting the water ready now will save you time later when you want to fill the rest of the tank next catch the goldfish one at a time putting them in a one gallon baggie filled with a few inches of water the water level should be enough to cover them not enough so they can swim around why they are only going to be in the bag for a short time only until the water temp in the bag adjusts to the water temp of the tank it will be faster this way keep the baggies open with the tops upwards and monitor the bags and fish to make sure the fish don't get too stressed after about minutes you can began letting them go into the new tank water and all remeber this water came from their old tank it's safe for them then slowly fill the new tank to top it off start your filters and airstone put your light and cover on sit back and enjoy watching your goldfish explore their new tank and they will enjoy it btw how big are your goldfish now this past march i placed twelve inch goldfish in my new pond built last oct nov it was still cold and the goldfish immediately hid in the rocks they only came out when it warmed up they initially grew kind of fast growing quickly to inches they spawned and had babies that survived now the goldfish are about to inches in length and i have about babies that are about inches to inches in length i think i have some photos on my website along with my koi my koi grew fast started with three inch ones in april now they're to each amazing http yahoo com kenrnoto ken  Sento Marine aquarium Goldfish

question about cycling i just asked a question a bit ago about fish recommendation and really started reading up on some of the answers thank you all by the way my goodness i didn't realize how complicated this could be p so here is my setup i have a gallon tank with a lid and light for heat i also have a filter thermometer ornament with a small pump for bubbles i also have gravel i filled the tank and used a packet of tetra brand water conditioner that is supposed to make my tank suitable for freshwater fish what do i need to check before adding my or little fish for cycling what should the temperature be how long do i need to keep the fish in my tank to cycle it before adding a third tiny little fish the tank is currently on with the filter running and bubble thingy going how long does it need to be doing this before i can add fish thanks in advance that second answer is a great example of why fishless cycling is recommended you are killing fish when you cycle with them and not killing them quickly either why that's okay with some people i can't understand look up fishless cycle and see if that's something you're willing to do it requires testing your water parameters regularly but it doesn't require water changes and it doesn't require torturing any fish as a bonus fishless cycling is quicker and more efficient than cycling with fish in a tiny gallon it shouldn't take longer than a couple of weeks  Brewery Marine aquarium Aquarium E85 Sea-Monkey Reef tank Fish farming Thermal power station Autonomous building Carburetor Jet engine Goldfish Air conditioning Sewage treatment Hydrogen economy Extreme Programming Hydroponics Biodiesel Theory of conduct Motor oil Fusion power Diesel engine Fossil fuel power plant CPU design Swimming pool Temperature Dry cleaning Portable stove Coffee Nuclear reactor Hardware random number generator USS Tunny (SS-282) God Emperor of Dune Stirling engine Fountain Ocean thermal energy conversion Spacecraft propulsion Polymerase chain reaction Thermostat Immortality Motorcycle Nuclear power Turbocharger Dialysis Expert system Nuclear thermal rocket Welding Tire Tea Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) STS-59 GunBound Solar power Hydraulic machinery Fire fighting Houseplant Loudspeaker Drill bit Three Mile Island Cannabis cultivation Toyota Prius Alcohol fuel Renewable energy Flood geology Transformer Sterilization (microbiology) Electrophysiology Sonoluminescence Discus (fish) StarCraft: Uprising Quizbowl Marathon (sport) STS-62 Hard disk Beer Gas turbine Magnetic core memory Bubble Bobble Soap bubble Wind turbine Kitchen Watercooling Heinkel He 100 Password PID controller Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Heartworm Water purification Tidal power Microeconomics Hash table Compiler optimization Axolotl Lighting MS-06 Zaku II Apollo 13

fish recommendations for a gallon tank i just bought a gallon tank i assembled it this evening added the rocks an ornament the filter and a small pump for bubbles it looks lovely enough and i'd love to keep it just like this but alas we bought it for fish haha can you tell i'm not a fish person i have young children which is why i bought the tank for them i know i likely can only buy one or two fish with such a small tank but i was curious what exactly i should buy to put in there i am admittedly not great with fish several years ago i remember buying betas because they were pretty but one killed all the others but this time im hoping will be different i am hoping to buy hopefully two low maintenance fish recommendations please a betta is very easy to take care of but you must not put more than two of them in the same tank this is one of the most fundamental rules about betta keeping without meaning to offend i do suggest you research the breed of fish you want to keep before buying one before you bite off more than you can chew too many people buy little plecos thinking they'll fit in their gallon tanks not knowing that plecos can grow huge and require gallon tanks i would definitely recommend a betta particularly because you are buying the tank for your children keeping a small fish tank is a fun and effective way of teaching a child responsibility but fishkeeping isn't as easy as it looks and very often fish die from beginner's mistakes bettas are extremely hardy and will put up with most of these mistakes note that i said most in a gallon tank you could even fit in a tankmate like a snail an african dwarf frog or a small school of fish like tetras as long as a tankmate doesn't resemble a betta in any way the betta will not harm it other than bettas you could get a few guppies maybe about four since you have a filter you can also get about six or seven harlequin rasboras some of which i have recently acquired and rather fallen in love with please do not get a goldfish i don't know if you know this but when kept in small tanks goldfish release hormones that stunt their internal organs and deform them so they are unable to grow any larger so it's not like they only grow to the size of their container like many think one goldfish needs about gallons of water minimum however regardless of which fish you decide to get please be aware that you must cycle your tank first before you put in any fish this can take up to a month here are some links on cycling http www fishlore com nitrogencycle htm http www aquamaniacs net forum cms view article php aid  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Marine aquarium Aquarium Discus (fish) Fish farming Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy Tank Tilapia Carnivorous plant Reef tank PHP Violin Milk Autonomous building Biodiesel Sewage treatment Domestic rabbit Microeconomics Axolotl Hamster Dairy Omega-3 fatty acid Brewery Social rule Theory of conduct Insulin Kender Mosquito Swimming pool F-16 Fighting Falcon Koi Hypoglycemia Poker jargon Organic farming Zerg Fertility awareness Dwarf gourami Water garden Breastfeeding Fishing Children of God Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Solar variation Depleted uranium GunBound A Course In Miracles E85 Equine conformation Ajax (programming) Fugu Phishing RuneScape quests Surveillance Motion picture rating system Hash table Transsexuality Stuttering Humpback Whale Infantilism Energy development Capital punishment YuYu Hakusho Whaling Ferret Fire extinguisher Toyota Prius Controversies in autism Cancer Team Fortress Classic Shrimp farm Drug abuse Cruising (maritime) BZFlag Breast cancer Blog Terminal ballistics Motorcycle XML Tank locomotive Veganism Panama Canal Shark CPU design Dog

two part filter question the instructions on my filter says that i should replace the filter cartridge every four weeks i thought bacteria were supposed to develope in the filter so how can they if i replace the cartridge monthly the other day i fished something out the aquarium with my hand just then i realized that i had just washed them with anti bacterial soap can this act kill off the bacteria i am trying to grow spt you are right actually when you say it's supposed to develop there if you look at the different type of filters out there not sure what one you have but i like aquaclears myself they have three components to it the sponge activated carbon and bio max on the top i've found with these type of filters most of your beneficial bacteria grows in the sponge itself this makes sense from a different point of view if you think about it the sponge itself filters mechanically and strains out physical food and fish waste and that would be the point of ammonia introduction through the filter and also why you have some in your gravel as well bacteria like any other living organism will establish itself near food fuel source manufactuer's benefit if you replace parts sooner then needed and their motivation is pretty clear on that money it's really not necessary to replace your sponge or bio max components or whatever bacteria media you have as often as they say then you do have bio wheel type filters which you really don't want to replace at all there are also wet dry and cannister filters which work a little different but i'd assume you either have a component or bio wheel and you just ignore the manufacter instructions as far as replacing goes in fact when you do clean out your sponge portion use a bucket of the tank water you are replacing and that will help you retain somewhat your bacteria anti bacterial soap in theory would yes destroy some of that you have other bacterias some unwanted in your tank just having it on your hands technically would kill off some but most likely not nearly enough to effect the overall operation of your biological filtration now if you pour an entire dose of soap yeah it would but the soap itself in the tank would pose a much greater danger and kill the fish long before your bacteria dying would come into play if you need better answers and service check out fishless cyling com or just use the link on my profile jv  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Water purification Bacteria Aquarium Dry cleaning Agar plate Foodborne illness Brewery Biology Anthrax Dairy Common cold Tank Motor oil Compost Reef tank Carbon dioxide Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Many-worlds interpretation Ultraviolet Energy development Sterilization (microbiology) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Microeconomics Sake Cell (biology) Slow sand filter bed Sponge Autonomous building Tooth enamel Biodiesel Biodiversity Dishwasher Helicobacter pylori Bread Acne Renewable energy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Omega-3 fatty acid SpongeBob SquarePants Fossil fuel power plant Water Fish farming Hemp Modchip Soap Dialysis Water pollution Lac operon Anaerobic digestion Carnivorous plant Bong Ecology Motivation Flagellum Thermal power station Intelligent design Food preservation Hydraulic machinery Eutrophication Vermicompost Cyanide Coffee Yoghurt Hydrogen economy Hamster Vaccine Photosynthesis Disinfection Plastic Sugar Sea-Monkey Textile manufacturing Life Biochemistry Hybrid vehicle Biological pest control Political economy Liquid crystal Toilet paper Specified complexity Rebreather Flood geology Anti-Mormonism Menstrual cycle Theory of conduct CPU cache Irrigation

i just got a new fish tank any tips on keeping my fish alive and taking care of maintenance please post please post thank you and one more question i just got a sword tail and it stay next to heater is that normal thanks again please post the best thing for success in a fish tank is water changes weekly water changes are a must for the best water quality possible many care sheets say change the water times a month i believe i saw one that says once a year this is wrong you will need to change the water everyweek you will need a good filter u did say how many gallons so im assuming a gallon a filter is need to pick up waste mechianical filteration ammonia chemical and storeing benefical bacteria bio having a good filter doesnt mean that the water doesnt need to be change that is important to understand another important tip is dont overstock any tank this is way to common people follow the inch per gallon rule but what they dont keep in mind is that these fishes will grow and they dont understand that if the fish is going to get big it actually will overstocking any tank will cause poor water quality and kill fish the bio overload will end up crashing the tank with a vartiy of illness and isnt fun so never overstock your tank live plants live plants are great for fish tanks they help add oxygen and help clean the water they provide cover and a good look not all live plants require a co system or fancy lighting try looking into anabuis which is alittle extra cash but very hardy they are hard leaf plant which makes it so that fish dont eat them i still have some from years ago again feeding is ok but you never want to over feed them which will lead to poor water quality the sword tail is staying by the heater as it is nerous im guessing that you just set up the tank so it is normal for him to be nerious  Sewage treatment Aquarium Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Brewery Hydrogen economy Fish farming Dairy Water purification Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Goldfish Alcohol fuel Carnivorous plant Reef tank Sea-Monkey Textile manufacturing Knife Photosynthesis E85 Shark Biology Biogeochemical cycle Tilapia Eutrophication Biodiesel Houseplant Cannabis cultivation RuneScape quests Town gas Shrimp farm Thermal depolymerization Social rule Energy development Hydroponics Biochemistry Apollo Command/Service Module Floppy disk Welding Swimming pool Gasoline Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kosher foods Dialysis Chinook salmon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Furnace Vermicompost Nile crocodile Water pollution GunBound Water Fugu Carburetor Nutrient Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Renewable energy Mosquito Gothic metal Carbon dioxide RuneScape skills Coffee Agriculture Solar panel Bacteria Gas metal arc welding Factory farming HVAC Axolotl Tank RuneScape Mini-Games YuYu Hakusho Hard disk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Botany Atomic Kitten Water supply Refrigerator Mattress Domestic water system Pneumonia Rail terminology Chicken Betting (poker) Organic farming P-47 Thunderbolt Home repair Illegal drug trade Livestock

does anyone know a good website for aquariums are you looking to buy an aquarium if so i wouldn't advise getting one from a website it would need to be shipped to you and the shipping cost because of the weight would be ridiculous you might look through a few websites if you want a larger tank or a specialty item but i would suggest speaking with a manager at one of your local stores and buying it there as a special order item most stores are happy to order things for their customers it a sale and money for them plus you may buy other items or fish from them as well then you won't need to pay the shipping cost here's a website that has a pretty good selection look along the left hand margin under specialty items http www thatpetplace com  Retailer Electronic commerce Bulk vending Islamic banking Inventory Loss leader Wal-Mart Best Buy Argos (retailer) Supermarket Internet fraud Aquarium Microeconomics $ale of the Century Illegal drug trade Health insurance My Little Pony Sears Holdings Corporation Economics Fry's Electronics Chinatown Pricing Externality Textbook Airbus A320 Animal Crossing Hydrogen economy RuneScape economy Investment bank Gross domestic product Discus (fish) The Apprentice 2 Anarchism and capitalism Poker jargon Ashton-Tate Airbus A380 Aldi Monetary policy Georgia Aquarium Conveyor belt sushi Marine aquarium Sears Catalog Home Supply and demand Commodity Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Price discrimination Final Fantasy XI FairTax Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Insurance Public good Advance fee fraud GunBound Fish Humphrey Bogart Epcot CPU cache Parable of the broken window Short selling Mutual fund Life insurance Stock Cable television Neopets Opportunity cost El-Fish Shopping Solarquest Auction Sam Walton Outsourcing Price Day trading Progressive tax Filling station Delicatessen Cost accounting Eaton's Procurement Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tariff Flat tax Video game crash of 1983 Tesco Space Shuttle program Hyperinflation Lottery Theory of conduct Minor characters in Morrowind Disney Store Sea-Monkey Law of value Costco RFID Arbitrage Diseconomies of scale Small business Customer relationship management Productive and unproductive labour Legal research

i have a vacuum cleaner fish why is my molly near the water surface constantly sucking in water or debris i know the oxygen level is not low because i have oxgyenator plants plus the light is on so the plants aren't using oxygen furthermore the filter and the airstone is in top notch condition and the guppies in there are happy and swimming the molly looks happy and healthy though it swims down sometimes and goes up sometimes and my water tests came out good no nh equals zero all that good stuff since the fish involved is a molly there could be a few reasons for this behavior mollies are surface feeding fish so it may be looking for food what's the water temperature as water warms it holds less oxygen but with a filter in the tank the temperature would need to be very warm for the molly to be affected if the molly is newer than the guppies or the tank itself is new less then months running you might have a buildup of ammonia or nitrite if the guppies have been in the tank longer they may have adapted somewhat to the level but a new fish would not have it may also be more sensitive to the chemicals than are the guppies see ammonia poisoning and nitrite poisoning in this link http www fish disease net diseases htm the solution to this is a larger partial water change of about if you're unable to test your water to rule this out  Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Fish farming Water Water (molecule) Carburetor Autonomous building Ammonia Carnivorous plant Eutrophication Carbon dioxide Cyanide Hydrogen economy Hydrogen sulfide Brewery Solar power Sea-Monkey Ozone depletion Ocean thermal energy conversion Shark Explosive material Biogeochemical cycle Ozone hole Hydrogen Sun E85 Water purification Nitrous oxide Hydroponics Krill Solar variation Iron Thermal power station El Ni__o Drowning Tetrapod Swimming Vitamin C Welding Alternative biochemistry Motor oil Earth's atmosphere Mosquito Diseases of the honeybee Global warming and agriculture Coal Fossil fuel power plant Siphon Dairy Antarctic krill Dry cleaning Nuclear power Lake Gar Acetic acid Wetland Fishing Glossary of firefighting equipment Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Omega-3 fatty acid Haloalkane Soil pH Atlantic herring Helium Bong Nitrogen Decompression sickness Vacuum cleaner Photosynthesis Rocket fuel Nitric acid Ice core Ecology of Hong Kong Beryllium Dog Corrosion Origin of life Renewable energy Acne Vegetarianism Refrigerator Hamster Contact lens Coral reef Copper Hydrogen peroxide Incandescent light bulb Nutrition

why are lake malawi cichlids so much more available than lake tanganyika cichlids i see the malawi cichlids regularly in pet stores but rarely if ever lake tanganyika cichlids if i do see a lake tanganyika cichlids its usely a frontosa any ideas maybe prices it has to do with alot of things mbunas haps and peacocks are more popular because of their vibrant colors and relatively small size they have been on the market long enough that many are farm raised in the far east this allows them to be sold at much lower prices as well you also have to take into account political situations many of the countries surrounding lake tanganyika are war torn and it can be more difficult to export from that area driving the price up when you buy a wild caught fish you are paying for the divers fishermen their equipment the transporters to the airport the air cargo the wholesaler and so on the smaller tanganyikans are not that popular because of their needs and lack of bright color tropheus are not that popular because of their high price and insane aggression frontosa are fairly popular due to their nice blue and white stripes but even they are expensive  Lake Malawi Cichlid Discus (fish) Zambezi Diamond Tanzania Rift Valley lakes Peanut Tilapia Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Malawi Airline Sexual selection Economy of Africa Economy of Malawi Commodore 64 Floppy disk Hamster Banana Gross domestic product Geography of Africa Milwaukee, Wisconsin Common Agricultural Policy Mutual fund MMORPG Airport RuneScape economy Chevrolet Camaro Salmon Supply and demand Sport utility vehicle Filling station Tax Digital photography Economy of the Republic of Ireland Fishing Laserdisc Common Fisheries Policy Inflation Hard disk Economy of the United States Privatization Shrimp farm NeXT Neopets Lionel Corporation Atari 8-bit family Wal-Mart Panama Canal Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Sega Saturn Tesco Economy of Iceland Price discrimination Inventory Economy of Mexico Externality Fish farming Ithaca, New York British Empire Great Lakes Ferret Light-emitting diode Shau Kei Wan Plasma display Economy of Chile Economy of Venezuela Hyperinflation O scale Insurance Carlsbad, California Manitoba Hydro Nile perch Livestock Dog Grand Forks, North Dakota Lake Freshwater angelfish Chicken PE ratio Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Clarinet Farmers' Alliance Uganda Railway Video game crash of 1983 Economy of Suriname Redundant array of independent disks Dragons (Pern) Economic history of Canada Taboo food and drink Bond Ryanair Economy of Kuwait Bulk vending Dodge Charger Commodore International Economy of the United Arab Emirates Broadband Internet access

feeding question last night i got a male betta along with dwarf platies and i give the platies flake food and i give the betta betta pellet food however my betta seems to eat both flake and pellet food is this good for him i'm also afraid that i'm polluting the tank with too much food also of my platies is eating and looks healthy but the other are hiding behind plants and don't know there's food i'm afraid they'll starve please help thanks i am assuming that you have a filtered tank in a new tank water quality is much more important than food your tank needs to cycle adding fish all at once is going to increase your ammonia all the food you give them will increase the ammonia as well you should feed your fish but only very small amounts once your tank is cycled and you are doing water changes on a regular schedule you can feed a little bit more your fish will not starve to death email me if you have any questions  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fish farming Sewage treatment Autonomous building Dwarf gourami Hamster Organic farming Discus (fish) Goldfish Maize Spider Shrimp farm Omega-3 fatty acid Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Thermal power station Ecology Eutrophication Carbon dioxide Chinook salmon Water Agriculture Seabird Nuclear reactor Axolotl Clownfish Town gas Domestic rabbit Environmental vegetarianism Dairy Clown loach Veganism Biodiesel Nutrition Hydroponics E85 Ammonia Natural gas Aquarium Crayfish Green roof Shark Halfbeak Cochineal Tilapia Healthy eating Apple Rice Vegetarianism Water (molecule) Factory farming Nutrient Salmon Biological pest control Dieting Fugu STS-59 Pine Stomach cancer Brewery Twelve leverage points Economy of the People's Republic of China Chicken Tidal power Cannabis cultivation Trophic level Gar Kosher foods Wetland Anorexia nervosa Albatross Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Krill RuneScape skills Space Shuttle external tank Diseases of the honeybee Antarctic krill Carburetor RuneScape Random Events Fish and chips Carbon dioxide sink RuneScape Mini-Games Nuclear power Energy development Alcohol fuel Sandworm (Dune) Frog Ecology of Hong Kong Nitrogen Iron Global warming and agriculture Environmental concerns with electricity generation Kissing gourami Earthworm Vermicompost Poison Capercaillie Spam (electronic)

i am looking to buy some fish for my tank iam in dc where schould i look hi ms dc i would strongly advise you go to a specialist aquarium store rather than petco or a general pet store for several reasons many general pet stores keep their stock in less than perfect conditions have little or no knowledge of specific fish care many will tell you myths half truths some blatantly lie just to get you to part with your money have no interest in the well being of either you or your new fish in contrast specialist aquarium stores are almost always staffed by people who also keep fish as a hobby therefore keep better healthier stock will not spin you a line i realise you may have a general pet outlet nearby but it will benefit you no end to find a specialist i would also recommend you join one of the many fish keeping forums on the internet that deal with whatever type s of fish you are thinking about keeping if you are unsure of anything always ask before doing good luck  Aquarium Domestic rabbit Discus (fish) Marine aquarium Neopets Pet Clownfish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Pet store Reef tank Wal-Mart Prostate cancer Insurance Theory of conduct Microeconomics Password Fish Stock Economics Zebra Danio Surplus product Contract Goldfish Sears Holdings Corporation Coin collecting Crayfish Omega-3 fatty acid Characters of Naruto Surplus value Friedrich Schleiermacher Internet troll Gar Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Care Bears Health insurance CPU cache Social rule Koi Infantilism Slot machine Lie Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape skills Live-bearing aquarium fish Orthogonal matrix Deflation (economics) Sea-Monkey Estoppel Motion picture rating system Inventory Insulin Animal Crossing Capital accumulation Fast bowling Vegetarianism Colorectal cancer Insider trading Final Fantasy XI Mutual fund Brackish water Productive and unproductive labour God Emperor of Dune Coral reef Advanced Squad Leader Fancy rat Breastfeeding Fish farming Annuity Orca PETCO Park Angling Law of value Nicomachean Ethics Internet fraud Surveillance Finding Nemo Plame affair Egg (food) Expert system Fishing Aristotle Dog Gaia Online Education Mythology Anchor Open access Cyanide California Academy of Sciences Hunter (World of Warcraft) Arbitrage John Wycliffe Economy of the United States Age of Mythology Dairy Fathers' rights Organic food J Sainsbury Enron Corporation

mixing fish right now i have silver shark approx inches black redtail shark approx inches dwarf tiger barbs about fully grown inches each female dwarf guarami approx inches chinese algae eater approx inches catfish black w white spots approx inches they all live hapily with each other it seems the catfish doesnt swim around alot ive never seen him eat but hes gotten alot bigger is this a good mix what else could i put in with them what is the best kind of food to feed them right now im feeding them complete flake food becase i ran out of blood worms im wondering if there was something better than blood worms i heard they were the best and the have the most protien is there a difference between enamel coated rocks like the blue green red ones and the other gravel smaller rocks sandy type stuff i know its a big long question but im curious i want to give my fish the best environment i can d all answers are appreciated d how good of a mix depends in part on the tank size i'll assume these are in the gallon you mentioned in your last question the dwarf tiger barbs can be very nippy and might cause some problems for the other fish especially the gourami they may never cause a problem at all but they will need to be watched the silver shark is most likely a fish also known as a colombian shark or catfish and will very quickly outgrow the tank further more it is a predator that will start to make meals of your other fish as it grows you can top of the problem here with the fact that as it ages and grow it will require brackish water and eventually a fully saltwater tank to live i don't think a chinese algae eater is a good mix for any tank anytime they get large rowdy and territorial in addition to the fact that they will stop eating algae at all and will actually attack your other fish so i would suggest you replace the cae with something like a bristlenose catfish that will eat the algae and will not become a problem for the other fish find a new home for the silver shark and replace him with a peaceful fish that will not grow over about long as for feeding i would suggest using a quality flake of pellet food as a staple and supplement with bloodworms blackworms mosquito larvae brine shrimp and other assorted frozen foods it's not only about which has the most protein but feeding a variety of foods to give them a balanced diet of micronutrients and vitamins any aquarium safe gravel will work well in this tank with this selection of fish none of them have any special requirements in that regard mm  Tilapia Shark Marine aquarium Hamster Dwarf gourami Goldfish Fish farming Veganism Clownfish Sea-Monkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Krill Axolotl Fishing Guinea pig Salmon Mosquito Kissing gourami Aquarium Fugu Domestic rabbit Tofu Halfbeak Gar Vegetarianism Peanut Tea Fauna of Australia Sewage treatment Cat Omega-3 fatty acid Healthy eating Maize Chlorophyta Aquaculture Nutrition Potato Antarctic krill Zebra Danio Agriculture RuneScape skills Cuisine of Malaysia Animal Koi Catfish Goby Tag Aztec Fancy rat Cuisine of Denmark Dog Vermicompost Hamburger Biological pest control Cuisine of the Southern United States Cantonese cuisine Genetically modified food Hydroponics Breastfeeding Bengali cuisine Protein Folic acid Coeliac disease Raw food diet Crocodile Capercaillie Autonomous building Finding Nemo Great White Shark Organic farming Fish Tyrannosaurus rex Vitamin Domesticated turkey Tlingit E85 Orca American lobster Stingray Bottlenose Dolphin RuneScape locations Fish and chips Creatures in Bionicle Brine shrimp Honeybee Tooth

need some more betta help i resuced another betta today half dead in a filthy bowl at the lps he's in clean water w some aquarium salt and a heating pad to help warm it up anything else i can do he's now down at the bottom not looking so good he looks a little skinny but he won't eat yet other than that his color looks pretty good considering any suggestions that might help him out a little more than i've done already i just couldn't leave him at the pet store he was upside down in the bowl i actually thought he was dead but he moved i don't really expect him to make it but i'm gonna do my best to help him so if you have any helpful advice other than ending his misery i'm willing to give it a try thanks i think you have done at that is reasonable at this point many people suggest such things as bettafix etc to be added tot he water but i don t i would suggest that clean water is the best thing at this point and if you add enough salt it will act as a better preventative than the various chemical additives add tablespoon per gallons of water but add it slowly by scooping out some water and dissolving the salt in it then pouring back a little of that water every hour or so until it's all added over the course of hours also he has had one sudden change in his water chemistry already adding other chemicals would only make for more changes and therefore more stress you will of course want to watch carefully for any signs of disease and be ready to treat accordingly a peaceful spot for the bowl would also be a good idea so that he can adjust to his new environment more easily best of luck with him and if i can help further feel free to email me mm  Textile manufacturing Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Coffee Aquarium Hamster Opportunity rover Water (molecule) Water Bong Fire extinguisher Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sea-Monkey Pottery Ammonia Japanese tea ceremony Goldfish Poker jargon Corrosion Diseases of the honeybee First aid Idli Soldering Bread Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Carburetor Asthma Taxi Driver Water purification Cryonics Motor oil Olive oil Hydrogen peroxide Pittsburgh Steelers Solvent Mattress Mouth ulcer Fossil fuel power plant Microeconomics Brewery Thermal power station Sodium sulfate Clinical depression 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Anchor Decompression sickness The Apprentice 2 Vinegar Eutrophication The Ashlee Simpson Show Book of Isaiah Nuclear reactor Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Wine making Nuclear power Inflation Sauna Sulfur Urinary incontinence Milton H.

do sea anemone grow in your tank or do they stay the same size when you buy them at the aquarium store unless you know the age always plan on any living thing to continue to grow it can't hurt to ask the age when you buy something because oftentimes a good fish store will know but yeah plan on your anemone growing more possibly to even twice its size once you get it home  Clownfish Marine aquarium Sea anemone Jellyfish Symbiosis Biology Anemone Sea-Monkey Monterey Bay Aquarium Discus (fish) El-Fish Percula Clownfish Aquarium Fish Crayfish Georgia Aquarium Animal The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mount Sinai, New York Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Butterflyfish New England Aquarium Eaton's Anemone nemorosa Marine biology Epcot Fishing Jon Secada Billboard Hot 100 Tilapia Sears Holdings Corporation Goldfish RuneScape economy Oscar (fish) Goby Halfbeak Shedd Aquarium Common Fisheries Policy Best Buy Sea spider Fancy Crane Cnidaria Autonomous building Simpsons Already Did It Marshall Field's Finding Nemo Diving cylinder She Loves You Virginia Beach, Virginia Biological dispersal Bart Sells His Soul Sailfin Molly The Fairly OddParents Live-bearing aquarium fish Cuttlefish Cabela's Cruising (maritime) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Beluga Inventory Reef tank Solar power Corydoras Karachi Zebra Danio Coral Trade Canc__n Antarctic krill Coral reef Salmon Belle Isle Aquarium Fish farming Gross domestic product Gar Freshwater angelfish Brackish water Tesco Shark Seahorse Aqua (band) Manila Hall & Oates Eel life history Retailer Jackass: The Movie Urban sprawl Fugu Otter Orca Cyanide LiveJournal Louie, Louie Metrication California Academy of Sciences Cnidocyte Carpinteria, California FairTax Tide pool IKEA

my oranda developed sores or cuts on it's mouth now they've healed but he lost part of his bottom lip help i bought goldfish about a month ago an oranda and a ryukin a few days later the oranda developed sores or maybe cuts on his mouth i wonder if he cut himself on one of the plastic plants he liked to chew them they healed pretty quickly a couple of days but he lost part of his bottom lip from it and can't eat very well and spends a lot of time at the bottom of the aquarium the ryukin never suffered any illness or injury and is very healthy has this happened to anyone else out there what else could have caused it and how do i help my poor oranda fish gallon tank weekly water changes all numbers are good no more plastic plants goldfish love to pick up gravel and move it about and they also love to nibble on plants of course preferably alive but they're not going to learn that the plants aren't edible until they've tried it once yes goldfish can get cut on plastic plants that's why i always run my fingers over every piece of anything that goes into my tank if it feels even the least bit rough or sharp i smooth it out he's healing and that's good you may want to peak his interest in food by feeding special treats like brineshrimp krill bloodworms etc yes these are rich treats only to be given once or twice a week but if he isn't eating then it's a better alternative unfortunately his lip won't grow back and there really isn't anything you can do about it other than to make sure he eats even if it requires personal hand feedings  Goldfish Hamster Equine conformation Breastfeeding Aquarium YuYu Hakusho Sea-Monkey Chopsticks Koi Drill bit Bong Stomach cancer Tooth Domestic rabbit Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fancy rat Fugu Axolotl Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Elephant Bread Textile manufacturing Dairy Massage Guinea pig Mouth ulcer Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oral sex Cocaine Clarinet Theory of conduct Sewage treatment Shark Kodocha Discus (fish) Cliff Richard Billboard Hot 100 Halfbeak Tilapia Urinary incontinence Salmon Mattress Adjustable gastric band Marathon (sport) Body piercing RuneScape economy Piccolo Junior Saga Samuel Goldwyn The Amber Spyglass Kissing gourami Terri Schiavo Peanut Poker jargon Negima Natural health Mushroom hunting Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Antarctic krill Knife 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cleft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dog training Humphrey Bogart Gar Albatross Chocolate Traditional Chinese medicine Nile crocodile Comfrey Whaling Eating First aid Aztec Tomato Fast bowling Houseplant Krill Tobacco Chicken Swimming RuneScape skills Japanese tea ceremony Naruto jutsu Skateboarding trick 613 mitzvot Final Fantasy: Unlimited Hydroponics Veganism About a Boy Medicine El-Fish Harmonica Hydrogen economy Church of Christ, Scientist Hip fracture Atlantic herring Elis Prefecture

is it ok to give my betta fish peas from ramen noodle cups would rinsing cooking cooling it make it safe for him to eat also how long is it safe to leave the light on in a one gallon triangle shaped tank will the the top melt because its some sort of plastic the top has a clear acrylic part to separate the air above the water from the lightbulb above the light where it touches the outer layer there is a piece of aluminum im guessing to reflect on the water im trying to keep the heat around so my betta stays happy this is my third betta one lived years and i want to make him happy but he will not eat his food pebbles he only grabs onto the pebble swims around with it in his mouth and spits it back out so now to give him a little treat i want to try the pea also i cant think of anything to help him feel a little homey because right now his tank is pretty bare its just light gravel with an air filter no plants because the tank was used by my one other fish and i dont have a new fake plant to give ok ok no peas i get it im not trying to give him a new diet of peas for life i just wanted to see if he would eat those to actually fill him a little more because he wouldnt eat the food i give him i would stay away from the pea thing if you want to give him a treat try some blood worms betas do the spitting out of the food business they'll eat it when they are hungry if you want to try something you could try a small slice of cucumber at petsmart we give all of our goldfish and some of our other fish slices of cucumber it would be okay for a beta as for your light you want to make sure you leave your light off for hours a day this is to prevent an overgrowth of bacteria and algae the light stimulates algae growth your beta can survive from degrees to that is why they are such harty fish you should get some decorations for your tank suprisingly you'll see your fish more happy and active if you do it gives them a home if you want you can get some live plants they really aren't that expensive and you get the benifits of oxygen in your tank this also makes the fish happy especially if he is living in a bowel just no peas or anything from ramen soup for your fish dont soak the food in water it's already going to be soaked in water i wouldn't switch to flake it's very easy to overfeed with flake stick with the pellets he'll eat  Sea-Monkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Ramen Japanese cuisine Sewage treatment Tofu Cantonese cuisine Swimming pool Fish farming Goldfish Marine aquarium Cuisine of Denmark Aquarium Solar power Pebble bed reactor Plastic Cuisine of the Philippines Chopsticks Hydroponics Hamster Tilapia Brewery Pea Breakfast Nutrition Bong Carbon dioxide Rice Carnivorous plant Knife Tooth Water purification Sushi Roman eating and drinking Russian cuisine Food preservation Agar plate Fire fighting Cookware and bakeware Autonomous building Textile manufacturing Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hydrogen economy Lake Fishing Sauerkraut Coffee Chinese cuisine Houseplant Shark Welding Iron Cuisine of Singapore Fossil fuel power plant Dead Sea Korean cuisine Chlorophyta Botany Tomato Kosher foods Hamburger Cuisine of Malaysia Photosynthesis Incandescent light bulb Nuclear reactor Fish and chips Animal Internal ballistics Chocolate Aluminium Thermal power station Colorectal cancer Dry cleaning Fecal incontinence Common bean Algae Mercury Atlas 6 Comanche Eutrophication Wok E85 MRE Kitchen Tlingit Cheese Chinook salmon Soap bubble Soba

fish tank filter questions please can you help i have just started my new l tank for goldfish it can supplied with an internal submersable filter the instructions were pants where in the tank should i put it as in how high low in the water it has a water jet so if i put it near the top of the water can i get away with out using an airpump many thanks the filter is a rena filstar with plungers on to attach to the side of the tank we are in the uk thanks for the replies so far you can place it anywhere in the tank lower in the tank will stir the debris like food making it more likely it will be filtered out but may irritate any bottom dwellers you may get some fish like corydoras catfish might like it higher up will provide better surface agitation promoting higher oxygen exchange in the water and evaporation to keep the tank cooler but might make feeding upper tier fish difficult without turning it off an air pump isn't necessary if you have enough surface agitation elsewhere the bubbles don't add oxygen to the water the bubbles breaking on the surface do so a good powerhead churning up the water can be used instead take into account any plants you might put in there the type of fish that you plan to stock it with some don't like any currents other enjoy them and the size of your tank after that lecture i personally would put the filter on the bottom in a back corner with the jet pointing across the back of the tank like if you were to choose the back left corner point the jet to the right as an aside make sure you know that a l will stock fish that reach a maximum of inch in length  Brewery Thermal power station Aquarium Carburetor Fish farming Siphon Motor oil Goldfish Glossary of firefighting equipment Water (molecule) Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment E85 Autonomous building Bong Coffee Water purification Petroleum Supply-side economics Dry cleaning Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Apollo Command/Service Module Carbon dioxide Gas compressor Gas metal arc welding Space shuttle main engine Apollo 13 Scramjet USS Yorktown (CV-5) Jet engine Air conditioning Shrimp farm Anchor Irrigation Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Lake Diving regulator Loudspeaker Dead Sea Space Shuttle external tank Lake Burley Griffin Equine conformation Space Shuttle program Fossil fuel power plant Eutrophication Ozone depletion Ocean thermal energy conversion Textile manufacturing Mattress Drill bit Paintball marker Turbocharger Hydrogen economy Mooney M20 Reef tank Seismic retrofit Tank Oxygen sensor Ozone hole Saturn V Diving suit Energy development Antarctic krill Intravenous therapy Twelve leverage points Scuba set Tesla coil Water supply Incandescent light bulb B-47 Stratojet Terminal ballistics Diving cylinder Tetrapod Rocket fuel Gasoline Dam Fire fighting Hydroponics Ice core Pulmonary alveolus Decompression sickness Vacuum Explosive material Wind turbine Motorcycle Radio controlled airplane Biodiesel Marine aquarium STS-51-L

can water sit too long for aging i have used a dechorinator in the water which also takes care of chloramine it has sat for about two weeks in sealed gallon containers it is for a gallon tank can the water sit too long before being used i am guessing no but i do not want to take the chance someone knowledgable in the area please help thank you water can become stale and especially if you have hard water the dissolved solids can settle on the bottom and make an unattractive gunk on the bottom once added to the tank though it shouldn't be any problem at all although the sealed containers defeat the purpose of airing out untreated tank water you let water sit if you don't have dechlorinater so the chlorine and chloramine can dissolve out and into the air above  Sewage treatment Chlorine Brewery Ammonia Wine making Thermal power station Marine aquarium Chlorination Aquarium E85 Dry cleaning Fossil fuel power plant Hydrogen economy Flush toilet Pebble bed reactor Electrophysiology Solvent Carbon dioxide Diving Sauna Goldfish Japanese tea ceremony Plastic Sodium hypochlorite Diving suit Density Swimming pool Nuclear power Password Homebrewing Tofu Grand Calumet River Sea-Monkey Tank Wood pulp Ocean thermal energy conversion Hydrochloric acid Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Water (molecule) USS Wake Island (CVE-65) Hydrogen chloride Barrel (storage) Acetic acid Novelty (locomotive) Pump Houseplant Septic tank Water supply Bong Grog Hydroponics STS-51-L Hard water Dairy Siphon Rebreather Fire extinguisher Samovar Textile manufacturing Panama Canal Timeline of underwater technology Autonomous building Card Sharks Three Mile Island John Dalton Bread U.S. Navy SEALs Minesweeper (computer game) Rum Coffee Corrosion Alcohol fuel Asthma Eifel Aqueduct English unit Aerial firefighting Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Concrete Decompression sickness High explosive anti-tank Bladderwort Water heater Wheel of Fortune Tire Soap bubble Cessna T-37 Smoke-screen Canoe Energy development Memorial Stadium, Clemson Swimming Discus (fish) Molotov cocktail Nitric acid Menstrual cup Axolotl Social rule Aerial (dance move) Tank car

snail from no where i just saw a teeny tiny baby snail in my bettas tanks i have no idea where it came from all i can figure is that it came from the live plants in his tank but ive had those for weeks where did the little thing come from and should i leave it there try and put it in my gallon community tank or dispose of it which i hate to do because it is quite cute and seems fairly harmless ive never had snails before and been told to avoid them and that they are just trouble any ideas right now it is in my betta's gallon tank when it gets bigger i will have to move it because he is in there with a ghost shrimp and i worry about there being enough space but for now it is about half the size of an apple seed i have no clue what kind it is other than that it is off white colored my gallon is a tropical tank with platies mollies and a pleco i didnt know they could reproduce like that yikes now i am kind of worried yup more than likely from your new plants it was still an egg and now it's hatched that's why you're only seeing it now and why i am extremely hesitant to suggest that anyone get snails and when i do it's for just one apple snail they're sneaky little critters snails are apple snails are not hermaphroditic which means they don't need another snail to reproduce but most of the rest are they can do the whole job all on their own which is why they're so much trouble  Snail Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Marine aquarium Knots Landing StarCraft Episode VI Brewery Social rule Tilapia Color Species Shrimp farm Rocko's Modern Life Johnny Appleseed Apple Computer Goldfish Discworld gods German cuisine Hermaphrodite Humphrey Bogart P-38 Lightning Dwarf gourami Flowering plant Plant Aquarium Donald Rumsfeld Cannabis cultivation Charles Ives Timon and Pumbaa Paul Is Dead Milton H.

how long does it take for fish tank water to be dechlorinised if i am not going to use a dechlorinizer how long should i leave in order to make sure that it is safe for the fishes like hours for example allowing water to sit out only allows for the chlorine to evaporate there are other chemicals in the water such as chloramine that do not evaporate and need dechlorinators added to neutralize them so you need to let water sit for about hours to allow chlorine to evaporate but if you want your water safe you need to use a dechlorinator  Sewage treatment Chlorination Polychlorinated biphenyl Water purification Chlorine Swimming pool Ammonia Sodium hypochlorite Wood pulp Hydrochloric acid Sea-Monkey Sodium chloride Evaporation Smoke-screen Brewery Axolotl Water supply Haloalkane Chemical warfare Bromine Mercury (element) Solvent Apollo 13 Bleach Instant coffee Air conditioning Water Hydrogen chloride Dry cleaning Hydrogen peroxide Dead Sea Titanium Dairy Phosphorus chlorides Swimming Incandescent light bulb Sauna Thermal power station Water resources Hyperthermia Ethylene glycol Alum Autonomous building Alkane USS Thresher (SS-200) Hydrogen Alcohol Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Lake Rebreather Use of poison gas in World War I Aral Sea Sodium hydroxide Decaffeination Mineral Fugu Fountain Sugar beet Myxobolus cerebralis Trichloroethylene Edible salt Ethylene John Dalton Sandworm (Dune) Fossil fuel power plant Gilding Bottled water Textile manufacturing Concrete Motorcycle Perfume Neutrino Cookware and bakeware Ozone depletion Bathing Tetrachloroethylene Watercooling Kosher foods Ethidium bromide Warm-blooded Marine aquarium Mississauga, Ontario Explosive material Aquarium Desert USS Tunny (SS-282) Ozone layer Shoe polish Coffee Helium Phosgene Asthma Twelve leverage points Perchlorate SS Andrea Doria Fish Ozone hole Stock car (rail) Drip irrigation

betta can't eat i just got a male betta last night and he's been trying to eat the pellets but he keeps spitting them back out they seem like they are too hard or something for him is he getting any food off of the pellet even though he's spitting them back out it's not like he doesn't like them he rushes up to them and try's really hard to eat it please help thanks he is also acting lethargic and then swimming fast and then rushing into walls i'm kinda worried thanks i have a gallon tank you're exactly right they are a bit hard and he's just trying to soften them a bit try soaking them in a little water for few minutes before you feed him and that should help as for the rest he's probably just adjusting to his new home and will settle down before long at all mm  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Piccolo Junior Saga Kitchen Natural Selection (computer game) Spider Bladderwort Nerpa Unreal E85 Chinese food therapy Carbon dioxide Dishwasher Brewery Clownfish Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Drill bit Hard water Mattress The Legend of Zelda series enemies Tlingit Swimming pool Blood (computer game) Rush (band) Sodium hydroxide Rice Tooth Swimming Dwarf gourami Shark Nuclear reactor USS Indianapolis (CA-35) American lobster GunZ The Duel Water purification Freshwater angelfish Operation Market Garden Ron and Fez Antarctic krill Shrimp farm Fish farming Comanche Giant Panda Fasting Sketch comedy Tilapia Hip hop collaborations Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Elephant Halfbeak Paint Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

my goldfish what exactly happened a couple days ago i came home from my relatives to find my goldfish laying on it's side and constantly trying to keep it's balance the bowl was fairly dirty but my mother insisted that she cleaned it yesterday anyway i scrubbed the bowl clean replaced it with fresh water and put my goldfish back in it still was having issues swimming i just left it in the bowl and left the room after i came back an hour or so i was shocked to see my fish swimming around happily and not tipping over once on it's side i could clearly see patches of red at the end of it's tail fin though which i'm guessing are broken blood vessels also it may be worth to note that while i was cleaning the bowl i saw a ton of fish food like pellets at the bottom even though my mother once again insisted that she didn't put that many pellets in i'm guessing that maybe he was having defecation problems or maybe he didn't eat them was it the pellets causing the dirty tank or something else there shouldn't be any food laying on the bottom of the tank all uneaten food should be taken out so even though your mom may have believed she was not overfeeding she was the food was rotting and causing the water to become toxic thus causing the fish to start getting sick from the toxic water changing the water removed the toxic environment and thus made the fish happier you're lucky that you caught it so soon yes the red streaks at the ends of the fins are from stress and or septicemia which can be a result of poor water quality these will go away when the stress and or poor water quality is eliminated but if allowed to continue will kill the fish bowls are not the best environment for any fish but especially a goldfish i would highly suggest saving your allowance to buy at least a gallon tank and a very very good filter trust me your fish will be much healthier and live much longer in the meantime because of the excessive levels of waste goldfish create and because you have a bowl with no filter you are going to need to change the water at least times a week if not every day good luck and glad you saved your goldy in time  Goldfish Aquarium Shrimp farm Fish farming Marine aquarium Bong Hamster Carbon dioxide Sewage treatment Shark Dairy E85 Dry cleaning Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sea-Monkey Biodiesel Nutrition Hydrogen economy Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Japanese tea ceremony Cannabis cultivation Orca Brewery Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit Pitaten Eutrophication Fugu Menstrual cup Guinea pig Ecco the Dolphin Foodborne illness Diseases of the honeybee Cat Whaling Tea Dialysis Ecology Weekly World News Kosher foods Tag Fishing Toilet humour Fin Whale Environmental concerns with electricity generation Equine conformation Whale Lake Burley Griffin Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Water purification Folic acid Dam Alcohol fuel Poker jargon Kashrut First Battle of the Atlantic Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Humpback Whale Coffee West Indian cricket team Veganism Laserdisc Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Rebreather Predestination paradox Motor oil Salmon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Oily fish Bread Kodocha Gar Koi Mercury (element) Tetrapod Welding Characters in the Smurfs Water The Perishers Panama Canal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Futurama (TV series - season 2) Iron Swimming Pebble bed reactor Sin City Chopsticks Insulin Unemployment Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Cleveland Browns Vegetarianism

good fish for a gallon high tank if you'd like a lively colorful tank you can try platies or mollies try to keep a ratio of females for each male and don't stock more than about of them trust me it'll look like plenty they're very active and playful you don't want to overstock these guys because they are big waste producers like goldfish read the labels carefully on the mollies some of them like the sailfins and the dalmations get much larger than others also swordtails seem too large and aggressive to me for a gallon especially a tall which won't have as much swim space now a tank of livebearers can end up being problematic because they do breed like bunnies and you can end up overstocked one solution is to keep only large leaved plants in the tank and only small gravel so that the fry have nowhere to hide and can be eaten by the adults i've also found that keeping a single female betta in the tank is a great population control tool those girls are quite the predators for bottom feeders a small school about cories and a couple of olive nerite snails have worked great for me  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Live-bearing aquarium fish Sailfin Molly Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Green swordtail Sewage treatment Poker jargon Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Discus (fish) Halfbeak Snail Fugu Hydrogen economy Gas turbine Clownfish Lake Burley Griffin Koi Brewery Livestock Gar Alcohol fuel Kakapo Unreal Dwarf gourami Domestic rabbit Tilapia Seabird Autonomous building Spider Biological pest control Crayfish Hydroponics Shrimp farm American lobster Olive oil Gray Wolf Yacht Axolotl Albatross Biodiesel The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shark Poeciliidae Hamster Fishing Ostrich Atlantic herring Transformer Striped bass Guinea pig Fuel injection Olive Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Tank Salmon Leatherback Sea Turtle History of the tank Dry cleaning Spacecraft propulsion Lion Bottlenose Dolphin Gay slang American Alligator Kangaroo Domesticated turkey Tarantula Gasoline Dog Tlingit Muskellunge Cheetah Carburetor Grunion Cat Murray Cod Liger Clown loach Dairy Seine (fishing) Equine conformation Glossary of wildland fire terms Sexual dimorphism Diving Stingray Mosquito Corydoras E85 Musk Duck CPU cache House Mouse Anchor Coconut crab Energy development American Dad!

i have a gold fish and i want him to grow big or at least put in other fish how can i make it so i dont really have to clean the tank but have fish in it please list the size tank i would need but no more than gallon and can i get the sucky fish that suck on the walls i want it to be color full and i want to add fish to my gold fish well i answered your second question first but one if you want your goldfish to grow big you are going to need to get him out of that gallon and give him a gallon at least maybe more depending on what type of goldy it is next you can't put other tropical fish in with goldfish only goldfish can live with goldfish except for a few bottom feeders and finally regardless of the type of fish regular tank cleaning and maintenance is a basic necessity and if you don't properly and regularly clean your tank none of your fish will live to grow big if you want a goldfish and the sucky fish sucky fish oftentimes more accurately referred to as plecostomus for example grow very very large and with just one goldfish and one pleco you are going to need about a gallon plus tank if you can't go bigger than a gallon tank i would suggest selling or giving away your goldfish and investing in a few schooling fish such as tetras they're colorful stay relatively small and in a gallon tank you could get away with between but you still need to clean every single week once a week a water change siphon the gravel rinse the filter and wipe down the glass and accessories no outrageous scrubbing is necessary however and boiling bleaching etc is basically a no no  Aquarium Goldfish Brewery Marine aquarium Fish farming Discus (fish) Wine making Reef tank Rum Dishwashing Thermal power station Dry cleaning Tilapia Autonomous building Samuel Goldwyn Dishwasher Biodiesel Homebrewing Sento Axolotl Coffee Gar Sea-Monkey Menstrual cup Flush toilet Fossil fuel power plant Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Tofu Alcohol fuel Dairy Bong GunBound Shrimp farm Koi Fire extinguisher Casting Color Stage lighting Fume hood Dredge Microeconomics Suckermouth Catfish Sewage treatment Hamster Water purification Solar power Strap-on dildo Cruising (maritime) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Panama Canal RuneScape skills Hydrogen economy Hummingbird Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) M60 machine gun Dialysis Mattress Soap Slide rule PID controller Fishing Ron and Fez Japanese toilet Filling station Vinegar Coral reef Glossary of firefighting terms E85 Dodge Charger Siphon Wheel of Fortune Diaper Irrigation Lake Burley Griffin Laundry detergent Yacht Milk Nuclear power Sake Neil Gaiman Carburetor Jennifer Lopez Billboard Hot 100 Kosher foods Cuisine of Brazil Justification (theology) Seine (fishing) Habbo Hotel Striped bass Car washing techniques T-72 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mikoyan MiG-29 Wok Mussel Drill bit Samovar MS-06 Zaku II

two part filter question the instructions on my filter says that i should replace the filter cartridge every four weeks i thought bacteria were supposed to develope in the filter so how can they if i replace the cartridge monthly the other day i fished something out the aquarium with my hand just then i realized that i had just washed them with anti bacterial soap can this act kill off the bacteria i am trying to grow the instructions say to replace the cartridge every weeks because the carbon is unable to adsorb any more stuff by that time filters that have two replaceable cartridges are good because you can replace one and leave the old one in if your filter only has one pad then usually there is enough bacteria in the filter plants decorations gravel etc to prevent any fluctuations be careful with feeding right after replacing it you can also rinse the filter and reuse it there just won't be any activated carbon left you will want to stay on top of water changes if you decide to reuse your filters though the anti bacterial soap has been recently debated over it's effectiveness as long as the soap was completely rinsed from your hands there is nothing to worry about at this point there are people claiming that it doesn't even kill bacteria on hands so i wouldn't be too concerned for your biological filter medications on the other hand can wipe out your entire bio filter so be aware of this carbon will adsorb the chemicals so you would want to remove the filter anyway please email me if you have any questions  Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Water purification Agar plate Bacteria Common cold Carbon dioxide Marine aquarium Menstrual cup Anthrax Aquarium Sugar beet Dairy Textile manufacturing Brewery Hard water Carnivorous plant Shroud of Turin Tooth enamel Disinfection Activated carbon Escherichia coli O157:H7 Foodborne illness Photosynthesis Body piercing Coffee Immortality Cell (biology) Biology Gaia theory (science) Hand washing Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Iron Wok Swimming pool Please Save My Earth Biodiesel Water Water pollution Soap Fountain Halitosis Manicure Slow sand filter bed B3ta Food preservation Eutrophication Sugarcane Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fluoride therapy Global warming Autonomous building Dialysis Car washing techniques Theory of conduct Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Veganism Cheese Biogeochemical cycle Mosquito Biological pest control Nuclear fallout Bread Sterilization (microbiology) 2003 Invasion of Iraq Omega-3 fatty acid Origin of life Pneumonia Light pollution Fecal incontinence Hard disk Biochemistry Acetic acid Ulcerative colitis Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Ozone depletion Yerba mate Spam (electronic) Gram staining The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Shrimp farm Tilapia Sodium hypochlorite Breastfeeding Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Dishwasher Smegma Hydroponics Carbon dioxide sink Dishwashing Futurama (TV series - season 5) M16 (rifle) Abiogenic petroleum origin Abortion debate Organic farming Thermal depolymerization

gouramis and bettas new take on it i have a female dwarf gourami yes i am sure she's a female and an overly placid male betta they're currently relaxing in a heavily planted gallon tank with a few danio some cories and a small school of tetra this male betta is so relaxed he won't flare at himself he won't flare at all actually the same with the female gourami docile as ever i've seen no problems out of them and they generally seem to enjoy one another's company now here's the question i've heard good and bad about keeping dwarf gouramis and bettas together do these two sound likely to suddenly snap and tear each other apart or do i just have freak fish again you could try it but both being labyrnith fish you may run into problems i know what you mean though i have a very placid male betta who was so non aggressive i think he was raised by guppies o i had him with all kinds of different fish but never any gouramis the best thing to do is to try it and watch them both carefully for any signs of aggression if the the tank is planted heavily enough i don't think you would have any problems  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dwarf gourami Gourami Kissing gourami Hamster Danio Urinary incontinence Aquarium The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fish farming Anal sex Zebra Danio Tank USS Tunny (SS-282) Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Ty Cobb Dragon Booster Marine aquarium Tarantula Social rule Pearl Danio Domestic rabbit Perciformes Fish Discus (fish) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Basement Tapes New York Giants Hardcore punk Neon tetra Hydrogen economy Intelligent design Kender Ron and Fez Warrior (World of Warcraft) Milton H.

how does a protein skimmer work and do i need one for my gallon saltwater aquarium in my opinion you do need a protein skimmer in theory a skimmer actually removes waste products by placing them in a collection cup tiny bubbles that are produced in an a air water interface ie a small pump is the foundation of a skimmer waste molecules are atttracted to these tiny bubbles which float up into a cup thus it actually removes waste from your tank also with a bigger tank you should not have to perform more water changes small tank more water chemistry problems than a larger tank i have a gallon tank and do not have a skimmer on it  Aquarium Marine aquarium Brewery Reef tank Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment Dairy Autonomous building Carbon dioxide Seabird Blood Alcohol fuel P-47 Thunderbolt Fish farming Cell (biology) Hydrogen economy E85 Water (molecule) Sonoluminescence Biochemistry Carburetor Mitochondrion Rebreather Goldfish Bong Soap bubble Fire extinguisher Fossil fuel power plant Biodiesel Dry cleaning Shrimp farm Chemistry Gas turbine Gasoline Mass spectrometry Dwarf gourami Sugar beet Septic tank Hydrochloric acid Flush toilet Tilapia Technetium Fire fighting Oil platform Automobile emissions control Energy development Photosynthesis Sake Cold fusion Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Renewable energy Origin of life Naval mine Hydrogen chloride Carnivorous plant Chromatography Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Thermal depolymerization Hydrogen bond Hydroponics Siphon Milk Champagne (beverage) Swimming pool Cracking (chemistry) B-47 Stratojet Landfill Red blood cell Acetic acid Francis Crick Pebble bed reactor Protein Hard water Hanford Site Natural gas Intravenous therapy F-16 Fighting Falcon Tank Alternative biochemistry Wine making Thermal power station Cheese Nephron Liquid crystal Nuclear power Life Clownfish Tank truck Cavitation Glossary of firefighting terms Iron Vickers Valiant Menstrual cup Multiverse Plastic Ecology Light-dependent reaction Pump Kidney

hermit crabs as classroom pets i am considering getting some hermit crabs for my classroom this year i have visited hermit crabs com and read up on the care and everything but all of that is geared toward someone having them at home my question is what about the weekends will they generally be all right over a day weekend i would bring them home if it was an extended weekend but i'm hoping not to have to do that every weekend as i have a big glass tank and also it sounds like it would stress them out to be moved that often advice also about bathing the site i looked at recommended a bath once a week for those of you who have successfully kept hermit crabs kept them alive for their natural life spans how often do you bathe them thanks i want to make sure i do this right hermit crabs do not carry diseases please only answer if you actually keep some hermit crabs would be a great class room pet but they don't like loud noises and can get stressed easily what are the ages that you teach how many students are there in your classroom if you think that your students won't be loud and won't disturb the hermit crabs while they are sleeping during the day then they should be fine but if you think that will be loud and such then i would recommend that you don't get a hermit crab if you decide that you want a hermit crab or two in your class room then here are your answers to your questions weekends you are right taking a hermit crab home for only two days and moving them will be very stressful on a hermit crab they will be fine in the classroom as long as they have enough food and water some pet stores and even online pet stores sell water pillows made just for hermit crabs i would recommend that you get these for over the weekend here is the link http www petco com product esu reptile hermit crab water pillows aspx also www petco com has some good food packages for hermit crabs they are blocks filled with food that way you will know that the hermit crabs have enough food for the weekend here is the link http www petco com product hbh hermit crab vacation food aspx i would recommend that you don't feed the hermit crabs fruits or veggies over the weekend since they can get very stinky when you get back but feeding the hermit crabs fruits and veggies during the days that you are at the school would be great bathing bathing a hermit crab once a week is great but also putting a dish like the link below and filling it with distilled water or the second link below then putting the dish in the hermit crab tank is great it allows the hermit crabs to bathe themselves whenever they want also if they are running low on water they can drink from the dish too make sure though that you clean out the dish everyday and replace it water here are the links dish http www petco com product kritterz reptile fossil food and water dish aspx hermit crab water http www petco com product saltwater glub for hermit crabs aspx also make sure that you spray the hermit crabs down with some water the distilled water or the hermit crab water is good to put in the sprayer here is a good sprayer to get http www petco com product t rex crab island mr mister water sprayer aspx also make sure that you spray the corners of the hermit crab tank everyday that way when the hermit crabs molt they will have enough moisture spray the tank once a day hermit crabs are really fun pets to have but i would recommend that read up on them some more there are a few good hermit crabs out there that you should read here are a few http www petco com product hermit crabs for dummies aspx http www amazon com hermit crabs complete owners manual dp ref pd bbs sr ie utf s books qid sr http www amazon com quick easy hermit crab publications dp ref sr ie utf s books qid sr i highly recommend the last book i have that one and i love it thank you for taking this answer and good luck future vet  Coconut crab Hamster Domestic rabbit Garfield Upholstery Friends Cheese Chicken Thermal power station Apple Tofu Marine aquarium Mattress Mosquito Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Minor Harry Potter Beasts Pet skunk Plastic Urinary incontinence Tung Chung Guinea pig Kosher foods Hermit crab Cat Rule of St Benedict Sin City Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Discus (fish) Cruising (maritime) Professional wrestling match types Migraine GED Japanese tea ceremony Carnegie Mellon University Fahrenheit 9/11 HyperText Transfer Protocol Shrimp farm Professional wrestling holds Water Fancy rat Brewery Creatures in Bionicle Tooth A Course In Miracles Avenue Q World Wide Web Education in Japan Dog training Commodore 64 Canary Full Metal Panic?

aquarium setup i bought a gal tank there is tank hoods one for each half and cutouts for the filter and heater does it matter if i put the filter on the left or right and should the heater be on opposite sides of the filter or same side put it where you want makes no difference as long as the filter is turning over enough water for your setup than it doesnt matter where it is just as long as it is there for the heaters i personally like using smaller heaters so the heat is eveenly dispearsed through thye tank so one goes on one side and one on the other if you already have the one heatrer that is rated for your size tank should be about watts per gallon than again it doesnt matter just spend like dollars on thermometers so you can measure temperature near the heater and another on the other side of the tank away from the heater or if you have one of those heaters that can be fully submerged than put it right in the middle against the back wall sideways so you can get as close to evenly dispearsing the heat hope this helps and good luck with the new tank addition if you have a canister filter you can have the intake on one side and the output on the other so you can be moving more water in different areas of the tank if its a hang on back style filter than it doesnt matter j e t s jets jets jets hahah nice screen name btw  Brewery Marine aquarium Aquarium Reef tank Diesel engine Thermal power station Carburetor Tank Autonomous building Temperature Water heater Thermostat Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Apollo 13 Process control HVAC Biodiesel Loudspeaker PID controller Fire fighting Vacuum cleaner Cannabis cultivation Refrigerator Mars Exploration Rover Chevrolet Corvair Siphon Incandescent light bulb E85 Turbocharger Jet engine Transformer Glossary of firefighting equipment Furnace Textile manufacturing Ocean thermal energy conversion Solar panel MS-09 Dom Sewage treatment Energy Dodge Charger Samovar Motor oil Heat Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water purification Cold fusion Welding Stereoscopy Taikyoku shogi Dairy Peltier-Seebeck effect Calorimeter Transistor Vacuum tube Alcohol fuel Hydrogen economy Rail terminology Tai shogi Atomic Kitten Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dai dai shogi Light-emitting diode B-47 Stratojet Hydropower Dry cleaning Entropy Water supply Thermocouple Smoke-screen Circuit design Backstroke Butterfly stroke Fuel injection Wind power Electronic amplifier Renewable energy Swingout STS-87 Torpedo Gas turbine Japanese toilet Professional wrestling holds Swimming pool Hard disk Internal combustion engine Supercharger Gas turbine-electric locomotive Chevrolet Corvair engine Powder metallurgy Bong Portable stove Antenna (radio) Breaststroke STS-62 Oscilloscope Professional wrestling throws Air conditioning

do fish scales grow back my goldfish became caught between the filter and the wall of the fish tank i managed to free him but now all the scales under his belly have fallen off or been scraped off i have added some antibiotics to the tank to help protect the area but will they ever grow back and if so do you know how long it usually takes thanx hi psycgirl yes the scales on your goldfish will grow back but as he has lost a large number in addition to the antibiotic salt treatment you must ensure his tank water is absolutely perfect by regular partial water changes keep a close eye on your parameters the scales should all have regrown in a few weeks but the new growth may appear lighter than the old at first gradually darken to match his main colour now you are fixing is scales you need to ensure this doesn't happen again by re sighting the filter so the gap behind it is either way too small for any fish to get through or far enough away from the glass so they can pass behind it with ease if it is one of the internal type secured with suckers they function perfectly well simply stood on a solid surface such as a rock in the tank if this is not possible cut a piece of filter sponge to fit securely behind your filter blocking off access you can buy blocks of this for sponge filters from aquarium stores  Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Thermal power station Color Electrophysiology Filter (optics) Fish farming Low-pass filter Shrimp farm Dialysis Firearm Discus (fish) Brewery Firewall (networking) Sponge Wood Space Shuttle program Password Temperature Perl Biodiesel T-72 Combine (Half-Life 2) Knife Seismic retrofit Agar plate Circuit design Common cold Hydrogen economy Volleyball Hydroponics Polarization Reef tank Rigging The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Water purification Loudspeaker Transformer Floppy disk ALGOL 68 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Pointer Internal ballistics Color blindness Sunglasses Bretton Woods system Liquid crystal X86 assembly language Hamster Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Syphon Filter Airport Liquid crystal display Antarctic krill Hydraulic machinery Siphon Compiler optimization Poker jargon CPU cache GunBound Glass Electronic amplifier Hardware random number generator Autonomous building Items in the Metroid series Archery Trapping Cell (biology) Campfire Memoir '44 Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Diatom Light-emitting diode Digital photography Hemp Energy development Fancy rat PHP Glasses Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Flowering plant Stopping e-mail abuse Fishing Traffic light Menstrual cup Stereoscopy F-16 Fighting Falcon Clownfish Analog-to-digital converter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sodium chloride

is there anything wrong with this combination of fish ram green tiger barb betta blond guppy patrizi killifish sailfin molly celebes rainbow splashing tetra and true rummy nose tetra i'm buying a larger tank and i have been looking at fish i have read about all of them and i think that all the temperments on them were peaceful and maybe a couple semi aggressive ones is that a bad combination it really depends a lot on how big the tank is and how you decorate it bettas and rams are both territorial and won't live peacefully together it can work only if it's a large enough tank and well planted but for the most part the safest thing to do is choose one type or the other and run with it as mentioned barbs can be feisty and are also extremely active and can cause problems for your betta or your ram again if the tank is big and well decorated and the barbs kept in a good sized group it might work i don't know this for certain but you need to be careful with the killifish as well it very well may draw aggression from a betta and possibly the ram too so be careful if it were me i'd make it either a ram betta or killifish tank i'm partial to cichlids skip the barbs altogether and then go with the rest of the plan making sure to keep the rainbow and tetras in appropriate schools instead of the barbs i'd go with a school of corydora catfish or other bottom dweller since your tank already has an abundance of open water schoolers  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Poker jargon Sailfin Molly Livestock Shen Gong Wu Brewery Neon tetra Nickname Oscar (fish) Nuclear power Professional wrestling match types Carnivorous plant Pysanka Japanese tea ceremony Link (Legend of Zelda) Dairy Cichlid USS Tunny (SS-282) Hydrogen economy Fast bowling Gar Aquarium Live-bearing aquarium fish Theory of conduct Diving Eastern Front (World War II) Ammonite Marine aquarium Fishing Leopard Fish farming Professional wrestling attacks Tank CPU cache Equine conformation History of the tank Plant St. Louis Rams First-person shooter Extreme Programming Cardinal tetra Social rule Semi-trailer Barbed wire Freshwater angelfish BZFlag Redundant array of independent disks Dr. Seuss Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stairway Professional wrestling slang Dwarf gourami Shrimp farm Laptop Naval mine Princess Zelda Taikyoku shogi Stingray Mosquito Seine (fishing) Rainbow Islands USS Thresher (SS-200) Solar power Atlantic herring Green Day Creatures in Bionicle The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Jet engine The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sewage treatment Lake Malawi Color Strap-on dildo World Championship Wrestling Energy development Autonomous building Malachite green 21st Century Fox Arab-Israeli conflict USS Barb (SS-220) Brotherhood of Nod Theodicy Tank classification Zambezi Glossary of firefighting equipment Sea-Monkey RuneScape skills Thermal power station GunBound Super Bowl XXXVI Floppy disk Gin rummy Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Craps Homeschooling

there are bubbles under algea on my live rock what does this means is this good or bad what should i do algae undergoes photosynthesis just like plants so whenever the lights are on it takes in water and carbon dioxide from your fish and it releases oxygen so this might be what you're seeing is small bubbles of pure o that are being released in general this won't be a problem although you don't want to have it trapped under live rock being exposed to oxygen air will kill the beneficial bacteria on that part of the rock if what you're seeing is bubble algae like what's shown in the link above you'll want to try and remove this from the tank bubble algae will get to be a nuisance and if you break open one of the bubbles when it's in the tank it will release spores and reproduce i recommend removing the entire piece of live rock in a plastic bag or container before your next water change and cut scrape the bubbles off from the very base while the rock is in the bag container this way if one breaks it's not in the tank you can replace each piece and move on to another as long as none break if one does dump that water and get more from the tank you want the rock exposed to air as little time as possible then you can replace any dumped water as part of the water change just be certain that any bubbles are coming from the algae itself and not from a powerhead skimmer or the filter if these are your source adjust the water level filter flow rate or flow valves just enough to eliminate bubble production the bubbles these produce don't add dissolved oxygen to the water water movement circulates dissolved oxygen that dissolves at the water's surface the only piece of equipment that should produce bubbles is the skimmer but the bubbles should remain inside the column and not be carried out the return  Rebreather Sewage treatment Photosynthesis Aquarium Marine aquarium Water purification Brewery Biodiesel Bong Energy development Sea-Monkey Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Scuba set Algae Fish farming Thermal power station Reef tank Fossil fuel power plant E85 Pebble bed reactor Eutrophication Cell (biology) Decompression sickness Hydroponics Swimming pool Motor oil Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Plant Ecology Corrosion Carburetor Carbon dioxide sink Carnivorous plant Intravenous therapy Glossary of firefighting equipment Ice core Explosive material Fire fighting Plastic Diving regulator Hydrogen economy Cavitation Oxygen Liquid breathing Water (molecule) Wine making Gas metal arc welding Diving cylinder Chlorophyta Disinfection Carbon cycle Snowball Earth Siphon Terraforming Bacteria Soil life Acetic acid Irrigation Environmental concerns with electricity generation Blood Copper extraction RuBisCO Gasoline Water Casting Dry cleaning Water pollution Renewable energy 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Plankton Erosion Seabird Apollo 13 Lung Hydrogen sulfide Pulmonary alveolus Earth's atmosphere Pollution Welding Champagne (beverage) Sugar beet Coffee Respiratory system Shrimp farm Permian-Triassic extinction event Bubble Bobble Mosquito Stoma Wind power Drill bit Weathering

should i defrost my frozen blood worms before feeding i just bought frozen bloodworms they come in frozen cubes cubes should i defrost the worms and feed my fishes or just pop the whole cube inside the tank after defrosting a cube can i put half in the tank and store the rest in the freezer again advise pls thnks i would defrost the wholde cube as in my experience it is quite difficult to cut in half a fully frozen cube the fact that the cube is frozen will not alter the temperature of the water although most fish will not readily go for food that is frozen in the case of goldfish they will be greedy and can hurt themselves trying to gobble it down to quick in my opinion i have always defrosted the cube all the way before feeding and discarded any leftover do not refreeze whats left as it can become contaminated with bacteria which will harm your fish live bloodworm are potential disease carriers and freeze dried bloodworm are not good for fancy goldfish as they can cause bloat however if you have tropical or marine fish then freeze dried bloodworm or prepacked 'delicia' which is bloodworm in jelly would be just as good as frozen  Refrigerator Tofu Goldfish Diseases of the honeybee Food preservation Domesticated turkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Axolotl French fries Ice cream Gar Myxobolus cerebralis Breastfeeding Marine aquarium Dairy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Aquarium Bread Ice Freeze drying Omega-3 fatty acid Shark Fish farming Discus (fish) Slow cooker Philip J.

how do i raise the ph level in my tank really the first question to ask yourself is way you want to adjust the ph in your tank the vast majority of freshwater fish will do very well in a wide range of ph and unless your water is outside the range of about you really don't want to change it altering the ph is rarely needed for the health of the fish altering the ph of a tank with fish in it is tricky and dangerous to the fish maintaining the altered ph is tricky and very time consuming having a ph different than that at your local shop makes adding new fish a royal pain and extremely stressful to the fish your best bet is simply to leave your ph alone and use your regular tap water given all of that if for some reason you feel you need to raise the ph in your tank the best way to do that is with some crushed coral added to the filter or in a small bag hidden in the tank remember though when you do your regular weekly water changes you will need to adjust the new water to match the ph of your tank water and a fast method for this is with a touch of baking soda mm  Marine aquarium Brewery Goldfish Illegal drug trade Fish farming Transformer Shrimp farm Aquarium Discus (fish) Hypoglycemia Coffee Sewage treatment Carburetor Dairy Fishing Team Fortress Classic Carbon dioxide Fly fishing Fugu Cocaine Electrophysiology Coral reef Bread Fish Betting (poker) Combine (Half-Life 2) Timpani Rebreather Lake Tea Reef tank Water Analog-to-digital converter Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hydroponics Rum Mattress Ecco the Dolphin Scientology beliefs and practices Jet engine Thermal power station View camera Water purification Bong Netfilter/iptables Motor oil Blackjack Tofu Wetland Breastfeeding Cheating in Counter-Strike Clown loach Ice cream Plastic Swimming Poker jargon Fire fighting Hypnosis Kosher foods RuneScape Mini-Games Swimming pool Goby PID controller Finding Nemo Clownfish Potato chips RuneScape skills Naruto jutsu Equine conformation Artillery Tank Motorcycle BZFlag Insulin Seismic retrofit Autonomous building Omega-3 fatty acid Ecology Angling T-72 Chocolate Economics Dead Sea Trombone Yacht 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Inflation Artificial neural network Craps Organic food French fries Scuba set Aspartame Dialysis Taboo food and drink Internal ballistics Bicycle helmet Tai Chi Chuan

suggestions regarding fish tank i am planning to buy a fish tank i have had it before but my fish never lived long please provide suggestions about water to fish ratio fish food what kind of fish is easy to keep should i keep any plants in the fish tank etc easiest to keep are tropical fish since they are generally easy to maintain buy tank filter and heater unless you live in tropical country and your tank isnt in an air con room so you dont need heater first zero fish fill tank with water check for leaks first if not leaking after a day put in filter and heater and start them running if you like plants now is the time to put them in clean gravel and put in gravel and also plant the plants into the gravel however plants have possibility of carrying disease or pests but then again so do fish and plants do give some cover for the shyer types of fish i like those swordshaped plants and also those frilly types whatever you like is fine but you may have to weigh them down in the substrate gravel one week later put in a couple of fishes always incrementally add fish until length of all fish at adult size length of tank general guide if you want to put in more fish add a airstone air pump required and ensure your filter has enough power to filter it for starters keep smaller tropical fish red blue color of neon and cardinal tetras are very nice in groups of can also put some bottom feeders like corydoras mini catfish and some yellow orange fish like swordtails and guppies as for feeding stick to fish flakes live foods tend to contain disease change water weekly about and clean filter once a week too or if you got a powerful filter whenever recommended  Marine aquarium Thermal power station Aquarium Fish farming Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Autonomous building Brewery Shrimp farm Sewage treatment Tilapia Energy development Dairy Dwarf gourami Coffee Solar power Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dry cleaning Basement E85 Houseplant Fossil fuel power plant Tank Dialysis Rail terminology Antarctic krill Cannabis cultivation Carnivorous plant Hydroponics Stock car (rail) Diesel engine Light-emitting diode Fume hood Motor oil Hydrogen economy Reef tank Hamster Mosquito M16 (rifle) Krill ALGOL 68 Internal ballistics Tofu Cruising (maritime) Goldfish Swimming pool Bonsai Three Mile Island Japanese tea ceremony Novelty (locomotive) Neon tetra Koi Breastfeeding Top-bar hive M60 machine gun Atlantic herring Textile manufacturing Transformer Three-phase electric power Gar Sponge Hydraulic machinery GunBound Airport Liquid crystal display Albatross Water supply Fancy rat Axolotl Weekly World News Carbon dioxide Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Poker jargon Saturn V Kashrut Drainage Phase-locked loop Anchor Nuclear power Maize Whaling Shark Pok__mon Abilities Kissing gourami Water purification Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Space Shuttle program Seabird Banana BS 1363

is it safe to put the small two inch turtles in a fishtank freshwater the ones they sell in chinatown they are called red ear sliders and most likely no it is not safe they usually eat fish not always but i wouldn't risk it also they produce a ton of waste so if they don't eat the fish they will prob dirty up the water enough to cause problems if you refering to china town in la you bought illegal turtles in the state of ca it is illegal to sell a turtle if it is less then inches the two turtles need a very large tank or pond and a large filter to be healthy they will reach about inches when full grown they also need an uv light to remain healthy or be allowed to bask in the sun i think they are cute little guys but most people do not realize how large they get and how much upkeep they need to thrive they either die or become really unhealthy if not properly taken care of and after they grow big the novelty wears off and no one wants them anymore it's rather sad i really only suggest having one if you have an outside pond they can live in good luck with them but if you like your fish keep them out of the tank  Aquarium Fish farming Nuclear power Snapping turtle Goldfish Hard disk Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Turtle Hamster Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Leatherback Sea Turtle Chinatown Tetrapod Fugu Sea turtle Humphrey Bogart Fishing Chinook salmon Domestic rabbit Japanese tea ceremony Hamburger Shark Health insurance MapleStory Pittwater Council Gramophone record Factory farming Characters in the Smurfs Environmental concerns with electricity generation Whaling Tank Tattoo Brewery Swimming pool Fancy rat Autonomous building Softball Guinea pig Timeline of alternative rock Dairy Bonsai Economy of the United States Ecology Roman eating and drinking Tobacco smoking Water Foodborne illness E85 Plesiosaur Dog Crayfish Tofu Tuatara Cruising (maritime) Smoke-screen Series finale Aquaculture Tooth Finding Nemo Confidence trick Teen Girl Squad Rocko's Modern Life Pitaten Veganism Menstrual cup Characters of Naruto Atkins Nutritional Approach Light pollution Tai Chi Chuan GunBound Stage lighting Reptile Infantilism Growth hormone treatment Sun Firework Body piercing M16 (rifle) Crocodile Treehouse of Horror XV Kylie Minogue Physical attractiveness Havanese AFI 100 Years series Vitamin C Unreal Animal Crossing Dinosaur Reef tank Vegetarianism Smelt Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Dialysis Quotation mark Peanut

dark of light substrate my friend gave me a gallon tank that's already cycled but doesn't have much substrate i have a few question what are the advantages and disadvantages of using light and or dark substrate should i just get some ugly substrate and then buy some carpeting plant so that it will cover the every inch of the tank's bottom is there an advantage of doing this beside it looking really awesome as a carpeting plant is java moss the most undemanding and easy to take care of dark substrate will show off your fish's colors better food that falls to the bottom will show up better but fish waste won't show up very well light substrate will drain the color from your fish fish waste will show up better and that's all i can think of now i wouldn't recommend it because you'll need good lighting and co fertilization to maintain that plant ztm  Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Aquarium Houseplant Autonomous building Tilapia Biodiesel Fish farming Moss Discus (fish) Carnivorous plant Kissing gourami Dwarf gourami Hydrogen economy Toyota Prius Vitreous enamel Lake Reef tank Shrimp farm Light-emitting diode Eutrophication Goldfish Nuclear power Inkjet printer Thermal power station Dairy Printed circuit board Hemp Flush toilet Color space Pachypodium ambongense Fossil fuel power plant Sea-Monkey Agriculture Stairway Basement Vermicompost Pachypodium baronii Poker jargon Dragon Booster Cannabis cultivation Transistor Fish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Pachypodium Axolotl Potato The Amazing Race Environmental concerns with electricity generation Kasparov versus The World Coffee RuBisCO Nuclear power plant Carpet Brewery Nutrition Photosynthesis Yohoho!

cost of small fish tank setup and upkeep i'm interested in getting a fish but i was wondering what a new setup cost for a small fish tank and about what regualr upkeep is just looking for a ballpark estimate lets see the smallest i'd go with is a gallon unless you want something really small with a betta that would only be about the top fin gallon kit is the cheapest way to go cheaper then buying it all individually gallon kit with out heater made for goldfish gallon kit with heater for tropical fish gravel and decor at the least can be more if you want fancy decor and plastic plants fish depends on what kind you get community are the most colorful hardiest and cheapest depending on what you pick i wouldn't get goldfish for that small of a tank they grow big fast but if you did do goldfish i'd only get one thats the kit comes with all the chemicals and food you need to get started monthly cost chemicals and food not that much it's gotta be way less then the food will last you months if you feed appropriately the chemical's going to last a while too you only need to clean once a month one item that doesn't come with the kit that is a much have is a tank vacuum the easiest quickest way to clean your tank it'll cost less then for a manual one have a store employee show you how it's used it's simple good luck they aren't really that hard or too much work once you get the hang of it so adding it all up your looking at minimum can be higher with more expensive fish and decor ps make sure you research the kind of fish you decide to get there are simple steps to keeping the fish healthy some people think you just dump the water in and dump the fish in and they end up losing a lot of money patience that way just ask the employees at the store you go to on how to keep the fish healthy and how to take care of the tank good luck  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Marine aquarium Biodiesel Aquarium Microeconomics Sea-Monkey Alcohol fuel Fish farming Paintball Japanese tea ceremony Dairy Solar power Domestic rabbit Thermal power station Wal-Mart Brewery Illegal drug trade Poker jargon Fossil fuel power plant Cannabis cultivation E85 Hydroponics Cruising (maritime) Bong Plastic Emergency preparedness Taxation in the United States Computer Tilapia Organic farming Strap-on dildo Reef tank Discus (fish) Nintendo Koi Fancy rat Health insurance Knife Welding Shrimp farm Chocolate Sewage treatment Coffee Energy development Dishwasher Tax Fugu Nuclear power Milk Social rule Galactic Civilizations Mutual fund Bulk vending P-47 Thunderbolt Carburetor Textile manufacturing Bonsai Diesel engine Toyota Prius Radio controlled airplane Capital accumulation Fasting Surplus value Filling station RuneScape quests Floppy disk Solar cell MAME Quicksort Organic food Axolotl Environmental concerns with electricity generation Yacht In-N-Out Burger Cable television El-Fish Diamond Solar panel Social Security debate (United States) Ra (board game) Tlingit Agriculture Redundant array of independent disks Credit card United States Postal Service Japanese toilet Volleyball Hard disk

how many times should you change the water in your saltwater tank in a month if i am breeding my clownfish should i get an algae eater honestly i dont think your gonna have great sucess with your breeding project not to say it isnt possible but you have a lot of research to do on your own where yahoo answers isnt gonna get you the info you need if you arent even aware of how often to clean the tank then you have much to learn i am willing to offer any help i can but you just dont seem willing to do the research and just expect the answers to come to you many people have different methods the work for them and you have to figure out what method works for you try just keeping clownfish for months happy and healthy then worry about attempting to breed them i have much more expierence propagating corals than i do with breeding clownfish being that your tank is very new the chance of clownfish breeding in your system is very small since i read one of your last posts saying that the tank has only been setup for a max of weeks you havent even cycled your tank yet for now i assume you already jumped into adding the clownfish into your systme so you just made your job harder you must monitor you ph but more importantly amonia nitrite and nitrates once you notice your amonia reaching dangerous levels where you will see the fish be unhappy that is when you should do a water change clownfish are hardy fish but not in comparison to damsels or green chromis which are also damsels just a more peaceful damsel so when you do water changes now you are prolonging the nitrogen cycle but if the clowns are already in the tank you have to do it to keep them alive once the tank has completed the cycle you should do weekly water changes if there is one thing you have to learn with keeping saltwater fish is patience and i cant stress that enough copperhead or magicman will be able to better help you as far as breeding goes for i have never even attempted to breed any marine fish as far as algae eaters go you should probobaly add a few nassarius snails and some mexican turbo snails i dont know if having those will have any affect on the fish breeding but i assume it shouldnt hope this helps and good luck  Marine aquarium Clownfish Fish farming Shrimp farm Eutrophication Aquarium Sewage treatment Biology Percula Clownfish Coral reef Marine biology Extreme Programming Reef tank Algae Fugu Insulin Tank Nutrient A Course In Miracles Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dog Biodiesel Biogeochemical cycle Ozone depletion Baseball Stars Prostate cancer RuneScape Mini-Games Discus (fish) Cyanide God Emperor of Dune Diatom Ozone hole Hydrogen sulfide Ammonia EastEnders Explosive material Software engineering Fauna of Australia Goldfish Fox hunting Breastfeeding Microeconomics Social rule Zerg $ale of the Century Clinical depression Tilapia Organic farming Brewery Rebreather Photosynthesis Species Albatross 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carbon dioxide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientology beliefs and practices Angling Ecology Terraforming E85 Coral Fly fishing Friends Chlorophyta Algal bloom Nuclear power 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Toyota Prius Advance Wars: Dual Strike Sea level rise Shark Fancy rat City of Heroes Octopus Swimming pool Infantilism Tidal power Atomic Kitten Chinook salmon Singlish Diving Veganism Gas metal arc welding Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Lake Burley Griffin Myxobolus cerebralis Axolotl Fertility awareness Pitaten Fishing Knife Ginny Weasley Diseases of the honeybee Sea anemone ALGOL 68 Gray Wolf Green Revolution

when you change your saltwater tank how much of it should you change thanx it actually depends on what is happening within your tank is the norm with everything happening as it should be and it should be done weekly simply due to the fact that there are trace minerals within the salt mixture that marine life needs in order to survive if you are having issues with ammonia or nitrite your going to want to do a larger percentage of a water change in order to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals within your water column this in conjunction with figuring out what caused the increase in these toxic substances is necessary if you have high nitrates you are going to want to increase the frequency of your water changes and the percentage of water your change then add something that will aid in nutrient export such as a macro algae on these later two once you get your parameters back under control you can proceed with the weekely changes you can read more at the below listed link  Sewage treatment Ammonia Marine aquarium Eutrophication Nutrient Shrimp farm Aluminium Biogeochemical cycle Explosive material Nitric acid Uranium Ecology Fish farming Hydroponics Nutrition Soil pH Rebreather Hydrogen sulfide E85 Illegal drug trade Concentration Cyanide Water (molecule) Potassium nitrate Hydrogen economy Carnivorous plant Nitrogen Carbon dioxide Nuclear reactor Aquarium Gasoline Origin of life Coral reef Fertilizer Water purification Water pollution Methamphetamine Plankton Green Revolution Plutonium Controlled Substances Act Chlorophyta Coffee Gas metal arc welding Mineral Biodiesel Water Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sodium chloride Organic food Food preservation Welding Nuclear weapon design Ethylene glycol Ozone depletion Cocaine Chemical reaction Portland cement Phase (matter) Inflation Edible salt Sulfuric acid DDT Polarization Pollution Reef tank Alcohol fuel Helium Diatomaceous earth Lithium salt Pebble bed reactor Incineration Rocket fuel Ozone hole Nuclear power Loudspeaker Chlorine Fire extinguisher Global warming and agriculture Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Depleted uranium CPU cache Natural gas Corrosion Biochemistry PID controller Transformer Sulfur Hard water Ocean thermal energy conversion Algae Duesberg hypothesis Ammonium nitrate Organic farming Fluorescent lamp Microeconomics Milk Healthy eating Tocopherol

once the salinity is perfect and the ammonia nitrites nitrates are at can i put in my clownfish thanx for a marine biologist to say get some anemones for them leads me to believe there isnt truth behind that anemones shouldnt be kept in a new system they may thriove in the wild but not very well in captivity you should by no means get an anemone yet they have high lighting demands and are by no means hardy inverts clownfish do not need an anemone to thrive in a home aquarium i have a clownfish and a carpet anemone and my clownfish has never once even attempted to host the anemone if i were you i would stray off the clownfish and try keeping green chromis much hardier fish and they are perfect to someone new to the hobby keep green chromis alive for months then add your clownfish green chromis are like bucks and any good store will be more than happy to take them back once your tank cycled and is ready for the clowns  Clownfish Marine aquarium Percula Clownfish Aquarium Symbiosis Biology Sea anemone Reef tank Marine biology Finding Nemo Fish farming Biogeochemical cycle Nitrogen Monterey Bay Aquarium Shrimp farm Fauna of Australia Anemone nemorosa Jellyfish Ammonia Green swordtail Anemone Nitrogen cycle Discus (fish) Fish Tilapia Eutrophication Coral reef Shedd Aquarium Halfbeak Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Hydrogen economy Autonomous building Guppy Nitric acid Toyota Prius Timeline of alternative rock Cyanide Antarctic krill Professional wrestling match types Cannabis cultivation Butterflyfish Sailfin Molly Salt Pittsburgh Steelers Ammonium nitrate Potassium nitrate El-Fish Hydrogen sulfide Brackish water Nutrient Hybrid vehicle Clown loach Donald Neilson Orca Amyl nitrite Sodium chloride Corydoras Frontier in Space Biological dispersal Siphon Happiness Goldfish Origin of life Falconry Gas mantle Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Octopus Professional wrestling throws Sodium nitrite Protoss Cat Laurel and Hardy Tidal power Rocko's Modern Life Town gas Green Goblin White Cloud Mountain Minnow Bonnie and Clyde Water (molecule) Myxobolus cerebralis Gas turbine CPU cache English grammar Agriculture Natural gas Seijuu Sentai Gingaman Food preservation Cnidocyte Goby Poker jargon Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Gar Bicycle lighting Zebra Danio M60 machine gun Shark Domestic rabbit Georgia Aquarium

fish tank and sand advice i have a fish tank with sand instead of rocks i think the silt is killing my filter motor has anyone had experience with this any advice i have had some issues with this as well i solved my issues by removing everything from the tank except the sand and the water from here you can do things depending on weather it's cycled or not uncycled remove the sand and put some of it into a bucket remove the water from the tank and refill fill the bucket about way with water and stir the heck out of it wait seconds and dump the water repeat untill it runs crystal clear then do it for all the sand return it to the tank let it settle try the filter and do water changes on any remaining particles then cycle the tank and add you stuff cycled this is risky but it could save your filter remove everything and turn off the filter stir the heck out of you tank let it settle for about seconds to min then do a water change after a few days repeat untill you water is cleared up shortly after stirring min this will save some bacteria and hopefully not ruin your chemistry to bad definatly test your tank and let it cycle since your filter will still have bacteria and some will be left from the sand it won't take to long mine was done in about weeks or less if your sand is very fine then wait longer befor dumping the bucket changing water since it will take longer to settle that should work and if not find new larger grain sized sand for the top layer i hear play sand works well for this but you need to clean it really good i don't know about that personally i'm testing it in a tank right now actually and it seams ok so far but i haven't tested the water yet  Brewery Sewage treatment Water purification Opportunity rover Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Sand Dairy Casting The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie E85 Thermal power station Ecology of Hong Kong Bong USS Tunny (SS-282) Electrophysiology Nuclear fallout Motor oil Biodiesel Fire extinguisher Pebble bed reactor Hash table Polymerase chain reaction Cruising (maritime) Apollo 8 Web crawler Heinkel He 100 Soil Carbon dioxide Tank Shot of Love Water pollution Golf Time Diesel engine Apollo 13 STS-51-L Drill bit Sedimentary rock Fossil fuel power plant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sento Dredge Dead Sea Shen Gong Wu Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Yerba mate B-47 Stratojet Liquid crystal display Agar plate STS-114 CPU cache M60 machine gun Aquarium Poker jargon Liquid crystal Diseases of the honeybee Fast bowling Tier One Acetic acid Anchor Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fire fighting Coming of Age (TNG episode) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Sandstone Environmental concerns with electricity generation RuneScape quests Nuclear power Hardware random number generator Mattress Mars Exploration Rover Dialysis Bloom filter Sediment Volleyball Glacier The Dalek Invasion of Earth GunBound Cannabis cultivation M16 (rifle) Extreme Programming Refrigerator Campfire Lightning John F.

why is this fish so popular i've been seeing a few people asking about keeping this fish called an arowana on here when i googled it i saw this fish gets pretty big we have a gallon tank in our home and we keep some clown loaches and a couple oscars in it this fish looks nice but if it gets that big i would think that would cost alot of money wouldn't it are these fish hard to care for and would you reccomend one and why thanks arowanas especially the asian species are only found in a few countries within south east asia they are getting rare in the wild and are protected under cites some people likes to keep large fishes and other love rare species with the improvement in aqua culture technology acquiring this fish is now possible as there have been successful farm cultured fishes available in those countries the law in the west still forbids or makes it very difficult for westerners to obtain these fish therefore there are also people who are into fishes that no one else keeps kinda like eating the forbidden fruit even if you can acquire one it wouldn't come cheap and the grace and majestic attitude of this fish only comes only when the fish is mature so you gotta invest and take good care of it before you get any returns personally i don't think it's hard to care for as with any fishes knowledge of it's requirements pristine water and plenty of room to swim will ensure that your pet is happy arowana feed on insects worms feeder fishes and some even pellets so that ain't too fussy and eats what most predatory fishes eats and whether it's nice beauty is in the eyes of the beholder personally i love the look of the matured specimens in asia espeically with the chinese the arowana is said to bring the keeper luck and prosperity thats another reason why they are so sort after  Chicken Shrimp farm Gar Discus (fish) Goldfish Hamster Rice Clown loach Marine aquarium Cheetah Domestic rabbit Poker jargon Clownfish Tilapia Animal Crossing Agriculture Kashrut Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Apple Theory of conduct Pysanka Salmon Aquarium Kosher foods Myxobolus cerebralis Shark Durian Monster Rancher monsters Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Taboo food and drink Fishing Seabird Whaling Economic history of Canada Cat Mushroom hunting Loach Original sin Spider RuneScape quests Nile crocodile Rise of Nations Aquaculture Aqua Teen Hunger Force Bat Tarantula Cuisine of Malaysia American Alligator Beetle Gray Wolf Chinese cuisine Physical attractiveness Summa Theologiae Care Bears Garfield Giant Panda Plastic Hunting Fugu American individualist anarchism Economy of Africa Axolotl Cliff Richard Orca Halfbeak Hydrogen economy Lamprey Guns, Germs, and Steel French cuisine Killifish Rich Mullins Fruits Basket Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tlingit Dairy Sea-Monkey Sauna Bamboo Lake Burley Griffin Vegetarianism Coelacanth Conker's Bad Fur Day Characters in the Smurfs Mail-order bride Patent Free trade Humphrey Bogart MMORPG

baby mollies i recently moved my fry from a hatchery to a gallon empty tank to grow i haven't done this in a while and they are one month old right now how old are the babies when you can determine their gender how old are they when you see the beginnings of a lyretail how do you feed fry in a gallon tank what type of food makes them grow bigger if they all live what do i do with baby mollies at the most i can only keep they should be sexually mature by about months males who are not sexually mature will look like females so even if you can see the anal fins at a young age it might not be what it looks like it is not sure i'd do a small pinch kind of grounded up between your fingers of tropical fish flakes they sell fry food that claims to make the baby grow fast but it's just a gimmick to make money of all the ones i've used i haven't noticed any difference i think anything that claims it'll make them bigger is another gimmick i think its how often you feed them that is going to make them grow bigger and faster i'd feed them a tiny bit times a day well see if you can find friends who want them or advertise them as free on your local craigslist because that's honestly the only way you are going to get rid of them unless you don't mind them being fed to bigger fish fish stores are not going to want to buy them since they breed so easily if a fish store does accept them as in they might take them from you for free they'll prob just feed them to some bigger fish  Shark Clownfish Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Breastfeeding Goldfish Gender role Salmon Milk Fish and chips Hamburger Seabird Sailfin Molly Tilapia Pizza Gender Hamster Infantilism Anal sex Blue Whale Platypus Fugu Halfbeak Fish anatomy Fast-food restaurant Dairy Pet skunk Cable television Dwarf gourami Krill Marine aquarium Toilet Atlantic herring Ostrich Orca Aquarium McDonald's Animal Crossing Alcohol fuel Myxobolus cerebralis Condom Bird migration The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bird Zebra Danio Leatherback Sea Turtle Bat Ant Breakfast Australian bass RuneScape skills Tetrapod Best Buy Theory of conduct MMORPG Effeminacy French fries Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sex assignment Kitten Orgasm Albatross Burger King Cuisine of Denmark Food and Drug Administration Cuisine of Malaysia Life insurance Paintball Britney Spears Walleye Mountain Gorilla Organic farming Mutual fund Vegetarianism Kissing gourami Advertising Sex Married... with Children Urinary incontinence Jon Secada Stock car (rail) RuneScape quests Nerpa Muskellunge Rum Eid ul-Fitr P-47 Thunderbolt Domestic rabbit Biodiesel History of intersex surgery Zerg American lobster Humpback Whale Phoebe Buffay's songs

do i need a heater for my fish i am getting a gallon tank with male mollies and about male guppies my room right now is degrees farenheit won't a heater over heat my tank also does it turn off when my tank is a certain degree turn on when it lowers etc i have never really owned a large aquarium before any help would be appreciated mollies and guppies can survive without a heater i've done it many times they are hardy fish they'll be fine without one just make sure you fill up the tank and have the filter running for hours before you add them this will give the water time to cycle it's bacteria good bacteria that the fish need and become room temperature also buy some water conditioner this is a chemical that removes the chlorine from tap water it needs to be used when you start a tank and every time you clean the tank when you clean the tank only take of the water out a time with a siphon most new fish owners make the mistake of changing all the water at one time and killing all their fish or some because of it the water has good bacteria in it that the fish need so never change all the water at one time good luck kudos on getting all males we won't see you in a month posting the question my mollies and guppies had so many babies what do i do  Marine aquarium Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sewage treatment Autonomous building Fossil fuel power plant Sea-Monkey Brewery Thermal power station Water purification HVAC Refrigerator Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Dry cleaning Solar power Coffee Tilapia Wine making E85 Fire fighting Hydrogen economy Goldfish Water Sauna Swimming pool Dairy SS Andrea Doria Biodiesel Thermostat Water supply Fish farming Disinfection Dishwasher Fish Water heater Gar Motor oil Ozone depletion Yoghurt Pocket cruiser Agar plate Live-bearing aquarium fish Diesel engine Energy development Chlorine Axolotl Fugu Clownfish PID controller Polychlorinated biphenyl Cruising (maritime) Toyota Prius Water (molecule) Ozone hole USS Tunny (SS-282) Flush toilet Myxobolus cerebralis Smoke-screen Chevrolet Corvair Sake Carburetor Energy Slow cooker Hydrogen sulfide Samovar Guppy Eutrophication Carbon dioxide Renewable energy Haloalkane Titanium Diseases of the honeybee Hyperthermia Washing machine Sento Sailfin Molly Milk Fuel cell Cyanide Shrimp farm Transformer Discus (fish) Air conditioning Furnace Survival skills Houseplant Slow sand filter bed Ozone Dialysis Bong Hot air balloon Photosynthesis Hard water Alkane

a plastic peanut butter jar for a betta my betta lives in a reg large size plastic peanut butter jar despite that he's five years old and just seemingly start to have problems should i change the jar and how is ammonia poisoning created because he has kind of reddish gills now should i change the water everyday now for a change he also has this small gole in his pectoral fin the front fin someone suggested pimafix but does betta water conditioner work like pimafix two years ago i used betta water conditioner when his tail got this hole too and he healed i would say yes change the jar or change the water in the jar i wouldn't recommend anything less than a gallon filtered tank for bettas they sell these tanks cheap at petsmart under you can buy a gallon kit top aqua scene for or get a standard rectangular gallon aquarium and buy the filter air pump substrate and a silk plant after buying everything you'll be out tops make sure you read up on tank cycling prior to adding the betta to a new tank and that will give you more insight into ammonia and nitrate levels you may want to keep the betta in a cleaner jar until the tank has sufficiently cycled ammonia levels are caused by waste from the betta and excess food in the jar in a peanut butter size jar you'd have to conduct a water change every few days to keep the ammonia level under control the redness on his gills is most likely caused by by irritation from high ammonia levels or high chlorine levels if his water is untreated his gills are essentially burning from the ammonia he may also flare his gills more often in order to sooth the burn if he had more room he would be swimming rapidly or darting to also help cool the burning if you haven't already change the water now use a betta conditioner to remove any heavy metals chloramine and chlorine from any water you add to the jar pimafix treats bacterial and fungal infections he could have fin rot but fin rot generally starts on the outer edge of the fin and works it's way to the base betta water conditioner doesn't treat infections as i mentioned above if you used it two years ago it possibly cleared his water and he healed on his own try looking for medications dosed for bettas to avoid complications remember drop the cash and get that gallon tank setup the betta will be happier and it will be much more attractive to look at than a peanut butter jar good luck and take care of that little guy and keep him around for many more years edit hey your betta is fairly old if old age is his problem and he's unforuntately on his way out then there's not too much you can do about nature always takes its course however you'll have a nice and proper setup for your next betta or your current betta will have a very comfortable and happy reamainder of his life  Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Ammonia Aquarium E85 Dairy Hydrogen economy Plastic Thermal power station Fish farming Carburetor Dry cleaning Nuclear power Asthma Peanut butter Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Air conditioning Ozone depletion P-47 Thunderbolt Motor oil Jet engine Water (molecule) Ozone hole Coffee Explosive material Carnivorous plant Biodiesel Alternative biochemistry Nutrition Solar power Swimming Psoriasis Reef tank Poison Sodium hypochlorite Microeconomics Common cold Veganism Omega-3 fatty acid Natural gas Peanut Fire fighting Insulin Energy development Malaria Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Iron Breastfeeding Nitrogen Ocean thermal energy conversion Vitamin C Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Sterilization (microbiology) Bong Sun Diseases of the honeybee Cancer Chlorine Toyota Prius Hydrogen sulfide Alcohol fuel Floppy disk Tank Titanium Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease Tofu Hydrogen Town gas Glass Dwarf gourami Terran (StarCraft) Tetrapod Loudspeaker Hypoglycemia Sauna Seismic retrofit Swimming pool Diarrhea Haloalkane Diving suit HIV test Acne Diesel engine

african cichlid my mom just rescued an oscar that is about almost inches long we met this lady at walmart who said that she had just moved in to a new apartment and she found the oscar a african cichlid and a plecostomus all in a gallon tank she doesn't know how long they had been there but their water was absolutely filthy we moved the oscar in to a gallon aquarium but we don't have anywhere else to put the african cichlid so my mo put him in with the oscar until we can find him a good safe home we put the plecostomus at home in our gallon tank with small angel fish a small clown knife gouramis and another plecostomus this one being long we know that the oscar will eventually eat the african cichlid but we need to know what the african cichlid is compatible with so that we can move him hopefully before that happens we just need to know what he can go with and what he can't go with any links tips and suggestions will work thank you so much here is a link to a picture for jon v but it says unidentified african cichlid fish so i don't know but it is him http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages fp dafrican bcichlid ei dutf fr dyfp t b d w h imgurl www oceanlight com fthumbs f jpg rurl http a f fwww oceanlight com fspotlight php fimg d size kb name jpg p african cichlid type jpeg no tt oid d e ei utf i have to say that your intentions are noble i think that you have bitten off more than you can chew the picture is of a yellow lab which is usually a fairly mild mannered mbuna cichlid from lake malawi this is what i would do move the angels clown knife and the gouramis to the gallon place the oscar in the you should try to give the yellow lab to a pet store use the phone book and tell them that you have a yellow lab ciclid that you need to get rid of and ask them if they will take it many will the reason i told you to put the oscar in the is because the clown knife is going to need to get a little bit of size on him but he does not need to be with the angels for too much longer the knife will get huge eventually it should get along with the oscar in the when it gets around inches long the reason i said you should give the yellow lab away is because it should really be only with other mbuna cichlids and they would need at least a to gallon tank please email me if you have any questions  Cichlid Dwarf gourami Lake Malawi Digital photography JPEG Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Knife Garfield Drill bit Gmail Panama Canal Lake Tanganyika Shaggy dog story Freshwater angelfish Clownfish Goldfish Friends Tilapia Hamster The Inside Marine aquarium Sluggy Freelance The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an HyperText Transfer Protocol PNG Aquarium Ajax (programming) Rift Valley lakes Johnny 5 Search engine Plame affair Zambezi RuneScape quests Jack Dempsey (fish) The Fairly OddParents GIF The Amber Spyglass Good Morning, Vietnam Suckermouth Catfish Phishing RuneScape cheats Sin City Oplan Bojinka Fishing World Wide Web Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clown loach PHP Bob and George Refrigerator car Insulin Floppy disk Piccolo Junior Saga Resident Evil: Apocalypse The Subtle Knife Thermal power station HTTP cookie ITunes Cross site scripting Live-bearing aquarium fish Mushroom hunting Rei Ayanami Web page Goatse.cx Associative array Opera (web browser) Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Ron and Fez Infantilism Oscar Wilde Bratislava The Critic Samuel Goldwyn Sailfin Molly Team Fortress Classic USS Yorktown (CV-5) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Uniform Resource Locator Axolotl Autonomous building Homer Simpson Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) P-47 Thunderbolt Theory of conduct Good Times Nicomachean Ethics Night (book) Killian documents One Piece minor characters The Ersatz Elevator New England Aquarium Fugu

how to tell the gender of cory cats i just bought blue longfin corydoras catfish two jumped out but i managed to save i noticed that one of them was darker than the others so why do corys jump out of the water and how do you tell the gender no links and keep answers to the point please fish jump out of the water either because they are just unfamiliar with the new surroundings but more importantly often because the water is toxic and they are trying to escape it did you cycle your water next it is difficult to sex corys based on coloring it is more easy to sex them based on their behaviors and interactions with other corys the only general physical characteristic that might help is that females tend to be larger otherwise you have to wait until pairing and breeding which really can only happen naturally of their own volition then it can become more obvious when you see the male chasing the female  Gender role Gender Spider Dog Gender identity Sexual selection Human sexual behavior Transgender Sex Hentai Bisexuality CPU cache Orgasm Sexual orientation Platypus Liger Fish farming Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chinese calendar Homosexuality and transgender Gray Wolf Tilapia Effeminacy Eusociality God Emperor of Dune Drosophila melanogaster Domestic rabbit Mario series enemies Clownfish Cory's Shearwater Sexual fantasy Calvin and Hobbes Chemistry Sexual attraction Maine Coon Lion The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Phase (matter) Central processing unit Conker's Bad Fur Day Red Squirrel House Mouse Group sex Heteronormativity Puma Guinea pig Species Sexual differentiation Grammatical gender Gender identity disorder Sexual dimorphism Girl Robert A.

fish keep dying i received a gallon fish tank last christmas and soon after bought some fish and they died i was told htey died becasue i have too many in there there were i then proceded to buy more fish only one at a time and within hours they die please help i don't want to keep killing fish first a tank needs to be cycled so the good bacteria will keep the nitrite and ammonia which the fish make in their excrements level low nitrites and ammonia will kill fish fast and fish in a gal tank will contribute an amazing amount of those two products your tank will also go through what is known as new tank syndrome developing brown or blackish algae spots sometimes having the water chemistry spike and then drop you should buy test kits for ammonia nitrite at a minimum get the ones using reagent not the test strips the older test strips get the more off their results and you can't tell how old the kits are sitting on the shelf and test your water you'll need a dechlorinator unless you're using bottle spring water and then you'll need to always use the same brand since not all spring waters are the same research your fish to make sure they are appropriate for your tank all need to live in the same temperature get a good submersible heater you can adjust it's easier if they all eat the same thing they have to get along some fish only do well in schools others are super territorial and won't get along with any of their own kind some won't get along with any other fish get a good filter before adding fish make sure everything is working propertly heater is maintaining the set temperature filter is filtering and the tank is set up as you wish it to be trying to do changes later can disturb the ecological balance in the tank sending your tank into another dreaded cycling if you are going to cycle using fish which can be hard on the fish pick hardy fish that don't cost a fortune in case they die test your tank water at least twice daily more if possible and do water changes if the levels are above the recommended kits come with levels or normalcy for you to compare your water to if you're doing fishless cycling do a search for how to do that using ammonia and or fish food the beneficial bacteria eat ammonia decomposing fish food creates ammonia you might be able to get a product called bio spira by marineland small pouch which is enough for a g tank costs about and needs to be kept cool which eliminates the need to cycle your tank when you're tank is all set up and ready for fish just open and dump the pouch contents into your tank i usually dump it into the filter to make sure the bacteria starts going in there and then put in your fish continue to test the water twice daily to make sure things nitrites ammonia levels are staying close to zero also make sure the fish you buy are healthy look at each closely and the other fish in the tank since many fish ailments are highly contagious to make sure there aren't little white dots on them no fuzzy places no parasites that the fish look healthy and undamages and are active the link below is barely minimal for setting up a new tank if your local fish store is a good one that is if the clerks there are fishmaniacs they should be able to answer all your questions and even help you with testing give you advice kind of mentor you through the process  Sewage treatment Ammonia Biogeochemical cycle Eutrophication Ecology Fish farming Autonomous building Water purification Fugu Hydrogen economy Shrimp farm Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant E85 Sea-Monkey Refrigerator Aquarium Cyanide Water Dairy Nutrition Poker jargon Diseases of the honeybee Ocean thermal energy conversion Explosive material Energy development Bong Water (molecule) Fire fighting Hypoglycemia Polychlorinated biphenyl Nutrient Veganism Chocolate Environmental concerns with electricity generation Swimming pool B-47 Stratojet Coffee Biology Antarctic krill Electrophysiology Menstrual cycle Cocaine Photosynthesis RuneScape skills Nuclear power Tofu Haloalkane Microeconomics Healthy eating Motorcycle Extreme Programming GunBound Dead Sea Alcohol fuel Cannabis cultivation Ozone depletion PID controller Iron Origin of life Stomach cancer Diesel engine Hard disk Illegal drug trade Nitric acid Vitamin C Hydrogen Nitrogen cycle Transformer Diabetes mellitus Nuclear reactor Mooney M20 Beer Halitosis Ozone Solar variation Hydrogen peroxide Motor oil Expert system Cruising (maritime) STS-62 Town gas God Emperor of Dune

did i beat the ich within the last three weeks or so i saw ich developing in my tank after the introduction of my pakistani loaches when i noticed it i turned the heat up to degrees but some still came back a bit in some of my fish i then turned the heat up to and for the last three days have not seen anything the strange thing is that one of my scissor tails developed dropsy very quickly on saturday and by monday he wasn't to save so we put him down humanely the other fish have not been reinfected and no signs of dropsy temps are back at did i beat the ich no meds only high temps gal cycling for over months for discus corydoras pakistani loaches siamese algae eaters now scissor tail rasboras and rummynose tetras sorry edit temps back at degrees c animalovingirl yes i know the tank is usually at but because of ich higher temps they are allactually trying to spawn at these temps but i assure you they are completely fine the ich parasite's life cycle is days at normal tropical aquarium temps as the temp goes up the life cycle is shortened as the temp goes down the life cycle is lengthened as far as beating the ich if you have had the temp at degrees farenheit for at least days and have seen no reinfestation of the fish for days you are safe the timeline here is very important dropping the temp too soon can allow reinfestation loaches are very susceptible to ich and they would be the first to be attacked again they are scaleless fish and the ich parasite finds them particularly delicious as far as all fish being infected with ich that is just not true one of the old wives tales from back in the 's i have recently discussed this with magicman who is very knowledgeable he teaches the subject in a college course on fish diseases and he told me there is no scientific evidence to prove that the ich parasite can exist in a cyst state for any longer than that part of their normal life cycle just a few days the main way the parasite is introduced to a tank is if an infected fish is added to a tank it can also come in water from an infected fish store tank this is why you should never dump the water from the fish store bag into your own tank or on plants from an infected tank the best way to keep it out of your community tank is to have a small or gallon quarantine tank always set up and running and put your new fish into it for at least weeks before adding them to your tank btw do not combine medication with the heat treatment medications drive the o out of the water as does the heat the combination of fish weakened by the parasite and less o in the water can be lethal always increase aeration when medicating or increasing the temp a small air pump and air stone is always good to have on hand for situations like this they are cheap email me if you still have questions  Marine aquarium Aquarium Temperature Myxobolus cerebralis Sewage treatment Fish farming Autonomous building Toxoplasmosis Shrimp farm Ecology Solar power Thermal power station Cephalic disorder Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydrogen economy Diseases of the honeybee Chagas disease Rabies Goldfish Fancy rat AIDS Fossil fuel power plant Vitamin C Energy development Ulcerative colitis Ocean thermal energy conversion Multiple sclerosis Quarantine Acne Ich Biodiesel Items in the Metroid series Nutrition Schistosomiasis Pneumonia Dairy Professional wrestling throws Medicine Hookworm Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Autism Stock car (rail) Asthma Carbon dioxide Dialysis Duesberg hypothesis Herpes simplex virus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Environmental concerns with electricity generation Diabetes mellitus Hydroponics Rocky Mountain spotted fever E85 Brewery Sleeping sickness Carburetor Infantilism Breastfeeding Thermoregulation Glossary of wildland fire terms Anopheles Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Decompression sickness Sickle-cell disease Heinkel He 100 God Emperor of Dune Biology Chinese calendar Computer virus HIV test Gas compressor First aid Clown loach CPU design Water purification Pharmaceutical company USS Yorktown (CV-5) Entamoeba histolytica Zerg Bipolar disorder Weapon Common cold Diesel engine Equine conformation Acute respiratory distress syndrome Loach Stirling engine Hypnosis Crohn's disease Shark

aerator needed for litre tank hi there i have had my litre tank for a month and a half now i currently have shubunkins colourful goldfish i do a partial water change every week and siphon out thir gravel from gunk every month they have a filter in their tank elite stingray one but the question is do they need an areator because i was thinking i could get one and hook it up to a special typr of toy you get in pet shops that let out the oxygen so do i need one also how far down the tank wall do i place the filter i have it about one inch below the surface right now oh and btw i use the nessacery water conditioners and suppliments oh sometimes i see them at the surface but for only like twice a day for a few seconds thanks for looking yeah i think i will also bubbles look nice well ive only recenly bought this tank and well the fish expert at the aquarium store did say maximum goldfish but maybe in the future when the fish do eventually die like all fish i wont replace them their more work then my shih tzu you don't need an aerator unless you want one your fish aren't gasping for breath most filters provide adequate aeration if you are really worried about the oxygen i recommend moving the filter so that the out end is close enough to the water line to agitate the surface this adds more than enough oxygen also i recommend that every few weeks you take the filter apart to clean the mechanical parts many sources have told me that the stingray kind clogs easily if your filter is clogged it will not be able to process as much water as it should and your fish could get very sick  Goldfish Aquarium Sewage treatment Diving cylinder Brewery Marine aquarium Fish farming Dry cleaning Water Motor oil Scuba set Solar power Dairy Decompression sickness Glossary of firefighting equipment Sea-Monkey Siphon Houseplant Coffee Hydroponics E85 Gar Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hamster Acute respiratory distress syndrome Discus (fish) Thermal power station Biodiesel Water purification Clownfish The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tilapia Bong Wine making Sylvia and Gerry Anderson Axolotl Carburetor Flush toilet Color Autonomous building Carbon dioxide Hard disk Eutrophication Earthworm Fire fighting Lionel Corporation Corrosion Fishing Textile manufacturing Neighbours Hydrogen vehicle Sun Space shuttle main engine Wine Torpedo Apollo 8 Breathing gas Octopus Atlantic herring Hydrogen economy Oxyacetylene PID controller Antarctic krill Stingray Mattress Syphon Filter Water (molecule) Renewable energy Drowning Glossary of wildland fire terms Cell (biology) Tooth enamel Energy development Dive computer Whitewater Drainage Home repair Cyanide Floppy disk Blood (computer game) Explosive material Water pollution Chinook salmon Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster XML GunBound Irrigation Digital photography Lake Casting Brewing Marathon (sport) Stock car (rail) Stingray (TV show) Space Shuttle external tank Gaia Online

any advice for changing filter types in an aquarium i have a gallon acrylic hex tank with a male betta and a mystery snail the tank has been completely cycled for quite some time now the tank came as a package topfin aquascene with an undergravel filter the filter seems to be working ok but i keep hearing so many negative things about ugf filters plus there seems to be a lot of surfarce agitation from the air pump bubbles and my betta can't create bubble nests i would like to replace the ugf with a small gallon in tank filter that i have in a different gallon tank is it ok to change fitler types in a cycled tank if i do do i have to re cycle the tank do i need to completely clean out the bottom of the tank below the ugf plate or just remove the plate ugf do suck in my opinion lol i'm not real familiar with their set up it's been over years since i had one but is there any kind of filter pad in them if so add that to the new filter beneficial bacteria grows all over the tank in the gravel so be sure you only rinse that in a bucket of used tank water not tap water any decorations in the tank and the filter media so if there is no filter pad in the ugf to move to the new filter there will still be some beneficial bacteria in the tank it may go through a mini cycle just monitor the levels and increase the water changes if you need to i would completely clean the bottom of the tank because those ugf have a tendency to trap uneaten food and waste under there which can cause an ammonia spike i'd do a good gravel vac remove the fish and about the water and put the gravel in the bucket with the used tank water then remove the ugf also is that new filter on an established tank that's been running if so then don't change the filter pad in that one keep it on and it should be ok no cycle good luck  Marine aquarium Brewery Aquarium Dry cleaning Sewage treatment Autonomous building Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bong Dairy Sea-Monkey Reef tank Water purification Fossil fuel power plant E85 Thermal power station Vacuum cleaner Dishwasher Tank Biodiesel Refrigerator Carburetor Shrimp farm Agar plate Carbon dioxide Energy development GunBound Water Dredge Hydrogen economy Goldfish Dialysis Toyota Prius Microeconomics Wine making Eutrophication Tlingit Flush toilet Irrigation Dwarf gourami Water supply Sake Tilapia Coffee Ultraviolet Cannabis cultivation Rail terminology Photosynthesis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sterilization (microbiology) Cruising (maritime) Ocean thermal energy conversion RuneScape quests Ecology Vinegar Siphon Inkjet printer Bubble Bobble Glacier Motorcycle Halitosis Gasoline Axolotl Depleted uranium Hash table Bloom filter Transformer Fountain Glossary of climbing terms Sugar beet Intravenous therapy Bacteria Circuit design Swimming pool Honey Capacitor Phase-locked loop The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Glossary of wildland fire terms Fugu Dead Sea Cheating in Counter-Strike Pump Fume hood Two-stroke cycle Air conditioning Japanese tea ceremony Water (molecule) Diseases of the honeybee Low-pass filter Kosher foods Loudspeaker Plastic Digital photography Ice core

what hydrometer do you reccomend i use for my saltwater aquarium i think the floating glass ones http www thatpetplace com pet group product web are more accurate although they can be somewhat harder to read if you don't turn off everything that creates water movement in the tank or read from a sample in a separate container these also break a lot easier the plastic units with the swinging arm are more durable but even they can break but there can be misleading readings if there's salt preventing the arm from swinging freely or if air bubbles attact to the arm it's always a good idea to keep two on hand anyway just when you need to do a water change that's the time the one you have will decide to break if you keep two you have a backup  Aquarium Marine aquarium Anchor Plastic Naval mine Hydrometer Sea-Monkey Baseball Reef tank World Wide Web Knife Brewery Equine conformation Electrophysiology Aerial (dance move) Butterfly stroke Fire fighting Bong Glass Water (molecule) Hydroponics Robot Master Ice core Polyethylene terephthalate Chair Hamster Bulk vending Goldfish Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Carburetor Clownfish HyperText Transfer Protocol Naruto jutsu M60 machine gun Siphon Hemp Tank Milk On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Backstroke Three Mile Island Jute Breaststroke Pebble bed reactor Dishwasher Swingout First Battle of the Atlantic Swimming pool Textile manufacturing Gramophone record Fly fishing Cyanide Ion selective electrode Surveillance Mouse (computing) Shen Gong Wu Floyd Rose Solar power Unreal Cruising (maritime) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Messerschmitt Bf 109 Music genre Cheese Microeconomics Diving Handloading The Apprentice 2 Pretty Good Privacy Floppy disk Volleyball Titanium Python programming language Terminal ballistics Wave power E85 Backup Fish MP3 Soap bubble Types of bowlers in cricket Violin Bubble Bobble Domain Name System Fish farming Glossary of climbing terms Casting Wine making Ammonia Timpani GunZ The Duel Beer Pong MegaMan Battle Network 5 Radio controlled airplane Sodium chloride Waste management Koi Star Trek Customizable Card Game Acetic acid

is it possible to make my freshwater tank into a saltwater tank i want to make my freshwater tank into a salt water tank it is only gallons but i want to get like clown fish and fish like that i always take very good care of my tank and fish i have some freshwater fish but i will wait till' they die off i know that sounds mean but they will die eventually i really want this to happen would i need to buy a new tank and filter i want to use the one i have now it would be possible to convert your tank to saltwater although a gallon is a little small you would be able to keep a pair of clownfish if these were ocellaris clowns the nemo type as they only get around inches although other species that grow to inches would be too large generally the larger you go in saltwater the better since the fish are less tolerant of changes to their environment poor water quality and overcrowding the fish tend to be more aggressive territorial and most grow to a larger size than typical freshwater community fish so this generally means much lighter stocking rates for saltwater if your tank is a regular tall that would be okay for the clowns if it's a long you might be able to keep another fish as well i would recommend something very different than a clown for a third fish because their territorial aggressive nature doesn't allow them to mix with fish with similar colors or body shapes or members of the same family this applys to most marine species so for most groups this means only one fish per type tangs triggers wrasses etc in the tank there are a few species that can be kept as mated pairs clownfish cardinalfish and even fewer that can be kept as a school if you want to try a third fish a good place to start your research is with the types of fish you want and check their compatibility aggressive vs peaceful adult sizes activity levels minimum tank sizes and whether or not they would be reef safe then figure the tank size you'll need to keep them then you can plan the rest of the tank and equipment from there there's no reason you can't use the equipment you already have either this will save you some of the expense in setting up the tank for most items there is no freshwater or saltwater versions you just want to make sure what you have is appropriate for your tank size if you have a stand for the tank you might need to protect it if it's anything other than solid wood the particleboard stands won't hold up if they get wet and the glue separates and the iron metal stands will corrode if any salt gets on them or you could get a metal stand just use a flannel backed tablecloth under the tank to protect the stand from splashed water saltwater is expensive enough that you don't want the entire system crashing to the floor some night some of the other items you'll need filter you want one that's properly sized filters x x the tank volume per hour check the gallons per hour rating if you want to get a new one or upgrade there are lots of choices and what you'll need will really depend on budget what you're trying to keep and personal preference i'd consider the best type to be a refugium or wet dry trickle filter but this would be overkill for a gallon tank next best would be a canister followed by a biowheel then a standard hang on tank unless you're using a fine sand or oolite substrate you can also use an undergravel filter to supplement filtration but i'd suggest powering it with a reversible powerhead to blow the water up through the substrate prevents stuff from building up under the filter and clogging it powerhead s to provide more water circulation in hard to get to places this also helps circulate dissolved oxygen to the bottom of the tank having depending on their sizes should be enough for your tank heaters for a saltwater tank i'd suggest getting and putting one on each end if you get a tank that's more than gallons you might even want to do this if what you have is a long this will provide more even heating and your tank has a back up if one heater gives out figure the correct size as watts per gallon divided by heaters if you need to heat the water more than degrees above the room temperature go one size higher lighting if you never want anything but fish you can use the standard lighting and hood made for your tank you might want to upgrade the lamps to a k tube or a actinic if you're going to try corals anemones etc go with a compact fluorescent metal halide or combo system these will provide more intense light that they'll need for photosynthesis substrate you want something made of aragonite to help keep the ph from changing i like the smaller shell material that carib sea puts out it doesn't have to be live sand either some folks like crushed coral but the particle size is bigger than i like and it tends to have a lot of dust that never rinses completely out another very fine grained material is oolitic aragonite looks like small white balls and aragonite sand here's an idea of the materials available http www caribsea com pages products dry aragonite html while it's possible to keep a marine tank with regular aquarium gravel or no substrate the aragonite will keep the ph from falling below it should be salt mix if you're only keeping fish you can go with one of the less expensive brands of synthetic sea salt if you get any invertebrates shrimp snails crabs corals anemones etc switch to a better quality mix before you add them these cost a little more but you won't need to be using additives for the trace elements they need either hydrometer this measures the amount of salt that's dissolved inwater there are two kinds you can get one made of glass that floats on the surface more accurate but easy to break and a plastic container that has a needle that rises and falls as the amount of salt changes less accurate bubbles attaching to the needle gives false readings for fish only you want the specific gravity to read if you're keeping inverts you want it to be water testing kit minimum of ph ammonia nitrite nitrate cleaning supplies elbow length gloves gravel vacuum gallon bucket large plastic container and powerhead for mixing the salt to be done well ahead of water changes algae scraper razor blades for coraline algae and diatoms that like to attach to the glass water conditioner for removing chlorine or chloramine from your tap water unless you plan to use a reverse osmosis filter or buy ro water which is preferred for a reef tank the following are optional but strongly suggested protein skimmer this removes dissloved and small organic materials that would normally contribute to the ammonia nitrite and nitrate in your tank not necessary for fish only tanks but will be handy if you have inverts to keep up good water quality by removing organic materials that become nutrients for algae glass cover this reduces evaporation and keeps the fish inside the tank some are jumpers although with a metal halide lighting system it can overheat your tank live rock this give the tank a more natural appearance provides hiding places for the fish and inverts and increases the biological filtration not to mention you get all kinds of cool critters that hitchhike into your tank shrimp snails sea urchins sea cucumbers sea stars etc chiller if you use metal halide lighting or the water temperature regularly gets above o for corals or anemones fish can take a little more heat you may need to invest in a chiller to keep the tank cool the water temperature should run of there may be additional items that you could need such as kalkwasser to raise your ph if you can't get it to but you won't know these until you get the tank set up and running and test your water before going out and buying all this i would suggest some reading to see what you're getting into by keeping saltwater since you still have existing fish this will give you time to to read up on saltwater in smaller doses i did research for almost years before i set up my first tank and i had about years of freshwater aquarium experience already rushing into a saltwater setup usually doesn't give you good results and the equipment and fish are a little too expensive to be finding out in a few weeks you got something that's not appropriate for what you want for your tank i'd also recommend a good reference book for some research either of these would be a good one to start with the new marine aquarium by michael s paletta microcosm ltd isbn or the conscientious marine aquarist by robert m fenner microcosm ltd isbn here are some websites that can also get you started http www wetwebmedia com marsetupez htm http www peteducation com index cfm cls http www wetwebmedia com

help is this normal i just floated the bag of my betta in my un cycled tank i decied to use him to cycle hes not gasping for air or anything but hes staying at the top of the tank is this normal and its a gallon tank should i turn the light of or what should i do don't worry so much a little betta in a gallon tank will cause such a small ammonia spike that you probably won't even be able to measure it if you want to play it safe buy a test for ammonia and test for it every day if you notice it start to crawl up past change a third of the water in the mean time go back to the fish store and ask them for a handful of gravel from one of their mature tanks ask them to bag it for you and then put this into your filter you will be introducing live bacteria and won't need to worry about the cycle at all a fishless cycle or exposing the fish to toxins is kind of pointless when you can just bypass the cycle altogether by doing this and the method is virtually flawless  Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sewage treatment Fossil fuel power plant Hydrogen economy E85 Sea-Monkey Autonomous building Jet engine Thermal power station Dairy Aquarium Refrigerator Biogeochemical cycle Cannabis cultivation Fish farming Fugu Toyota Prius Dialysis Menstrual cycle Tag GunBound Eutrophication Poker jargon Swimming pool Carbon dioxide Ultraviolet Dry cleaning Hydroponics Sun Brewery Carburetor Mattress Anchor Glossary of wildland fire terms Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster P-38 Lightning Goldfish Ocean thermal energy conversion Agar plate B-47 Stratojet History of swimming Backstroke P-47 Thunderbolt Tank Gaia Online Diving regulator Fischer Random Chess Cessna T-37 Ice core Solar power Coffee Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dwarf gourami Breaststroke USS Yorktown (CV-5) Tour de France Milk Fuel efficiency Indianapolis 500 Tlingit PID controller Cruising (maritime) Ecco the Dolphin God Emperor of Dune CPU cache Motorcycle Discus (fish) Water Tilapia Golf Ammunition Hard disk Shrimp farm Front crawl Electrophysiology Diesel engine Rebreather Utility cycling Professional wrestling match types Biodiesel Reef tank Biochemistry Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Normal distribution Illegal drug trade Galileo spacecraft StarCraft Secret Missions Mercury Atlas 6 Doom enemies Escherichia coli O157:H7 Axolotl STS-62 Motor oil Diseases of the honeybee Vacuum cleaner Hypoglycemia

help my gold angelfish spawned after they spawned we moved them to another tank along with the eggs that were laid on the intake tube part of our filter lol it has been around hours and i don't really see anything happening also the parent fish are doing their fanning part but they won't eat because of this the tank is a bit cloudy from the uneaten food what do i do at this point are the eggs turning white if so they are infertile which is common for a first spawn the should begin to darken and hatch around days from the spawn keep the water clean so remove any uneaten food from the tank make certain the tank is well areated and perform small water changes to keep the tank water fresh once the eggs sacks are disovled and the fish are swimming you will need to begin feeding baby brine shrimp they will need this food for the first few weeks of their life also if you placed a small airstone near the eggs there is no need for the parent fish to be in the tank with the eggs just make certain to remove any white or fungus covered eggs  Sea-Monkey Salmon Freshwater angelfish Discus (fish) Shark Krill Clownfish Goldfish Egg (food) Albatross Chicken Frog Shrimp farm Antarctic krill Cantonese cuisine Halfbeak Tofu Dwarf gourami Hamster Grunion Zebra Danio Brine shrimp American lobster Cuisine of the Philippines Korean cuisine Egg (biology) Platypus Sea star Atlantic herring Tilapia Fish farming Brewery Cichlid Tooth Beetle Marine aquarium Kakapo Notostraca Kosher foods Aphid Seabird Aquarium Marine angelfish Bird Infertility Capercaillie Diseases of the honeybee Eggerland series Pickling Worker bee Sewage treatment Sexual reproduction Goby Japanese tea ceremony Carburetor In vitro fertilisation Fancy rat Solar power Leatherback Sea Turtle Dry cleaning Tlingit Biological pest control Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Denmark Thermal power station Bedbug Breakfast Emperor Penguin Australian bass Lamprey Bong Jellyfish Axolotl Atlantic salmon Breastfeeding Angling Murray Cod Kissing gourami Sushi Tank Fugu Ant Brook trout Chinook salmon Bee Cockroach Autonomous building Killifish Bread Vegetarianism Snorkel German cuisine Pysanka Nile crocodile Pink salmon Wine making USS Tunny (SS-282) Octopus

frustrated with my tank question about molly hi i am trying hard to establish a freshwater tank i've had it for two weeks and already a guppy died the ammonia had spiked i think that is why i still have a male molly i can't seem to contol the ammonia i have done percent water changes for the last three days also i have reduced feeling him to once a day still the ammonia is at or i am trying to establish the good bacteria through cycling but with all these water changes i wonder if it is doing more harm i am at a loss i have a young daughter who is stressing over the death of the other wish and i really want to make the tank fine for the molly the molly has been acting differetly sometimes swimming at the top and then resting on the bottom near the gravel way less active what's wrong help tank you thank you everyone for your expertise and advise here are some details i would like to add again thank you jon v yes i have been vacuuming the gravel while doing the water changes i think that is the only thing that has reduced the ammonia at all i tested my tap water and it came up negative for ammonia thank you for offering your email i may need to i will let you know shelly my ph is high hard water tikitili thanks for info on prime also i did not know you can cycle the tank w o fish this is what i did after posting last i went and added a dose of aquarium salt i heard mollys like this also i added an ammonia filter to my regular filter i wonder of this will be counter productive please email me with any other additional advise as i soo appriciate it i will let you know how it goes chen chen you've been doing the right thing treating this with water changes chemical treatments are not the answer here that should be used as an emergency and last resort if you've been doing the changes and cutting down the feedings to a bare minimum but still getting reading this high two things come to mind here when you are doing your changes are you vaccuming the gravel as well if there is a build up of waste materials sitting in the substrate and you only change out the water those waste materials are still decomposing and emitting ammonia into your water if you have not been doing so every water change do a thorough cleaning in your substrate to eliminate excess waste second possibility is that there is an ammonia source already present in your tap water your tap water maybe excessively high in chloramines which is a binded cholorine and ammonia run an ammonia test on your tap water to rule that out email me if you still have high readings a third possible final option the tester is bad giving you false readings if it has a lot expiration date check that as well you may need to just get a new test kit for superior service and a service group dedicated to your help you can go to fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Water purification Eutrophication Fish farming Hydrogen economy Aquarium Brewery Asthma Nitrogen Sea-Monkey Diseases of the honeybee Water (molecule) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma E85 Autonomous building Cocaine Sodium hypochlorite Biodiesel Iron Water Aluminium Biochemistry Hydrogen peroxide Solar cell Motor oil Bong Ultraviolet Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Refrigerator Nutrition Acne Dishwasher Energy development Alternative biochemistry Haloalkane Carburetor Gmail Waste management Solar power Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Diving Chronic fatigue syndrome Shrimp farm Urine Google Electrophysiology Fertilizer Fossil fuel power plant Coffee Titanium Ocean thermal energy conversion Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chlorophyta Cyanide Avalanche Thimerosal Nuclear fallout Fugu HIV test Ecology Fire fighting Software testing Industrial wastewater treatment Light-emitting diode Psoriasis Natural deduction Hypoglycemia Sun Town gas Origin of life XML Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Hard water Carbon dioxide Advanced Squad Leader Glucocorticoid Cancer Corrosion Hydrogen sulfide CPU cache Transformer Dry cleaning Bacteria Motility Radiation hardening Nuclear weapon design

i need help picking out a clown fish so i work at a fish store so i can order all my dish at whole sale here is the question that i have should i order a mated pair of true percula clown fish or should i just buy two true percula clown fish i know that in the wild the larger one of the two will become the female and so forth so do i need to buy a mated pair when they are supposed to do this sex change thing are you planning on mating them or are you just worried about about them fighting if you are looking to mate them then you have a better chance of them mating if you get a breeding pair the price is heft but if you work at a fish store you may be able to sell off the off spring and make your money back realize there are no guaruntee that they will mate when you put them in your tank if you are just lo oking for them to peacefully coexhist with eah other order jueveniles and raise them in the same tank together and you most likely wont have a problem with them fighting as they grow older not to say that its that they wont fight but many people have success keeping clownfish together that were raised together hope this helps and good luck  Clownfish Percula Clownfish Discus (fish) Gray Wolf Poker jargon Platypus Fish farming $ale of the Century God Emperor of Dune Hamster Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marine aquarium Charmbracelet Clown Humpback Whale 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Great Depression Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Microeconomics Bird Short selling Domestic rabbit Spider RuneScape economy Internet fraud Kylie Minogue Law of value Species Avenue Q Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shark Capitalism Shaggy dog story Mutual fund Chess terminology Lionel Corporation Mobile Fighter G Gundam Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce Seymour Cray Bulk vending Neopets Non-human animal sexuality Extreme Programming Cruising (maritime) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Supply and demand Kakapo Betting (poker) Tarantula ITunes Music Store Heretics of Dune Battle of the Bulge Friends New York Giants Hip hop rivalries Inventory Surveillance Pack (canine) Porsche 911 American lobster Therion (band) Tigon Finding Nemo Monogamy Wal-Mart Ecco the Dolphin Fugu Confidence trick Chess problem terminology Hard disk Minor characters in Morrowind Transsexuality Taboo food and drink Hermaphrodite Animal communication Hyperinflation Commodity Sea-Monkey Chinatown Eaton's Drosophila melanogaster John Kerry Game show Viz (comic) UK Singles Chart Ant Rei Ayanami Aquarium Chopsticks Dragons (Pern) Infantilism Baseball Stars Red Squirrel Deflation (economics) Chess strategy and tactics Criticisms of socialism

why have my pond goldfish lost their colour started red gold and are now white ish all over some just faded and others' colour went in patches other goldfish in pond not affected except one koi which started off navy blue all over he's about years old he started losing colour round his scales on his back and now his back is totally white silver while his lower scales are blue black and still gradually turning white he's otherwise very healthy same as the goldfish help water conditions temperature what you feed them age genetics and color of background all can have an effect on color of koi there is an excellent article in aquarium fish magazine this month on why koi change colors the fish is not ill and there is likely nothing you can do but wait and see what color it turns out to be some will retain vivid color and many will loose color as they age warm water can retract color where cold water makes color expand ph also has a simular effect green water or a pond with lots of algae can make colors deeper hope this helps many experts are apparantly trying to scientifically figure out what exactly causes a koi to loose color what i've read its a combination of things but mostly breeding or genetics of the fish  Koi Color Aquarium Color blindness Iris (anatomy) Discus (fish) Colours, standards and guidons Hair color Lake Paleoclimatology Tilapia Water garden Eye color Ecology Horse Color theory Wassily Kandinsky Dog Human skin color Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Fish farming Coral reef Pond Traffic sign Cheetah Algae Water (molecule) Salmon Dragon Booster Color temperature Cyanide Roan (color) Geologic time scale Silver Alhambra Lake Burley Griffin Frog Zebra Danio Cat coat genetics Solar variation Clownfish Color Graphics Adapter Dobermann Myxobolus cerebralis German car number plates Effects of global warming Diamond Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Extinction Camouflage Cloud Species Water Toronto Blue Jays Bipolar disorder Turkish Van Shrimp farm Goldeen Thermoregulation Opportunity rover Blue Hubble Deep Field Mercury (element) Hydropower Carburetor CMYK color model Marine aquarium Diamond simulant Global warming and agriculture Vitamin C Cannabis (drug) Titanium Collectibles in Bionicle Krill Power Rangers CIE 1931 color space Multiple sclerosis Factory farming El Ni__o Guinea pig Technicolor Turquoise Hydrogen Light-emitting diode Bird migration Biology Harp Poker jargon Carp Red Original Amiga chipset Atari 8-bit family Pimp My Ride Parrotfish Los Angeles Kings Carbon dioxide Border Collie

rock for my aquarium i found a rock in my garden that i want to put in my aquarium i asked a friend about it and she said to boil the rock and then rinse it with cold water before i put it in the aquarium is this ok or is there another way to make this rock ok for my aquarium it's a gallon and it's not a very big rock any suggestions would be great too thanks generally you will hear that it is a bad idea to put anything like that into your tank this is a very broad statement however if you follow certain rules you can minimize the potential for problems firstly you want to remove the surface dirt and bacteria boiling is a good way to do this if you can fit the item into a pot then you will want to use the vinegar test on it as posted above finally you should submerge it in clean water overnight and the next day check for any oily residue on the water surface or discoloration of the water if you notice any residue floating on the water surface or discoloration with the exception of tannins from driftwood i advise you to not use it in the tank otherwise go ahead and try it monitoring closely your fish and water parameters for a few weeks i hope this helps you jason c  Aquarium Marine aquarium Vinegar Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Thermal power station Hard water Dishwasher Renewable energy Poker jargon Fishing Brewery Gar Goldfish Clownfish Halitosis Sea-Monkey Reef tank Water USS Tunny (SS-282) Water purification Tilapia Autonomous building Crayfish Koi Tattoo E85 Houseplant Tea Betting (poker) Leather Water (molecule) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Swimming pool Cyanide Bong Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Kosher foods Linear regression Textile manufacturing Welding Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Nuclear fallout Wine making Discus (fish) Dialysis Essential oil Soap Fire extinguisher Fish Insulin Monterey Bay Aquarium Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Dam Normal distribution USS Albacore (SS-218) Tofu Sulfuric acid Acetic acid C plus plus 2003 North America blackout Menstrual cup Japanese tea ceremony Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February M16 (rifle) Ocean thermal energy conversion StarCraft: Uprising Alcohol fuel Alcoholics Anonymous Sterilization (microbiology) Heinkel He 100 Siphon Fossil fuel power plant The Parting of the Ways STS-59 Fire fighting Acne Georgia Aquarium Hemp Space Mountain USS S-38 (SS-143) Mercury Atlas 6 Internal ballistics Drowning Frogman Pickling Food preservation Vacuum Diving regulator Eutrophication Glossary of wildland fire terms Nuclear power Contact lens Sodium hypochlorite Heat exchanger P-47 Thunderbolt Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans

my goldfish has a little problem i just noticed my gold fish has black blotchy spots all over it and i don't know what is going on anyone got a clue water quality is poor change the water your ammonia level is high the black spots are blood hemorrhages coming to the surface of the skin the blood looks black or brown on a goldfish because it is being seen through an orange skin the reason they get these hemorrhages is because the ammonia in the water is mixing with their blood through their gills and it is keeping the oxygen in the water from going into the blood as the fish is starved for oxygen the blood comes to the surface in the fishes body trying to get oxygen if you do water changes you lower the concentration of ammonia in the water and the fish can get oxygen again and then the blood spots go away  Ammonia Sewage treatment Decompression sickness Water (molecule) Hydrogen economy Traumatic brain injury Lake Gill Pulmonary alveolus Blood Urea Osmoregulation Aquarium Stroke Cyanide Iron Earth's atmosphere Fish farming Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide Discus (fish) Titanium Eutrophication Water Insulin Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Gas metal arc welding Homeostasis Alternative biochemistry Fishing Rebreather Skin Dam Lung Dialysis Hemoglobin Ozone depletion Bacteria Red blood cell Corrosion Welding Drowning Anemia Poison Breathing gas Coagulation Ozone hole Diabetic retinopathy Ozone layer Origin of life Color Circulatory system Hydrogen Copper Cetacea Carburetor Roach Hydrogen peroxide Fire fighting Hypoglycemia Enceladus (moon) Coronary heart disease Atherosclerosis Intracranial pressure Hyperventilation Blood pressure Neptune Partial pressure Cheetah Blood vessel Water pollution Gas bladder Electrolyte Liquid breathing Terraforming Pneumonia Koi Shark Algal bloom Biochemistry Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Thermoregulation Tetrapod Brewery Beryllium Atlantic herring Lake Burley Griffin Cocaine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Oily fish Thermal power station Global warming and agriculture Diabetes mellitus Nitric oxide Nutrient Nitroglycerin Gas exchange Sulfuric acid Nitrous oxide

how can you tell if a fish is male or female i have goldfish a black molly and a platy if it helps for the mollies and platys perhaps the easiest category of fish to sex are the livebearing fish males are usually smaller and more colorful than the females they also possess an external sexual organ the gonopodium which makes it easy to differentiate males from the females the gonopodium is a modified anal fin which is used to fertilize eggs in the male the anal fin is rod shaped while the female has a traditional fan shaped anal fin for the goldfish it is very hard except that during breeding season the males get white pimples on the leading edges of their gills hope this helps  Sailfin Molly Goldfish Live-bearing aquarium fish Hermaphrodite Egg (biology) Sex Fish anatomy Strap-on dildo Shark Perch Condom Anal sex Gender Koi Sexual dimorphism Barreleye Zebra Danio Halfbeak Group sex Human sexuality Knife Freshwater angelfish Sexual reproduction Orgasm Sexual differentiation Age of consent Dildo Sex organ Clownfish Bird Sexual selection Sexual intercourse Parthenogenesis Zeidae Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Parrotfish Marine angelfish Green swordtail Southern platyfish Anus Percula Clownfish Snake Tilapia Yellow Leatherback Sea Turtle Dragonet Batoidea Lanternfish Gender role Ruff Golden Perch Pink salmon Octopus Intersexuality Effeminacy Color AVN Awards Semen Spider Ostrich Fecal incontinence Salmon Poeciliidae Australian bass Species Discus (fish) Chondrichthyes Dragons (Pern) Artificial selection Human sexual response cycle Murray Cod Moorish Idol Sex assignment Plant sexuality Lion Anal masturbation Orange roughy Grass carp Non-human animal sexuality Flower Ridgehead Eel Arctic grayling Kissing gourami Conifer cones Atlantic herring Kakapo Safe sex Angler Reptile Basking Shark Liger Aphid Anal-oral contact Human sexual behavior Gamut Xenomorph Pysanka Cellular differentiation Sex toy

how do i know if my aquarium has cycled i wanted to do a fishless cycling of my gal aquarium so i had filled it up connected my airpumps filters and increased the water temp to degrees i also dechlorinated the water with big al's dechorinator formula i have been dropping fish flakes in twice a day but i hadn't bought any water testing kit until yesterday when i tested the water after days of dropping in fish food the ammonia was and the nitrite was and the nitrate was and the ph was this morning before work i dropped in frozen shrimp because i'm not sure if it's possible for my readings to be zero because my aquarium is cycled or if it's because i haven't kick started the cycling process yet how is the best way to determine this without adding ammonia drops to the water what would you suggest i do i started adding fish food right away after filling it with water about days now do you think shrimp is enough to cycle a gallon tank it's not cycled you'll need to test it every few days but your ammonia will spike first then that will drop and your nitrites will spike then that'll drop and nitrates will show up when it's done cycling ammonia and nitrites will read ppm and you'll have nitrates showing you probably didn't add enough flake food to the tank i'm guessing the shrimp way is easier i'd recommend taking the shrimp put them in a mesh filter media bag buy at the pet store in the filter media section or a pair of pantyhose nylons with the foot leg cut off put the shrimp in that and knot it shut and drop it in the tank that'll keep the shrimp together as opposed to clouding up your tank and making a mess let it rot and eventually that'll put out ammonia the whole process takes about weeks to complete don't do any water changes during this time because there's no fish in there no need to just top off any water that evaporates and monitor those levels when it is done cycling remove the shrimp do a water change to get your nitrates under ppm and add your fish slowly soon after that and you can drop your temperature down i don't believe that has much affect on the cycle process put it to f or whatever temp the fish you plan on keeping prefer  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Eutrophication Cyanide Fish farming Sea-Monkey Fishing Carburetor Goldfish Shrimp farm Thermal power station Hydrogen sulfide Ammonium nitrate Water Hydroponics Autonomous building Mattress Brewery Cannabis cultivation Refrigerator Cocaine Clownfish Dairy Ozone depletion Fossil fuel power plant Discus (fish) Internal ballistics Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ocean thermal energy conversion Temperature Biodiesel Explosive material Ice core E85 Illegal drug trade Biogeochemical cycle Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Ozone hole Hydrogen economy Rebreather Antarctic krill Tilapia Axolotl Nitric acid Hard water Coffee Dry cleaning Krill Earth's atmosphere Reef tank Tofu Extreme Programming Food preservation Diseases of the honeybee Shaggy dog story Potassium nitrate Moon Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Oplan Bojinka Fish Electrophysiology Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Fire fighting Menstrual cycle Soil pH StarCraft: Uprising Poker jargon Ham Tank Nuclear power Hard disk Climate change Aluminium Mercury Atlas 6 Wheel of Fortune Motor oil Sun Bong Angling Thermoregulation Tooth enamel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster PID controller Solar variation Gas mantle Sonar Water purification Paragliding Toyota Prius Laserdisc

hospital tank for female bettas hi i currently have a vacant gallon with an undergravel filter and a heater so the water stays around f with it in it i also have a gallon with female bettas so my question is if one of the girls are to get sick can i use the one gallon as a hospital tank thanks if all got it or if it was a really common easy to treat disease like ich ten i would treat the whole gallon i am talking about if one gets dropsy or something to prevent them from spreading the illness and saving me from spending x as much money on the good meds like maracyn tc or something you can use the one gallon tank as a hospital tank however it may be better to have something slighty larger than the one gallon if one of the bettas get sick most likely so will others many fish diseases are highly contagious one gallon would not allow for the treatment of more than one or two fish at a time i would look for at least a gallon tank it is still good to have the one gallon for an emergency though addition note treating the main tank is not a good idea as many medications can kill off your good bacteria and you will need to recycle the tank this can be as harmfull as the illness itself  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Pneumonia Medicine Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sewage treatment Health insurance Tuberculosis Psychiatric hospital Autonomous building Fish farming Aquarium Legionellosis Fossil fuel power plant Disease Ebola Traditional Chinese medicine Water purification Publicly funded medicine Dairy Psychiatry Fire fighting Foodborne illness Clostridium difficile Sexually-transmitted infection Homeopathy Biodiesel Sleeping sickness Cruising (maritime) Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa Virus Malaria Escherichia coli O157:H7 American Red Cross 2001 anthrax attacks H5N1 Hygiene Decompression sickness Reef tank Stomach cancer Diarrhea Biological warfare Sea-Monkey Duesberg hypothesis Bipolar disorder Quarantine Hospital Dysentery Anti-psychiatry Chronic fatigue syndrome Anthrax Brewery Pharmaceutical company Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Smallpox E85 Shrimp farm Charles Darwin's illness Chlamydophila pneumoniae Chiropractic Asthma Goldfish Gasoline Milk Bottled water Alcoholism Atherosclerosis Combat stress reaction Scouting Antiviral drug Rabies Influenza Alcohol fuel Migraine Sickle-cell disease Apollo 13 NEWater Emergency Medical Services Drowning Health care in the United States Blood Sigmund Freud Vitamin C Hepatitis C Medicare (Canada) USS Yorktown (CV-5) Conjunctivitis Canine parvovirus Omega-3 fatty acid Axolotl Alternative medicine Water heater Intravenous therapy Bacteria Growth hormone treatment AIDS reappraisal

beta fish and how to care for them we went to wal mart last night and spent about a half an hour filling beta fish bowls with water about of the bowls had maybe an inch of water in them and the fish were practically swimming on there sides not to mention that there were several dead i have no idea how to care for these fish and i am sure that the straight tap water was not the best for them but was better than none can anyone tell me if this is okay for them to not have much water and how to care for them because i am considering going back and saving a few i got my betta from wal mart too it was in this little bitty cup that could have held almost twice as much water as what the walmart people choose to put in it i took it home and it seems to like it's bigger tank a whole lot better than that itty bitty cup you could probably save one's life by taking it home and putting it in a bigger tank but please keep in mind that you can't put more than one betta in a tank unless they're both females also if you put tap water in it's tank don't forget to use a water conditioner to dechlorinate it i feed mine twice a day small amounts each time but please don't overfeed because that could cloud it's tank verry badly or it could get really fat and die one more thing even though alot of people say that you can put a mirror up to your bettas tank just to watch it flare up but i wouldn't do that because it stresses them out and makes them verry mad cya and have lots of fun  Sea-Monkey Wal-Mart Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Little Britain Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Theory of conduct Brewery Solar power Cruising (maritime) Characters in the Smurfs About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Axolotl Norway national football team Garfield Blood (computer game) Poker jargon Swimming Vegeta Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station Stanley Cup Autonomous building Aquarium Japanese tea ceremony Haibane Renmei Time Out of Mind Customs and etiquette of Japan Menstrual cup The Amber Spyglass Blonde on Blonde Internal ballistics Empire Burlesque Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Conker's Bad Fur Day Diving Craps Sewage treatment Clownfish Crystal Palace F.C.

bleached fish tank rock and filter details can be skipped if you like question is at the bottom i bleached my holey rock and a used filter that had algae all over it i read later that i might have used to much bleach i say about a cup in only gallons and it soaked for about hours instead of minutes i then soaked it in dechlorinator i then rinsed it off again really well finally i let it dry completely next i put the rock and filter into a bucket of really hot water not boiling water just high temp and now plan to soak in dechlorinator again my question in short is there anyway i can make sure this rock and filter is safe from the bleach before adding them to my tank i don't want to wait weeks if you thoroughly boil the rock after bleaching and then let it air dry over night it will be safe for your fish if you take the rock and soak it in water with a dechlorinator the rock will also absorb the dechlorinator neutralizing the bleach nosoop u for more on aquarium maintenance check out the link in my profile  Water purification Brewery Marine aquarium Menstrual cup Sewage treatment Coffee Thermal power station Dishwasher Dry cleaning Aquarium Ethidium bromide Tofu Dairy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Coral reef Reef tank Fossil fuel power plant Sea-Monkey E85 Autonomous building Decaffeination Rebreather Fire fighting Dishwashing Agar plate Wood pulp Hydroponics Axolotl Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Carbon dioxide Swimming pool Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Technicolor Kosher foods Soy milk Fishing Rice Sulfuric acid Solar power Cuisine of Brazil Sugar beet Dialysis Motor oil Hummingbird Timeline of alternative rock Idli Cantonese cuisine Manicure Bong Sodium hypochlorite Cruising (maritime) Laundry detergent Quinoa Rum Fish farming Polychlorinated biphenyl Haggis Hydrogen peroxide Risotto Tea Steam engine USS Yorktown (CV-5) Ammonia Nirvana (band) Wine making Illegal drug trade Menstrual cycle Beer Sento Space Shuttle program Fire extinguisher Sugarcane Dead Sea Koi Hydrogen economy Common bean Car washing techniques Sake Goldfish Tillandsia Survival skills Composting toilet USS Tunny (SS-282) Nuclear power Filter (optics) Homebrewing Angling STS-57 Mercury Atlas 6 Jewish cuisine MTV2 Bleach (manga) Russian cuisine Pump Western blot Instant coffee Leather Chlorination Yerba mate

saltwater to freshwater what are the steps that one would need to take to transform a saltwater tank into a freshwater tank how would i go about cleaning it before use what you'll need to do will depend a little on the material the tank is made of and the types of freshwater fish you plan to keep as far as the substrate this is probably a crushed coral or shell material this would be okay to rinse off through a strainer under hot water and reuse if your planned fish are african cichlids or other species that need a higher ph if you're not planning to keep any of these i would suggest changing to standard aquarium gravel or sand depending on the needs of your fish and your preferences you'll mosy likely need to clean the walls of the tank and if these are glass you can use a standard algae scraper and vinegar and hot water to remove any coralline algae or tube worms that have attached to the glass if there are stubborn spots you might need to use a razor to scrape them off be aware if the glass itself looks cloudy there may have been permanent etching from the high ph this won't be something you're able to get rid of because the glass itself has become pitted it doesn't look quite as bad when the tank has water in it but it may still be noticeable if the tank is acrylic you'll need to be more careful about cleaning the walls because this is more likely to be scratched use the hot water still but use either a pad made for cleaning acrylic and be sure no particles of the substrate get causght between the pad and the tank surface or use the edge of an old plastic card credit card type to scrape if there are heaters powerheads or filters that were for the tank these should be able to be used as well just clean with hot water and use vinegar to remove salt build up other than these specifics everything else would be the same as setting up a freshwater tank from scratch  Marine aquarium Aquarium Reef tank Sewage treatment Brewery Dishwasher Casting Fish farming Printed circuit board Solar power Dry cleaning Thermal power station Fish Knife Vinegar Seismic retrofit Drill bit Biodiesel Fishing Laserdisc Angling Water purification Bong Corrosion Shrimp farm Tilapia Textile manufacturing Polymethyl methacrylate Chlorophyta Slow sand filter bed Discus (fish) Diatom Algae Irrigation Dice Mussel Glass Fly fishing Aquifer Swimming pool Lake Autonomous building Tank Antarctic krill Halfbeak Cathode ray tube Goby Eutrophication Dialysis Kissing gourami Menstrual cup Transistor Vacuum tube Coral Cookware and bakeware Jellyfish Fossil fuel power plant Explosive material Dead Sea Tofu Dinghy Gramophone record Hamster Solar panel Diatomaceous earth Basement Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Soldering Opportunity rover Mattress Motor oil Shrimp Diode Cheese Solar cell Brush Wok Dredge Lighting Welding Compact disc Ecology of Hong Kong Paint Freshwater angelfish Cyanide Liquid crystal display Olduwan Krill Fire fighting Plastic Water (molecule) Osmosis Cuisine of the Philippines Atlantic herring

why does my new fish tank look like it has green water how do i fix it so it looks clear water doesnt look murky just green the green water is caused by an algal bloom i am facing this problems as i speak this can be caused by too much direct sunlight or poor water quality overfeeding fish which is my problem can also lead to this condition recommended solutions are blackouts for a few days no light diatomic or micron filtration and getting something called daphnia for the tank one of the best preventative measures for green water is frequent water changes if water quality is good and light is diminished then your green water problems should stay at bay good luck  Eutrophication Algal bloom Solar power Aquarium Algae Lake Sea-Monkey Light pollution Sewage treatment Diatom Marine aquarium Autonomous building Fish farming Shrimp farm Houseplant Aquaculture Coral reef 2003 North America blackout Brewery Lake Burley Griffin Psoriasis Plankton Salton Sea Water E85 Kidney Traffic light Bladderwort Lichen Water pollution Potomac River Mercury Atlas 6 USS Tunny (SS-282) Color Drowning Carnivorous plant Photosynthesis Axolotl Inflation Renewable energy Jellyfish Gas metal arc welding Cloud Rickets Hydroponics Welding Water purification Reef tank History of the tank Krill Antarctic krill Swimming pool Fish Scotch whisky Lake Ontario USS Yorktown (CV-5) Energy development Hard water Dundas Square Cyanide Clear Lake Public policy Vitamin D Hash table Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Diatomaceous earth Eye Neutrino Daylight saving time Dam Sunscreen Bicycle lighting Knife Equine conformation Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Rail terminology Thermal power station Bong USS Thresher (SS-200) Laser applications Public good Extreme Programming USS Wahoo (SS-238) Rebreather Shipwreck Tide Rainbow Cyanobacteria Sun Hydrogen economy Chesapeake Bay Cancer Gasoline Chlorophyta Urinary incontinence Elis Prefecture Keynesian economics

do i have to treat the water in my teired fountain if i want to put coi and shabunkins i have large five or teired fountain and i bought six small coi some large goldfish and like a dozen large shabunkins and tossed them in its been one week and a few goldfish have died but most are seeming to thrive should i be treating the water well you have more than enough mechanical filtration the water falling off each tier will add oxygen into the water and keep the water from becoming stagnent you should however add dechlorinator to it although if it has been running for awhile befor you added the fish most of the chlorine should have evaporated out of the water do you know how many gallons are in it is it possible to add carbon filtration to it goldfish produce a lot of waste and that amonia will build up in in effect suffocate the fish in thier own waste carbon filtration will help remove some of that waste and once it cycles just like any body of water with livestock in it bacteria in the water will also help break down the massive ammounts of waste produced by goldfish  Sewage treatment Aquarium Brewery Goldfish Marine aquarium Water purification Fountain Carbon dioxide Photosynthesis Dry cleaning Dishwasher Energy development Sea-Monkey Wood pulp Chlorine Fossil fuel power plant Filtration Anaerobic digestion Water pollution Eutrophication Water Homeostasis Environmental concerns with electricity generation Alkane Hydrogen Haloalkane Sugar Ozone Hydrogen economy Carbon dioxide sink Biochemistry Dundas Square Ozone depletion Permian-Triassic extinction event Acetic acid Gasoline Blood Thermal depolymerization Dairy Wine making Industrial wastewater treatment Terraforming Casting Water garden Ozone hole Renewable energy Fire fighting Bacteria Chlorination Alternative biochemistry Vermicompost Ozone layer Rebreather Nuclear power Factory farming Weathering Hard water Cryptosporidium Kidney Swimming pool Town gas Environmental engineering Cellular respiration Pebble bed reactor Disinfection Waste management Fire extinguisher Sodium carbonate Acid mine drainage Sulfuric acid Honey Hemoglobin Acne Autonomous building Bong Carnivorous plant Alcohol fuel Insulin Carbon cycle Compost Lake Redox Iron Circulatory system Fish farming Water supply Renal physiology Agricultural wastewater treatment Biodiesel Gas mask Hydrogen sulfide Biogeochemical cycle Carburetor Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Beer

questions about my community tank i have a gallon that currently has fancy guppies mollies cory cats platies zebra danios neon tetras african dwarf frogs and about babies of a variety of sizes i'm not planning on adding more fish unless necessary females getting bullied lack of schooling etc if i change my mind am i safe to add more fish if so what kinds will nature takes its course with the fry or do you think i will have many fry growing into adults any suggestions for my tank best temp ph etc for my tank combos also i lost a guppy to a freak filter accident and they next day her mate died is this coincidence is it necessary to put netting over the filter please give me any info you think i need ty things i already know so please don't give me these answer or anything completely basic like do water changes ty if you think something is basic but unique feel free to let me know my tank is not overstocked fish eat their fry proper general maintenance there is no need to get rid of certain breed i have done a lot of research and as you can see i have top mid and bottom swimmers as for the guppies i realize they are the million fish basic info about guppies i'm not concerned about too many guppies that's the goal they will be moved when they are large enough i will be moved only fry in the community tank i have many live plants aeration filtration this is considered basic types of info not unique don't take me wrong i appreciate all comments i just wish people would read more carefully and specific i am talking about my fish when i say fish eat their fry the large majority of the breeds i have eat their fry most of my fry are guppies i have some platy fry that were just born but have only seen at once culling will begin to occur once they get the majority of their color they will be used for food for convict and oscars owned by friend and others will be given to friends with other community tanks all has been arranged you could buy more fish since most of yours are smaller but make sure you have more filtration than you need i would add some different tetras they come in so many colors and sizes the mollies will prolly eat the fry unless you have good hiding places hard one to call without a picture i'd say keep the tank about f and a ph of about lower ph will help keep amonia down if it becomes a problem but only so much if you want the fry to live i'd place a fish net over the filter intake other wise don't worry about it a pain to clean it's probably a coincidence about the guppies mate but we don't know what fish think yet i would also suggest doing some research into planted tanks it could really increase the look of your tank as well as water quality extra oxygen will increase the number of fish you can have but it does take work to do it right hope i helped  Brewery Fish farming Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Hamster Tofu Shark Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tilapia Sea-Monkey Yerba mate Dairy Goldfish God Emperor of Dune Thermal power station Fugu Shrimp farm Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hydrogen economy Theory of conduct Fancy rat Poker jargon Carburetor Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Tank Salmon Social rule Autonomous building Folic acid Domestic rabbit Houseplant Energy development Milk Coffee House Mouse Dwarf gourami Seabird Biodiesel RuneScape quests Ecology Hydroponics Nuclear power Solar power Boeing 747 Live-bearing aquarium fish Danio Water purification E85 Elephant Vegetarianism Zebra Danio Little Britain Tocopherol Fishing Dry cleaning Gaia Online 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spider Motorcycle Potato Dog Education Digital photography Diving Abortion debate Plant breeding In-N-Out Burger Domesticated turkey Infantilism Green Revolution Veganism Weight training Chinook salmon Clownfish Atkins Nutritional Approach Koi Reef tank Eutrophication Saturn V Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Tooth Apollo 13 Biodiversity Laserdisc Monopoly (game) Animal Species Nutrition M60 machine gun Fish and chips Philip J.

i received a betta as a gift it is in a container that is about gallon is that large enough for one betta i read they don't need oxygen to survive it has stones a nice plant it also has some stone like thing that it can swim thru how often do i clean the container i always feel sorry for those poor things that you see in the stores that are in those tiny square things this little guy seems happy but i read about them kept in larger aquariums with the filter system all i don't want to get into all that but i want the little guy to be happy healthy too any suggestions i also read that it is not good for them to be in the vases with the peace lily plant in it first of all bettas do need oxygen to survive but they don't need it pumped into the water to dissolve they breathe air from the surface which is why their containers should never be airtight although they should have lids as bettas are terrific jumpers for a one gallon tank you must clean it at least every or days one gallon of water accumulates waste very quickly so you have to be diligent about this he will be happy in gallon of water as long as you change the water frequently enough it's understandable if you don't want a huge tank with filtration it's difficult to explain this without getting into details about the whole nitrogen cycle but basically filters should only go in tanks that have been cycled trying to cycle a gallon tank will only throw things off balance because of the small amount of water so i would actually advise against filtering such a small tank however discipline when it comes to water changes is a must another important thing is heating bettas come from tropical climates and require a steady temperature in the high s fahrenheit the only way to ensure this is via a heater you can get junior heaters for gallon tanks so technically bettas do not need those large aquariums with elaborate filtration systems he will be happy in gallon unfiltered as long as you keep his water clean and heated however he will be happier in a larger tank maybe gallons and it'll also be less work for you less water changes so maybe you can consider that and you're right about the betta in a vase setup it is a torture device for them  Marine aquarium Brewery Sewage treatment Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Fish farming Bong Dry cleaning Carburetor Solar power Reef tank Carbon dioxide Ocean thermal energy conversion Water purification Hard disk Apollo 13 Thermal power station Hydrogen economy Ecology Water Alcohol fuel Energy development Sun Biodiesel Sea-Monkey Renewable energy Diesel engine HVAC Hydroponics Rebreather Dwarf gourami Fire fighting Swimming pool Nuclear power Cannabis cultivation Pebble bed reactor Carnivorous plant Nuclear reactor E85 Diving Siphon Decompression sickness Dairy Transformer Environmental concerns with electricity generation Stirling engine Eutrophication Dishwasher Oxygen sensor Japanese tea ceremony Ozone depletion Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fire extinguisher Air conditioning Thermostat Portable stove Gasoline Gas metal arc welding Sterilization (microbiology) Motor oil Kidney Sauna Fusion power Glossary of firefighting terms Turbocharger Gas compressor Carbon dioxide sink Fuel injection Theory of conduct Power station Jet engine Cold fusion Three Mile Island Vacuum tube Global warming and agriculture Entropy Wind power Ecology of Hong Kong Drowning Furnace Planetary habitability Nuclear fallout Earthworm Internal combustion engine Lung Vermicompost Glossary of firefighting equipment Biogeochemical cycle Welding Liquid breathing

water chemistry way off and water cloudy i have a planted gal tank with spotted gar a shovelnose catfish pleco and rosy red feeders did have days ago now down to about most died the tank has been established for months now and my chemestry has always tested in the norm days ago i noticed about dead rosy's then found about more hours later i quickly removed them but was out of test strips i got more and tested last night no ppm nitrites ppm gh always has been kh ppm and ph about i know these are some wild readings double checked got the same today i retested after installing additional filters all established from other tanks everything tested close to the same ph went down to but kh dropped to ppm and nitrites dropped to ppm my water is still cloudy and fish are dying like crazy have any cheap solutions or causes i am out of ammonia test strips i'm shure it's climbed from all the deaths but i don't think it's the cause my ph is generally about so it is low the tank is actually very well maintained on it's own i normally don't touch it except for a water change a month for the plants to get extra co buildup is and has been low the pleco does a good job very active if it helps my plants have been growing rapidly the past few days i'm assuming thanks to the added ammonia a don't play with the ph that's not the problem here something is off in your bio filter at six months there shouldn't be and prehaps when you clealed it just was over cleaned and wiped out too much of your nitrosomma's if it's just the feeders dying off the problem probably was that there were too many fish and the death of them combined with thier decomposition caused an influx of ammonia is what i guess here you already have a pleco and that population listing i don't think using cory cats is the way to go either it doesn't seem like this is excess food such as flakes or whatever secondary thing i see here is using test strips they are not that accurate and i'd urge you to get a liquid reagent tester they are more accurate and easier to read if your bigger fish are not having problems then do treat this like the other answerer said with a good sized partial water change for now and run a test specifically on your ammonia and nitrites you're ph is a little low but that's not a problem that is actually keeping your ammonia from being all that more toxic run your tests with the new kit after a water change and please let me know you can get better answers and superior service at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv follow up john has some good advice actually but when it comes to fixing your ph you really do not have to worry about this at you are quite well within an acceptable range and ph adjustments should be done prior to populating a tank shifts in ph levels with a fish population in the water can be just as damaging as ammonia and nitrites in the water i suspect that your ph is downing due to overpopulation with those rosies in and i like the idea of just keeping them in a seperate tank until you want to put some in to feed i think i know what you are doing putting that many in so you don't have to make continual trips for food and the logic isn't bad on that here is the problem with doing that though one of the first breakdown steps of the ammonia into nitrite is the production of nitric acid it will exist in the water while your nitrites are being formed and that presence of the nitric acid is what is lowering your ph it is being caused because of excess waste and ammonia present in the water for now to treat this don't fight the battle with the ph number but combine this with putting less feeders in the tank and raising your kh to give you a bigger buffer  Sewage treatment Carbon dioxide Hydrogen sulfide Nitric acid Hydrogen economy Fish farming Eutrophication E85 Hydrogen peroxide Hydrogen Water purification Explosive material Nuclear power Haloalkane Carburetor Dairy Discus (fish) Water (molecule) Electrophysiology Poker jargon Cyanide Biodiesel Brewery Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Keynesian economics Debugging Thermal power station Nitrogen Ozone depletion Tank Cocaine Hypoglycemia Extreme Programming Microeconomics Ammonium nitrate Theory of conduct Shrimp farm Solar power Hydrochloric acid Internal ballistics Ozone hole Motor oil Hydroponics Organic farming Diseases of the honeybee Messerschmitt Bf 109 Nutrition Hard disk Hard water Sulfuric acid CPU cache Inflation Biogeochemical cycle Biochemistry Folic acid Hamster Technetium M16 (rifle) HIV test Autonomous building Aquarium GED M60 machine gun Nitrous oxide Veganism Ecco the Dolphin Urea Water FairTax Software testing Aldehyde Gmail Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ultraviolet Unemployment B-47 Stratojet Jet engine Energy development Natural gas Supply and demand Town gas Protein Photosynthesis Poison Moon Iron Chlorine The Apprentice 2 Social rule Aluminium Rebreather Rocket fuel Cannabis cultivation

a question i want to know if u can feed red blood worms to salwater fish more convincing answers i keep both fresh and saltwater tanks although my freshwater fish love them i haven't had any saltwater fish that have shown nearly the same amount of enthusiasm for eating them i've seen bloodworms suggested as food for saltwater fish but since they're the freshwater larval form of a terrestrial insect they can be found in almost any lake pond stream or river i'm not sure that most saltwater fish recognize that these are even food that said it would be possible to feed them to the fish i just can't say with any certainty that the fish will eat them they wouldn't be harmful as an occasional treat but they shouldn't be used as a sole food i always prefer to give my saltwater fish a basic diet of flakes or pellets but any frozen live foods i give i try to match with the environment where the fish would naturally be found so for saltwater fish i would give mine enriched brine shrimp plankton krill clams etc based on the size of the fish  Marine aquarium Shrimp farm Salmon Krill Fly fishing Fish farming Striped bass Zebra Danio Halfbeak Axolotl Sockeye salmon Clownfish Fauna of Australia Seabird Fishing Water (molecule) Discus (fish) Plankton Vegetarianism Goldfish Angling Antarctic krill Fish Mussel Tilapia Crayfish Lake Eutrophication Tlingit Dwarf gourami Sea-Monkey Brine shrimp Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Blackfish Sodium chloride Hamster Murray Cod Lamprey Tetrapod Roman eating and drinking Aquaculture Aztec Anchovy Bioluminescence Cantonese cuisine Freshwater angelfish Crocodile Snail Desert Ecology Jellyfish Water resources Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Chlorophyta Bengali cuisine Taboo food and drink Octopus Albatross Smelt Earthworm Sawfish (fish) Shrimp Domestic rabbit Florida Living fossil Killifish Chinook salmon Dead Sea Mazon Creek fossils Nerpa Osmosis Cheese Cuisine of Denmark Gar Lobster German cuisine Russian cuisine Animal New York SuperCroc Annelid Japanese cuisine Copepod Tofu Chicken Kashrut Brook trout Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Cuisine of Malaysia Fish and chips Omega-3 fatty acid Macquarie Perch Aquifer Fugu Wisconsin glaciation Seafood

saltwater aquarium salinity problem question i can't seem to get the salinity specific gravity up to i add more salt and it goes up for a bit but then settles back down to to i feel like i've already added quite a bit more than the cup per gallon as recommended on the instant ocean package that i used i have a gallon viaaqua tank a fluval canister filter pounds of live rock pounds of live sand and pounds of regular sand aragonite scarlet hermits and nassarius snails i'me using a red sea hydrometer swing arm my other water parameters seem to be okay ph about temp about f nitrates and nitrites okay i've been taking out gallons of water adding more salt to the bucket stir it up and then pour it back into the tank when it looks to be dissolved completely no air stone and its usually the next day when i notice the sg has gone back down again i don't understand it because i was expecting the salinity to go up as the water evaporates i understand the effect of sawter temperature on specific gravity and have made the necessary adjustments my concern is that the s g is not calculating the salinity properly i know my water is on the hard side maybe to ppm according to test srtips could this be affecting the s g don't pay attention to the cup per gallon given in the directions on the salt in my experience this is hardly ever an accurate measurement to get the salinity high enough for a tank with inverts if anything it usually works out closer to cup or more for me go by the readings of the hydrometer just make sure that there aren't any air bubbles attached to the needle if you use a floating needle variety and rinse the hydrometer well between and before each use to make sure there isn't dried salt making the float stick or weighing it down the glass floating hydrometers are more accurate but can be harder to read if there's any current they are also much easier to break take an average of three readings from different points in the tank and take an average if the readings seem to fluctuate the temperature would only affect the salinity by about for every of change in temp and the salinity should go down as the water evaporates hardness shouldn't be a factor if you have salt creep along the filter or rim this could cause the salinity to go down  Dead Sea Explosive material Brewery Water (molecule) Anchor Carburetor Desert Sewage treatment Coffee Tea Fish farming Casting Sea-Monkey Hydrometer Carbon dioxide Salinity Fire extinguisher Weighing scale Dialysis Beer E85 Dairy Thermal power station STS-87 Hard water Soap bubble Tank Hydroponics Sea ice Ammonia Water STS-62 Tide Salt Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dishwasher Autonomous building Concentration Ocean thermal energy conversion Dry cleaning Apollo 13 Sea level rise Mercury Atlas 6 Siphon Reef tank Electrophysiology Mineral Knife Biodiesel Eutrophication 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake First aid Water purification M60 machine gun Agar plate Lake Bong Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Nitrogen Internal ballistics Sea water Wave power Great Salt Lake Textile manufacturing Robot Master PID controller Bubble Bobble Geography of Africa Margin of error Loudspeaker Gaia theory (science) Coriolis effect Soil salination Collodion process Welding Sento Opportunity rover Equine conformation Salton Sea Alcohol fuel Glass Diving Fire fighting Concrete Global warming and agriculture Pacific Ocean Prostate cancer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Gravity Pottery Big Bang Diamond simulant

how can i make my tetras less timid i have three black phantom tetras in a gallon tank but everytime i approach the tank they all hide in a corner behind a ceramic ornament i've had one of the tetras for three years and the others for they will come out if i feed them but they eat better if i walk away from the tank and watch them at a distance is there anyway i can gradually make the less timid yup to above most species are schoolers but you've already had them for a few years so i don't think thats the issue i think the issue is the noise and this huge object they see huge compared to them and they aren't secure enough to just come out for all they know that's a predator comming after them i wouldn't stress it much as fish are not like a dog and cat where you can directly train them to do things as long as they are growing not fighting or sick they happy just sneak back away walk slow so they don't feel the vibrations as much and smile if you need further help and advanced answers check out fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv  Tank Neon tetra Discus (fish) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story Sin City Gray Wolf The Catcher in the Rye Kender Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Princess Zelda Kodocha Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Biological pest control Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sealab 2021 Cat Dog Chicken Goldfish Ron Weasley Characters in the Smurfs Brown Bear Battle of the Bulge Eastern Front (World War II) Spider The Death Gate Cycle Species Ecology Marine aquarium Link (Legend of Zelda) Hydrogen economy Friends German grammar Hunting Aquarium Traumatic incident reduction Equine conformation Kakapo Blonde on Blonde IBM PC compatible The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures Erwin Rommel Tetra Pak Shrimp farm Humphrey Bogart Diesel engine Taikyoku shogi The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe English grammar RuneScape quests Tank classification Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys American Alligator Characters of Naruto Livestock Fish farming Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bottlenose Dolphin The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Drama Transformer Ceramics Zerg Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Hamster Utility cycling The Beach Boys Orca Theory of conduct Religion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Internet fraud Mercury 4 AGX-04 Gerbera Tetra 2000 Australian Grand Prix Immortality Baroque chess F-16 Fighting Falcon The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Stomach cancer Combine (Half-Life 2) Sea-Monkey Time Out of Mind USS Yorktown (CV-5) Jet engine Dai dai shogi Futurama (TV series - season 2) African American Vernacular English YuYu Hakusho Socialization Characiformes The Strangerhood White Cloud Mountain Minnow Jackass: The Movie Dualism (philosophy of mind) Out-of-body experience

beginner with fish tank help i just got a new gallon fish tank and it came with chocolate albino algea suckers and i was just wondering what would be some good fish to get that would all get along and some helpful tips on everything from feeding to cleaning thanx first read up on cycling your tank you will kill fish if you don't cycle it read up on that by searching it on google or reading this article http www cichlid forum com articles fishless cycling php next it's all up to your taste about sticking your tank don't get something of everything most fish prefer larger groups of their own species corydoras catfish are amusing and very active bottom level fish they help clean food that falls to the bottom but should be fed sinking bottomfeeder pellets they should be in groups of or more they are sensitive to nitrate buildup and salt in their water tetras are also a common choice as there are many colors and shapes to choose from and the shoal well they are also very hardy fish that will tolerate a lot of conditions from temperature swings and ammonia spikes to different food they are mostly mid level to surface dwellers and prefer groups of or more feeding should be by level fish and amount eaten higher level fish should be fed floating food like common tropical flakes so as to not compete with bottom dwellers and bottom level fish should be fed sinking foods like bottom dweller pellets for the same reason it may take you a bit but carefully monitor how much the fish eat in the span of or minutes and adjust the amount you give them accordingly a group of or cory catfish will need one sinking bottom dweller pellet a day for example but if they compete with other aquiarium denizens like apple snails there may need to be one in the morning and another at night to feed everyone evenly cleaning aquariums is actually easy if you keep a good 'cleanup crew' usually snails three apple snails will keep a gallon tank fairly sparkling with you only needing to do a water change every week don't overstock your tank is another vital tip a rule of thumb is one inch of fish per gallon and one gallon per snail make sure that you know a fish's environmental and social needs before you add it some fish need live plants to use as hiding places others will tear up live plants and harrass your other fish and to top all this off get a gallon tank fill it with cycled tank water this is your hospital and quarrentine tank always quarrentine any new fish you get for at least weeks in this tank and if one of your fish gets sick you can move it to this smaller tank it is a lot easier to treat a disease or parasite in a hospital tank than it is to treat all of your fish in your main tank good luck and welcome to fishkeeping  Marine aquarium Fish farming Tilapia Corydoras Goldfish Hamster Sea-Monkey Brewery Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Carburetor Fishing Carnivorous plant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Shark Thermal power station Guinea pig Eutrophication Water Breastfeeding Dairy Electrophysiology Water (molecule) Domestic rabbit Ecology Gar Coffee Fugu Dog Chocolate Hydroponics Malaria Fancy rat Bong Dry cleaning Axolotl Orca Alcohol fuel Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy Tooth Clownfish Toyota Prius Anorexia nervosa Bottlenose Dolphin Earthworm Fire fighting Fish Omega-3 fatty acid Water purification Fossil fuel power plant Strap-on dildo Myxobolus cerebralis Biodiesel Ocean thermal energy conversion Houseplant Salmon USS Tunny (SS-282) Livestock Apple Nuclear reactor RuneScape quests Krill USS Yorktown (CV-5) Zebra Danio Hard disk Octopus Soil life Spider Dog agility Fecal incontinence Atlantic herring E85 Coral reef Trophic level Organic farming Schistosomiasis Gypsy moth Hypoglycemia Breakfast Iron Anchor Japanese tea ceremony Vitamin C Snail Anopheles Microeconomics Mattress Freshwater angelfish

moving goldfish so come payday my black moor goldfish and my fantail goldfish are going to get a lovely new larger tank i've heard some horror stories about losing fifty percent of the fish in a move and i don't want to only have one fish left how i can i ensure a successful move i know how to set up the new tank for the most part but do i put any of the old water in the new tank how long should i let it sit cycle before putting the fish in how do i put the fish in when it's finally time a detailed step by step response would be awesome thanks hi demon no problem i've done it myself so have several people in my forum this is how it goes assuming the tank you are transferring your goldfish to is no bigger than twice the volume of their old tank it's easy because in effect you will simply be doing a water change so there should be no cycling issues before you begin make sure the new tank is filled with water allowed to stand for a couple of days to test it do this even if it is brand new you cannot be too careful then clean it thoroughly with luke warm water salt finally rinse with clean water calculate how much more water your new tank holds than your old one prepare slightly more than this amount for example if your present tank is a gallon your new one is gallons prepare gallons of treated water allow to stand until it reaches room temperature then you are ready for the move draw off buckets full of your old tank water then using a small net guide each of your fish into a small container or bag transfer each individual to one of the buckets then transfer all your ornaments plants airstones other decorations plus filter to the other bucket these all have the healthy bacterial colonies on them which preserve the cycle if you have a canister filter simply unhook it from your old tank transfer the remainder of your old tank water into your new tank until you have just a couple inches left in the old the gravel can now be rinsed in the remaining water transferred to the new tank leaving the loose debris gunk behind in the old tank this residue is great for the tomato plants arrange your decorations plants airstones etc in your new tank fix the filter then gently introduce your fish to the new tank one by one in the same way you put them in the bucket once they are in their new home the bucket of water they were in can also be added along with the one the accessories were in which should bring the water level in the new tank to at least half way slowly top up with the new treated temperature matched water switch on your filter airstones you are done depending on the capacity of your filter the capacity of your new tank you may need a bigger filter but running your old one in conjunction with the new one for several weeks will ensure a smooth transition keep a daily check on your parameters for a couple of weeks do regular partial water changes as normal job done finally if the tank you are transferring to is a whole lot bigger than twice the volume of your old one you may need to cycle it from scratch in which case i recommend a fishless cycle link below for several reasons firstly you have no urgency to transfer so a few more weeks will not hurt second a fishless cycle is almost always quicker more controllable than using live fish which brings me to arguably the most important reason no poor fish have to suffer the stress torment of being used in this way simply because they are unfortunate enough to be regarded as 'hearty' whatever that means or cheap good luck with your endeavours  Brewery Goldfish Dairy Bong Thermal power station E85 Entropy Marine aquarium Japanese tea ceremony Carburetor Menstrual cup Sento Sewage treatment Nuclear power Aquarium Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hash table Textile manufacturing Yerba mate Betting (poker) Poker jargon Hard disk Cannabis cultivation Fire extinguisher Jet engine Loudspeaker Fire fighting Fish farming CPU design Hydrogen economy Dishwasher Shrimp farm Mercury Atlas 6 Vacuum cleaner CPU cache PID controller Microeconomics Dialysis Rebreather Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Biodiesel Carbon dioxide Three Mile Island Energy development Water Ocean thermal energy conversion Water purification Hydroponics Diseases of the honeybee Redundant array of independent disks Halitosis Electronic amplifier Hamster Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Water (molecule) Hebrew calendar Quicksort Philosophy of space and time Alcohol fuel Electrophysiology Fancy rat Vitamin C Urinary incontinence Toyota Prius Tea STS-61 Internal ballistics Coffee Elis Prefecture Nuclear reactor Single Transferable Vote Sake Contact lens Motor oil Artificial neural network Normal distribution FairTax Floppy disk Axolotl Dodge Charger Panama Canal Fischer Random Chess Tidal power Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Autonomous building Extreme Programming First aid Polymerase chain reaction Domestic rabbit Fast bowling Web crawler

what kind of food is best for a small ryukin in response to a question i asked regarding my ryukins strange behavior see ryukin being silly one of the ya members answered that it is normal so long as he isnt stressed and i havent been feeding him on the surface my question is this is it for some reason bad to feed a ryukin on the surface the question was regarding his pattern of swimming up the current created by his filter is there a connection between feeding him surface food and swim bladder problems he usually eats flake food on the surface he has floating pellets but doesnt seem to like eating them he always spits them out i know goldfish do this playfully before eating them but he just leaves them floating when hes done i have never heard of feeding goldfish sinking food is that what they are supposed to eat i have the kind of gravel they sell at petsmart its a mid size gravel not as fine as some but not huge either the biggest rocks are about the size of my pinky nail and bear in mind i am a small female would he be able to eat the pellets or would they sink out of his reach hi kii creating buoyancy problems by surface feeding is just another of those pesky goldfish urban myths like the bowl the second memory if you watch fish for any length of time they will almost certainly come up for air blow it out their gills this is what they are designed to do so rest assured you are not creating problems this way there is nothing nicer than being able to hand feed your goldfish regarding the food what they are supposed to eat in the wild much of a carp's diet consists of plants mulluscs so it's good to try to replicate that healthy balance so i would advise weaning him off flakes as they are the 'junk food' of the goldfish diet a good staple pellet food like pro gold or any of several made by hikari are excellent supplemented by small daily amounts of variously frozen brine shrimp bloodworms cooked shelled peas cooked broccoli citrus fruit finally regarding your mentioning the size of the gravel your fish will have no problem 'grubbing' through it foraging for food they positively love doing this but i would say that your gravel is irregularly shaped then it is a very real danger of getting stuck in their mouths choking i would advise the tiny mm rounded fine stones or alternatively large 'pond safe' polished river rocks from garden centres are far better if only for your peace of mind than risking choking with pea sized gravel  Hamster Breastfeeding Vitamin C Fishing Fish farming Antarctic krill Axolotl Guinea pig Swimming pool Shrimp farm Salmon Carburetor Sea-Monkey Food Shark Shotgun Bengali cuisine Aquarium Maize Carbon dioxide Blood (computer game) Tilapia Internal ballistics Diving Veganism Krill Anorexia nervosa Anchor Korean cuisine Livestock Lake Burley Griffin Jewish cuisine Cat Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Olduwan Glacier Seabird Gravel Scuba set Omega-3 fatty acid Bong Nerpa Pea Pikmin Loudspeaker Agriculture Gar Stone Age Tea Diving regulator Cuisine of Malaysia Tetrapod Apple American lobster Acorn Urinary incontinence Dog Tlingit Swimming Healthy eating Mountain Gorilla Thermal power station Dieting Japanese tea ceremony Dairy Autonomous building Sperm Whale Atlantic herring Folic acid Handloading Fancy rat Terminal ballistics Tomato Cuisine of Denmark Carnivorous plant Elephant Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Flood geology Obesity Bladderwort Electrophysiology Chopsticks Desert Raw food diet Fusion power Prostate cancer Naval mine Stomach cancer Drill bit Floppy disk Shotgun shell Iron

what fish would be a good tank mates for goldfish and a plec i was wondering what would be a good tank mate s for them im fairly new to fishkeeping myself so something on the easier side that is hardy and obviously a community fish im in a hard water area not sure of the ph though and have a foot tank ok so do you have a coldwater tank or tropical for a coldwater tank i'd suggest white cloud minnows they are extremely hardy fish but they are rly small as well and they love to live in shoals of around so you could make the population of your tank increase by adding they are really cool and quite cute too for a tropical tank i'd go to some tetra's they are just like the white cloud minnows but a tropical water version they are small and come in different colours so again you could put a shoal of in and they will add colour to your tank without over running it again they are hardy fish and get along with everything good luck with finding the right fish  Marine aquarium White Cloud Mountain Minnow Goldfish Danio Characiformes USS Tunny (SS-282) Cruising (maritime) Aquarium Cloud Tank locomotive Seabird Tank Corydoras Sea-Monkey Swarm Gar Discus (fish) Sonar Koi Rail terminology Bottlenose Dolphin Platypus Tag M4 Sherman Albedo Aquatic ape hypothesis Water garden Zebra Danio Brewery Clownfish Messerschmitt Bf 109 Unreal Yacht Fish BZFlag Walleye Fish farming Tilapia Geography of Japan M16 (rifle) Sailfin Molly Peafowl Hamster Cardinal tetra Gilligan's Island Butterflyfish Autonomous building Neon tetra Seismic retrofit Cyprinid Bryce Canyon National Park Precipitation (meteorology) Humpback Whale Halfbeak Hydrogen economy Mosquito Thermal power station Shark Pok__mon Abilities BMW 801 Panama Canal Taikyoku shogi Panzer II Leopard Isetta Grunion USS Ray (SS-271) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Shrimp farm Stock car (rail) Seine (fishing) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) El Ni__o Whale song National Weather Service Tiger I Smelt Trolling for fish Battle of Tarawa Bird Gal__pagos Islands Spratly Islands Hurricane Rita Kingdom Hearts P-38 Lightning USS Aaron Ward (DD-483) Carnivorous plant Leopard tank French Frigate Shoals Climate of the United Kingdom Centurion tank Houseplant Ammunition Yerba mate Pottery Elis Prefecture Carp Norway national football team Global Liberation Army Hardy-Weinberg principle

serious fish injustice what do i do my moronic office manager just days ago set up tiny tanks for his desk one's gallon the other gallon today i arrived at work to find the gallon with two inch long malawi cichlids and a pleco in it and get this the gallon with two and a half inch long oscars and a pleco in it he informed my concerned face that 'he knows what he's doing' 'they'll be okay in there for a year before they get too big' blah blah blah he claims he worked at a pet shop for years i managed a pet shop for but i don't know what i'm talking about so here's the question do i try to help this jackass take care of these poor doomed fish or do i wait 'till he leaves and kidnap them my office is dreary enough without a bunch of floaters to look forward to what would you do unfortunately he isn't doing anything illegal they're his fish and there are no cruelty laws that i know of in regards to how he's keeping them he is free to do what he wants with them and it's legally none of your business so it depends which do you value more the fish or your job if the latter do whatever talk to him steal his fish whatever else you'll get fired before long so do whatever if you value your job leave him be and let him learn his mistake the hard way yes i know this way is harder for the fish but he obviously isn't going to listen to you you gave him your advice continuing in that vein will only piss him off his ego is more important to him than these fish when the fish start getting sick simply raise an eyebrow at him and say nothing the only thing i can think of that might let you help these fish and keep your job is to buy him new tanks me i'd ignore him and his floaters if i worked closely with someone with that sort of ego i'd have to go find different work if it was just an office and i didn't have to deal with his ego daily in the course of my job to where it effected my work i'd just let it go if you have a family that depends on your income their interests in regards to your level of income should be a priority over a few fish and a mgr with an ego  Plame affair Discus (fish) Little Britain Poker jargon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Social rule Theory of conduct Marine aquarium The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Fox hunting Donald Rumsfeld Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Wal-Mart Drag racing Trade union Shaggy dog story Sin City A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina God Emperor of Dune Economics Phoebe Halliwell Make money fast Kim Possible Free trade YuYu Hakusho Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dilbert Great Teacher Onizuka Fancy Crane The Inside Funny Farm (comic) Samuel Goldwyn Beavis and Butt-head Miss Saigon Jackass: The Movie Ocean's Twelve Trailer Park Boys Pet Sounds Ethics Protoss Cichlid Kodocha MapleStory EastEnders Insurance Creatures in Bionicle Knots Landing Characters in the Smurfs Tilapia Time Out of Mind Grand Theft Auto (game) Euphemism Extreme Programming Call centre Economic inequality The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Transactional analysis The Invisibles The Critic W.I.T.C.H.

blue dolphin cichlids i am looking to start another large tank and recently i saw blu dolphin cichlids they caught my eye i have always had red devils and have now but he lives by himself i want to get a second tank and was thinking about having blue dolphins as my centerpiece i heard they are not very aggressive does anyone have any experiences with theese fish thanx moorii a very nice fish but a little different then the new worlds you may be used to they do best in groups rather than pairs and as adults the aim is to have one or two males with a bunch of females so it's always helpful to start off with extra juvi's to ensure you get a good ratio as slow growers you can't buy small fish and expect large fish a year from now growing these guys out takes long term commitment but on the bright side they can be started off in a smaller tank as long as there are plans for at least a gallon in the future they aren't very aggressive and are actually pretty timid for a cichlid they'll do best kept in species tanks but can be mixed with mild carefully selected malawi haps or non cichlids like synodontis catfish that won't bother them as a centerpiece for a mix n' match malawi tank though going with something tougher would expand your options for tankmates and keeping them singly means missing a lot on what they are about but then that goes for any cichlid in the end a colony of moorii is way nicer then those random mix n match tanks anyway  Discus (fish) Lake Malawi Poker jargon Tilapia Cichlid Live-bearing aquarium fish Oscar (fish) Hydrogen economy Sexual selection Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fish farming Color Ecco the Dolphin Norway national football team Freshwater angelfish Aquarium Badminton Zambezi Bottlenose Dolphin Sea-Monkey Miami Dolphins Time Out of Mind Unreal Biodiesel Cetacea Gameplay of StarCraft Whale Cetacean intelligence Internal ballistics E85 BZFlag Fast bowling Albatross Illegal drug trade Avenue Q Chicken Catfish Whaling Intelligent design Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gar Pittsburgh Steelers CPU cache Orca Jack Dempsey (fish) Team Fortress Classic Snooker Fish Stereoscopy Extreme Programming Zerg W.

ryukin being silly bear with me because this is going to sound like a worthless question but i am getting at something my ryukins filter in his gallon tank empties into the tank from about an inch above the water level and creates a current under water where the bubbles are pushed in just today i noticed my ryukin swimming into the current and then stopping and trying like mad to swim up the current at first i thought he was just playing as may still be the case but then someone suggested that perhaps he was doing it because there was more air where the bubbles are entering the water he doesnt stay in it just swims in it for a second or two and then goes off exploring his rocks and plants and then a few minutes later he is back in it it has also occured to me that he could just be swimming through a stronger part of the current since he is swimming closer to the top than he was before he has only been in the tank for about a week and getting stuck the reason i ask is that i would like to determine if there is a lack of oxygen in the tank so that i can take measures to correct it he is in good health and eating well the tank he was in did not cycle for months as recommended but as i said he is doing well and we are closely monitoring his ammonia levels has anyone else had experience with this behavior in their fish and if so can you give me any insight into what may be causing it is he just being playful he looks to me like hes just being silly and playful and in my experience goldfish are quite the little jokers but i just wanted to make sure nobody had had this be a bad sign or a sign of a problem in the water btw hes a tiny fish still but will be upgraded to a asap anyway so dont worry about tank size hes got a good few months before he outgrows it you didn't mention anything else wierd i know you monitor your ammonia good you have a good filter water quality should not be a problem how do you feed him flakes on the surface or do you sink his food this is important beacause that and stress are two main contributors to swimbladder disease our shubunkin acted 'funny' as well he was stressed a move and it was a couple of weeks to a month before he died it sucked if you haven't been feeding him on the surface and he is not stressed then he is probally playing they really are quite the entertainers just keep an eye on him and enjoy him  Thermal power station Goldfish Fish farming Drowning Swimming pool Water (molecule) Sea-Monkey Swimming Eutrophication Ammonia Rebreather Little Britain Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide Shrimp farm Sewage treatment Aquarium Fire fighting Urinary incontinence Ecology Decompression sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Brewery Atlantic herring Bong Hypoglycemia Carburetor Krill Axolotl E85 Solar system Tank Loudspeaker Autonomous building Seabird Galileo spacecraft Childbirth Livestock Insulin Water Carnivorous plant Ecco the Dolphin Dog Myxobolus cerebralis Traumatic brain injury Cognitive science Antarctic krill Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer Sea level rise Ozone depletion Origin of life Chernobyl accident Quarashi Welding Anorexia nervosa Electrophysiology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sun Equine conformation Motorcycle Hamster Siphon Fossil fuel power plant Apollo 8 Asthma Hard disk Clinical depression Breaststroke Dog agility F-16 Fighting Falcon 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Ozone hole Orca 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Prostate cancer Bottlenose Dolphin Boom Town (Doctor Who) GunBound Economics Space Shuttle external tank Scientology beliefs and practices Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Jumpstart 3rd Grade P-47 Thunderbolt Dwarf gourami Aluminium Schizophrenia Myocardial infarction Extreme Programming Dialysis Glacier Tide Chronic fatigue syndrome

how can i raise my hardness level and lower my alkalinity level in my tank i just tested everything in my tank and found problems the water is too soft for the fish i am going to get how can i raise it does it raise on it's own my alkalinity was very high how can i lower it does it lower on it's own i just set up my tank last night and i have the filter running i am getting zebra danios in a week and mollies and guppies in weeks any help would be helpful you don't have to answer both questions i don't see any problem in terms of water softness as many fish can easily adapt to any condition the fish you plan on keeping are very hardy and don't require a whole lot in terms of water chemistry with alkalinity are you refering to ph or kh with both again there is no problem and with kh high is good as it will keep your tank from experiencing ph fluctuations as long as your levels stay consistent you are fine whatever you do don't add any chemicals from a product that gaurantees to magically get rid of your problems  Marine aquarium Thermal power station Zebra Danio Danio Extreme Programming E85 Sewage treatment Motor oil Fish farming Aspartame Aquarium Brewery Corrosion Illegal drug trade Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Discus (fish) Water purification Hydrogen peroxide Carburetor Tank Reef tank Soil pH Hydrogen economy Uranium Bladderwort Portland cement Alkali Depleted uranium Dishwasher Water (molecule) PID controller Battery (electricity) Carbon dioxide Shrimp farm Chemistry Economy of Russia Fuel cell Solar power Alkaline earth metal Electrophysiology Base (chemistry) Messerschmitt Bf 109 Coffee Dead Sea Equine conformation Gasoline Abortion Chemoluminescence Emergence Motorcycle Siphon Welding Swimming pool Transactional analysis Science Tofu Ammonia Beryllium Twelve leverage points Prostate cancer Hard water Expert system Saturn V Hydrogen vehicle Nickel-cadmium battery Technetium Dam Fish Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Seismic retrofit Hydrogeology Stomach cancer Fire extinguisher Keynesian economics MTBE Mattress Radiation hardening Knife Experiment Hypoglycemia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Magnesium Fair use Drainage Tilapia Bicycle lighting Bayesian inference Seine (fishing) Ice core Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Car handling Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Unemployment Space Shuttle program Opportunity rover RuneScape quests Final Fantasy XI Poker jargon

can fish yawn because i think my betta fish is i was look at my fish every day for about minutes just to see if everything is going ok while looking at my betta fish he opened his mouth really wide then closed it and no he didn't go up for air he did this about a couple of times already also lately my betta has been flaring a lot at me for no reason maybe the two are connected somehow i know fish don't sleep they 'rest' so i thought maybe my fish is yawning so i turned off my tank's light and now my betta fish is in the little hole under his castle is this normal or is this some sort of diesase he didn't do something like this before i just got him about a little less than a month ago and yesterday i did my weekly water change maybe it was because of that sorry but i can't get a picture for you because my betta does it pretty fast can you please help thanks capp my betta yawns after i feed him bloodworms but that is just spitting up any part of the food he didn't like it looks like they thrust their jaw outwards but it is not yawning yawning is often associated with emotions but because fish don't have emotions that is not the case flaring is caused by stress and yawning is thought to be caused by nervousness so maybe the flaring is stressing the betta and making him nervous leading to a fishy yawn i don't think anybody is going to be able to tell you why the fish is yawning but there will be a lot of guesses nosoop u  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Yawn Equine conformation Fish The Ashlee Simpson Show EastEnders Bottlenose Dolphin Urinary incontinence Humphrey Bogart Weekly World News Tetrapod Shark Kitchen Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jet engine Tasmanian Devil Jon Secada Jaws (film) Orca Dwarf gourami Clomipramine Clownfish B-47 Stratojet Cliff Richard Nile crocodile Time Out of Mind Anorexia nervosa USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Hypoglycemia Discus (fish) Insomnia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Reflexology Hip hop collaborations AFI 100 Years series Combine (Half-Life 2) USS Twining (DD-540) Sun RuneScape Random Events The Blue Lagoon (1980 film) Anxiety Slayers Axolotl Meat Loaf Elis Prefecture The Amazing Race Solar flare Myxobolus cerebralis Sampling (music) Tourette syndrome Action potential Chronic fatigue syndrome Insulin Dog One Tree Hill (TV series) Decompression sickness Carburetor Slowpoke Thermal power station Bob and George Terminal ballistics Fast bowling Black hole Ecco the Dolphin Dairy Post-traumatic stress disorder Cat Neighbours Attack on Pearl Harbor American Alligator Vitamin C Sea-Monkey Poliomyelitis RuneScape quests Blood on the Tracks Vowel Carbon dioxide USS Indianapolis (CA-35) Aquarium Angling Strap-on dildo USS Yorktown (CV-5) USS Wichita (CA-45) Whale Gemini 9A Social rule Time Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Deluge (mythology) 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Ozone depletion Albatross Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trapping Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Amber Spyglass Paul Is Dead

cant seem to lower ammonia levels s i have one of the in tank monitors for ammonia level in my new uncycled gallon i had figured that if the ammonia got too high i could just do a partial water change to maintain good levles when the ammonia got just slightly high we did a like water change with a siphon the next day the ammonia had only gotten higher after it still hadnt evened out after like two days we did another water change still we saw no difference in the ammonia level even if our filter wasnt working it should have lowered the levels a bit simply by diluting the concentration of ammonia in the water we are using the live nh ammonia monitor in tank by mardel we had thought that maybe it just doesnt reset after the ammonia levels elevate and have put the test in clean water in a glass to see if it resets does anyone have any experience with this after a few water changes within maybe a week we are still seeing the test read only higher and higher levels help btw there is only one fish in it atm and it is a tiny ryukin it may also be important to note that judging by our test the water should be full of ammonia but he is swimming happlily his breathing is normal he is eating eagerly and stays near the middle of the tank where he should be the only strange behavior we have noticed is his habit of swimming upstream in the current created by the filter dumping the water back in the tank but even this is brief and then he goes back to exploring his gravel and plants it seems like he could even just be playing so judging by his patterns it seems like the water is perfectly fine since the test says its nearly toxic i have no clue what to think s ok as usual i am going to have to add an incredible amount of details first off stop with the you shouldnt have the fish in a gallon trip plz because he was a rescue and it was an uncycled gal or a gallon bowl while the tank cycled believe me his prior circumstances were worse i know the gal per '' of fish rule he is a baby and under '' when he exceeds '' he will get a larger tank right now i am testing the test to see if it lowers i would really like to know if anyone has used this test before and had good results not only with it increasing in ammonia level but also reading a decrease it has been sitting in treated tap water in a cup for about mins with no change in the reading this causes me some suspicion but we are just waiting still i should also have elaborated more on the fact that i am not seeing a change in ammonia even immediately after a water change the level has constantly increased despite all the water changes never dropped any advice also my primary question isnt an expression of concern over the existing levels its confusion as to why the levels have never dropped even after a water change i am wondering if the meter is flaky hopefully someone can tell me wether it is normal to see no change in the ammonia level a constant increase even after a signifigant water change seems fishy to me ditto to ghost i'm really liking this lady she's giving on target analysis on water chemistry i've seen in other answers and it's refreshing to see written out explanations kudos to you gf i can say that what she is saying about that live monitor is right on basically that live monitor is nothing more then a fancy test strip that wears out and needs replacement over time the best thing you can do for yourself to get a reliable accurate reading is get a liquid testing kit and while your tank is cycling out take readings from that ok so we'll not go into your population tank issues enough said i can read and comprehend lol i think the ammonia is lowering actually and you are just getting false readings from that live reader fish behavior will be another indicator if the ammonia was excessivly high you'd most likely see the fish near the top of the water breathing rapidly as this is the onset of ammonia poisoning if you are not seeing that in conjunction with your live reader i'm inclined to say your reading is false i'd reccomend getting the liquid drop testers and reduce your feedings to once a day only as much as the fish can eat entirely in minutes that will suffice and your goldfish is not going to die from starvation i promise you fish do not use food in the same manners you and i do being a cold blooded animal they do not have to internally heat themselves nor use the food as a source of energy to fight off disease excess food in the water is a strong source of ammonia and excess feedings directly means excess waste which ultimately means more ammonia as well stay on top of the water changes and do not give up on it just for the hell of it too run a check on your tap water source ones you get the testing kit and see if it's reading ammonia in there because like you said it should be lowering just rule that possibility out if you need further help feel free to email me direct via my profile jv  Sewage treatment Ammonia E85 Fish

do fish sleep i have a fish tank and i have brackish water fish my daughter my lady and my bubba say no they do not i believe every living organism must sleep to recharge their cells and rejuvinate themselfs every living thing needs sleep the heart slows down the breathing is more slow and regular and the muscles become more relaxed sleep means different things to different forms of animal life the saunders comprehensive veterinary dictionary defines sleep in animals humans dogs fish all animals as a period of rest during which volition and consciousness are in partial or complete abeyance and the bodily functions are partially suspended a behavioral state marked by characteristic immobile posture and diminished but readily reversible sensitivity to external stimuli each different animal chooses to perform sleep in different ways some lay down and close their eyes and some just hover with their eyes open but it doesn't mean that they don't sleep sleep is not about closing the eyes it's about rejuvenation  Sleep Animal communication Cat Tai Chi Chuan Suspended animation Traumatic brain injury Narcolepsy Thermoregulation Death Animal testing Rapid eye movement Animism Insulin Insomnia Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Tetrapod Whale Urinary incontinence Brain Warm-blooded Electroencephalography Milton H.

weird betta behavior this isn't really a concern more of a curiosity question two weeks ago i got my betta a bigger tank gallons his old one was really small pints and he's much happier in his new tank the weird part is that in the smaller tank he would always build huge nests but in the new big tank he doesn't at all i've also noticed the same thing w my second betta when he was in a smaller tank he'd build nests but when i got him a bigger one he stopped why is that btw my two male bettas were never together their tanks have always been on opposite sides of the room that's the same with one of my bettas he used to be in a gallon tank and he blew bubble nests all the time then i bought him a gallon bowl and he never builds nests anymore although there are many plants and hiding spots in the bowl so it might just be because he has more places to swim however my other betta who's in the old gallon tank builds bubble nests all the time once he built one that covered the entire water surface it probably does have something to do with their boredom levels lol so it's very possible that your fish might just be having fun swimming around in their extra space  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Aquarium Dwarf gourami K' Goldfish Autonomous building Swimming pool Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sea-Monkey Bong Fire fighting Winning Streak Soap bubble GunBound Zerg Fish farming Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve P-47 Thunderbolt Hamster Carbon dioxide StarCraft: Uprising Marine aquarium Tilapia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bubble Bobble Gallon Great Teacher Onizuka Quicksort RuneScape quests The Legend of Zelda series enemies Brewery Panama Canal "Weird Al" Yankovic Surtsey Siphon Ecology Hydrogen economy USS Yorktown (CV-5) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jet Force Gemini Bottlenose Dolphin Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Flush toilet Sewage treatment Russian joke FoxTrot Gourami Fast bowling Ecco the Dolphin God Emperor of Dune Seabird Coriolis effect Microeconomics Solar power Conker's Bad Fur Day Thermal power station Supply and demand Barton Springs Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Leatherback Sea Turtle Kakapo Pure Pwnage Nile crocodile Dyson sphere Tank truck Volume Rebreather Champagne (beverage) Sento Glacier Swimming First Battle of the Atlantic Professional wrestling slang Cooking weights and measures Advance Wars: Dual Strike Combine (Half-Life 2) Pop punk Sorting algorithm Castlevania: Symphony of the Night The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tank Sin City Fight Club Isetta Albatross Diving suit Wine making Three Mile Island Pok__mon Live!

aquarium newbie advice i'm thinking of getting a small aquarium i'm an experienced pet owner but i've never owned fish before my wife got me a really pretty betta which i keep on my desk at work and he got me thinking i'd like to get an aquarium how do i get started i'm a beginner so nothing too complicated small apartment so nothing too big my wife likes colourful pretty fish i like strange and unusual suggestions i aquariums are not hard to keep as long as you know the basics the easiest to keep is a gallon but it sounds like you would prefer a smaller version no matter which tank size you buy you will need lights and a filter gravel usually pounds per gallon i e a gallon would take lbs i like backings on my tank pictures and there are many natural scenes to choose from at your local pet dealer if you want tropical fish you will need a heater and depending on the fish i keep my tanks at between and degrees make sure that after you set up your tank you let it cycle for at least two weeks a month is better before you add too many fish betas are hardy and would do well you need to get your biological filter up and running your biological filter is friendly bacteria that render harmless any fish waste products that will produce the ammonia harmful to fish live plants will help 'cycle' the tank more quickly and they help prevent algae you will have to stick with smaller variety fish your beta is perfect make sure any others will stay small loaches may be fun to watch and tiny when you buy them but some can grow to be several feet long betas are compatable with most other 'community' fish just not another male beta neon tetras are flashy as are many types of tetras make sure you don't buy the smallest ones because they are easily stressed and can die for no apparent reason dwarf gouramis are pretty and a fun fish these are all freshwater i feed my fish twice a day no more than they can eat in to minutes i feed them frozen food in the morning and flake at night it helps them to remain healty and makes their colours bright lastly please get a water test kit you can only really know your tank is ready for fish if you can test the water and then you should test on a regular basis you will need to test at least for ph and ammonia the smaller tanks are a little harder to keep stable but it can be done with regular water changes only about once or twice a week 'bog log' is decorative wood that you can put in your tank to help keep it stable get a siphon and vaccum the gravel when you change the water it will only take a few minutes with a small tank make sure when you replace the water that the temperature is similar and it is conditioned with a dechlorinator i know this can sound complicated but it really isn't just take it a step at a time and your fish will love you for it there is nothing more eye catching than a well cared for tank with happy healthy fish good luck  Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Reef tank Goldfish Autonomous building Fish farming Tilapia Ecology Brewery Illegal drug trade Clownfish Hydrogen economy Biodiesel Dwarf gourami Water purification Neopets Kissing gourami Eutrophication Shrimp farm Domestic rabbit Clown loach Tlingit Textile manufacturing Water (molecule) Cruising (maritime) E85 Water Dairy Refrigerator Nuclear power Coral reef Cyanide Thermal power station Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Axolotl Insulin Gaia Online Tofu Krill Chlorophyta Halfbeak Carnivorous plant RuneScape skills 2000 Australian Grand Prix Guinea pig Dry cleaning Cocaine Knife Bottlenose Dolphin Antarctic krill Gas metal arc welding Unreal Electrophysiology Mattress Carbon dioxide Motorcycle Microeconomics Welding Fossil fuel power plant IBM PC compatible Fish Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cannabis cultivation Hypoglycemia Zebra Danio Diabetes mellitus GunBound Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Fishing Weight training Fancy rat Planetary habitability Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sento Vegetarianism P-38 Lightning Chinook salmon Coffee Fusion power M60 machine gun Tag The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Agriculture USS Tunny (SS-282) Craps M16 (rifle) Capercaillie

my fish bowl is getting cloudy and smelly just days after cleaning it what should i do i have a betta fish in a fish bowl and i have just cleaned his water days ago the water is becoming smelly and cloudy and i don't know what to do i use tap water that i let sit for a few days and i also use a conditioner for the water also he hasn't been moving as much is this a sign of sickness or just near death unfortunately bowls aren't the best homes for bettas despite the myths floating around if the water is getting cloudy you're probably feeding too much also if you're feeding flakes i suggest switching to pellets the reason bowls aren't great is because they don't really live in puddles or muddy footprints they live in rice paddies and slow moving streams in east asia so the small environment bowls provide is pointless bettas don't feel more comfortable in small spaces also the temp where they naturally live is about f and i'm willing to be you don't keep your ac at f it's nearly impossible to heat bowls so really the smallest they should be in is a gallon tank with a small filter and a watt heater watt for gallons and watt for gallons so it's very likely the poor water conditions and the cold are getting to your betta and might eventually lead to him getting sick instead of just being lethargic good luck if you have any other questions feel free to email me or check out the link in my profile  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Aquarium Autonomous building Brewery Carburetor Hydrogen economy Solar power Rice HVAC Goldfish Fish farming E85 Renewable energy Coffee Shrimp farm Thermostat Air conditioning Sewage treatment Tilapia Wind power Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Upholstery Bong Nuclear reactor Drowning Thermal power station Climate of the United Kingdom Water Biodiesel Environmental vegetarianism Sea-Monkey Axolotl Water heater Customs and etiquette of Japan Dishwasher Alcohol fuel Dwarf gourami Fire extinguisher Mars Exploration Rover Japanese toilet Chopsticks Fossil fuel power plant Japanese tea ceremony Sake Elephant Fire fighting Cruising (maritime) Dairy Cannabis cultivation Hydropower Phase (matter) Hyperthermia Galileo spacecraft Domestic rabbit Gmail Diesel engine Rail terminology Apollo 13 Great Lakes Hamster Ocean thermal energy conversion Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Temperature Beer Southeast Asia Sun Vacuum cleaner Weather lore Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Transformer Wine making Kannur district Alan Watts Desert Potomac River Quicksort Terraforming Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Energy development Elis Prefecture Opportunity rover Dialysis The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Louisiana Superdome Yacht Tea Dry cleaning Whale Domestic water system Tlingit Pasadena, California Porridge Deluge (mythology) San Francisco 49ers High-definition television Water (molecule) Heat Wall Street Aluminium

my friend put goldfish in a gallon bowl help i know it is completely terrible that is so mean for the poor fish her dad said get atleast fish but he know nothing about fish help what should i tell her she won't listen to me the first thing you need to tell her is that the fish are going to die if you keep them in the bowl they need water that is filtered and has air moving around the second thing you need to tell her is that you need one gallon of water for every one inch of fish so if all of her fish are one inches then she would need four gallons also she needs to take into consideration that these fish will grow although if they remain in a bowl they won't have time to grow since they will most likely die so if they are goldfish and each fish is supposed to grow to be three inches then she should accomodate for four inch fish or inches of fish so she would need gallons of water if she were to buy a gallon tank and put a filter and heater in there kept around degrees farenheit she should also get an air stone which will keep the water filled with oxygen her fish should be fine in a gallon as long as she doesn't have too many decorations in it  Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Autonomous building Fossil fuel power plant Flush toilet Fish farming Brewery E85 American Dad!

ok set up for a gourami and neons i have a gal standard with corycats and snail but i really want dwarf gourami and neons not bad zoo but you don't really even have to go that far just consider your tank depth and length for fish of this nature i'd say zoo is right on about the gourami max might be four inches three is a good safe esitmate and having only shouldn't be a problem neons should be schooled and go for instead of five there isn't really any issues in populations right now i have a baby arowana five baby clown loaches three spot gourami oapline gourmi female pearl gourami zebra danios and a male betta in my i moved out my work tank took up too much space and noone is dying or having any fights of course this isn't going to be a long term set up my baby arowana is still too small to go with the group in my and he will be moved the clown loaches of course will move when bigger they are only inches now the gourami and betta really don't fight but if aggression sets in the gourami go play with the arowana in the lol so sometimes you can have overcrowding but as long as you have proper filtration aquaclear for mine and realize the compatibility you can do it in this set up your fish are not going to really fight though just keep an eye on that dwarf with the neons and you are not going to run out of space none of these fish are massive waste producers either so best of luck with them sounds great you can get better help and service at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv  Dwarf gourami Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Gourami Kissing gourami Danio Perciformes Clown loach Hard disk Zebra Danio Timeline of alternative rock Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey USS Tunny (SS-282) Timon and Pumbaa Loach Hamster Shaggy dog story Quotation mark Tank Rail terminology Pearl Danio Sewage treatment Television Laser Sheryl Crow Equine conformation Red Dwarf The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Floppy disk Ostrich Poker jargon Fluorescent lamp Nuclear power Punk ideology Space Shuttle external tank Dishwasher Galactic Civilizations AFI 100 Years series Elephant RISC Drill bit Bristol Zoo Timeline of fictional future events Intelligent design RuneScape quests Incandescent light bulb Kender Animals in space Supernova Shark Clown Horse Hip hop collaborations Neon Genesis Evangelion Samus Aran Star Destroyer Dry cleaning Terminal ballistics Aquarium The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Insane Clown Posse USS Yorktown (CV-5) Domestication USS Nautilus (SS-168) Rebreather RuneScape slang and terminology Hydrogen economy Laws of cricket Neon tetra Quicksort RuneScape locations Sandworm (Dune) Stellar evolution Biodiesel Audio tape length and thickness American lobster Who Framed Roger Rabbit Helium Theodicy Tigon Social rule Hall & Oates Max Martin The Miracles Platypus Brewery The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Theory of conduct Irrigation Second Battle of the Atlantic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Lion Advance Wars: Dual Strike B-47 Stratojet Pitaten USS Hoel (DD-533) Pierson's Puppeteer Warrior (World of Warcraft) Lighting

how do i clean the inside of my tank fast i suspect that my aquarium is dirty from the inside how do i clean it it is not green the water looks dull but when i take the water out in a cup the water is perfectly clean i got it just on sunday first there is nothing about fish keeping that is fast everything about keeping fish is about time and patience if you just got the tank on sunday then it has not had time to cycle yet the term cycle is referred to allowing the tank time to set up a bio filter a group of positive bacteria that assist in keeping the water balanced many whom are new to the hobby add fish to the system too quickly and end up a with an ammonia spike and loose the fish if you already have fish in the tank do a partial water change take out of the water using a gravel vacuum and replace with water as close to the same temp as possible dont forget to add the stress coat to remove the chlorine and other harmful things from the water you need to go pick up a product called cycle add it to the water and this will help boost your bio filter and help get it established then maintain by doing weekly partial water changes each week to maintain a healthy system  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Fish farming Dairy Brewery Dry cleaning Swimming pool Thermal power station Ammonia Biogeochemical cycle Hard disk Sea-Monkey Siphon Reef tank Water supply Motor oil Disinfection Water purification Electrophysiology E85 Solar power Menstrual cup Temperature Dishwasher Discus (fish) Eutrophication Motorcycle Tank Chlorine Domestic rabbit Nuclear power Cannabis cultivation Fossil fuel power plant Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Toyota Prius Rail terminology Poker jargon Goldfish Axolotl Carburetor Swimming Refrigerator Textile manufacturing M60 machine gun Coffee Diseases of the honeybee PID controller Tofu Natural gas Dead Like Me Volleyball Home repair CPU cache Carbon dioxide Entropy Wetland Kalman filter Escherichia coli O157:H7 Menstrual cycle Polarization Energy development MS-06 Zaku II Kosher foods Audio level compression Sodium hypochlorite Fish Unreal Web crawler Hydrogen economy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Liquid crystal Japanese toilet Shrimp farm Sterilization (microbiology) Heinkel He 100 Advance Wars: Dual Strike Hybrid vehicle Fugu Biodiesel Brackish water Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Biology Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Ocean thermal energy conversion Tilapia Tea Mooney M20 Sabbath Healthy eating Butterfly stroke Hypoglycemia Ecology Dodge Charger Internal ballistics Seine (fishing)

my fish just died some questions my female swordtail just died i think it was ich because it looked as if it's body was covered in some sort of white powder and it's fins were folded i will clean the bottom of the tank and do a percent water change i am going to change the substrate from rocks to something smaller the rocks leave gaps for food and dirt to settle and make it harder to siphon out which probably is why my fish got ich from bad water conditions do i replace all the substrate at the same time will that be ok i know some beneficial bacteria grows on the substrate so i don't know if i should replace it all at once or gradually over a week also what do you suggest i replace it with it's a gallon with some moss and i'm getting a bigger tank in three months when i move apartments i was thinking some neon tetras or a single catfish or maybe even an oscar personally i prefer a fairly fine gravel over sand in tanks as the gravel is easier to clean assuming the tank is now empty i would suggest replacing all of the substrate at once to help eliminate the ich from the tank either wash out the tank well or allow it to sit without fish for weeks to be sure there is no ich in the tank before you add more fish ich is not caussed by poor water quality it's a parasite that is in the tank and needs to die off before you add more fish mm  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Tilapia Discus (fish) Brewery Aquarium Shark Milk Fish farming Wine making Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Textile manufacturing Pachypodium habitats German grammar Goby Evidence of evolution Dairy Sea-Monkey Dam Tank Fugu Flush toilet Autonomous building Ich Japanese toilet T-34 Nuclear fallout Diseases of the honeybee Gravel Kissing gourami Sailfin Molly Mussel Thermal power station Shrimp farm Vinegar Sento M4 Sherman Dredge Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Mattress Dinghy Tooth Hydrogen economy Habitats of Pachypodium of Southern Continental Africa and Madagascar Houseplant Opportunity rover Foodborne illness Biodiesel Tetrapod Paint Dwarf gourami Flood geology Dry cleaning Cheese Axolotl Atlantic herring Malachite green Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Hydroponics Siphon Water purification Solar cell Carnivorous plant Menstrual cup Pachypodium Reef tank Sake American lobster Glucocorticoid Atlantic Ocean Lake Urinary incontinence Light-emitting diode Fish Insulin Soil life Bottlenose Dolphin Aerial (dance move) Myxobolus cerebralis Toilet paper Erosion Ecology Slow sand filter bed Sugar Alcoholic beverage Chlorophyta Poker jargon Tlingit Dune Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Anchor Novelty (locomotive) Cruising (maritime) Catfish Bladderwort

my water became dull what do i do i bought a new filter and now my water is dull i don't know what to do please help me if you replaced an old filter without preserving the old media then you've virtually destroyed your bacterial colonies you may be experiencing bacterial bloom as if in a new tank test for ammonia and nitrite if there are signs of either then the tank is going through a new cycle and you need to do water changes to keep the levels down and try to get your hands on filter media or gravel from a mature tank to put into your own filter to re introduce bacteria directly if you don't measure any toxins then your tank is probably going through a harmless type bacterial bloom and will clear up on its own you can do water changes to help speed it up  Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Eutrophication Bacteria Agar plate Tank Algal bloom Dialysis Water purification Tank classification Fish farming Shrimp farm Cyanide Honey Thermal power station Motorcycle Tooth enamel Ammonia Dairy Foodborne illness Brewery Ultraviolet Cirrhosis Fountain Pneumonia Diseases of the honeybee Botulism Water pollution Conjunctivitis Anthrax Ozone Carbon dioxide PID controller Sterilization (microbiology) Water Propaganda model Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cell (biology) Biogeochemical cycle Slow sand filter bed Common cold Refrigerator Sake E85 Biological warfare Hydrogen sulfide Sea-Monkey Mitsubishi Zero Phage Land mine T-34 Nitrogen Flagellum Gas mask Toxin Halitosis Aquarium Gastroparesis MS-09 Dom Acetic acid Ice core Sun Nutrition Chlorophyta Diatom Water supply Meningitis Hydrogen economy RuneScape cheats Rum Carbon dioxide sink Food preservation Neutrino Helicobacter pylori Menstrual cycle Circuit breaker Galileo spacecraft Cholera Hawker Hurricane Photosynthesis Maser Digital photography Biological pest control GunBound Directed-energy weapon Swimming pool Seabird Think tank Light pollution MS-06 Zaku II Specified complexity Life Technicolor Electrophysiology Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Humidifier Zerg Nitrogen cycle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2

can you help me save my goldfish anyone please i think the medication i'm using has burned his tail fins i noticed that my goldfish bubbles had a slight case of fin rot and that his eyes were slightly cloudy i went to the pet store and after confirming with the pet store guy that it was fin rot he advised me to use melafix and pimafix broad spectrum anti bacterial and antifungal i set up a quarantine tank for him and followed the directions religiously took carbon out of filter confirmed that medicines can be used simultaneoulsy dosed him at the same time every day now a week later his eyes are still not clear and his tail which was looking better a few days ago is now shredded and there's even a hole in it have i damaged him with this medication can anyone offer me any suggestions to help me save my friend hi gazza girl although you are doing good by setting up a hospital tank for bubbles i suggest you stop the over the counter medications if possible set up a 'tub to tub' quarantine system as described in the first link don't be too worried about the to gallon suggestion it can work just as well in x gallon tubs or tanks this method ensures you are constantly moving your fish away from any infection or pathogens by continually refreshing his environment i many of my far more experienced colleagues on our forum have done this it works if you check the second link about fin rot you will see a probable relationship between that cloudy eye so i would think they are linked in your case fix the fin rot the cloudy eye should disappear in addition to the tub to tub method i would also advise an exclusive course of quality medicated food such as medi gold for two weeks followed by a further weeks of jump start i'm sorry this method may seem rather technical but it's easy enough once you get into a routine please email me if you have any concerns  Goldfish Medicine Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Computer virus Brewery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Quarantine Stopping e-mail abuse Sake Breastfeeding H5N1 Decompression sickness Folic acid Chronic fatigue syndrome P-47 Thunderbolt Sin City Cannabis cultivation Insulin E-mail spam Fish farming Rabies Medical prescription Aquarium Hypoglycemia Common cold Dishwasher Shrimp farm Dead Like Me Intravenous therapy Guinea pig Asthma Hamster Urinary incontinence Gmail E85 Avian influenza Tank Water purification Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dairy Acne Bubble Bobble Psychosis Carbon dioxide Dialysis Gaia Online Homeopathy Ultraviolet Progress of the SARS outbreak Infantilism Vermicompost Dog Dog agility Medicare (Canada) Characters of Naruto Stereoscopy RuneScape cheats Prostate cancer Casting Wine making Bicycle lighting Foodborne illness Plame affair Medical analysis of circumcision Cancer Alexander Technique Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk Windows XP Autonomous building Biodiesel Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Top-bar hive Little Britain Hydrogen economy Parachuting Naval mine Team Fortress Classic Cetacea Clinical depression Potato Wine Tattoo Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Spam (electronic) Hydrogen peroxide Conjunctivitis

convict fry what can i do with my convict fry i have tanks i dont have any tanks where they would be safe this small i intend leaving them with the parents until they spawn again but soon ill b left with the choice to safe them or let them be eaten should i maybe take out the cave where the parents spawned in to stop or delay them spawning again the parents will probably spawn anytime after the fry are weeks old maybe slightly longer i read a site where it took month see link below moving the cave might buy you some time but they will probably just find somewhere else to spawn you might also stress them out if they are using this cave to hide the fry in convicts will spawn alot most likely every weeks unless you can fine a lfs that will take them off you its unlikely you will save every batch of fry you have you could buy a tank divide and separate them when they start to eat them but you will still have to find somewhere for them to go or else you will soon be over run with them i would leave them to get eaten and maybe save or and put them in a breeding net if the tank large enough that way you would have your own pair of convicts that you raised from birth good luck this link is to someones diary its about him raising his convict fry http www geocities com the dog geo convict aug html  Discus (fish) Salmon Philip J.

i am trying to prepare an aquarium but everything is going wrong my betta bow died today so i am now trying to prepare an aquarium for a new family member and try to avoid all the mistakes i made with bow i set up my gallon tank with tap water put a bowl buddy in it and let it sit for about hours i just tested the water and that's when i found out what kind of poison soup bow must've been swimming in hardness of the water was at ppm alkalinity at ppm ph was at and even though there's nothing living in there yet the nitrite is between and ppm what is going on how can i fix all that stuff i don't want to start dumping chemicals in there because that'll be hard on a fish plus be a real bear when i have to change water does anyone have any advice your tank is going through what's called a cycle process i'm assuming it has a filter on it if so you'll want it to complete this process here's a link that explains it click on how an aquarium cycles http freshaquarium about com od startupcycle step the cycle htm now you need to have an ammonia source in the tank i'd recommend doing a fishless cycle so you don't harm or kill the fish i would pick up a salad or cocktail shrimp frozen food section of the store put it in a pair of nylons pantyhose with the leg cut off knot it and toss it in the tank and let it rot that's your ammonia source with nitrites showing up in the tank it's about done cycling should take a few more weeks you want your ammonia and nitrite to be at ppm and some nitrates showing when those levels are reached remove the shrimp and do a water change to get the nitrates under ppm then add your fish soon after that then you'll need to do weekly water changes of about to keep the water quality good if there's no filter in the tank dump all the water out add new water and when you add the fish you'll need to do about a water change every days or so to keep the water quality good with no filter you do not want your tank to start cycling now your ph is a bit high what kind of substrate do you have in the tank any sea shells corals rocks those could be raising the ph if so remove them another test you can do get a glass of water from your tap test the ph leave it out and test it about hours later and see if changes if so then that's your problem and you'll probably be best off using bottled spring water for your water changes stay away from the chemicals like ph up ph down ph neutral etc they don't work unless you buffer your water and you really need to know what you're doing otherwise the ph will crash or rise dramatically thus stressing killing your fish you're smart trying to stay away from using chemicals as much as possible they're not good for the fish overall and usually all they do is mask problems not solve them  Sewage treatment Ammonia Eutrophication Hydrogen sulfide Cyanide Fishing Water Nitrogen Fish farming Sea-Monkey Thermal power station Extreme Programming Shrimp farm Hydrogen economy Carbon dioxide Fugu Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cocaine Reef tank Food preservation Antarctic krill Hydroponics Ammonium nitrate Biogeochemical cycle Kosher foods Coral reef Water purification Textile manufacturing Fossil fuel power plant Ecco the Dolphin Dairy Ultraviolet Brewery Hard water Oplan Bojinka Bong Cannabis cultivation Hydrogen peroxide Rebreather Discus (fish) Aerial (dance move) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Plastic RuneScape skills Diseases of the honeybee Illegal drug trade Refrigerator USS Yorktown (CV-5) Octopus Angling Biodiesel Tea Autonomous building Goby Tilapia Hamster Rum Shrimp Solar power Chlorine Clownfish E85 Microeconomics Moon Carnivorous plant Laserdisc B-47 Stratojet Cider Coffee Japanese tea ceremony Uranium Nitric acid Dry cleaning Software testing Krill Ozone depletion Web crawler RuneScape Random Events Fire fighting Polymerase chain reaction Common Unix Printing System Shark Nutrient Hash table Sun Windows XP Portland cement USS Vestal (AR-4) Origin of life Ozone Town gas Cantonese cuisine Glossary of climbing terms Climate change Silver

how can i defeat ich i have had numerous fish that have died from ich i mean don't get me wrong i take great care of my fish and several have grown to be over a foot long but ich is usually the way that these fish die i have ich medicine and stress coat that i use and it helps the symptoms but it doesn't ever go away i've only ever had one fish that's died of old age she was anyway can you reccomend any stronger medicines that i can have on hand i agree go with the heat salt method whenever possible the meds are very stressful for the fish like mentioned stress is the big factor in bringing ich on ich is always present in the tank but it's an opportunistic host so when the fish gets stressed it moves in best thing you can do is to prevent it be sure to do frequent water changes at least once a week about of the water needs to be changed be sure to vacuum the gravel substrate and decorations good as well ich hangs out in there don't overstock the tank overcrowding causes stress don't overfeed that will need to poor water quality when you add new water make sure it's close to the same temp as the tank water temperature fluctuations will stress the fish as well some fish are sensitive to salt and the ich meds loaches plecos some cat fish tetras any scaleless fish first you'll want to slowly raise the tank temperature to about f for salt dosage about tablespoon per us gallons but mix it first in a bucket of water to dissolve it and it slowly as well ich is only killed when it's in it's free swimming state so it's not technically killed when it's on the fish and falls off you also need to be sure to treat for at least weeks to effectively kill it that's usually where people go wrong they don't treat it long enough the increase in the temperature will increase the ich life cycle thus making them get to the free swimming state quicker stress coat doesn't do anything so save your money and do buy it anymore here's a couple of good links that explain ich and different ways to treat it http www peteducation com article cfm cls cat articleid http en wikipedia org wiki ichthyophthirius  Brewery Corrosion Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Psoriasis Aquarium Ich Shark Fish farming Sea-Monkey Bipolar disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common cold German grammar Ceramics Biodiesel Insulin Houseplant Glass Theory of conduct Dairy Nutrition Clinical depression Lake Abortion Water (molecule) Rebreather Anorexia nervosa Water purification Migraine Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy Fire fighting Urinary incontinence Atherosclerosis Decompression sickness Poker jargon Dead Sea Prostate cancer Marine aquarium Cancer Asthma Desert Heat Gross domestic product Dishwasher Microeconomics Chronic fatigue syndrome Thermal power station Tilapia Aluminium Tocopherol Bread Fancy rat Hypertension Global warming Water Drowning Capitalism Characters in the Smurfs Gypsy moth Extreme Programming Infantilism Axolotl Sento Siphon Tetrapod Carburetor Antidepressant Vitamin C Baldness Medicine Casting Pottery Hydrochloric acid Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hydroponics E85 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Password Osteoarthritis Suicide methods Sodium chloride Heartworm Sword making Cannabis (drug)

my minnow is twitching two years ago i won a gold fish bought more and frogs both frogs died then two of the fish we bought one new fishand found a mineow in the delaware river last summer we put him in with the goldefish and he was fine a few weeks ago of the remaining goldfish died we bought a new one and that one killed the other fish then that one died we bought a feeder goldfish and put it in the tank i just came back from a crusie and the feeder fish is fine water is too but the mineow is lying at the bottom and hidding behind plants and twitching what should i do hi sorry to hear about all your fish and frogs that died are you sure that the environment you're provided for them is adequate do you have at least a gallon tank with a filter rated for a gallon tank or better an air pump rated for a gallon tank or better a heater rated for a gallon tank or better and of course a tank lid light combination you need all those plus your gravel and airstones to provide an adequate home for your fishy friends and the most important part is that you have to take care of them all why well they're your pets and you have the responsibility for their continued health and existence you have to feed them you have to partially change the tank's water each week and make sure the new water is dechlorinated if you introduce any new fish they should be quarantined for three weeks in a separate tank before being introduced into your main tank the reason for this is that many fish especially the so called feeder fish aren't properly cared for so they'll contain diseases and parasites so if you put those fish immediately into your main tank you run the risk of having those sick fish infect all your healthy fish you don't want that now you said your one goldfish killed another that's kind of odd why do i say that well goldfish aren't the kind of fish that go around killing each other but if the new one was sick or infected with a parasite well their parasite or disease could have killed off the new one and your minnow the one you got from the delaware river first you should never ever take any fish or plant from the natural ecosystem and put it into your aquarium the main reason again it is probably infected with some weird disease or crazy strange parasite why bring that into your house and main tank also in most states it's illegal to take a fish or plant from it's native habitat to place elsewhere you're fooling with mother nature here and you could inadvertantly be introducing a virus or disease or parasite to another area of the country we have that same problem when people want to dispose of their old fish they don't want to euthanize them so they dump them in a native stream and let them swim away that's the most terrible thing you can do especially to a minnow that grew up in one area and you want to let go in another area why again introduction of diseases and parasites that the native fishies have never been exposed to can kill them by the millions also by introducing a new fish into the environment can wreak havock with the native fish stock remember reading about the snakehead fish a few years ago or what about the asian carp now the asian carp are a nasty fish these lb fish get spooked when your boat goes by and can jump straight up out of the water a lot of people have been injured by them hitting them in their faces as their boat goes by these asian carp have been eating everything that our native fish stock eat and they've caused our native fishes to have problems they're a good example of a good fish gone bad if you want to see them in action and see the strangest videos ever go to youtube com and do a search on asian carp you'll be amazed and horrified by what you see now you're minnow on the bottom twitching it's probably got some sort of parasite and it's probably all through your tank you really should have the fish all your fish euthanized then clean your tank thoroughly go to a good aquarium site online and they'll give you instructions just don't use any household chemicals use what's specified for euthanizing fish get some oil of cloves you can buy some at your local health store they usually carry it once you get it put your fish in a bowl of water put about drops of the oil of clove in a small jar of water close the jar and shake then pour the contents of the jar oil and water into the bowl with the fish you are euthanizing stir the water quickly and the fish should slowly go asleep leave the fish in there for about minutes then check it watch it's gills for about minutes if they don't move the fish had died in its sleep if the gills are still moving let the fish stay in the water for another minutes then check again if it's still breathing you may need to add a bit more oil of clove to the water do as before add it to the small jar of water first close the lid shake then pour the shaken contents into the big bowl this does work good luck ken  Marine aquarium

whats wrong with my goldfish just recently my all gold goldfish has developed a reddish pink colour on its back next to its fin is there something wong with it ok yup i had suffered from the same problem but it had happend to my tropical fish and my frieds goldfish it usually happens when you have added to many fish at once to your fish tank or when the bad bacteria levels are too high this sometimes happens if you put too much food in the tank and alot is left over also the reason for the reddish pink is because of the bacteria to resolve this problem you have to change about of the water and if you have a filter do not clean it when you are changing of the water because all of the good bacteria will be gone if this problem continues try a few more times to change most of the water but if it does not help go to your pet dealer and ask for advice hope this helps  Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Acne Koi Fish farming Shrimp farm Water purification Kissing gourami Whaling Dairy Discus (fish) Water Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Foodborne illness Gar Crohn's disease Cyanide Color Omega-3 fatty acid Tooth enamel El-Fish Zebra Danio Poker jargon Fish Sea-Monkey Clownfish Sake Murray Cod Tooth Ecco the Dolphin Halitosis Final Fantasy XI Carnivorous plant Swimming pool Ecology Gram staining Tilapia Clown loach Seabird Red Craps Whale Samuel Goldwyn Bacteria Hydrogen sulfide Biology Thermal power station Kosher foods Great Salt Lake Snooker Chronic fatigue syndrome American Dad!

i'm a new betta owner and i don't think i'm doing too well please help i got a betta two days ago the first day i put him in a vase the next day i found out that the vase was less than one gallon and that i needed to feed him not just put a pellet in and let it sit the water was gross from the pellet so i changed his water today i got him a gallon tank i put the filter it came with in but it was visibly moving the water and he kept getting stuck behind it and i think it made him stuggle to swim the water is conditioned but i haven't tested the levels yet there are three small plants in the bottom but the walls are covered in bubbles is this normal whenever i put the water in the tank it did this and where i have scraped off the bubbles they are gone but everywhere else they're still there now he's floating not upside down head up but he won't move unless i disturb him i think he might be sick or really stressed his eyes don't look quite as clear and his fins aren't quite as full any suggestions or comments he's not moving his tiny fins right by his face hardly is that bad too this morning he looked happy he ate pellets in less than a minute i just put a pellet in and he ignored it he has no reaction time like i got him two days ago and usually wouldn't let me near him but i brushed him with my hand removing the pellet then he pointed downward and just drifted down until i disturbed him and then he quickly swam to the top i don't think he's going to make it he is acting really wierd and is not swimming at all i did take the filter out though i turned off his overhead light maybe he was getting too hot i just hate the way he keeps swimming up and then drifting down he looks pale and his fins keep looking worse well i don't know what others might tell you but i had a gallon tank with a very flowing filter and a light and a very agressive beta and he loved the tank to the point that when i moved him to a slightly smaller unlit and bubbleless tank to make room for baby mollies he litterally starved himself to death beta seem pale when not doing good and they often just sit still i fed mine regualr tetratropical fish flakes and he loved them and when i was trying other foods like pellets and tetrabetta i noted that his color was duller than on the tropic food rip socortease  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Brewery Bong E85 Thermal power station Carbon dioxide Marine aquarium Goldfish 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Professional wrestling throws Fish farming Swimming pool Domestic rabbit Fusion power Shaggy dog story Aquarium Discus (fish) Dwarf gourami Ecco the Dolphin Pikmin Dog Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Iron Dairy Autonomous building Fire fighting Shark Seabird Glacier Sewage treatment Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Axolotl Bottlenose Dolphin Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Antarctic krill Bubble Bobble Traffic light GunBound Diving suit Fossil fuel power plant Bladderwort SS Andrea Doria Frogman Fin Whale P-47 Thunderbolt Carnivorous plant Electrophysiology Cliff Richard Stingray Combine (Half-Life 2) MS-06 Zaku II RuneScape quests Sento Sin City Motor oil Apollo 8 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Backstroke Internal ballistics Shotgun Naval mine Breaststroke Krill Textile manufacturing Whale Orca Guinea pig Paul Is Dead Little Britain Sonoluminescence Suplex Extraterrestrial skies Poker jargon Drowning USS Yorktown (CV-5) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Elephant Pebble bed reactor Lake Conker's Bad Fur Day Aerial (dance move) Tilapia The Legend of Zelda series enemies Rum USS Tunny (SS-282) Hamster Pac-Man The Legend of Zelda series races Solar power

why does my betta flare at me when i look at him when i go near my betta's tank he flares at me not just with his fins but he also puffs up behind his gills which looks really scary does this mean he doesn't like me i'd love him to be tame and let me hand feed him even pat him as i've heard some betta's do that is perfectly normal depending on how long you've had him he may stop eventually right now he sees you as a threat to his territory if you take some frozen bloodworms and let them sit on your fingers he will probably swim up to you and eat the bloodworms off of your hand it is not good to pet fish even if you are careful you risk removing their slime coats and leaving them susceptible to infections nosoop u for more info on bettas and fish in general check out the site in my profile edit bettas don't learn peoples' faces they learn that people mean they get fed by putting your face right up to his tank you will likely scare him because you are so much larger than him thus you appear threatening also don't make loud noises around the tank that will confuse him and he may learn to associate humans with loud noises closing a door is fine just don't slam it things like that edit bettas don't care what color you are wearing just like it has been proven that bulls don't get angry when they see red they are actually colorblind they just don't like the waving motion  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cat Dwarf gourami Prank flash Shark Shaggy dog story Blood (computer game) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hearing impairment Salad Fingers Chicken Combine (Half-Life 2) Prostate cancer Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) YuYu Hakusho Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dog training Domestic rabbit Tag The Time Machine Discus (fish) Customs and etiquette of Japan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Covenant Kim Possible Trademark Stereoscopy Friends Creatures in Bionicle Swimming Characters in the Smurfs Grandview, U.S.A.

help my fish has swim bladder disease please help i have a fish and it was swimming on its side and floating to the top helplessly and then repeating this process i am so scared turns out he has swim bladder disease i learned what i should do right now i'm cleaning out the tank and i have my fish in a separate tank i don't have water de chlorination tablets or anything like that but i learned that if you leave it out for a while it naturally de chlorinates how long do i leave it out please help my fish he's not dead he's still breathing hi check the link below it gives you some pointers about possible causes of swimming awkwardly may not be swim bladder constipation also causes loss of equilibrium as someone else suggested peas are a good remedy for constipation but ensure they are cooked shelled only small pieces fed at a time as they have a mild laxative effect letting the water stand or 'ageing' does indeed remove chlorine from tap faucet water when left overnight however several things should be borne in mind when doing this because ageing water does not remove chloramine which is another additive some water companies add so you will need to add dechlorinator anyway then so you may as well not bother ageing it look on the website of your local water company it will say what they add to your water if you do age your water instead of dechlorinating it you must ensure it has an airstone running in the bucket or is turned over every few hours otherwise it will go stale finally remember to only add water to your tank once it is the same temperature good luck  Sewage treatment Chlorination Sea-Monkey Swimming pool Water purification Menstrual cup Myxobolus cerebralis Polychlorinated biphenyl Brewery Chlorine Asthma Swimming Cantonese cuisine Drowning Diving Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fishing Rebreather Dry cleaning Transformer Sodium hypochlorite Sento Shark Dairy Carburetor Marine aquarium Fecal incontinence Axolotl Diving suit Seine (fishing) Cruising (maritime) Tlingit Fish farming Sauna Bladderwort Prostate cancer Siphon Thermal power station Disinfection Sterilization (microbiology) Dishwasher Hydrochloric acid Mercury (element) Coffee Ozone hole The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Haloalkane Fire fighting Ammonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma History of swimming Hyperthermia Laxative Gas bladder Lung Hash table Dietary fiber Kosher foods Coral reef Customs and etiquette of Japan Butterfly stroke Gar Fugu Diseases of the honeybee Stomach cancer Textile manufacturing Acetic acid Dead Sea Tap (valve) Water SS Andrea Doria Scuba set Bathing Foodborne illness Carbon dioxide E85 Ecco the Dolphin Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mosquito CPU cache Poker jargon Energy development Gelatin Theory of conduct Hamster Bread First aid Three Mile Island USS Tunny (SS-282) Compiler optimization Cystoscopy Final Fantasy Legend III Triathlon Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bleach Chocolate

starting a salt water aquarium hey i'm an aquarium hobbiest but so far i've stuck to fresh water i'm thinking about moving on to saltwater don't worry i plan on doing tons of research but does anyone have any suggestions any thumb rules i should know about or does anyone have a quick check list of things i need from the start and or how much they cost i know it's expensive so be honest basically anything you can tell me that you think is important will be helpful i think one of the most important things is to get the largest tank you can afford freshwater fish can handle much wider fluctuations in water chemistry because they are used to a much smaller volume of water overall than the ocean most of the problems that saltwater aquarists have is by having some parameter of water chemistry out of whack in nature the ocean fluctuates very little so the fish are not more delicate they are used to much narrower parameters this is why you should get a larger tank the larger the volume of water the more slowly things like ph and temperature shift look at your local water company's water report one thing of importance to note is the phosphate levels in the water and the hardness of the water if the water has high phosphates you are going to have problems with algae and mostly the kinds of algae that saltwater fish don't really eat consider ro di water don't decorate your tank until after it cycles cycle it with damsels then take the damsels back to the store damsels are hard to catch especially if you got the big tank suggested in some shops will give you partial credit on the damsels you return damsels do not play well with other fish such as tangs they are aggressive eaters and will harry a fish to death without ever touching him if the primary cause of saltwater losses is water chemistry the next cause is fish incompatibility learn to distinguish the difference between fact and opinion there's a lot of information out there and you have to be discerning are there tanks that have damsels and tangs together sure but they're either large enough to accommodate or someone's buying tangs every months find what works for you and know why it works and run with it pick the one fish you really really really want and build your tank around it even though you may add that particular fish last have the end goal of your tank in mind as stated freshwater fish are a lot cheaper plan your tank with a final community in mind and don't buy fish on a whim be religious with your water changes see tip you can cheat a little with freshwater because of the aforementioned tolerances but do what you have to do to make those water changes a have of your tanks volume in saltwater made up and ready to go for emergency changes feel free to pm with more questions  Aquarium Fish farming Shrimp farm Reef tank Hydrogen economy Water (molecule) Fish Ecology Cruising (maritime) Dead Sea Twelve leverage points Discus (fish) Sea-Monkey Lake Gar Hard disk Shark Solar power Floppy disk Fly fishing Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Carbon dioxide Fishing Halfbeak Crayfish Tilapia Poker jargon 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Microeconomics Tlingit Milton H.

how many snails should i get for my gallon reef tank my somewhat new reef tank about months is starting to get a slight cyanobacteria outbreak while ammonia nitrites are at and nitrates close to i think this problem was due to using tap water in the initial setup and old pc bulbs i've replaced the bulbs and have done a number of water changes and the red slime algae seems to be lessening i would like to get some snails to finish it off and to take care of some of the other algae in the tank i'm probably going to stay away from any hermits as i would like to build this into a reef tank and people have noted their hermit crabs messing with some of their corals so for now i want to go with astaea turbos but i don't know how many i should get for a gallon i've had snails in the past with no problems with them over reproducing i've noticed a lot of the janitor packages included a sea star or two would you recommend these i've had a lot of problems in the past with algae in the sand do the hermits do a good job of sifting i have a gal reef tank full of corals sps lps fofties crocea clams this tank has been running for well over a year now and i have about assorted snails and about the same amount of hermit crabs i could use more of each blue leg hermits and scarlet reef hermits will not harm your corals as far as i'm concerned they are a must addition for any good reef cleaner crew the scarlet reef hermit crab is best kept in a reef style aquarium where it will have ample supplies of algae to eat it is helpful in keeping algae under control including filamentous algae and cyanobacteria the dwarf blue leg hermit crab is a valuable addition to an aquarium because it will eat algae including green hair algae and cyanobacteria in addition it provides valuable aeration by sifting through the sand it is one of the hermit crabs that is reef safe http www liveaquaria com product scateg cfm pcatid cerith snail one of the most ideal scavengers detritus eaters and algae eaters these snails are perfect for the reef aquarium quickly devouring detritus uneaten food decaying organics fish waste and several types of nuisance algae cerith snails will often bury themselves in the sand which will help maintain adequate oxygen levels in the substrate the astraea conehead snail will do well in an aquarium if provided with ample hiding places and sufficient room to roam an aquarium with live rock is preferable so that it can graze on the algae it will also graze on algae on the side of the tank in addition it eats cyanobacteria and diatoms if it falls it is often unable to right itself and will need the aquarist to place it upright again the nassarius snail is a small scavenger with an oval spiral shell that resembles an olive pit with a long tube like siphon that protrudes from the end of the shell one of the most ideal scavengers and detritus eaters these snails are perfect for the reef aquarium quickly consuming detritus uneaten food decaying organics and fish waste nassarius snails like to bury themselves in the sand which will help maintain adequate oxygen levels in the substrate trochus snail it does well in an aquarium when provided with ample hiding places and room to forage live rock provides algae cyanobacteria and diatoms for food but it also is an effective film algae eater grazing on other surfaces such as the sides of the tank http www liveaquaria com product scateg cfm pcatid i would put a good mix of all of these your tank will not look like it is infested as these animals have very good camoflage some you will see at night and others during the day some you will probably never see because they spend most of there time under the sand bed or in the rockwork http saltaquarium about com cs aboutjanitors a aa n htm ps dawn m you have absolutly no idea what you are talking about saltwater snails very rarely reproduce in an aquarium a algae eater or ghost shrimp would probably last about min in his tank if you don t want to read the question don't answer it pss a small sandsifting sea star would be good but is not needed some of the snails i've mentioned do a great job of sifting through the sand and the

what other kinds of fish can live in a betta tank i have a small betta fishtank and my betta brucey recently died i don't think i'm ready for another betta due to the fact that they look identical other than colouring but i do want another fish just a totally different one i have a tank light and brucey was quite happy and alive until my dad let my cat into my room unsupervised and she killed him my cat is never allowed in my room without me in here i always shut my door when i leave but my dad can be a moron sometimes as i've realized so i'm going to be extra careful this time around so what other kinds of fish could live in my betta fish tank if any it's a one gallon fish tank bowls tend to be inadequate for fish keeping they are small require very frequent water changes and generally do not support steady water parameters would you enjoy living in a small room or even a closet even a smaller size aquarium such as or gallon makes a world of difference and are fairly inexpensive along with a small inexpensive but efficient filter your fish will thrive and love you for it the bigger the aquarium the more stable water parameters will be such as temperature ph etc and easier to maintain an investment in a small aquarium and filter goes a long way be kind to your fish and consider it bettas do not enjoy living in small bowls as it is commonly believed the most often misquoted fact is that in the wild and their natural habitat they live in small puddles of water the fact is they are largely found in asian rice paddies which are certainly shallow bodies of water but are by no means puddles rice paddies are huge areas of water so wild bettas actually live in thousands of gallons in the wild they are able to survive in small puddles of water but this only happens during drought which is not a natural condition and there is a difference between thriving and merely surviving so please free your betta from that tiny bowl and get him a decent aquarium you will come to find that they will be a different kind of fish altogether and will love you for it  Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Reef tank Fish farming Brewery Goldfish Phase (matter) Autonomous building Shrimp farm Clownfish Welding Carburetor Fishing Rice Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Domestic rabbit Fish Leopard Cat Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Coffee Thermal power station Coral reef Energy development Cannabis cultivation Yacht Carnivorous plant Floppy disk Gar Southeast Asia Orca Shark Hydrogen economy Solar power Ozone depletion Flush toilet Toyota Prius Swimming pool Internal ballistics E85 Tetrapod Sento Microeconomics Gas metal arc welding Water Ozone hole Bottlenose Dolphin Nuclear reactor Mosquito New York Giants Chopsticks Fugu Loudspeaker Tank classification Normal distribution SS Andrea Doria Fire fighting Danio Drowning Sea-Monkey Bonsai Species Japanese toilet Puddle jumper (Stargate) Physical paradox Renewable energy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Environmental concerns with electricity generation Polarization Angling Ecology Hard disk Steel Biodiesel Strap-on dildo Technicolor Global warming and agriculture Glass Diesel engine Poker jargon Lake Stone Age Stereoscopy Redundant array of independent disks Bong Jet engine Seabird Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Kitchen Synthesizer

easy freshwater fish i have an eclispe gallon tank what would be an easy species to maintain that won't grow too big i had a goldfish and ended up giving it to a friend with a pond it really got big and is doing very well if you go to a specialty shop you will have more options to answer the question though we really need to know the ph and hardness of the water in your tank that is a key determinant in deciding what fish are best suited to yuor aquariums conditions and all of that said if by easy you mean i don t want to take care of these fish nothing will do well but as long as you keep up with partial water changes regularly once a month is typical and don't overfeed you should do well with the following suggestions assuming that you are about neutral or slightly acidic in ph and your water is only slightly hard here are my suggestions for the bottom how about a rubber lipped pleco do not get a common pleco they get huge but the rubber lip varieites tend to be smaller and will help out with any algae that builds up and it will you might also try some amano shrimp they are cool little critters that also eat algae midwater how about some harlequin rasboras and leopard danios the latter are not as common as the typical zebra danios but in my opinion are prettier fish female bettas might also work well my favorite small tank fish has to be the rummy nosed tetra i have some in one of my tanks that have been there for almost five years cardinal tetras are pretty fish but can be a little delicate if the conditions aren't right they like the ph a little on the low side but provide the right conditions and they will thrive for the top water how about hatchet fish also white cloud mountain minnows are almost indestructable and will even over winter in outdoor ponds in some parts of the country if your water is hard with a higher ph then go with livebearers like platties swordtails or guppies although personally i think guppies should be in a tank by themselves there are a thousand choices really those are just a few suggestions any reliable local fish store not a chain should be able to recommend easy fish appropriate for your tank best advice i can give is find a good fish store bring a water sample with you for them to test for ph and hardness and let them help you pick out the right fish for your conditions note that i said a good fish store some are not so good with sick fish and lousy advice  Aquarium Marine aquarium Discus (fish) Zebra Danio Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shrimp farm Tilapia Goldfish Live-bearing aquarium fish Fish farming Fish Water (molecule) Gar White Cloud Mountain Minnow Sea-Monkey Lake E85 Koi Neon tetra Autonomous building Biodiesel Algae Reef tank Cardinal tetra Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Ecology Halfbeak Guppy Thermal power station Clownfish Coral reef Tank Hydrogen economy Illegal drug trade Carbon dioxide Coffee Dead Sea Mattress Sailfin Molly Crayfish Species Fugu Anchor Fishing Diatom Carp Houseplant RuneScape quests Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Tofu Ozone depletion Veganism Kissing gourami Sewage treatment Solar power Cruising (maritime) Leopard Theory of conduct Shawangunk Ridge Floppy disk Nile crocodile Violin Animals in space Gramophone record Drill bit Stomach cancer Expert system Goby Thermoregulation Dog Poker jargon Bladderwort Yacht Ozone hole Strap-on dildo Fossil fuel power plant Omega-3 fatty acid Diving suit Fish and chips Aquaculture Saxophone Skateboarding trick Toyota Prius Bong Cyanide Knife Paragliding Cloud Shark Hash table

salt water fish i have always been interested in salt water fish and the tanks are so colorful and great i have a couple questions for people who have saltwater tanks is it hard to have how much does it cost how much work do you have to do what is the smallest size tank for a nemo fish to live in and if you have more info on them please tell me thanks there are many different types of setups for saltwater fish it all depends on what you plan to keep in the tank the cheapest setup will only allow you to keep fish no inverts or corals the larger the tank the less work it is you can house a nemo fish in a gallon tank but with not many other fish in there btw nemo is a oscellaris clownfish or a percula clownfish the onjly difference is the oscellaris is wildly caught in the ocean where the percula is bred in captivity you will need cleaning supplies live rock and live sand for substrate you will need a hydrometer to measure saltcontent of the water as well as marine salt to add to the water you will need a test kit to measure ph nitrite nitrate and amonia you will also need an aquarium light if you plan to keep corals you will need to upgrade your lighting but as a beginner to keeping a marine tank i will only talk about a fish only tank for it is the easiest setup and the cheapest you will also need a filter thats rated for your size tank freshwater filters are the same as saltwater then youll need a heater to maintain the warm temperatures clownfish need a protien skimmer is another filtration device that i strongly reccomend but i know of people who dont use themk and they have had great success for years with out one so just due to supplies the price is pretty hefty for maintenence you will have to do weekly water changes and daily feedings if you enjoy keeping it than it isnt hard its actually quite relaxing and addictive id be happy to answer any other questions if you care to email me hope this helps and good luck  Clownfish Fish farming Sewage treatment Percula Clownfish Fish Shrimp farm Coral reef Finding Nemo Hydrogen economy Brewery Solar power E85 Biodiesel Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Autonomous building Fly fishing Strap-on dildo Sea-Monkey Thermal power station Hard water Tank Cyanide Eutrophication Seabird Tilapia Nuclear power PID controller Carburetor Swimming pool Fauna of Australia Goldfish Microeconomics Goby Marine biology Transformer Fishing Dishwasher Krill Hard disk Coral Water purification Fire extinguisher Dry cleaning Hamster Cruising (maritime) Fish migration Carnivorous plant Antarctic krill Monterey Bay Aquarium Koi Japanese toilet Angling Dead Sea Shark M60 machine gun Lake Opportunity rover Coast Gasoline Sea anemone Hubble Space Telescope Digital photography Radio controlled airplane Welding Dairy Fugu Loudspeaker Ice core MS-06 Zaku II Illegal drug trade Anchor Biodiversity Saltwater intrusion Water Uranium Japanese tea ceremony Gas metal arc welding Hydroponics Rebreather Crocodile Bong Water supply Diode Paragliding 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Economic history of Canada Solar cell Siphon F-16 Fighting Falcon United States Marine Corps Light-emitting diode

help last week i bought goldfish for my kids i got a gal tank rocks filter plastic plants about days ago we noticed that one of the fish started laying on it's side but it was still able to swim during feeding time now it is haveing a hard time swimming properly and the other fish is getting little black spots on it's face i called the pet store were we pershed the fish and tank and they told me it was because it was a new tank and it did not have the bacteria nessery for healthy fish are our new little pet doomed if that is what they told you they are a poor excuse for a pet store no your new pets are not doomed bacteria is not what keeps fish healthy water changes are what keep fish healthy the bacteria helps to keep the water quality better for the fish and actually lives by eating the ammonia produced by the fish waste and uneaten food that decays in the tank the bacteria produce nitrites and nitrates which are also toxic to your fish weekly fresh water changes to remove the ammonia nitrite and nitrate build up are what is needed with goldfish they are dirty little guys but can be great teaching tools for young children do not feed the fish more than once a day and only as much as they can eat in about minutes if they do not eat it all in minutes you have given them too much you should immediately do a water change be sure to dechlorinate the fresh water some goldfish are prone to swim bladder infections and other problems that cause them to either float to the surface or sink to the bottom they are usually not fatal many can live a full life with this problem as far as the black spots this could be the fish's coloration that is starting to develop don't let any moron tell you it is ich  Sewage treatment Goldfish Marine aquarium Aquarium Sea-Monkey Fish farming Biogeochemical cycle Dairy Hydrogen sulfide Water Fancy rat Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Koi Water purification Carnivorous plant Tooth Tooth enamel Foodborne illness Nitrogen Great Lakes Ecology Escherichia coli O157:H7 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Swimming pool Iron Bladderwort Potassium Ammonia Sodium nitrite Carbon dioxide Urinary incontinence Fishing Biodiesel Nutrition Cyanide Axolotl Tlingit Refrigerator Factory farming Autonomous building Urine Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Livestock Salmon Dry cleaning Albatross Bong Japanese tea ceremony Hydrogen economy Diseases of the honeybee Nutrient Brewery Vitamin C Curing Chlorine Rebreather Fire fighting Cheese Veganism Plankton Silver Laserdisc Compost Food preservation Environmental concerns with electricity generation Soil pH Diving Drill bit Scuba set Vitamin Aluminium Milk Seine (fishing) Dialysis Fossil fuel power plant Chronic fatigue syndrome Clownfish Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Creatures in Bionicle Osmoregulation Cetacea Krill Copper American Dad!

where can i find a page about betta splendens siamese fighting fish where i can learn how to tell the gender i first got a male betta no doubt about that then i got two females or at least what i think are females that's the problem one of the females could possibly be a male with short fins i think all was fine at first and then the male started looking run down i thought he'd had to much problems with the women and he did look better after a couple of days i've been busy and i haven't had time to look after them properly for a couple of days and the other day i found him really beat up i moved him to a bowl of his own and he seemed to get better then he died sigh i think one of the females is the cause of it all and now i'm not so sure that it is a female she's dominant aggressive and she has larger fins than the other female she also has much more color i've read a bout the betta males with short fins didn't know they existed before and now i'm wondering if the woman that sold me the females could have messed it all up i'll add more soon running out of space i've done a google search and found pics that illustrates what i'm talking about this is what the female looks like http www anselm edu homepage llaplante home images betta g jpg and this is more of what the one i'm wondering looks like http www siamsbestbettas com images betta jpg i know they are breeding females with more male qualities and colors but i don't think they'd sell them like just any other female it's sunday and i'm stuck waiting for monday so i figured i'd try to find out as much as possible by myself before i bring it up with the woman that sold them to me i've already been to the wiki and it gave me no information about the issue that i asked about some males does not have large fins and some females dose look like short finned males i need to know how to tell them apart i guess i could make this clearer this is what the female looks like http www anselm edu homepage llaplante home images betta g jpg no doubt that she's a female this is what the female that i'm wondering about looks like http www siamsbestbettas com images betta jpg this one was sold to us as a female and we never doubted it she's more colorful and has larger fins than the other female but we also know that they can become very colorful and she's the dominant one after reading about males with short fins i'm not so sure that she is really a she and i want to find a way to make sure the pics are from the internet and it's not really my betta's they only look the same and i use the pics to illustrate what i mean wooha i found the answer to my own question thanks to vicky w that gave me the name for short tails plakat i kept searching and this is what i found if anyone is interested that is females will also have an egg spot aka the ovipositor tube the egg spot is a good way to identify a female and tell her apart from a young male the egg spot is a white dot located near the base of the ventrals it is from this egg spot that eggs will be released by the female during spawning my suspect does not have an egg spot so she is a he no doubt i understand that it was an easy mistake for the woman that sold them to me to make but i still have to have a talk to her about her saying that we could keep them together females for male she said since the male will hunt only female to death nothing about not keeping them together all the time grrr thank you all for the help that second picture does look like a plakat short finned male some of the time when breeding halfmoon bettas or any other kind i suppose they may have a grandparent or even a great grandparent that was plakat so sometimes when they have babies you might get one or two that look just like all the females but are actually short finned males sometimes they are accidentally sold as females my point is yes i think your female was probably a plakat male but i do not think that whoever you got the fish from did it on purpose i would definitely talk to her but keep in mind that it was probably unintentional very sorry about your loss though best of luck in the future  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) World Wide Web Social rule Uniform Resource Locator Spider Theory of conduct Ontological argument Domain Name System EastEnders PNG CPU cache Opportunity rover Roswell UFO incident Whose Line Is It Anyway?

questions about my leapard ctenopomas how do you like them if u have them are they intersting to watch in atank i have only read about them how much should i feed my pair they are only babys about inches im gonna go with brine shrimp to start okay acually will they disturb my pair of butterfly fish ans will my neopns be eatin i bought a pair tagged as spotted climbing perch and found they were a pair of leopard ctenopoma they weren't very interesting as they would tend to hide in the bunches of aponogetons and 'lay in wait' which i found out was part of their hunting behaviour in the wild they are 'semi aggressive' and were aggressive toward some of my upside down catfish so i eventually had to sell them as for feeding you can try a trick i use for my tetras and their various foods i feed them freeze dried bloodworms twice a week so i mix a small amount in a cup half filled with tank water and allow it to sit for a few moments then dump it all in freeze dried foods tend to float but this way most of it will at least stay suspended in mid water range for enough time that the pair geta few mouthfuls and follow it to the surface these fish are carnivores so you should stick with carnivorous pellets krill bloodworms and other food marketed for carnivorous fish only a pinch every day will do until they reach adult size at about inches your tetras will clean up after the pair as tetras are omnivorous but this might also trigger aggressive behaviour as long as the neons don't fit in the leopard ctenopoma's mouths they won't be eaten but they may be harassed you should have a densely planted tank or at least half of the tank planted very well which will curb some of the aggressiveness until the leopard ctenopoma's get bigger than the neons at which time you might have to move one or the other into another tank as for butterflyfish i assume you mean the african butterflyfish they are also semi aggressive so i wouldn't recommend putting the two species together when the leopard ctenopoma get bigger and a little more belligerent everything should be treated on a case by case basis because there are exceptions to any rule you may end up with a harmonious tank but leopard's and butterfly's also have two different tank requirements leopard's like dense vegetation and butterfly's perfer open water like tetra's  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Krill Axolotl Discus (fish) Leopard Spider Shrimp farm Antarctic krill Tilapia Clownfish Cat Carnivore Tooth Fishing Tofu Seabird Poker jargon Fauna of Australia Cheetah Dog Bladderwort Salmon Fancy rat Insect Brown Bear Carnivorous plant Domestic rabbit Albatross Goldfish Frog Halfbeak Butterflyfish Kosher foods Danio Guinea pig Platypus Minor Harry Potter Beasts Gar American lobster Ecology Zebra Danio Moorish Idol Vegetarianism Coconut crab Nerpa Carburetor Blue Whale Tasmanian Devil Water (molecule) Internal ballistics Sewage treatment Beetle Autonomous building Livestock Thermal power station Neon tetra Mountain Gorilla Gray Wolf Tyrannosaurus rex Puma Elephant Vermicompost Trophic level Knife Yosemite National Park Veganism Clouded Leopard Life in the Freezer Nile crocodile The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Textile manufacturing Chicken Breastfeeding Lion Goby Tarantula American Black Bear Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Carbon dioxide Banana Caterpillar Dolphin Murray Cod Hard disk Domesticated turkey Noah's Ark Death Valley National Park Chinook salmon

livebearer fry tropical fish i have platy fry and guppy fry in my breeding box and i am just wondering if this will have any affect on the growth of the fry the tank is set up at degrees celcius and the fry do have plenty of space i have also noticed that the same platy looks pregnant again is this possible thanks danny could you tel me if this will have any difference on the growth of the fry and how long until they get mature enough so i can release them into the main tank personally i don't use these breeders instead i have a well planted tank where the fry can hide and usually of them always survive because they hide from the other fish i tried both methods and noticed that fry who grow up in the main tank grow much faster then the ones in a breeder if you have them in a breeder it takes usually about for guppies to be big enough and weeks for platy to be big enough to release the main rule on that is they need to be bigger then the biggest mouth of your fish in the tank not to be eaten hope that helps good luck eb  Live-bearing aquarium fish Discus (fish) Goldfish Fish farming Sailfin Molly Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tilapia Norman Borlaug Hamster Cuisine of Denmark Gray Wolf Hemp Fugu Southern platyfish Clownfish Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Cuisine of Malaysia Philip J.

my fish are sick everytime i give em stupid tetra daphnia jelly some sort of disease breaks out they are tropical this time i am using api pimafix to treat cottony fungus but i have spotted white spot and fin rot too so would like to also use api melafix one fishie has only one little arm fin left and another fishie is on its side with fungus can i use both together first you need to identify all the problems and put them in order of importance to treat fungus comes last since it's rarely deadly quickly white spot or ich is a very fast killing parasite while fin rot is a slower killer really between the two considering you have three problems and in three different classifications you will need to be quite careful how you treat first melafix and pimafix are out both are very mild medications that will not get the job done quickly enough in this case your fish are far too weakened by everything going on to rely in these chemicals i would suggest you start with jungle labs fungus eliminator or fungus clear both contain medications that will clear up a fungus or in the case it's a bacterial infection instead of fungus they will treat that as well if that's not available you can use maroxy you can combine this with maracide for the ich white spot and maracyn tc for the fin rot it's a lot of medications but you have a lot of problems going on all at the same time i would also suggest you start off all of this with a large water change at least and an additional water change every day replacing the removed medication only replace the medication for the amount of water you remove not the entire tank again please feel free to email me if i can help further mm  Pneumonia Malaria Diseases of the honeybee Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Honey fungus Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Spanish flu Diarrhea Sexually-transmitted infection Theory of conduct Gypsy moth Carnivorous plant Foodborne illness Fungus Lyme disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cantonese cuisine Malachite green Sewage treatment Fancy rat Anti-aircraft warfare First aid Shrimp farm Water purification Asthma Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Ebola Cancer Anthrax Wood Conjunctivitis Drowning AIDS Tsetse fly Pharmaceutical company Biological pest control Acne Stomach cancer Biological warfare Hemp Sterilization (microbiology) Rabies DDT Ich Sleeping sickness Nail disease Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hip fracture Hypoglycemia MS-06 Zaku II Crohn's disease Medical analysis of circumcision Decompression sickness Wheat Disease Mushroom Dandruff Multiple sclerosis Candidiasis Agar plate Discus (fish) Psoriasis Progress of the SARS outbreak Smallpox Athlete's foot Orca Shark Lung cancer Fugu Meningitis Infectious disease Guinea pig Cyanide Mach kernel Neopets Antibiotic Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cirrhosis Fire fighting Diabetes mellitus Food preservation Compiler optimization RISC Oak Pesticide Paget's disease of bone Gmail Myxobolus cerebralis Fish farming

a question on zebra dianos i have zebra dianos and got them because they were only cents at the store i got fish books and looked up some information but it really didn't say anything one of them is very skinny but he or she eats the other one was bigger in the belly area when i first got them now it gets bigger and bigger the other one eats i have seen it but she he is always following the other one around i did get a little info from the books they said that males are skinny and females are more rounded is this a way of them mating or is something wrong with my fish when i thought that my white molly was pregnant i added marbles in the spot where she always was it just so happens that my zebra dianos hang out in the same area so if they lay eggs in the marbles will some servive that sounds very much like you have a male the skinny one and a female the bigger one and that he is interested in mating all danios are called egg scattering fish they scatter the eggs over the gravel or substrate and in plants as they spawn they like many other fish are also avid egg eaters so unless a tank has been especially planned and set up for breeding them it's highly unlikely you would ever find and eggs or fry mm  Danio Zebra Danio Shark Platypus Clownfish Ostrich Leatherback Sea Turtle Lion Salmon Discus (fish) Egg (biology) Kakapo Kissing gourami Grunion Sailfin Molly American lobster Parthenogenesis Sexual reproduction Hybrid Aphid Cat Dr. Seuss Walleye Egg (food) Bird Beetle Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Skinny Puppy Seahorse The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Live-bearing aquarium fish Animal Tigon Cheetah Horse Ocean's Twelve Seabird Fugu Nile crocodile Hermaphrodite Goldfish Life in the Freezer Elis Prefecture Chicken Bagworm moth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Panthera hybrid Tarantula House Mouse Octopus Kodocha Tuatara God Emperor of Dune McDonald's Minor Harry Potter Beasts Pizza Zeidae Murray Cod Brook trout Tlingit Freshwater angelfish Spider Roe Omega-3 fatty acid Great White Shark Sonic Adventure Non-human animal sexuality Poker jargon Cantonese cuisine Sex Pink salmon Japanese cuisine Chinook salmon Cuisine of Laos Red Squirrel Ramen Cichlid Rhea (bird) Fish and chips Hamburger Veganism Condor Dragonet Dinosaur Starship Troopers RuneScape quests Kruger National Park Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Arctic grayling Creatures in Bionicle Cuisine of Denmark Piccolo Junior Saga Sushi Chinese cuisine Halfbeak Fancy rat Boom Town (Doctor Who)

why does my male betta attack my female after he blows bubbles i keep them separated until after he blows bubbles then place her with him he chases her and then starts biting her she has a sore right now he has killed other females what am i doing wrong please help i have never had my bettas in with other fish or together only when i did put the other female in did he kill her so i watched him this time thanks for all the input what you are doing wrong is putting other bettas into the same tank as your male if you are trying to breed your bettas you need to first condition both the male and female for being in the same water as each other you don't just put them together and wait you can read about how to do this and more about breeding bettas here http www aquarticles com articles breeding kick beta breeding html once you have conditioned your bettas successfully they will not fight when placed in the same tank if they are displaying aggression to one another they are not ready to breed if you are not trying to breed them then they shouldn't ever be in the same water at all under no circumstances should another betta ever be in a male betta's tank whether the betta is male or female too many people are under the false impression that male bettas only attack other males they are territorial regardless of gender and such a set up will never work on a long term basis  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Humpback Whale Platypus Gray Wolf Lion Aquarium Poker jargon Puma Cat Gender role Battle of the Bulge HTML element Halfbeak Clownfish Sea-Monkey Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Heretics of Dune House Mouse Ostrich Six-Day War Spider Dwarf gourami USS Tunny (SS-282) Samus Aran Wine making HyperText Transfer Protocol Discus (fish) Nerpa Brewery Kakapo Cockfight War of 1812 Life in the Freezer Ruff Uniform Resource Locator Transgender Explosive material Jackass: The Movie Goldfish Aerial (dance move) Liger Domestic violence Tigon Salic law Tenshinhan Leatherback Sea Turtle Spyware Naruto jutsu Unicode and HTML Continuation War The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie American lobster Ant John Money Polish September Campaign Fish farming World Wide Web Gourami European Theatre of World War II Yom Kippur War Sex Pit bull Soap bubble John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Plame affair Equine conformation Mark I (tank) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Sex assignment Mountain Gorilla Electrophysiology F-104 Starfighter USS Thresher (SS-200) Programmable logic controller Tag 2003 Invasion of Iraq Order of succession Bubble Bobble Artificial selection Terrorism B-47 Stratojet Register renaming Chess strategy and tactics Lebanese Civil War Intersex surgery OpenDocument Minor Harry Potter Beasts Time Crisis 3 YuYu Hakusho Te Kooti's War Bullfighting JavaServer Pages Character encodings in HTML Shaggy dog story Homophobia PID controller Robot Master Battle of Mokra

deaths in my tank i got up this morning to find one of my platys and one of my cardinals dead in the tank both with no signs of illness whatsoever all the other platys and cardinals of each now are fine and my betta seems ok too what could have killed them i was concerned over this weekend because my tank was getting very warm due to the warm weather we had in the uk the temperature got up to about f c could this be what killed the fish i tested my water today and all is fine nitrate is nitrite is and ammonia is the only thing i had noticed with the platy was that she was not growing as large as the other platys and she always had her fins clamped to her body but the cardinal i have no idea why he died i'm doing a partial water change tomorrow is there anything else i should do to ensure the rest of my fish don't suddenly die thanks i've been keeping tropical fish for over years now and i'm afraid this sort of thing happens occasionally and you just have to accept it i once had a shoal of about cardinal tetras die in a few hours but had no problem whatsoever with any of the other tetras in the tank including neon's unless the water became too oxygen deficient lifting the temperature to c shouldn't do any harm water test kits are useful but they are not particularly accurate and without full laboratory facilities it's impossible to test for everything if you've got a filter try cleaning it out use tank water if it's a biological one and by all means change some of the water but try and get the fresh water to something like the temperature in the tank before you add it put a drop of water conditioner in to neutralise the chlorine if you've got any keep an eye on the other fish for a week or so look out particularly for any tiny white spots that appear on them if you see any put some white spot cure in the tank  Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Aquarium Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Fish farming Shark Water purification E85 Water Eutrophication Ozone depletion Electrophysiology Fish Dialysis Carburetor Carbon dioxide Ozone hole Cardinal tetra Energy development Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fire fighting Swimming pool Explosive material Ocean thermal energy conversion Global warming and agriculture Hydrogen economy Autonomous building Goldfish Diving suit Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Hyperthermia Food preservation Shrimp farm Corrosion Alternative biochemistry Cetacea Drowning Dry cleaning Carnivorous plant Immortality Ozone Nitric acid Lake Avalanche StarCraft: Uprising White Cloud Mountain Minnow Albedo Fossil fuel power plant Neon tetra USS Tunny (SS-282) Polychlorinated biphenyl Sauna Sterilization (microbiology) Disinfection Marine biology Rebreather STS-50 Global climate model Fugu Diseases of the honeybee Motor oil Bottlenose Dolphin Cloud Helium Acetic acid Tropical cyclone Foodborne illness Dairy Haloalkane Thermoregulation Climate of the United Kingdom P-38 Lightning Hydrogen Weather lore Sonar Mercury Atlas 6 Cryonics Sea level rise Mercury (element) El Ni__o Fishing Hypoglycemia Gas mantle Ecology Chlorine Dead Sea

why is my anenomie jumping around the fish tank anenomie is floating or jumping around the tank its crazy it looks like its hi or something lol what is it doing i assume you have a bubble tip anemone these anemones move around quite often if it is moving towards the top of the tank it most likely means you dont have good enough lighting anemones have high lighting demands to be kept happy and healthy if you are using just regular flourescent lights then you dont have proper lighting for the anemone you should really be using vho lighting or preferably metal halides you should also check your sg salt content this should be at for anemones and you should also be adding iodine to the water for it hope this helps and good luck  Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Reef tank Clownfish Aquarium Cannabis cultivation Sewage treatment E85 Atomic Kitten Edible salt Milk Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Thermal power station Carburetor Bubble Bobble Jellyfish Oxyacetylene Iodine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sodium chloride Robot Master Water purification Fish farming Bread Water (molecule) Knife Percula Clownfish Gas metal arc welding Mineral Biology Hydrogen economy Dodge Charger Lighting Relative clause Staining (biology) Nutrition Symbiosis Volleyball Silver Corrosion Titanium Coulometry Bong Parachuting Haloalkane Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hydroponics First aid Incandescent light bulb Aerial (dance move) Hamster Glossary of firefighting equipment Halogen Ammonia Rainbow Islands Tank Palindrome Aluminium Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Uranium Dimmer Siphon Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament Care Bears B3ta Quake III Arena Fly fishing Gasoline Alcohol Wine making Idli Unreal Fish Seismic retrofit Acetic acid Sugar beet Halo 2 Discus (fish) Black Carbon dioxide Final Fantasy XI Wild ARMs 2 Equine conformation Solar power Manicure Tank destroyer Bromine Lightning rod Sea anemone Cantonese cuisine Patrick Star Butterflyfish Anemone Mechanical Animals Sake Welding Veganism

why is my fish floating and the top of the water and swimming sideways could this have anything to do with the fact that i fed them too much last night if so what should i do not enough oxygen in your tank they have not eaten whatever you gave them last night but the feed you gave polluted the water too much and lessen the oxygen in the water that they couldn't breathe properly so im sorry to say you have to buy yourself another one of them fish and don't let it happen again  Sea-Monkey Fish farming Scuba set Gar Rebreather Sewage treatment Waterworld Fire fighting Shark Goldfish Clownfish Nile crocodile Carburetor Diving regulator Water pollution Drowning Swimming pool Thermal power station Ecco the Dolphin Moon Jelly Tetrapod Water quality Water Oxygen depletion E85 Fishing Cave diving Aquaculture Fugu Discus (fish) Atlantic herring Hydroponics Stingray Dwarf gourami Orca Chinook salmon Coconut crab Myxobolus cerebralis Factory farming Grand Calumet River Sperm Whale Seabird Space Shuttle external tank Ages of Uru Twelve leverage points Frog Aquarium Carbon dioxide Gas bladder History of swimming Helios Airways Flight 522 Cetacea Diving Aquatic ape hypothesis Autonomous building Crayfish Eutrophication Hydrogen vehicle Hydrogen sulfide Salmon Energy development Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Frogman Swimming Bottlenose Dolphin Bird The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pollution Jaws (film) Water (molecule) Nerpa Halfbeak Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Timeline of underwater technology Walleye Shrimp farm Particle (ecology) Diving cylinder Livestock Foodborne illness Creatures in Bionicle Batoidea Hydrogen economy Conker's Bad Fur Day Butterfly stroke Lake Burley Griffin Solar power Campfire Fin Whale Space Shuttle program Dolphin Lamprey Space shuttle main engine Deluge (mythology) Clear Lake Whale Decompression sickness Lifeguard Italian commando frogmen Goby

gone belly up today i just purchased a goldfish and it's already gone belly up on me it looked like a healthy fish when i bought him but it was an hour long trip back home before i could put him in the gallon tank and i imagine he was stressed from the journey the water is clean as i just changed it this morning so it can't be that the filter was primed and a new cartridge put in a good hours before the goldfish came home do you think it's the stress that made him go belly up anything i can do that might help him live i forgot to add that this is a fantail goldfish in case that makes a difference yes i'll often float the bag for about minutes i feel so sorry for the poor guy i bring him home and i kill him this is actually my first goldfish i've had many tropical fish but never a goldfish so perhaps i did something wrong in treating the water i know goldfish need slightly colder water temps than tropicals yup water was conditioned as well i used a ph regulator to bring the water to does a goldfish require a different level thanks for the information if the water isn't fully prepped yet then would it be better to transport him to my second gallon which has tropicals in it could that potentially help him out despite the temperature difference i really feel bad for the poor thing some good answers but in my experience this upside down syndrome sometimes happen to goldfish especially fantails because they have trapped air in their swimming air bladder they use it to stay balance and when stressed or moved from tank to tank they develop the condition now i have seen the fish naturally fix the problem but some can not and usually die some people try gently massaging the fish or squeezing ever so slightly and sometimes a spin in a bag cures it too hope it works out good luck  Goldfish Aquarium E85 Drowning Poker jargon Samuel Goldwyn Thermal power station Theory of conduct Water purification Urinary incontinence Marine aquarium Swimming pool Brewery Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Dairy Menstrual cup Dialysis Social rule Fish farming Fossil fuel power plant P-38 Lightning Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Coral reef Ocean thermal energy conversion Combat stress reaction Sea-Monkey Bladderwort 2000 Australian Grand Prix Breastfeeding Messerschmitt Bf 109 Thermoregulation Professional wrestling holds Hypoglycemia Rebreather Short selling Insulin Solar power Water (molecule) God Emperor of Dune Bong Lake USS Yorktown (CV-5) Shrimp farm Sento Aerial (dance move) Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Fugu Equine conformation Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Daylight saving time Asperger syndrome Autonomous building Firearm Scientology beliefs and practices Agar plate Carbon dioxide Carnivorous plant Hydrogen economy P-47 Thunderbolt Microeconomics Ecco the Dolphin First aid T'Pol Diseases of the honeybee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Decompression sickness Strategic management Diving suit 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ashton-Tate Iowa class battleship Futurama (TV series - season 5) Mattress Water Temperature Jet engine Cross-country skiing Shark Growth hormone treatment Textile manufacturing Procrastination Explosive material Gar Carburetor Climate of the United Kingdom Diving Free trade Color B-47 Stratojet

is the golden coris wrasse compatible with the spikefin goby and orchid doty back i have seen some sites which say they arnt compatible but when they say the wrasse is not compatible with these ones i think it may mean they more aggressive wrasses and not the golden coris wrasse or is the golden coris wrasse aggressive all of those fish will get along great especially if you have coral rock but the problem is if you dont have alot of experience of salt water fish i would recommend you not getting the golden coris wrasse yellow wrasse there hard to keep care of and require alot of needs and attention not actuall attention but if you do lots of research and get proper food and such the wrasse should be fine in the tank good luck  Corydoras Goby Marine aquarium Fauna of Australia Hamster Fish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Jute Clownfish Reef tank Tsing Yi Fugu Apple Hermaphrodite Sodium chloride Perciformes Dwarf gourami Discus (fish) Fish farming RuneScape quests Coral Cory's Shearwater Animal Crossing Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBM PC compatible Domestication Percula Clownfish Fishing Gobi Desert Hard disk Dishwasher Boy Meets World Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Breastfeeding Crown-of-Thorns starfish Aquarium Parrotfish Thermal power station Gerty Cori Golden rice Uranium Coral reef Password Golden Retriever E85 Floppy disk Cuisine of Malaysia RuneScape Mini-Games Dog Healthy eating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Labrador Retriever Carl Ferdinand Cori Luck Guinea pig Hydrogen economy Vegetarianism Mid-levels Animal communication Ladysmith Black Mambazo Columbia River Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma MS-DOS Yosemite National Park Condom Cyanide Windows XP Kosher foods First aid Motorcycle Clown loach Great Lakes Bipolar disorder Bernard Williams Crayfish Killian documents Anchor Shrimp farm Theory of conduct Cascading Style Sheets Veganism Oily fish French fries Zebra Danio Tilapia Diving locations San Francisco, California Orlando, Florida Nutrition Paintball Green roof Atari 8-bit family Hydroponics Tooth Eutrophication IBM PC Linux Drowning Psychoanalysis

so what fish can you put with your betta right so apparently goldfish are out of the question p and so are adult male bettas and female bettas i heard that after they have babehs the males have a little snack so what fish can you put in there depends on what kind of a set up you have a betta does fine in a tropical aquarium with most other fish as long as the aquarium is big enough i've had good luck placing them with catfish loaches plecos and others that prefer to stay near the bottom since the betta prefers to claim the top as his own i agree with keeping other bettas male or female out of that tank the betta can do well with tetras or other tropical fish that can move fairly fast to keep out of its way the larger showier fish such as angels and gouramis are probably not so good since the betta might snap at their long fins and possibly injure them and they do absolutely fine on their own they can be kept for several years in a bowl or as a specimen fish in a larger tank it's up to you if you want to keep one alone they're practically carefree just feed it once in awhile and change the water from time to time they can adapt to almost any conditions cold water is fine warm water is fine and they don't seem at all picky about whether the water is clean or dirty good luck and have fun  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Aquarium Gar Goldfish Tilapia Discus (fish) Clownfish Dwarf gourami Fishing Loach Kissing gourami Marine aquarium Bottlenose Dolphin Diving suit Halfbeak Gourami Fish Sea-Monkey Clown loach Carburetor Fast bowling Zebra Danio Coral reef Knife Fish farming Suckermouth Catfish Tetrapod Brewery Orca Koi Poker jargon Stingray Shrimp farm Japanese tea ceremony Tropical cyclone Catfish Social rule Cuisine of Denmark Dragonet Krill Tarantula Atlantic herring Marine biology Fangtooth Autonomous building Seahorse Sexual selection Galaxy Angel Humpback Whale Parrotfish Aerial (dance move) Moorish Idol Live-bearing aquarium fish Sailfin Molly Freshwater angelfish Reef tank Cardinal tetra Swimming pool Characiformes Flathead catfish Goby Fin Whale Crayfish Green swordtail Leatherback Sea Turtle Shark Whaling Nile crocodile Hamster Bong Cloud Equine conformation Nerpa Dinghy Salic law Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Bird migration Corydoras Chinatown White Cloud Mountain Minnow Hip hop collaborations Grunion Pitaten Species Clarinet Finding Nemo Paragliding Color Japanese toilet Ecco the Dolphin Gharial Toilet Textile manufacturing Georgia Aquarium Perciformes Murray Cod Whale Biodiversity Danio

my goldfish have ick and i don't feel comfortable using the salt treatment i just bought goldfish the other day all of which were fine except one which had a fish lice on it which i removed and treated now i'm noticing ick developing and it might be from the change of tanks but i'm sure it's from the stress of the parasite i looked online and found out that the ick treatment i bought for my last goldfish only kills what's fallen to the tank not what's on them i don't want my fish to die again i read about the salt treatment where you dilute and put teaspoons of salt per every gallon and as an example they said that would be tspns for gallons what i have they say it's a treatment for goldfish but this doesn't sound right i don't want to kill my fish by adding salt to their water but i don't want them to die of ick either i need confirmation that the salt treatment is safe for goldfish that just seems like a lot of salt to put in gallons source http thegab org articles ichsalttreatment html you could do a few thing to fight ich the easiest method would be to buy white spot medication an dose as instructed make sure that it's filter friendly the other is to use add a concentration of salt g per litre fishes have to be keep in this concentration until the white spots symptom disappears this concentration will not cause problem for the goldfishes lastly you could slowly increase the temperature of the tank to degrees c and keep it there for a week at this temperature the reproduction of the ich parasite will halt large water change on alternate days will also disrupt the ich reproduction cycle as you will be removing large amount of tomont and theronts different stages of the parasite during the water change this will reduce the parasites within the system for you to manage  Sewage treatment Goldfish Water purification Fish farming Marine aquarium Brewery Aquarium Diseases of the honeybee Bipolar disorder Thermal power station Biodiesel Decompression sickness Diarrhea Cancer Clinical depression Myxobolus cerebralis Ich Hyperthermia Common cold Sleeping sickness Fire fighting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Electrophysiology Hydrogen economy Antidepressant Hydrogen peroxide Concentration Ecology Nuclear power Atherosclerosis Autonomous building E85 Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fugu Caffeine Psoriasis Stomach cancer Foodborne illness Corrosion Insulin Cyanide Shark Coffee Hard water Fire extinguisher Intravenous therapy Hypertension Sodium chloride Asthma AIDS Shrimp farm Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Eutrophication Vitamin C Microeconomics Dairy Allergy Cannabis (drug) Palliative care Dry cleaning Ammonia Urinary incontinence Stuttering Nuclear fallout DDT Mouth ulcer Anorexia nervosa First aid Schistosomiasis Energy development Paracetamol Tank Diazepam Discus (fish) Rabies Common Unix Printing System Dialysis Medicine Lithium salt Fossil fuel power plant Cannabis cultivation Chronic fatigue syndrome Cephalic disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Menstrual cycle Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hard disk Sigmund Freud Cirrhosis Rebreather Hormone replacement therapy (trans)

what is actinic lighting a couple days ago i recently bought this for my freshwater planted community tank http www petco com product coralife mini compact fluorescent or bulb aspx and i wondered what actinic lighting is also would it benefit freshwater plant growth in order to begin to understand the available spectrums of bulbs we must first analyze how light naturally penetrates water red light is the first to be filtered out and can only penetrate a short distance as light waves penetrate deeper into the water orange and yellow are lost next of all the colors of the spectrum blue light penetrates the deepest light spectrum is measured by the kelvin scale natural sunlight on a clear day registers at kelvin degrees kelvin temperatures less than become more red and yellow and the higher the kelvin temperature the more blue the light is photosynthetic invertebrates should be kept under lamps rated at or near the kelvin temperature where the invertebrate was collected shallow water species should be kept under k lamps while deep water species would prefer k lighting longer photoperiods can not compensate for incorrect light spectrum or intensity actinic lighting peaks in the nanometer range and emits a fluorescent blue light and is usually used as supplemental lighting not only is actinic lighting beneficial to photosynthetic invertebrates it is also aesthetically pleasing to the eye when used to supplement daylight lighting freshwater aquarium plants benefit from lighting with a kelvin temperature in the range of degrees freshwater plants prefer light with more red and yellow in the spectrum the context with which i believe the statement that actinics are for nothing more than aesthetics is that it isn't that important what the composition of the spectrum of the bulb is as long as there is enough light of the appropriate wavelengths for photosynthesis to occur so as long as you satisfy the needs of photosynthesis beyond that it doesn't matter what bulbs you use actinic day light etc the spectrum from actinic lights are important because of the fact it is important for photosynthesis so on this basis saying actinic lights is for aesthetics is incorrect it can be very important if it is the important dominant source of light of the right spectrum for photosynthesis to occur whether actinics is important depends on how the tank is set up and the amount of light that the actinics contribute to the total photosynthetic available radiation for example if you are running a w k mh with w of no then the no contribution to the par is pretty insignificant and whether you use actinic or daylight is of no real consequence to the photosynthetic organisms in the tank but your choice of no will make a difference in how the tank appears to the human eye now what happens when you turn around and are just running no or vho over a tank half daylight and half actinic are the actinics now there just for the look of the tank of course not now it is making up a significant amount of the par http www aquarium lighting guide com aquarium lighting guide so to answer your question a bit more directly yes actinic may aid photosynthisis in yout freshwater tank however it depends on what other light sources you have available and what their spectrium range is it also depends on what type of plants you are trying to grow if the plants are not normaly deep water plants and you have other full spectrum bulbs or grow bulbs on your tank it is unlikely that actinic lighting would have much affect on your tanks photosynthitic potential if you are growing algae the actinics could be more important genneraly i associate actinics with salt water tanks and corals the blue color could be very pleasing in a fresh water tank though hope that this helps good luck  Sun Marine aquarium Black body Stage lighting Light Light pollution Lighting Compact fluorescent lamp Sewage treatment Plant Aquarium Renewable energy Fish farming Carnivorous plant Solar power Sunlight Plasma (physics) Future energy development Carbon dioxide Houseplant Spectroscopy Eutrophication Coral reef Laser Leaf Lake Biodiesel Ionizing radiation Bicycle lighting Algae Optical fiber Diode Wind power Chlorophyta Eye Species Global warming and agriculture CIE 1931 color space Hydrogen economy Speed of light Ozone depletion Mercury-vapor lamp Headlight Gamut Spectrophotometry Polarization Dead Sea Diamond Electromagnetic spectroscopy Krill Photometry (optics) Solar cell Microscopy Microeconomics Ozone hole Welding X-ray Nuclear fallout Brewery Big Bang Tooth enamel Monochromator Energy development Electrodeless lamp Traffic light Observational astronomy Sea-Monkey Cassini-Huygens Deforestation Milk Carbon dioxide sink Nuclear power Chlorophyll Oxygen Cell (biology) Fermi paradox Uranium Discus (fish) Infrared

help betta fish problem earlier on i thought my betta had swim bladder disorder i treated him and he became one happy little fish i started feeding him bloodworms only for two days he then later starts acting like he used to i just figured it was swim bladder again because it looked like his stomach was bloated and he wouldn't eat i just went to look at him and he is really pale it almost looks like his scales are out a bit and he's breathing really hard he almost looks near death but i'm not sure what it could be so i don't know if i should have hope help what is it what can i do if his scales are raised then it's dropsy i'm so sorry dropsy is an awful disease and very hard to treat the epsom salt bath that another person posted about might help but more than likely not there are lots of medications that claim to treat dropsy but don't waste your money they don't work the only thing i ever heard of working was one time someone tried the epsom salt bath at the very very first signs and it seemed to help so try that keep his water clean and keep him comfortable if he seems to be suffering then you may consider euthenizing him  Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shark Drowning Stomach cancer First aid Theory of conduct Stroke Charles Darwin's illness Fecal incontinence Anxiety Traumatic brain injury Gastroparesis Gas bladder Diving Cancer Anorexia nervosa Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hyperthermia Guinea pig Fugu Asthma Vampire Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hamster Bipolar disorder Sauna Sea-Monkey Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kashrut Fish farming Fishing Prostate cancer Creatures in Bionicle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Terri Schiavo Happy Tree Friends Bloat Social rule Urinary system Autism Tetrapod Kurt Cobain Hypertension Magnesium sulfate Omega-3 fatty acid Salmon Dietary fiber Escherichia coli O157:H7 Urine Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Time Out of Mind Tuberculosis Hearing impairment Myxobolus cerebralis Pneumonia Insomnia Garfield Multiple sclerosis Factory farming Paget's disease of bone Dwarf gourami Alcoholism Snake Decompression sickness Breastfeeding Iridology Kosher foods Kidney Utilitarianism Urea Hydrochloric acid Livestock Cat Fasting Sewage treatment Human physiology Hard water Bearberry Hypoglycemia Garlic Menstrual cup Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Wall Dehydration Aquaculture Bulimia nervosa Health insurance Triage Mental illness Death Folic acid Carnivorous plant Water Hydrotherapy Hookworm

do the legs on little crabs grow back i got my son little crabs for his fish tank and noticed the female was missing of her legs on one side i feel kinda bad for her and don't have the heart to take her back where she'll die in a fight by losing her other legs on that side and become immobile or walk in circles she only has one long leg on that side the other is her short one in the front kind of like the hand would be she already walks crazy enough will those legs grow back or is she doomed to be a legged crab should i maybe take the males with the big claws back so she stays safe or are they more likely to keep her company or eat our african dwarf frog he stays at the top of the tank and even the placostomus isn't afraid to be right next to a crab but i'd hate for my almost year old to wake up and find bits and pieces of his fish and frogs scattered in the bottom of the tank the guy at the pet store said everything in the tank should go together fine but he also seemed more interested on hitting on a girl with a baby on her hip and a little boy watching too so you never know i would separate the crabs until the legs grow back and yes they will grow back but your right in thinking that he is vulnerable right now with fewer legs set up a small tank for the injured crab most people who keep fish as a hobby will have a hospital tank for situations like this its always better to remove any sick or injured creatures from the community tank just give him a month in the hospital tank and after he molts he will have at least a couple new small legs don't make fun of him i'm sure he will feel awkward lol anyway at that point you can put him back in a hospital tank needs only be a small affair you don't need to go spending a bunch of money on it a gallon tank is usually like bucks and you can buy a simple charcoal filter for another that is fine for one crab for a short time be sure to give him access to land and water and a hiding place he will be all set good luck  Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds Coconut crab Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Poker jargon Equine conformation American lobster Swingout Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Creatures in Bionicle Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Crab Characters in the Smurfs The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Professional wrestling slang Marine aquarium About a Boy Arthropod Professional wrestling throws The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Humphrey Bogart Rocko's Modern Life Sea-Monkey Conker's Bad Fur Day Craps Vegeta Piccolo Junior Saga Tank Hamster Breaststroke Cruising (maritime) Eddie Guerrero Professional wrestling aerial techniques Avenue Q Paragliding Combine (Half-Life 2) Fishing Mattress Swimming YuYu Hakusho Doom enemies GunBound The Amazing Race One Tree Hill (TV series) Satchel Paige Pitaten Cliff Richard Jon Secada W.I.T.C.H.

do i have to cover the bottom of my glass tank with some kind of styrofoam what do people mean by that does it mean to put the tank on top of a thick piece of styrofoam if so where can i buy that it's a gallon tank the reason people put there tanks on styrofoam is a way to make sure the tank will level itself this way if the floor is uneven then the tank will be able to evenly distribute its wieght by pressing into the styrofoam so you place the tank on top of the foam do not put the foam in your tank  Mattress Brewery Plastic Polystyrene Shoe Fire extinguisher STS-114 Space Shuttle external tank Tank Loudspeaker Panzer I Casting Vermicompost Thermal power station Stairway Panzer II Foam Tank classification Bread Geodesic dome Polyurethane Flush toilet Strap-on dildo Mark VIII (tank) Fire fighting Public domain Coffee T-64 Diving suit Wheat beer Marine aquarium NASCAR Teller-Ulam design Glossary of firefighting terms Aquarium Shirt Door Upholstery Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Armoured warfare Space Shuttle program Dodge Charger Poker jargon Tank car Yohoho!

water changes with discus i've had my discus tank up and running for about months now i was told by breeders and other discus experts to do weekly water changers i have a gallon tank so i am taking gallons out each week to me this seems like quite a bit wouldn't it start a new cycle each time i do a water change i have a fluval filter and packages of the biomax balls so is this why it doesn't start a cycle each time i've had fishtanks for about years now but until recently i've never did any water changes or knew much if anything about water cycles could somebody help me out on this also since the biomax balls carry all of the beneficial bacteria wouldn't it make sense to never replace them with new ones fluval recommends changing it once every months staggering the replacements is this just a way for them to make money i don't see why i should replace it thanks for any help i'm probably overthinking on this one its just that i spent last night on discus and they will be arriving tuesday morning i'd hate to loose that much on these fish so early in the game for something stupid that i didn't ask doing water changes has little affect on the bacteria once the tank has cycled the bacteria live in the filter media in this case your bioballs and attached to the gravel there's very little of the cycling bacteria that would be in the water you do need to remove the ammonia and nitrite if the tank is cycling and the nitrate if it's finished though all of these can be toxic to fish if the levels are high enough it's just that for nitrate it takes a lot more to be harmful it is a plant fertilizer though so removing and replacing of the water keeps it from fertilizing any algae in the tank the replacement water also contains some minerals calcium magnesium sodium that are used by the fish and any aquarium plants so doing a water change replenishes these the basis of cycling is bacteria that use the ammonia that your fish produce as a part of their wastes as their energy source since ammonia is toxic to your fish in relatively small amounts this is a good thing by using it for their energy they convert it to nitrite which is also toxic a second group of bacteria uses the nitrite as an energy source and they convert the nitrite to nitrate which the fish can live in in larger amounts unfortunately there aren't tank bacteria that use the nitrate but live plants will use some the rest need to be reduced through water changes you're correct that the bioballs are one of the areas where the bacteria live but these also collect a lot of debris from fish poo plant leaves and maybe some food that gets caught in the intake overflow these will decompose and become a source of ammonia themselves so this is what you want to clean you can rinse them in a clean container of tank water or dechlorinated water and reuse the same ones so partly they do make money if you follow their directions to the letter you can also reuse filter pads in hang on filters as well even though the directions on those packages tell you to replace them  Eutrophication Biogeochemical cycle Fish farming Bacteria Hydrogen economy Ammonia Aquarium Cyanide Water purification Biodiesel Carnivorous plant Hydrogen sulfide Brewery Ecology Energy development Nitrogen cycle Nutrient Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Autonomous building Milk Sulfur Dairy Iron Nitrogen Photosynthesis Soil pH Discus (fish) Chlorophyta Dry cleaning Uranium Water Nutrition Fossil fuel power plant Mercury (element) Hard water Soil life Explosive material Dietary fiber Biochemistry Waste management Sodium hypochlorite Ammonium nitrate Aluminium Cocaine Future energy development Fertilizer E85 Dishwasher Alcohol fuel Omega-3 fatty acid Natural gas Ocean thermal energy conversion Hamster Textile manufacturing Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ozone hole Nuclear reactor Toyota Prius Environmental concerns with electricity generation Dead Sea Water pollution Thermal depolymerization E number Carburetor Sea-Monkey Disinfection Urine Tofu Reef tank Cell (biology) Thermal power station Sulfuric acid Potassium nitrate Sodium nitrite Algae Houseplant Fire fighting Cellular respiration Vitamin C Krill Polychlorinated biphenyl Sterilization (microbiology) Sun Domestic rabbit Plankton Transformer Cannabis cultivation Desert

i just got a few more fish tanks one tank has a mirrored background that is starting to come off i would like to remove the whole background of the mirrored tank i have used a blade which takes off the gray part but there is still a gold tint after that any suggestions that have been tried and true would be great thanks using very fine steel wool and some warm soapy water you may be able to get it off goo gone is another good bet but it may be that the glass or plastic was made with the gold tinting in it and it may not be removable there is a trick that is used to remove car tinting that may also be useful here you need a warm place preferably direct sunlight undiluted ammonia a garbage bag big enough to fit over the tinted area and fine steel wool lay the tank on its front tinted side up and in direct sunlight spray the ammonia over the tinted area and cover with the garbage bag so the ammonia doesn't dry out let it sit for about an hour and then scrub a small part with the steel wool if the gold comes up then you can do that to the entire thing just make sure you do it bit by bit with the garbage bag still over the undone parts so the ammonia doesn't dry out if it doesn't come up then i'd say that the tint is part of the glass  Textile manufacturing Dialysis Bong Lake District Sunglasses Solar power Autonomous building Ammonia Dundas Square Dinghy Casting Bedbug Energy development Wok Mattress Marine aquarium Brewery Fossil fuel power plant Knife Space habitat Confidence trick Characters in the Smurfs Lighting Woodworking Hamster Tire Soap Hydrogen economy Poker jargon Garbage truck Cannabis cultivation Thermal power station Drill bit Glass Genericized trademark Pontiac Trans Sport Dishwasher Airbag Gilding Dishwashing M16 (rifle) Dairy De Lorean DMC-12 Titanium Cyanide Cruising (maritime) Manicure Palace of Westminster Screw Oldsmobile Silhouette Geodesic dome Cocaine Cochineal Japanese tea ceremony Fish farming U.S. ten-dollar bill The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Upholstery Solar panel Knitting Aluminium Yohoho!

how do fish drown a fish can drown under two scenario firstly when there isn't enough dissolved oxygen do in the tank water as someone mentioned in a tank that have it's water heated either due to a pump or filter in the water or due to environmental factor will have the do in the water dramatically reduced this could cause the fishes in the water to gasp and eventually drown another scenario would be if something is preventing the fish from breathing properly eg would be a shark caught in a drift net some sharks need to swim to force water through it gills so that it can breath not being able to swim would cause it to drown another example would be a goldfish having a pebble stuck in it's mouth with the ability to gulp water and force it through it gills it'll also drown eventually air breathing fish like betta and some cory species need to access air pocket above the water to breath if the fish is kept in a bag of water without air pocket the fish might suffer serious distress i doubt they'll die in the short term but they might not do too well in the long term so fish do drown  Drowning Rebreather Swimming pool Fish farming Swimming Aquarium Tetrapod Shark Fishing Sewage treatment Carbon dioxide Fish Hyperthermia Lake Burley Griffin Scuba set Orca Krill Scuba diving Jellyfish Gas bladder Firefighter Brewery Angling Hydroponics Diving Lung Great Lakes Coconut crab Ecco the Dolphin Whale Goldfish Whale shark Suicide methods Aquatic ape hypothesis Pulmonary alveolus Glossary of firefighting equipment Decompression sickness Sea-Monkey Gar Atlantic herring Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tooth Waterworld Carnivorous plant Marine aquarium Batoidea Jaws (film) Water Lifeguard Autonomous building Siphon Octopus Chesapeake Bay Bottlenose Dolphin Biodiesel Pebble bed reactor Hypothermia Hydrogen sulfide Solar power Salmon Asthma Great White Shark Humpback Whale Personal flotation device Eutrophication Stingray Cetacea Sawfish (fish) Pikmin Carburetor Reptile Diver rescue Hiccup Gill First aid Front crawl Fugu Fuel injection Energy development Water (molecule) Shrimp farm Scramjet Bladderwort Water purification Nile crocodile Oxygen sensor Thermal power station Nuclear power The Legend of Zelda series races Dwarf gourami Backstroke Corrosion Tank Liquid breathing

my angel fish has a fin that is coming off my angel fishs' left fin is deteriorating and his other is very fuzzy and he floats on the top sideways i have put teaspoons of kosher salt in the tank he seems a little more lively but he still wont stop floating i can push him under and he can stay down for a few seconds but when he slows down he comes right back up will he die can his fin come back is this a lost cause it sounds like fin rot coupled with fungus and some kind of swim bladder disease the swim bladder is the organ on the fish that controls buoyancy the salt was good but unfortunately not enough to save him try maracyn i and ii products although this particular fish may die even after dosing it with the maracyn you'll have it for next time in case this happens again and actually i recommend using the product on the tank for about a week or so following the directions then change about of the water and clean some of the rocks and then the filter a few days afterward this will ensure that none of your other fish become contaminated and if they do you'll have the proper antibiotics to treat it before it gets too serious good luck  Drowning Shark Fish farming Kosher foods Swimming pool Gas bladder History of swimming Shrimp farm Cantonese cuisine Nuclear fallout Water purification Escherichia coli O157:H7 Buoyancy compensator Tetrapod Sea-Monkey Marine aquarium Mouth ulcer Schistosomiasis Sailing Thermal power station American lobster Menstrual cup Livestock Psoriasis Omega-3 fatty acid Fish Water Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cryptosporidium Diarrhea Carburetor USS Tunny (SS-282) Swingout Mercury 4 Swimming Diving suit Disinfection Gar Brewery Dead Sea Antibiotic Myxobolus cerebralis Slow sand filter bed Gonorrhoea Diseases of the honeybee Fugu First aid Common cold Carnivorous plant Hypertension Anthrax Cave diving Tank Fishing Foodborne illness Rocky Mountain spotted fever Seine (fishing) Urinary system Prostate cancer Atlantic herring Fin Whale Breaststroke Sperm Whale Radiation therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Tuberculosis Biological warfare Aquarium Frogman Otitis externa Flight controls Dysentery Roach Mars Exploration Rover Cannabis cultivation Balloon Danio Backstroke Industrial wastewater treatment Circle (dance move) Gimli Glider Naval mine Dwarf gourami Kissing gourami Cheese Legionellosis Bottlenose Dolphin Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sterilization (microbiology) Nasal irrigation Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Butterfly stroke Conker's Bad Fur Day Unclean animals

betta compatability are rams compatible with a betta in a large enough tank i know theyre not aggressive to other fish but im wondering how they would do with a long finned fish i have a ten gallon tank that i can put the betta in but if it can be with the rams ill put it with them in my gallon and stick my angels and swordtails in the ten they killed my last betta ive learned my lesson oh and dont worry its only three small angels and four half inch swords theyll be okay in the ten right now i have two rams but if i stick the angels in the ten ill buy about three more if its okay with you guys no they will not grow it out easily the angels are fully grown and my swords come from small parents and have been so far rather slow growers if they do grow it out i have another gallon tank with a few other swords that i can stick them in the only reason why the fish grow slow is from tank size the angel needs gallons each and they grow inches the betta and rams woud be good in the gallon tank just put alot of plants the swordies would be good with the angels but its best to get them a gallon too  Goldfish Dwarf gourami P-47 Thunderbolt Fruit tree propagation Hydrogen economy Biodiesel Poker jargon Green swordtail IBM PC compatible Brewery Hard disk Aquarium Laptop Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Fish farming Ford Mustang Firearm Apple St. Louis Rams YuYu Hakusho Refrigerator car Marine aquarium Sailfin Molly Lionel Corporation Discus (fish) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items USS Tunny (SS-282) Goby English unit Anti-aircraft warfare Toyota Prius Barrel (storage) Team Fortress Classic Gallon Alcohol fuel Terminal ballistics Peanut RISC Nintendo GameCube Nickname Knife Microeconomics Tilapia Weapon Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) Metrication arguments and counter-arguments Orca Elis Prefecture Autonomous building Metrication New York Giants USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB 11) Supply and demand Bowie knife Timpani Dairy Atari 8-bit family O scale Sea-Monkey Elephant Axolotl Grand Theft Auto (game) Tank locomotive Fin Whale U.S. customary units Link (Legend of Zelda) Thomas the Tank Engine Fire extinguisher Gourami Clownfish Kylie Minogue Illegal drug trade The Legend of Zelda series races Eskrima Random access memory Charles Ives Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories F-16 Fighting Falcon Cannabis cultivation Striker Pack Moorish Idol CPU design Empire Earth II American lobster P-38 Lightning PC Engine USB flash drive CPU cache Atari ST Tamil language Shell (projectile) Armoured warfare Commodore 64 Cleveland Browns Clown loach Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory

do convict cichlids need to be a pair hi i was hoping to get a convict cichli ive read abotu them alot i like to educate myself but the info mentions a lot of tiem about a pair of convicts i was planning on gettoing one do i neeed to get two no you don't need to get two definitely get a male female pair though if you do you can have two males but make sure you have a large tank so they don't fight each other just in case you don't know how to do this the females are typically smaller and have red dots on their belly their fins are different but this is the easiest way to identify them convict cichlids breed very easily so unless you're prepared to use them as feeders give them away or whatever you probably shouldn't get a pair i'm talking breeding easily frequently with large broods cichlid breeding and rearing behavior is very interesting to observe convicts are about as easy as it gets if you want to watch this just make sure you have an empty tank b c they'll aggressively pursue other fish and probably kill them i had a gallon with a pair in it with catfish and plecos and they survived and had enough sense to stay away although it probably was a high stress environment for them one convict in a tank is kind of uninteresting though they're kind of aggressive so there are only a few types of fish of other species you can match them with  Tilapia Cichlid Discus (fish) Fish farming Poker jargon Live-bearing aquarium fish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Humpback Whale Theory of conduct Clownfish Oscar (fish) Gray Wolf Bottlenose Dolphin Sexual selection Domestic rabbit Elephant Albatross Fugu Zerg Tank Kakapo Platypus Mountain Gorilla House Mouse Species Shrimp farm Artificial selection Dog Jack Dempsey (fish) Catfish Freshwater angelfish Livestock Mallard Spider BZFlag Animal communication Gender role Africanized bee Honeybee Goldfish Halfbeak Protoss Monogamy Cat Sex History of the tank Tetrapod Whale Fishing Badminton Marine aquarium Gar Leopard Ant Lion Chicken Plame affair Vowel Dog training StarCraft Episode VI Leatherback Sea Turtle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Whale watching Hamster Non-human animal sexuality Battle of Kursk God Emperor of Dune Prairie Falcon Motorcycle DNA Marine angelfish James Hanratty Emu Sperm Whale Armoured warfare Lake Malawi Surveillance Borderline personality disorder Sharon Tate Manifold Eusociality Polish September Campaign Hydrogen economy Rape Bird Terran (StarCraft) Aphid Combinatorial species Motivation Zambezi Seabird Nature versus nurture Honda CX series Shark Messerschmitt Bf 109 Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Vampire Squid Wind turbine Monster Rancher monsters

why are my fish dying okay i just cleaned my fish tank put all my fish in another contaner while i cleaned it and then pored them back in the tank i left the room for like hours and of the fish are dead and the others ones are acting like there going to die this has never happened before whats going on btw there goldfish did you put declorinator in did you correct for temperature meaning if the water the fish were in was warmer colder than the clean water in the tank they can go into shock and die you have to put them in ziplock bags and float them in the water like you did when you first got them did you do a complete water change did you wash the rocks with detergent both of these kill beneficial bacteria that keep fish alive also detergent and cleaners are toxic to fish and most of them are difficult to rinse off completely did you use a stress coat type medicine it's not exactly necessary but it helps how long were the fish in the container if it was over crowded and they were in there a while the oxygen level drops and the fish can get fatally sick pouring them in can injure the fish internally if it's been awhile since you cleaned the tank the clean water can put them into shock the chemicals have built up in the dirty water but the fish were used to it when you put them in clean water it changed the chemicals too fast and they went into shock and died this is the basic idea it's more complicated than this do research on how to clean a tank get a gravel vaccum it's the best invention ever fun and easy way to clean the tank and it preserves the environment for the fish  Aquarium Marine aquarium Dry cleaning Dishwasher Textile manufacturing First aid Water Goldfish Fugu Energy development Swimming pool Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen peroxide Menstrual cup Foodborne illness Fish farming Detergent Hard water Motor oil Dam Acne Hydrogen economy Solar power Laundry detergent Ice core Hydroponics Rebreather Fishing Agar plate Soap Glass Eutrophication Chemical warfare Brewery Vacuum cleaner Water pollution Tilapia Sento Japanese tea ceremony Insulin Sea-Monkey STS-50 Thermal power station Shark Corrosion Apollo Command/Service Module Food preservation Decompression sickness Water (molecule) Motorcycle Sodium chloride Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Sterilization (microbiology) Cryonics Scuba set Mercury (element) Great Lakes Vinegar Myxobolus cerebralis Shampoo Anchor Fire extinguisher Urticaria Autonomous building Disinfection Embalming Allergy Grand Calumet River Nuclear power Halitosis E85 Dead Sea Cannabis cultivation Apollo 13 Sulfur Aluminium Japanese toilet Dairy Vacuum Pneumonia Ricin Chronic fatigue syndrome Space disaster Poison Car washing techniques Explosive material Haloalkane Ozone Wound

are freshwater rams hardy fish would you consider them to be strong survivors also how big will they get with enough room well everywhere i read it always says that these fish are not for beginners and blah blah but i bought two and ive been caring for them in my tank and no problems at all none in fact their colors improved dramatically since ive brought them home so in conclusion i wouldnt say theyre hardy because of all of the other descriptions but i will say that they're not ridiculously weak theyre for the average somewhat experienced fishkeeper i'll agree that theyre not for beginners because theyre a bit costlier and should be well taken care of to maintain their beautiful lively colors well what do want them to try to survive they will not survive a tank with fast aggressive fish because they are very timid in fact its rare to see a ram go up to the surface to catch the flakes they wait for falling food also size they max out at three inches they average two  Marine aquarium Goldfish Clownfish Fish Shrimp farm Poker jargon CPU cache Ives Manufacturing Company Discus (fish) Corydoras Aquarium Halfbeak Fishing Charles Ives Zebra Danio Atari ST Atari 8-bit family Crayfish Childbirth Dwarf gourami O scale Organ transplant SS Andrea Doria New York Jets White Cloud Mountain Minnow Murray Cod Aquaculture Winter Dodge Charger Ecco the Dolphin Dr. Seuss Paragliding Fly fishing Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Violin Fancy rat St. Louis Rams Pittsburgh Steelers GunBound New York Giants Socrates USS Tunny (SS-282) Fish farming Irish dance Sea-Monkey Frontier in Space RISC Kosher foods Gar Virtual memory The Legend of Zelda series enemies Fast bowling Nintendo 64 Wassily Kandinsky Pysanka Bird Supernatural Carnivorous plant XML Tarot Dynamic random access memory Japanese tea ceremony Ferret Equine conformation Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Shark Spider Battle of France Vegeta Ecology of Hong Kong Animal Crossing Loudspeaker Thermal power station F-16 Fighting Falcon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME MS-06 Zaku II Pump It Up Timeline of computing 1990-forward Motorcycle Reef tank Professional wrestling match types Economy of the United States Anne Boleyn Common Fisheries Policy Fish and chips USS Thresher (SS-200) Sega Game Gear Second Battle of Gaza Hard disk Big Brother (USA TV series) Whale Matt Hardy Weight training History of the tank Reaganomics Operation Barbarossa Danio Visual Basic Goby Neo-Geo

can you put chinese fighting fish together with gold fish no you can't you can sometimes put a cleaner fish like a pecostomous in with a chinese fighting fish make sure it's around the same size as the betta too big and it'll kill the betta too small and the betta kills it if they're around the same size they'll generally leave one another alone the pecost never stops growing but if it has a fairly peaceful relationship with the betta from the start peaceful aka ignoring one another then when it gets bigger there usually isn't any prob  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Chu-Han contention Taikyoku shogi Poker jargon Charles George Gordon Tenshinhan Ecco the Dolphin RuneScape skills Shark Fishing Gourami Whaling Han Xin Rules of Go Hamburger Shotgun Maka dai dai shogi Midlands (Sword of Truth) YuYu Hakusho Mach kernel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 613 mitzvot Chris Kanyon Jet Li Goby Ranma __ characters Xi'an Incident Punctuation Emperor Guangwu of Han Zhao Yun Wang Mang Kylie Minogue Sonic Adventure Sakhalin Arjuna Dwarf gourami Diffraction Henry Pym Seven-Year War Daredevil The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Long Island Modoc War The Outsiders (novel) RuneScape economy Shaggy dog story Escape from New York Into the West (miniseries) Reel Big Fish IA-32 Trolling for fish Unified neutral theory of biodiversity The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Battle of Britain Viterbi algorithm Characters in the Smurfs Betting (poker) Thirteen Years' War Moldavian Magnate Wars Fancy Crane Non-native pronunciations of English Dragon boat South Vietnam Puni Puni Poemy Theory of conduct Fishery Angling Chopsticks Lin Kuei Xiangqi Philosophical skepticism True Crime: Streets of LA Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Hamster Vegeta The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Battle of Cut Knife RuneScape Random Events Doomsday argument Hangul RuneScape locations Tai shogi Piccolo Junior Saga Flax Birthday paradox Emperor Wu of Han The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Quentin Tarantino Xiang Yu 228 Incident Left-wing politics Mega Man & Bass Greenpeace Economy of Mali The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Hey Arnold!

goldfish deformed jaw my friend got a goldfish with a really long bottun jaw he has to get his food crushed so he can eat it can she cure it if the protruding jaw is by nature i doubt it can be cured but goldfishes are know to get their mouth lock what happens is that the plates that forms the mouth of the fish gets locked when the fish tries to eat or swallow something larger then it's mouth can handle for such case u can take a twiser and gently tugged at the mouth plates outwards and let it retract back by itself normally it should fall back in place after a few attempt a fish that can't close its mouth will have to put in extra effort in breathing in the long term the fish might die from exhaustion and drowning  Goldfish Tetrapod Vowel Trapping Hiccup Shark Jaws (film) Equine conformation Happy Tree Friends Oral sex Crocodilia Chopsticks Professional wrestling holds Nile crocodile Garfield Eryops Whale Fugu Drowning Jaw Great White Shark Animal Internal ballistics Cephalic disorder Heckler & Koch G3 Blue Whale Mouth ulcer Combine (Half-Life 2) Gharial Leviathan Herring Gar Grouper Voiceless palatal-velar fricative Cetacea Tlingit Insulin Snake Angling Professional wrestling aerial techniques Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Elephant The Amber Spyglass Fishing Professional wrestling throws Orca Cleft Lake Burley Griffin Naruto jutsu Canal lock American lobster Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Dolphin Muskellunge Tooth Koi Zambezi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humpback Whale Transformers: Cybertron Kenny McCormick Anchovy Bladderwort Stuttering Handloading Crocodile American Alligator Tuatara Lathe Remora M16 (rifle) SuperCroc Plastic Hypoglycemia Face Terminal ballistics American Dad!

gallon aquarium whats some good combinations of fish for a gal aquarium i want something with color and not all small fish have any ideas i like angels and catfish type things or cichilids i know they cant all be together so give me some good combos such as like angels and like plecostomus or something thanks best combo gets points would any cichilids be allowed with angels i know i definitly want angels based around that i need to know if i can have a plecostomus catfish and or cichilids how do you pronounce cichilids angel fish are cichilds actually you would pronouce it sick lids a good combination is open to many possibilties here consider this though gallon tank is roughly feet in length by feet wide that's the rough area you have to work with when considering your population if you go with angelfish then i'd stick with those only for your cichilds you can also go with africans but actually you'll want to overstock it to aggression is limited there are some africans that are fairly peaceful for africans as well i have protomelas stevani's aka taiwan reef cichilds in my and they cooexist with different types of mbuna in there and i have yet to have a fight between species go on the mbuna have fought within themselves and i also have four nicely growing yellow labs that fight sometimes among themselves but never between species granted my spacing is feet by two feet more area but the idea is if you want to intermix for colors then i'd go with groups that are relatively peaceful for africans and you get better colors out of them imo if you go south american i'd try blue acara as your main cichild nice colors on it and pretty peaceful fish you could probably get to breed i'd limit any plecos you get to just one given how big they get as adults take a peek at taiwan reefs and possibly red empress they have nice colors but i'll tell you one thing i've learned about schools of them there will be only one dominant male of the group the males usually have the most colors to them and if there is more then the colors you see on pictures that will be the colors on the main male the other males will have colors subdued and the females are many times not even the same color grouping at all making them easy to identify you can get further help still at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv  Discus (fish) Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Clownfish Marine aquarium Goldfish Color Georgia Aquarium Freshwater angelfish Fishing Stereoscopy Fish farming Yu-Gi-Oh!

i have an established gallon and a brand new how much gravel would i need from the old one i was just hoping to jump start the cycle would a cup of old gravel be enough in the old days this was the only way to jump start the cycle it was effective and still used today the question isn't what is needed but the answer is how much can be spared bacteria reproduces by doubling so the more that goes over the faster an equilibrium can be established in the new tank but how much can be spared if bacteria at its best doubles you can move over half of the gravel from the ten gallon this is not usually the case so i would only move over a third of the gravel for fastest bacteria transfer without upsetting the original tank there are other methods remember there are excellent products like hagen's cycle or sera's nitrivec which are premeasured means of jump starting the cycle these may be another option for you good luck and makesure you don't over crowd the new tank until it has cycled well not really then either i just mean not too many fish to begin with  Marine aquarium CPU cache 2000 Australian Grand Prix Entropy Social rule Sewage treatment Firearm Menstrual cycle Fire fighting Dairy 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Biodiesel Messerschmitt Bf 109 CDC 6600 Redundant array of independent disks RISC Aquarium Toyota Prius Badminton E85 Red Arrows 1957 World Series Final Fantasy XI Microeconomics Armored Core Control flow Dead Like Me Cross-country skiing P-47 Thunderbolt Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Antibiotic Keynesian economics Fish farming Alex Ferguson Sea-Monkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Piccolo Junior Saga Eastern Front (World War II) Napier's bones Triathlon Carbon dioxide Bacteria Shrimp farm Tai shogi Hiberno-English Hyperinflation Anthrax Theory of conduct Compiler optimization Anchor Ashton-Tate Dry cleaning General equilibrium Fossil fuel power plant Central processing unit Chu shogi Intelligent design CPU design Hebrew calendar Quake III Arena Biology Pump It Up The Joker's Wild Tax Economics Hard disk Ford Mustang Hydrogen economy African American Vernacular English History of swimming Swingout Transport in Sudan Genetically modified organism Brewery Chlorophyta Tank Diving Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

saltwater tank im starting a salt water tank gallons i would like to know what things i need to purchase and how to keep the tank running smoothly please give me as much information on salt water tanks as possible as much as possible may be more than your bargained for i see you've already decided on a good sized tank so i won't go into those but here's a listing of other items you should get and some optional items that may make the tank maintenance a little easier filter you'll need to get one that's properly sized filters x x the tank volume per hour there are lots of choices and what you'll need will really depend on budget what you're trying to keep and personal preference i'd consider the best to be a refugium or wet dry trickle filter next best would be a canister followed by a biowheel then a standard hang on tank unless you're using a fine sand or oolite substrate you can also use an undergravel filter to supplement filtration but i'd suggest powering it with a reversible powerhead to blow the water up through the substrate prevents stuff from building up under the filter and clogging it if the tank is predrilled for an overflow the refugium or wet dry are what it's set up for but you can also do an over the rim for this because of the length of this sized tank if it's not predrilled you might want to use two hang on filters to make the distance from the filter to any point in the tank at less powerhead s to provide more water circulation in hard to get to places this also helps circulate dissolved oxygen to the bottom of the tank heaters for a saltwater tank i'd suggest getting and putting one on each end this will provide more even heating and your tank has a back up if one gives out figure the correct size as watts per gallon divided by heaters if you need to heat the water more than degrees above the room temperature go one size higher also plan on thermometers to position in the tank to check the temperature lighting if you never want anything but fish you can use the standard lighting and hood made for your tank you might want to upgrade the lamps to a k tube or a actinic if you're going to try corals anemones etc go with a compact fluorescent metal halide or combo system these will provide more intense light that they'll need for photosynthesis substrate you want something made of aragonite to help keep the ph from changing i like the smaller shell material that carib sea puts out it doesn't have to be live sand either some folks like crushed coral but the particle size is bigger than i like and it tends to have a lot of dust that never rinses completely out another very fine grained material is oolitic aragonite looks like small white balls and aragonite sand here's an idea of the materials available http www caribsea com pages products dry aragonite html while it's possible to keep a marine tank with regular aquarium gravel or no substrate the aragonite will keep the ph from falling below it should be figure at least a pound of substrate per gallon of volume salt mix if you're only keeping fish you can go with one of the less expensive brands of synthetic sea salt if you get any invertebrates shrimp snails crabs corals anemones etc switch to a better quality mix before you add them these cost a little more but you won't need to be using additives for the trace elements they need either hydrometer this measures the amount of salt that's dissolved inwater there are two kinds you can get one made of glass that floats on the surface more accurate but easy to break and a plastic container that has a needle that rises and falls as the amount of salt changes less accurate bubbles attaching to the needle gives false readings for fish only you want the specific gravity to read if you're keeping inverts you want it to be water testing kit minimum of ph ammonia nitrite nitrate cleaning supplies elbow length gloves gravel vacuum gallon bucket large plastic container and powerhead for mixing the salt to be done well ahead of water changes algae scraper razor blades for coraline algae and diatoms that like to attach to the glass water conditioner for removing chlorine or chloramine from your tap water unless you plan to use a reverse osmosis filter or buy ro water the following are optional but strongly suggested protein skimmer this removes dissloved and small organic materials that would normally contribute to the ammonia nitrite and nitrate in your tank not necessay for fish only tanks but will be handy if you have inverts to keep up good water quality by removing organic materials that become nutrients for algae glass cover this reduces evaporation and keeps the fish inside the tank although with a metal halide lighting system it can overheat your tank live rock this give the tank a more natural appearance provides hiding places for the fish and inverts and increases the biological filtration not to mention you get all kinds of cool critters that hitchhike into your tank you should purchase pound of pacific origin or to pounds of atlantic or carribean origin rock per gallon of tank volume the difference is that the pacific origin rock is more porous so it provides more surface area for the nitrifying bacteria to colonize so you can use less but still get the same amount of biological filtration chiller if you use metal halide lighting or the water temperature regularly gets above o for corals or anemones fish can take a little more heat you may need to invest in a chiller to keep the tank cool the water temperature should run of i'd also recommend a good reference book for saltwater tanks either of these would be a good one to start with the new marine aquarium by michael s paletta microcosm ltd isbn or the conscientious marine aquarist by robert m fenner microcosm ltd isbn some web sites you can check out for more info on keeping saltwater are the following http www peteducation com index cfm cls very basics http www

i brought a beta fish home days ago and it has stopped eating and hides all the time the first day we brought our beta home he ate pellets we're feeding him hikari betta pellets the next day he ate but today he wouldn't even look at them this isn't the first beta i've owned but it's the first one i've had trouble feeding i know they like blood worms but i thought those were only supposed to be used as a supplement so i wanted to get him used to beta pellets first could the water be the problem i had dechlorinated the water in the tank and followed all the steps you're supposed to follow to acclimate a new fish to a new tank we had also bought the fish a live plant and he spends a lot of time either hiding behind it or resting in the leaves of the plant the other thing he does is rest close to the gravel in the tank he will swim fairly actively around the tank but always heads towards a wall and swims up and down the wall of the tank with his head against the glass any suggestions ideas or is it too soon to worry i changed the water tested ammonia ph and water hardness and temperature after the water change he is much more lively but still refuses to eat the store said they only feed their fish the hikari pellets so i'm still not entirely sure why he's not eating if he's flaring the gills towards the glass it's possible he might be seeing his reflection and is stressed over the other male betta that won't go away try covering the sides of the tank even taping up paper on a temporary basis and see if this helps also do you have a heater for him their water should be between o the only other possibility i can think of here is if he's in a small tank there may be ammonia building up in the water it might be time for a water change you don't mention a filter still a good idea to use a small one but if the tank doesn't have one i'd suggest changing about of the water when you get a chance take a sample to your pet store and have them test it for ammonia and nitrite also please read the links below  Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Axolotl Fish farming Solar power Sewage treatment Thermal power station Discus (fish) Shark Hydrogen economy Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goldfish Stomach cancer Clownfish Sea-Monkey Blood (computer game) Swimming pool Sun Jumpstart 3rd Grade Ammonia Pikmin Aquarium Guinea pig Tag Shrimp farm Customs and etiquette of Japan Conker's Bad Fur Day Eutrophication Insulin Ecco the Dolphin Happy Tree Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuclear reactor Prostate cancer Electrophysiology Shen Gong Wu Autonomous building T-64 StarCraft: Uprising Animal Haibane Renmei E85 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Cocaine Platypus 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gaia Online Chicken FoxTrot Vermicompost GunZ The Duel Taboo food and drink Iron Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Cigarette Smoking Man Neopets Clown loach Nuclear power Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Floppy disk Combine (Half-Life 2) Dairy Earthworm Danio The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Characters of Naruto Hydropower Domestic rabbit Sin City Garfield Apollo 8 Refrigerator Creatures in Bionicle Philosophical skepticism Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Irrigation The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha English grammar God Emperor of Dune Technetium RuneScape quests Extreme Programming Fire fighting Biogeochemical cycle Theory of conduct Naruto jutsu Vegetarianism Hard disk Roswell UFO incident

help me with aquarium plan i want to get an aquarium any ideas how much it would all cost list of stuff i would have to do and have any problems with different fish cat problem he doesn't do much but sleep is he a problem well the price will depend on the size of the tank you get and the larger the tank the larger the equipment that you'll need for it i would suggest getting at least a gallon or a since these will give you more room and let you get more or larger types of fish you'll also need a filter gravel lights and maybe a heater depending on the types of fish you want if you look in walmart they have aquarium kits in a variety of sizes and these include a tank light and filter for less than you'd get them separately or in a pet store you'll also have to consider the price of water treatment to remove chlorine chloramine find out which your water provider uses so you buy the right product a net a gravel vacuum fish food and of course the fish and any decorations you want for the tank to see some ideas of what types of fish can go together and if they need a heater or not see the community suggestions in this link http www elmersaquarium com h elmers freshwater handbook htm note that some fish should be kept in groups of their own kind even though there might be other fish in their tank or in a tank with only the one species here's another two links with information about keeping an aquarium and what you'll need to do to set it up and maintain it http www fishlore com http www firsttankguide net  Aquarium Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Reef tank Autonomous building Fish farming Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Biodiesel Fish Fishing E85 Brewery Thermal power station Dairy Zebra Danio Solar power Crayfish Water purification Goldfish HTML World Wide Web Common Unix Printing System Domestic rabbit Tank classification Alcohol fuel Hydrogen economy Lifeboat Domain Name System Airport Gmail Tank Illegal drug trade Clownfish Jellyfish Uniform Resource Locator Emergency preparedness Welding Wal-Mart Cruising (maritime) Japanese tea ceremony Salmon Basement Cross site scripting Hamster HTTP cookie Halfbeak Coffee Hash table Axolotl Koi Water heater Live-bearing aquarium fish Rail terminology Microeconomics Krill Thermostat Representational State Transfer Lighting Ferret Digital photography Solar panel HyperText Transfer Protocol Gas metal arc welding Nuclear power Pet Antarctic krill Biodiversity Dry cleaning Mattress Bulk vending Brackish water Fishery Octopus Water supply Angling Yacht Tlingit Carburetor Cyanide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuttlefish Diving cylinder Refrigerator Monterey Bay Aquarium Kissing gourami Clown loach Synthesizer Shedd Aquarium Ecology

why did my large two year old angelfish die i just started a new gallon tank a week and a half ago and i initially put tetras to cycle it and then added four large angelfish from a different tank yesterday i added a red parrot and a gold severum and when i got home today i saw one of my angels which is about two years old dead i was wondering whether it could have been a disease or the addition of new fish or perhaps my tank is too crowded or maybe the fact that its a new tank i check all the water parameters and everything looks good any ideas also ive noticed that some of my fish have what seems to be bloodshot eyes usually one of the two eyes is redish is this normal or is it a sign of sickness thank you so much are your ammonia and nitrite levels at because if they aren't your tank isn't cycled and it sounds like ammonia poisening as for the angels they are extremly sensitive and you can't put them in an not established tank hope that helps good luck eb  Marine aquarium Ammonia Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Hydrogen economy Paul Is Dead Freshwater angelfish E85 Eutrophication Thermal power station Aquarium Fish farming Sea-Monkey Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Chinese New Year Too Short a Season (TNG episode) StarCraft: Uprising Goldfish Wine making Biogeochemical cycle STS-59 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder YuYu Hakusho Biochemistry H5N1 Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga Nitrogen Social rule Singlish Maser Nitric acid Brewery Refrigerator Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Hamster Life expectancy Carbon dioxide Betting (poker) Dyslexia Ja Rule Toyota Prius Kender Donald Rumsfeld Ron Weasley Loudspeaker Rum Tank Tidal power Paintball Microeconomics Sun Hall & Oates Mark I (tank) Pasadena, California Second Battle of El Alamein Myslovitz Equine conformation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Norway national football team Cirrhosis Timeline of alternative rock Rei Ayanami New York Giants Polycystic ovary syndrome Duesberg hypothesis Characters of Naruto Messerschmitt Bf 109 Speech synthesis GunBound Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Sharon Tate Haven (TNG episode) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) The Strangerhood Natural gas Dialysis Myxobolus cerebralis Color Naruto jutsu Kelly Clarkson USS Tunny (SS-282) Copper National Football League The Death Gate Cycle Origin of life Cyanide Tank classification Yellowstone National Park Red Hot Chili Peppers World Championship Wrestling Sodium nitrite Diseases of the honeybee Normal distribution The Shining (film) Battle of Kursk Autonomous building PID controller

if i was to boil the rocks and gravel from my fish tank would this clean kill the hairy algae of them i can't get algae eating fish as the only tank out of is my piranha one they would not live long hi jamie why do you want to clean off the algae algae are part of the natural environment of the fish they are not harmful they help to absorb some of the waste products produced by the fish and provide micronutrients for them you will never eliminate algae from your tank completely because algae are a fact of aquatic life algae are a sign of a healthy tank also as copperhead and magicman pointed out by boiling the gravel you would disturb the fine balance in your tank and thus potentially harm your fish just clean the algae from the glass with a scourer such as used for dishes and don't worry about the rest of the tank you could try to plant your tank this would look very attractive and the stronger plants would compete with the algae for nutrients so that the algae would have less chance to grow for good aquatic plants in the uk i recommend http www aquaticplants eu com index html regards chirpy  Eutrophication Biodiesel Nutrient Fish farming Veganism Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Sea-Monkey Aquarium Vegetarianism Algae Carnivorous plant Plant Agriculture Brewery Nutrition Ecology Chinook salmon Water Shrimp farm Coral reef Hydrogen economy Chlorophyta Hydroponics Autonomous building Organic farming Cyanide Photosynthesis Hamster Vitamin C Fugu Coal Energy development Dead Sea Botany Marine biology Biodiversity Aquaculture Weed control Solar power Nuclear power Diatom Water purification Healthy eating Snake Water pollution Kissing gourami Biogeochemical cycle Jute Future energy development Lake Myxobolus cerebralis Polar Bear Coffee Depleted uranium Uranium Dairy Pollution Slow sand filter bed Fertilizer Coral Omega-3 fatty acid Power station Lake Burley Griffin Water resources Lichen Weed Algal bloom Danio Antarctic krill Goldfish Tilapia Biological pest control Egg (food) Carbon dioxide Hydroelectricity Green alga Cancer Gaia theory (science) Introduced species Kosher foods Reef tank Ketchup Jellyfish Wetland Soil life Halfbeak Fishery Lobster Sugar Rice Plankton Boiling point DDT Axolotl Trophic level Frog Discus (fish) Fungus

why is my fish acting strange ok i have a gallon saltwater fish tank and i fish got to crab then i added i sargent major and a blue green chomie and they were fine to got along well and at night when i turned down the light then even sleep in the same little hiding spot but yesterday i added two chocolate chip starfish and clown fish and two of these snails that stay under the sand evey thing was going well all day then i turned the lights out for about hours and wheni came to check on them my clown fish was layin in the corner on its side and by sargent major was al most completely black and my chomie was hiding from him cuz for some reason the sargent major started bitting him after like mins every thing went back to normal and they seem to be getting alone just fine but i think that my turning the light out had sone thing todo with it so im scared to turn it back out does anyone know what could have caused this please help what's happening is that the older fish have all set up their territories and the clownfish was a newcomer and didn't have anywhere of it's own the other fish had already claimed all of the tank area all three of these fish the clown sergeant major and chromis are all from the same family of fish and they will be aggressive toward one another except for the chromis which is a peaceful species the sergeant major will probably not get along in the long term yours are probably small yet but by the time it is full grown at inches it may kill the clown or stress it so much it may not come out to eat you might try taking the sergeant major out of the tank and rearranging everything in the tank so none of it looks the same after about hour put the sergeant major back this will give the chromis and clown time to get used to the new setup and the old territories won't exist any more so the sergeant major will have to create a new one this will give all three fish a chance to have their own space there's no guarantee this will always work with saltwater fish but it seems to be a good strategy for territorial freshwater species you'll just have to keep an eye on them if they still fisht you may need to separate them permanently with a second tank or retuen one to the store it's normal for fish to change color when the lights are out this helps keep predators from being able to see them as easily some will get darker others will get pale  Marine aquarium Clownfish Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fauna of Australia Color Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Fugu Leopard Shaggy dog story Hamster Snooker Wheel of Fortune RISC Shark Crocodile Clown loach CPU cache Aquarium Milton H.

answer it answer i just bot a gallon starter kit from petco i have a gallon with bio wheel filter a heater lbs sand lbs of live rock a back ground for the tank a tank light chemechls bio coat helps maintain ph level stress relife for fish hydro meterit has the right ph level marine flakes fake plants one reaches to the surface of the water and the other one is under water a net and i want to no if their is anything alse i need because im going to get fish by the way i did not put it in all in at once little by little ps their is a starfish living in it its tiny i dont know what kind it is it came with the sand it is saltwater i would be a help if people contiue to answer you should get about or so more lbs of live rock the rule of thumb for a marine tank is lbs of live rock per gallon you should get a master test kit for ph amonia nitrite and nitrate the live rock and live sand will help maintain the ph at the right level as for fish i would reccomend green chromis get like of them and they are great fish to cycle the tank with gallons isnt much and green chromis wont be able to stay in there for their entire lives but once the tank has cycled most places will take them back so you can get nicer fish that you will want on a more long term basis they are very hardy and arent agressive so if it were a larger tank id say keep them but im sure you had other fish in mind you will want more live rock and i like having a lot of little pieces so you have more surface area in the tank when the tank is almost through cycling you will get algae blooms and thats where the surface area will pay off and it also allows better water flow through the rocks there is a lot to know about marine aquariums and id be happy to help so if you have any other questions feel free to email me oh and do yourself a favor and stay away from damsels especially if they dont take fish back after your tank cycles they are extremely agressive and make it near impossible to add any delicate fish in the future addition there are many little things living in there that you havent discovered yet they hitch hike there way into the system via the live rock and live sand no need to worry these creatures are harmless for the most part it is important however to get familiar with anything new you find in the tank for some may be condisered parasitic you will find worms of many shapes and sizes and a list of many other things growing in the tank the best thing do is not freak out and try a sundry assortment of chemicals to erradicate them all befor iding them most of these thing will be beneficial to the system the worms will provide food for some species of fish that you may keep and they also stir up the sand bed which is good to keep a healthy tank again feel free to email me if you have any questions or concerns you will have problems that will arrise and there are always methods of dealing with them hope this helped and good luck  Aquarium Sewage treatment Fish farming Reef tank Eutrophication Marine biology Sea-Monkey Plankton Brewery Ecology Biodiesel Shrimp farm Biology Tank Shark Carbon dioxide Sandworm (Dune) Biogeochemical cycle E85 Coral reef Antarctic krill Hamster Sea star Cyanide Chlorophyta Water purification Flood geology Paragliding Fish Tilapia Discus (fish) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Carnivorous plant Microeconomics Algae Thermal power station GunBound Hydrogen economy Earthworm Opportunity rover Fossil fuel power plant Dairy Surtsey Energy development Seabird Cannabis cultivation God Emperor of Dune Krill Biological pest control Malaria Ozone depletion Myxobolus cerebralis Hydroponics Water Geology of the Grand Canyon area Environmental concerns with electricity generation Sant Thakar Singh Impact crater Great Lakes Hemp Aquaculture Houseplant Bioluminescence Clownfish Ozone hole Economy of the United States Glacier Soil life The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Glass Angling Concrete Fishing Swimming pool Diatom 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Species Infantilism Water (molecule) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Casting Corrosion Botany Vermicompost Solar power Stopping e-mail abuse Shen Gong Wu Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME BZFlag Exploration of Mars

nematodes in fishtank i'm assuming they are nematodes from what i've researced on the internet i own a gallon freshwater fishtank with mystery snail guppies sailfin molly noticed little white worm like things swimming around they stick to the glass they're making the tank look horrible i've cut back on how much i feed them but after a week of doing that they are still there do these hurt the fish at all and is there anything i can do our buy to get rid of them actually i have the same problem in my gallon i think what you're looking at are larvae of some sort of fly if they are staying close to the gravel and swim with a squirming snake like motion that's probably the case my fish have been living with them in the tank for a few days now and none of my fish are sick i never see them going after my fish and my fish never have them hanging off of them and when i stir up the gravel they eat them if you want to get rid of them i'm sure any sort of parasitic medication would do the trick but since they are harmless just vacumming them up when you clean your gravel and letting the fish eat them would be fine edit after doing a little research i found that these could well be nematodes after all i now believe that's what i have in my tank too don't worry they are still harmless unless you have fish eggs in the tank and all your fish are livebearers i got a link for you to read up on them http www kokosgoldfish com nematodesandplanaria html  Roundworm Marine aquarium Snake Sailfin Molly Live-bearing aquarium fish Aquarium Fish farming Animal Atlantic herring Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Snail Schistosomiasis Animals in space Discus (fish) Spyware Biological pest control Halfbeak Salmon Eel life history HyperText Transfer Protocol Cantonese cuisine The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Computer virus Coconut crab Hematophagy Chicken StarCraft: Uprising Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Krill Lamprey Caenorhabditis elegans Foodborne illness Conker's Bad Fur Day Camp Lazlo Gar Conspiracy (TNG episode) Myxobolus cerebralis Danio Fly fishing Insulin Diphyllobothriasis Aerial (dance move) Aspidogastrea Killifish Goldfish Mosquito Happy Tree Friends The Adventures of Pete & Pete RuneScape economy Cruising (maritime) Ascariasis Digenea Oily fish Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Egg (biology) Diving Sea serpent Tag Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pysanka The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases The Life and Times of Juniper Lee World Wide Web Clownfish Rocky Mountain spotted fever Aquaculture Fauna of Australia Cobia Moon Jelly Brewery Frog Russian joke Goby Characters of Naruto Spidey Super Stories Platypus The Subtle Knife Tlingit Bat Anopheles Infantilism Zebra Danio Little Shop of Horrors Dracunculiasis Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Timon and Pumbaa Tick Leech Advance fee fraud Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Taboo food and drink Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Wildhearts Axolotl

any aquarium experts i have just bought a cold water aquarium small ltrs introduced my first fish a betta splended saimese fighting fish please can anyone advise which other fish are suitable to live with him preferably coldwater fish thanks i'm honestly not sure why you were being told to house your male betta with other betta's because that is a recipe for death betta's cannot be housed with other betta's from a male's prespective you could house more then one female togeather but male betta's cannot be housed with other betta's period there are other fish you could add that would not cause over crowding as well white clouds are a good solid option some tetra's could work just research them for being fin nippers cory catfish will stay on the bottom and not disturb your betta much you have alot of options here really and what you want to focus your attention on are two things really avoid fish that have long flowing fins or tails a male betta may mistake that as another male and become aggressive towards it and two consider the adult size of fish you want to add if they go over to inches they would not do well in your tank if you need further help you can get better answers at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile and yes the others are correct that your betta is a tropical fish which means you need to keep him in a heated filtered tank jv  Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Aquarium Marine aquarium Discus (fish) Zebra Danio Gar Clownfish Halfbeak Fish American lobster Tilapia Brewery Shrimp farm Danio Corydoras Reef tank Thermal power station Dwarf gourami Moorish Idol Sea-Monkey Autonomous building Stingray Orca Catfish Hamster Parrotfish Bottlenose Dolphin Fin Whale Whale shark Whale Koi Kissing gourami Floppy disk Marine biology Sailfin Molly Goldfish Sewage treatment Water (molecule) Suckermouth Catfish Fishing Axolotl Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Octopus Goby Grunion Conker's Bad Fur Day Light-emitting diode Krill Cyanide Characiformes Poker jargon Green swordtail Fish farming Clown loach Seahorse Freshwater angelfish Cuisine of Brazil Humpback Whale Sawfish (fish) Fangtooth Seismic retrofit Neon tetra Crayfish Kosher foods Great White Shark Murray Cod French fries Solar power Atlantic herring Loch Ness Monster Oceanic Whitetip Shark Wheel of Fortune Fish anatomy Oscar (fish) Heat Link (Legend of Zelda) House Mouse Beluga Fugu Lake Muskellunge Jack Dempsey (fish) Shedd Aquarium Social rule Sexual selection Gray Wolf Carbon dioxide Hydraulic machinery Transmission Control Protocol Dairy Furnace Water Antarctic krill Cardinal tetra Internet troll Tarantula Leatherback Sea Turtle Angel shark Carburetor

how do you make soft water hard in an aquarium the best way is to not do it odds are very good your water hardness is fine for your fish and adjusting it will only stress the fish also remember if you increase the hardness in the tank significantly you will have to match that when you do water changes in case you really do need to alter the hardness a bit of crushed coral in the filter is a good way to have a slow steady and low stress increase in hardness of course increasing hardness will also increase ph mm  Marine aquarium Aquarium Coral reef Reef tank Mattress Discus (fish) Equine conformation Water purification Hard disk Jet engine Wetland Thermal power station Wood Goldfish Brewery MP3 Motorcycle Anchor Fish farming Internal ballistics Shrimp farm Poker jargon E85 Knife 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Fish Autonomous building Drill bit Blackjack Ich Carburetor Octopus Tank Clownfish Terminal ballistics Liquid crystal Illegal drug trade Osmosis Economy of Russia Angling Cyanide Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Unemployment Wind turbine Goby Carbon dioxide Tofu Galileo spacecraft Handloading Coral Glass Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Georgia Aquarium Seismic retrofit Finding Nemo Shedd Aquarium Clown loach Nuclear reactor Brazing Tai Chi Chuan PID controller ELO rating system Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Dam Sea level rise Fishing Welding Sewage treatment Antarctic krill Electrophysiology Indian Oil Cup 2005 Car handling Coffee Murder Freshwater angelfish Carbon steel Kissing gourami Vowel Soldering Bicycle helmet Cocaine Homeostasis Monetary policy Uranium Decompression sickness Nuclear power Propeller Phase-locked loop Halfbeak Aluminium RuneScape economy Dead Sea Table saw Analog-to-digital converter Great Barrier Reef Loudspeaker Inflation Phase-shift keying

hi what are the differences between male and female black more fish like goldfish well sexing young and juvenile goldfish is virtually impossible you have to wait until the fish reach breeding age which is usually around one year old moreover sexing adult goldfish out of the breeding season is difficult because the sexually distinguishing features only develop during the breeding season in the spring time but if you want to try to determine the sex during the breeding season males develop breeding tubercles white pimples on the gill covers and on the leading edge of the pectoral fins and females will have a larger convex vent just before the anal fin here is a link with pictures that can help you with identfication otherwise just in general about the only thing that maybe might tell the difference is that females tend to have a larger round body than males  Fish anatomy Goldfish Age of consent Platypus Sexual dimorphism Sexual differentiation Spider Humpback Whale Shark Gender Sexual attraction Tetrapod Red Squirrel Orgasm Zeidae Oarfish Murray Cod Parrotfish Perch Species Barreleye Strap-on dildo Sexual selection Human sexual behavior Intersexuality Condom Puberty Australian bass Lion Sex Atlantic herring Capercaillie Sex organ Marine angelfish Batoidea Reproduction Anal sex Opah Humerus Lanternfish Child sexuality Koi Macquarie Perch Gender identity Kissing gourami Golden Perch Equine conformation Oceanic Whitetip Shark Aphid Yellow Gharial Nile crocodile Liger Moorish Idol Non-human animal sexuality Bottlenose Dolphin Angler Breast Bisexuality Discus (fish) Motion picture rating system Clownfish House Mouse CPU cache Grass carp Man Gender role Mallard Subspecies Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prowfish Kakapo Bird Striptease Hermaphrodite Sexual fantasy Group sex Mixed-breed dog Pineconefish Physical attractiveness Mountain Gorilla Musk Duck Whitebait Dragonet Albatross Penis Shrimp farm Mandible Biology and sexual orientation Gray Wolf Sexual reproduction Black sea bass Sexual intercourse M16 (rifle) Cheetah X chromosome Homosexuality and transgender Australian salmon Roseate Tern Whale shark

is it easy to breed bettas i just wanted to about breeding them and i am not just trying to do it i already know a lot about them just wanted to know a little more it's neither really hard nor the easiest fish to breed but like many other things it's all in the preplanning and how much research you do before you start i've been breeding bettas for over years and this is what works for me breeding tank a gallon makes a good breeding tank for bettas place in on a dark surface and set it up with no gravel or decorations use a small sponge filter and a heater maintain the heat at the temperature is not really that critical using a hood is a good idea to hold in heat and moisture conditioning condition the male in the breeding tank condition the female in a separate tank and be sure they cannot see each other feed well on frozen or live foods alternating with flakes or pellets for at least a week the female should be plump with eggs and the male should be flaring and showing his best color maybe even building a bubble nest spawning drop the water level in the breeding tank to about deep place the female in a bowl or other container next to the breeding tank so that the male can see her as soon as there is a good bubble nest in the breeding tank add the female check for eggs in the bubble nest every few hours you know they are finished when the female is hiding from the male and he no longer leaves the nest to chase her down he will also not be trying to attract her to the nest at this time remove the female from the breeding tank if they fail to breed within a few hours go back and repeat the conditioning steps for a week eggs and fry the eggs will hatch in days at first the male will collect the babies and return them to the bubble nest this is normal once you see that the babes are able to swim in a normal fashion remove the male now is the time to start feeding the babies feed them newly hatched brine shrimp micro worms or vinegar eels feed several times a day for the first week to days at that time you can start adding some powdered flake food to their diet and begin increasing the water level in the tank care the babies need very clean water do a or more water change every day and be sure to remove any uneaten food or dead babies that you see keeping the water clean and changed very often is one of the major keys to success be sure you cull the brood culling is to remove unwanted fish remove any deformed fish right away and destroy them rearing and selection eventually you will need to split the batch as they will over crowd the gallon removing the females to another tank is the best way the males can stay together without a problem continue to feed quality foods of increasing size working your way up to frozen or adult brine shrimp and continue to do large daily water changes once they begin to develop color you should cull based on color keep the color you like and remove the rest even if you started with two reds you will get a few that are not red or are not evenly colored if they are near adult size a shop should buy them from you or at least give you some store credit be ruthless keep only the very best to breed with next time around the males can stay together basically for their entire lives as long as you never separate them once separated even for a day they will begin to fight so keep that in mind best of luck and stick with it you'll have baby betta before you know it mm  Sea-Monkey Brewery Goldfish Chicken Marine aquarium Dairy Aquarium Platypus Tilapia Salmon Clownfish Shrimp farm Diseases of the honeybee Discus (fish) Seabird Dwarf gourami Thermal power station Fish farming Krill Hamster Tofu Capercaillie Sewage treatment Kakapo Albatross Tag Domestic rabbit Autonomous building Zerg Carbon dioxide Carburetor Casting Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Emu Milk Elephant Axolotl Fancy rat Antarctic krill Explosive material Halfbeak Bong Livestock Bread Gypsy moth Leatherback Sea Turtle Japanese toilet Anopheles Dog Musk Duck Solar power Life in the Freezer E85 Extreme Programming Equine conformation Pet skunk Cheese Ant Vermicompost Redundant array of independent disks Coffee USS Tunny (SS-282) Compiler optimization Handloading Hemp Mountain Gorilla Domesticated turkey Welding Water (molecule) Gas metal arc welding Cantonese cuisine Food preservation Fishing Fossil fuel power plant Zebra Danio Kosher foods Terran (StarCraft) Soap bubble Poker jargon Blood (computer game) Japanese cuisine Items in the Metroid series Tarantula Water Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Korean cuisine Fugu Internal ballistics BZFlag Knife

what is the minimum size of tank for breeding clownfish i will no longer ask this question if you give me the right answer i can't find it on the internet thanx depends on what species of clown if you get percula clownfish same as ocellaris just perculas are born in captivity you can get away with a gallon tank from all of your previous posts i know this is the fish you are thinking of if you want to have success breeding them you will have to buy a breeding pair clownfish for the most part only have one mate for their life so just buying a male and female doesnt mean they will breed if you buy a breeding pair you know these fish have already had babies together so you know they should mate again i would also reccomend not having any other fish in the tank this way they feel comfortable to breed and not feel there are any predators once they do have the babies you will need a seperate tank to house the parents in or the babies so the babies do not get eaten here is a site that may put you in the right direction read it and do more research on your own everyone does things differently and you will have to find what works for you and dont get discouraged if thiongs dont work out the way you planned http www reefsuk org articles captivebreeding breedclownfish php  Clownfish Percula Clownfish Platypus Bird Biology Species Marine aquarium Symbiosis Red Squirrel Goldfish Extinction Cat Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Lion Leatherback Sea Turtle Infantilism God Emperor of Dune Domain Name System Sea anemone Aquarium House Mouse Fugu Tigon Albatross Kakapo Seabird Sexual selection Non-human animal sexuality Atomic Kitten Uniform Resource Locator Breastfeeding Mosquito Advanced Squad Leader Finding Nemo PHP HyperText Transfer Protocol Shark Ant Cheetah Liger Panthera hybrid Milk Koala Anopheles Nerpa Beetle Tasmanian Devil Coconut crab Animal communication Friends Fish farming Sexual dimorphism Dairy Eugenics The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sea-Monkey Poker jargon Spider Pok__mon Gold and Silver Hybrid Biodiesel Hamster Extreme Programming Internet troll Emu Dolphin Salmon Deer Eusociality Rei Ayanami Garter snake Metroid (video game species) Giant Panda Halfbeak Domestication American Black Bear Elephant Rhea (bird) Orca Aphid Baboon Dragons (Pern) Murray Cod Mallard Heretics of Dune Agriculture Marine biology Artificial selection Falconry Anthroposophy Life in the Freezer Genetic algorithm Great White Shark Krill Graduate school Fauna of Australia Mountain Gorilla

how much does it usually cost for an add on filter okay i have two goldfish sharing a tank but there isn't a filter built in can you buy one that could some how connect to the tank hi natalie yes you could get a small filter maybe an internal or hob hang on the back type but a filter for your a half gallon tank with goldfish will not be the answer they will get stunted die prematurely in such a confined space no matter how well it is filtered i would suggest you invest in a gallon lidded tank with a filter while i realise this may well cost more than you initially wanted to pay it will pay for itself in no time as constantly upgrading to keep your fish comfortable would have cost you infinitely more over time the link below should help you  Aquarium Goldfish Autonomous building Brewery SCO-Linux controversies Air New Zealand Marine aquarium Low-pass filter Reef tank Mutual fund Space Shuttle program Many-worlds interpretation F-16 Fighting Falcon Digital Subscriber Line E85 Dairy Water supply Sewage treatment Hydrogen economy Sea-Monkey Life insurance Depleted uranium Microeconomics Capital accumulation Zerg P-47 Thunderbolt Bloom filter Biodiesel Samuel Goldwyn Floppy disk Gross domestic product Tax Digital filter Monk (TV series) Analog-to-digital converter Surplus value Modem Mark I (tank) Tank Mikoyan MiG-29 Kalman filter Rise of Nations Paintball T-72 Mac OS X Fish farming Discus (fish) Synthesizer Panama Canal Call centre Axolotl Hard disk Stereoscopy Ford Motor Company Firewall (networking) Laptop High-voltage direct current Polarization Dry cleaning Siegfried Line White noise Neopets Hyperreal number Protoss Dodge Charger Operational amplifier Windows XP Thermal power station Gas turbine-electric locomotive Filling station Gmail Fire fighting Hydraulic machinery Alcohol fuel Law of value Airbus A320 Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 T-64 NTFS Maser Webmail Cable television Digital photography Stock Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Digital signal processing Common Unix Printing System Motor oil Spam (electronic) S__CAM National Kidney Foundation Singapore BZFlag Electronic amplifier Wavelet Textile manufacturing Outsourcing Singlish Anti-aliasing Windows 2000

problem with dead filter any help i just realized my filters dead it doesn't filter the water it just runs over the top of the charcoal and sponge i'm getting a new filter this afternoon as soon as i can its an aquaclear mini and i've been having problems with it for weeks i looked it up on the internet and the warrenty is only for two years and i've had it forever the motor still runs but it doesn't work anymore my problem is that since my filter wasn't working my tank looked dirty so i decided to clean it i've just realized its dead after i put all my fish in a pot and started taking the gravel out to clean it i knocked up all the fish poo so the water looks like mud and clearly i can't put my fish back i have three black phantom tetras and a pleco in my gallon tank any suggestions on how to get the filter to work best course of action i didn't have the best luck with my last fish question but i'm going to try again please no stupid one word answers you should be using a gravel vacuum weekly to change of your water and suck the dirt out of the gravel even if you have a filter you should never move your fish out of the tank or totally empty it to clean this is very stressful for them if you haven't been doing this that is why your tank is so dirty and you need to start it will be much better for your fish so you should get a gravel vacuum about dollars at the same time as your new filter if you don't know about cycling your tank try reading this as well http www worldcichlids com faqs cycling html  Vacuum cleaner Dry cleaning Brewery E85 2000 Australian Grand Prix Marine aquarium Common Unix Printing System Carburetor Gmail Kenny McCormick Biodiesel Jumpstart 3rd Grade Motorcycle Joke Kodocha Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Conker's Bad Fur Day Two-stroke cycle Kitchen The Best Page in the Universe Dialysis Discus (fish) EastEnders Characters in the Smurfs Social rule GunBound Oh My Goddess!
