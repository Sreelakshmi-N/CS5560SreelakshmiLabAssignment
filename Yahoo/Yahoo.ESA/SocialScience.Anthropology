which historical civilisation do you think would have been the best influence in human societal development we undoubtedly have advanced technologically but that was always a given to happen in my view it's open to question whether we have developed in any area as quickly and efficiently as would have been possible if western nations hadn't been so influenced by feudal roman christian dominance even today most western govts pay mere lip service to true democracy there were several ancient civilisations that i would say were more progressive than our current model many developed early versions of complex technology too who knows what they'd have achieved by now sadly i must debug and reformat my pc won't be around much over the next couple of days looking forward to reading any replies tho heh think we may share similar values bill progressive societies to me are egalatarian promoting fairness availabitity of real opportunities for all knowledge seeking don't live unsustainable lifestyles at the expense of the pain and suffering of others don't tolerate preemptive wars i could go on any society is only as good as the treatment of it's poorest inhabitant shows yes the indus civilisation is one i value very highly too must stop being distracted and sort out my pc many excellent answers on this post the answers from the bill monarch butterfly pataodelamuerte and civis romanus really stood out to me love the sn monarch butterfly and excellent choice of civilisations our main knowledge of the indus is from archaeological evidence but it is considerable enough to be considered pretty accurate i'll check out which informative links i have are generally accessible and post them in the near future the celts were not a particularly bloodthirsty people and were highly progressive i like them very much you might want to check out a couple of my previous posts the sumerians fascinate me too pataodelamuerte they certainly do seem to have had defensive fortifications but unlikely they were a militaristic people great answer your answer shows a lovely way of thinking civus romanus but so many of those achievements were made at the expense of pain and suffering in so many most seem unaware that greek civilisation was heavily influenced by the far more progressive and egalitarian minoan palace civilisation democracy love of art and culture etc is likely to have it's roots in minoan ideas and spread into mainland greece via the mycenaeans the ancient indus civilisation of around bc an advanced urban culture with town planning local government public baths hygiene and sanitation systems sewage wells courtyards laid out towns but unlike its contemporary cultures of mesopotamia and ancient egypt there is no evidence of large monumental structures no evidence of kings armies or priests these indus civilisation cities were notable for their apparent egalitarianism the people seem to have lived together in harmony with one another to a far greater extent than their neighbours so how do you measure progressive  Sociocultural evolution Minoan civilization Ancient Greece Celt Conservatism History of the World Art in Ancient Greece Western world Capitalism Ancient warfare Ancient Egypt Byzantine Empire Democracy Liberalism Anthroposophy Indo-Aryan migration History of technology State History of India Human Architectural history Archaeology Education Architecture Public policy History of Europe Maya civilization Meaning of life China Technology Coercion Republicanism Sacrifice John Wycliffe History of medicine Brave New World Prehistoric Europe History of British society Europe Primitive accumulation of capital Culture Afrocentrism Taoism Microeconomics Bosniaks Persian Empire Karl Popper Religion Military history of the Roman Empire History of the Levant Writing Philosophy Greek language Indigenous peoples Sassanid dynasty Goodness and value theory Academia Republic Roman law Prehistoric Britain Numerology Rudolf Steiner Economy of India Wealth British monarchy Jacobo Arenas Objectivist philosophy Pharisees City Mycenae Social justice World government American Conservatism Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Black (people) Head of state Medicine History of Athens Chariot Separation of church and state Opus Dei Libertarian socialism Roman Empire Stone Age Law of value Young Earth creationism The Culture Left-wing politics

do you think islamic terrorists and bombers are sexually deprived here is my theory i think it has to do with polygamy in most islamic countries originally due to infighting among tribes a sufficient no of male members used to die and polygamy was used as a way to protect women as single women were prone to rape and molestation if they were single however in the present scenario this leads to an excess of men e g this is a hypothetical situation if there are a men and women men marry women each this leaves men furthermore in the next generation there are again men and women the earlier men marry more women each leaving men without partners in most islamic countries a man is allowed to marry atleast times if not more no to these sexually depraved men the idea of virgins waiting in heaven by dying for islam must sound very tempting i think you need to re think your theory  Polygamy Marriage Polygyny Monogamy Domestic violence Feminist movement Plural marriage Religion and sexuality Sexual abstinence Sharia Original sin Same-sex marriage Honor killing History of sex Bisexuality Liberal movements within Islam Women in Islam Homosexuality and Islam Polyamory Islamic view of marriage Democracy Role of women in Judaism Virgin Feminism Pornography in Japan Sexual intercourse Child sexual abuse Age of consent Sexual orientation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pornography Demon Concubinage History of feminism Condom Bah__'u'll__h's family Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Human sexual behavior Human sexuality Age disparity in sexual relationships Lot (Biblical) Rape Adam and Eve Five Pillars of Islam Pedophilia Birth control Group sex Artificial selection Mormonism and Judaism Sexuality in Christian demonology Andrea Dworkin Isa Interpersonal relationship Big Bang Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Book of Mormon Christian view of marriage Sodom and Gomorrah Theodicy Consensual crime Castration Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Masturbation Gender role Orgasm Terrorism Soul The Handmaid's Tale Origin belief Anorgasmia Lawrence v.

why are there different races of people wht are asin people brown and white people white or black people ect we are all one race human or homosepien now our difference in the apperance of ethnic groups has merely to do with the adaptations that our ancestors developed while they were evolving the sun gives off vitamin d today vitamin d is added to our milk but in ancient times the only way to get vitamin d was to absorb it through the skin in places like africa where the sun is always out people developed pigmentation mellanin so as to stop the absorbtion of vitamin d too much of anything is bad but as humans went north and the sun was scarce places like england and russia they began to loose the mellanin because any mellanin might cause them to miss out on the vitamin d that only the sun provides so their skins became lighter our skin colors have to do with survival in different environments and nothing more  Melanin Hair color Skin White (people) Vitamin D Race Retinol Sunlight Tocopherol Human Black supremacy Ultraviolet Tuatara Sunscreen Pigment Dragon Booster Zinc Race and intelligence Race of Jesus Potato Color Caucasian race Black Milk Cyanocobalamin Lamanite Vitamin Complexion Light Horse Evolution Turkic peoples Veganism Albinism Stone Age Folic acid Leopard Eye color Riboflavin Color theory Nutrition Racism Miscegenation Chlorophyll Rice Egg (food) Vegetarian nutrition Ethnic group Fecal incontinence Lutein Tofu Common bean Color metaphors for race Race (U.S. Census) Tibetan people Scar Sociocultural evolution Blacks and Mormonism Pasteurization Cat Indigenous peoples Genetically modified food Bodybuilding Paint Garlic Race (historical definitions) White nationalism Vitamin K Cobalt Multiracial Hamster Clothing Blond Validity of human races Beet Aryan race Titanium Rickets Color blindness Afrocentrism African American Cheetah Bomberman Vitamin C Bacon Polar Bear Celt Vegetarianism Thermoregulation White Psoriasis Scurvy Iris (anatomy) Mongoloid Malignant melanoma White separatism Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races)

in what way does the power of man in silence get to be manifested if you are a man how can you show your power through silence i assume that man stands for mankind here i will also assume that this question although in the anthropology section does not require any specific cross cultural examination or any other cultural mention for that matter using some of anthropology's perspectives we can say that silence is used by cultures to communicate honor and celebrate the power of mankind rituals of silence codes of silence all promotes silence as the path to enlightnment as an example the entered apprentice mason is informed that masonic tradition requires that he refrains from speaking while the lodge is at work by doing so he is taught his first secret in masonry which is that by being silent while his senior brothers speak he may discover what is more important to listen by doing so he will need to submit his passions and he will eventually improve himself in masonry  Freemasonry Ordo Templi Orientis Endowment (Mormonism) Rosicrucian Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Anthropology Franz Boas Eucharist Prophet Roman Catholic Church Music Eastern Orthodox Church Ludwig Wittgenstein Sub-Zero Human York Rite Magic (paranormal) Religion Carlos Castaneda Leviathan (book) Sociocultural evolution Cultural relativism Shamanism Religious Society of Friends Mary, the mother of Jesus Second language acquisition A Course In Miracles Property (ownership right) Confucianism Evolutionism Samael Aun Weor Scottish Rite Nation of Islam Opus Dei Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plame affair Sabbath Heber C.

has any one have any knowledge of the evolution and dispersal of homo erectus what you are questioning here is not only the pylogeny of homo with a specific interest in homo erectus but also the geographical spread over this same period of time the contemporary evidence predicts that homo erectus migrated around the globe and eventually evolved into antecessor in europe which went extinct and into heidelbergensis heidelbergensis is accredited with evolving into homo neanderthalensis and anatomically modern homo sapiens this same evidence suggests that homo floresiensis evolved from homo erectus independently and were able to remain successful in their south east asian environment until the arrival of homo sapiens here is a pylogeny that not only shows this relationship of evolution over time but also demonstrates this spread over geographic regions http users static freeblog hu c r i criticalbiomass files hobbit homo phylogeny jpg i'm quite happy with the way that this phylogeny shows erectus as it seems to be very consistent with the known archaeological evidence and it even includes the lesser mentioned homo floresiensis the diagram could be more clear if they also wrote erectus on the right hand side between ergaster and heidelbergensis but otherwise it is a job well done and consistant with the majority of homo phlogenies well also providing this geographic perspective here are some phylogenies that you may compare it to http www nature com nature journal v n images nature f jpg http www archaeologyinfo com images phylogeny jpg http www accessexcellence org bf bf klein slides phylofthehom gif this phyogeny here http www antiquityofman com images modetechnologies mode technologies jpg is an excerpt from a book and attempts to give a similar geographic perspective where the left side is europe the center is africa and the right is asia then there are two diagrams side by side but the one on the right has a clearly delineated sketch of homo evolution including the elongated perseverance of erectus in asia but without specifying homo floresiensis as the end of the line of asian erectus evolution before being replaced by homo sapiens some other phyogenies rearrange it a bit or create different classifications for some fossil findings this example replaces heidlebergensis with african archaics and eurasian archaics http content answers com main content img mcgrawhill encyclopedia images ce fg gif this change obviously effects what homo erectus supposedly evolves into others phylogenies completely overgeneralize and skip some offshoots and evolutionary steps all together this example does not just skip the frequently overlooked homo antecessor but also completely ignores the existence of homo heidelbergensis and its significance all together and actually makes the model look a bit funny with the large gap inbetween homo erectus and the introduction of neanderthal and sapiens http www micro utexas edu courses levin bio humanevol homo gif because of such overgeneralized phylogenies like this one christian missing link arguments are fueled but those who have a better knowledge of the archaeological finds know that a phylogeny like this one is just oversimplified anyways the first link that i provided is a good visualization of what was going on before during and after erectus including the predescessors descendants and their geographic spread truly erectus was extremely well adapted to their environments very generalized to have spread so far and in so many environments at that time besides modern homo sapiens no other homo species has found as much success as erectus  Multiregional hypothesis Stone Age Evidence of evolution Olduwan Homo heidelbergensis Single-origin hypothesis Ape Evolution Prehistoric Spain Hominidae Primate Extinction Prehistoric Europe Sociocultural evolution Milford H.

could petroglyphs be graffitti as vital as they are to exploring previous cultures and ages couldn't cave drawings be the result of civil unrest as is the graffitti of today if so what importance will the graffitti of today play in the exploration of our culture thousands of years from now yes i am sure of it most of it probably is unless it is decifered to be accounting or marking of goods and ownership there is evidence of graffitti in many ancient forms of writting all over the world and it stands to reason that petroglyphs would as well workers in egypt use to use graffitti to talk crap about or praise their work bosses romans used latin to make political statements for all we know two rival groups could have had a bit of a competition and were doing the petroglyphs to say we were here louder than the other graffitti they found there to me petroglyphs are just a another language on the path to the sophisticated ones we use to day and so logically all other written languages have examples of graffitti it seems highy probable that petroglyphs though more primitive would also be used for graffitti  Nordic Bronze Age Graffiti Petroglyph Chariot Religion Labyrinth Predynastic Egypt Middle Ages Writing Falsifiability Jacob Neusner Ancient Egypt Culture of Egypt Logic Civilization Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Urban exploration Causality Ancient history Ancient Pueblo Peoples Indus Valley Civilization Rhetoric ELO rating system Aegean civilization Chinese language Scientific method Biblical inerrancy Cultural and historical background of Jesus Greek language Shamanism Sociocultural evolution Gottfried Leibniz Democracy History of Africa Dice Prehistoric Sweden Jesus History of technology Latin alphabet Apocrypha Ancient Rome Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Money Jew Culture Bible Bayesian inference Transcontinental nation Hittites Barbarian Black (people) Philosophy of mathematics Reincarnation Bhimbetka Rock carvings at Alta Truth Claude L__vi-Strauss Acts of the Apostles British monarchy Latin Maya civilization History of Scandinavia Game Ra (board game) Economic inequality Olduwan Prehistoric Britain Shit Julius Caesar Interactive fiction Colony in Space Silk Road Cave Laws of Form Epistemology Appeal A New Kind of Science Grand Duchy of Lithuania Complexity classes P and NP Korean art Neolithic Europe Gospel of Mark Modal logic Meaning of life Expert system Minoan civilization C programming language Creationism Library of Alexandria Etruscan language Sanskrit literature SCO-Linux controversies Anarchism Greece Ancient Greece G__del's incompleteness theorem Taiwanese (linguistics) Culture of Ancient Rome Roman Empire

how many people have there been since the beginning of modern man i read a question with this same title but it was looking at it from a creationist standpoint my question is this what is the total number of human beings to ever have lived since the dawn of homo sapiens sapiens i've looked it up and found nothing maybe you'll have better luck if you feel like going through the trouble for me dear thankjesus ever i'm touched by your concern but i'm fine all right we have one little problem here the inner workings of evolution are not such that one day an archaic homo sapien is in birth and then voila out pops the first true anatomically modern homo sapien irregardless of the fact that evolution is a rather slow process however the earliest sites of anatomically modern homo sapiens date back to around years ago qufzeh and skhul in the middle east are the oldest sites to have be dated definitively at years ago but there are also sites at klasies river mouth in south africa and omo kibish in ethiopia where anatomically modern homo sapiens have been found the s african site has been dated with electron spin resonance and resulted in being classified as between and years ago and the ethiopian site was dated to years ago but the finding of a much more primitive skull in the same soil formation has led some to believe that the site had been disrupted and the finding may have come from a higher soil layer so again this site is not with certainty more recently dna evidence has suggested a starting point of or earlier and a recent discovery in ethiopia unearthed a fossilized skeleton that dates to but is still be debated as to if it is an archaic homo sapien or a true anatomically modern homo sapien anyways years ago is as good a date as any for the beginning of anatomically modern homo sapiens but given the fact that the change would have been gradual you could easily put behind that to account for this evolutionary change to have occured in full and to account for our uncertainty in our original period of speciation from archaic homo sapiens so if the earth's history were put into a large book with each page representing million years making the book pages long then that gradual change and the first fully anatomically modern homo sapien would be written down as taking his first step and walking on the face of the earth at the bottom of the last page now that we have pegged the date of homo sapiens emergence at years ago you also want to estimate a head count for all mankind truly this is not possible looking at mitrochondrial dna for instance it is evident that there was a bottle neck in the human population years ago such that the reproductively involved individuals assumingly all that were present would have been no greater then individuals one hypothesis to account for this is the eruption of the toba supervolcano in sumatra indonesia who's impending ash cloud and sulphuric acid rain had a catastrophic effect on the african continent thus reducing the number of humans present at that point and also resulted in a year long ice age at that one squeezed point on human development it is possible to estimate our population because of the extreme restriction that was put on our gene pool but other less destructive events can not be estimated the years since were also marked with an ice age between and years ago and even a mini ice age that started in ad that resulted in famine and death throughout medival europe so considering that our population was truly not a linear progression the numbers can not truly be estimated accurately if anyone was to produce a number they would be lying at best because there is truly no way to know all the past variables or to know how they would have effected our human population i hope all of this helps  Cradle of Humanity Human migration Olduwan Macroevolution Flood geology Human extinction Single-origin hypothesis Homo floresiensis Natural disaster Homo (genus) Stone Age Prehistoric Britain Evidence of evolution Origin of language Biodiversity Ape Famine Creationism Human skin color Climate change Multiregional hypothesis Volcano Cro-Magnon man Mungo Man Creation science Homo erectus History of evolutionary thought Created kind Sea level rise Mount Pinatubo Ozone hole Fermi paradox History of the World Indo-Aryan migration History of Africa Young Earth creationism Effects of global warming Solar system Ice age 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Archaeology Global warming Impact event Supervolcano Paleoclimatology Scientific classification Neolithic Europe Origin belief Population bottleneck Creation-evolution controversy South Africa Permian-Triassic extinction event Day-Age Creationism Tyrannosaurus rex Age of the Earth Anthropology Human genome Hominidae Intelligent design Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Franz Boas Carbon dioxide The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Santorini Noah's Ark Glacier Milford H.

when did the first people settle in what is now the united states i am just curious as to how long people have been here and when the first people lived in what is now north america i realize that there have been native americans for a long time but are there any records of cro magnon men in the united states canada area what about south america first of all cro magnon is a site name that resulted in some european homo sapiens being called cro magnon cro magnon however is just another name for homo sapiens aka modern man aka humans seeing as cro magnon specifically were european homo sapiens however they really have nothing to do with migration to north america until more recent times vikings at approximately ad and then european colonialism ad previous to this european colonialism the major migration to north america occurred from north central asia during the last major ice age when the bearing straight became a land bridge this ice age period was between years ago and it was this migration that eventually radiated to fill the americas to become the dominant genealogical expression of the native american tribes some argue purely because of ethnocentrism that the clovis technology that was the major stone tool technology in the americas came from europe and show it s similarity to a french stone culture that dates back to around years ago these same scientists if i can call them that search the eastern seaboard with great zeal looking for signs of clovis technology to prove their non point the reason why i call this a non point is because the empirical evidence that is available that being the y dna mt dna evidence clearly demonstrates that the year ago migration did come form north central asia here are some links that clearly show the spread of y dna and the resulting pre colonial y dna frequencies in the americas http jewsandjoes com images ftdna migration map jpg http notavalidname files wordpress com w map gif if the migration of the clovis technology from west europe were true then the american y dna mt dna haplogroups should show at least a little of the western european haplogroup s influence yet none of the western european s predominantly r b haplogroup is represented anywhere in the pre colonial american natives the year ago migration however was not the first there have been a few archaeological sites that predate the year ago beginning of the major migration from asia or else are differential enough that have offered some clues as to there being multiple migrations into the americas one such site was that of kennewick man who s facial reconstruction offered a look at a man who looked distinctively caucasian http files blog city com files a p f kennewick man jpg http www pbs org wgbh nova first images kennewick jpg thus this initially fueled the fire of early european migration supporters the best hypothesis so far is that kennewick man is actually a relative of the ainu people of northern japan who are an ethnic group with caucasian like features much like those of kennewick many sites that have fueled these debates plus the questionable origins of clovis technology are shown on this map http www laputanlogic com images y r j jpg the evidence is not enough to predict whether all of these pre migrations and their ancestors like kennewick man are all bearing straight migrations or if some of the south american sites could even have been migrations from the south pacific oceania what is clear from the genealogical evidence however is that as the major migration of years ago spread across the americas is that they did a wholesale replacement of the previous migratory populations because the y dna and mt dna is quite purely that of this migration and not similar to either that of the ainu nor any other south pacific or asian groups that may have been a part of these earlier migrations the original dates of these earlier migrations coming to the americas is not fully know but it is suggested to be somewhere in the vicinity of years ago although sometimes you can see some obscure figures in the years thrown into the discussion i personally do not find the year ago range credible because that type of time frame would not be consistent with the spread of archaeological evidence radiating through asia and down into oceania  Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact Human

could any one help i'm sooo confused what is the difference between the multiregional model and out of africa model this question is regarding human evolution i'll make this simple as all the other answers either have minor or major flaws due to the dna evidence the current multiregional model has to imply that erectus migrated out of africa and then independantly evolved into different archaic homo sapien species all around the globe then as anatomically modern homo sapiens migrated out of africa these archaic groups were still reproductively compatible and bread into this anatomically modern homo sapien and added regional gene contributions from the archaic species the out of africa model states that these regional archaic populations were not reproductively compatible with anatomically modern homo sapiens and as of such were eventually replaced by being out competed by this new anatomically modern homo sapien that radiated out of africa this covers the models' definitions additional information the dna evidence is too consistent to ignore the fact that anatomically modern homo sapiens did evolve in africa and the discussion between multi regional vs out of africa comes down to weather or not anatomically modern homo sapiens were still reproductively compatible with the numerous archaic populations which had independantly evolved around the globe so far the bulk of the empirical evidence is pointing towards the out of africa model as being the correct one here are some maps which show the spread of y dna and mt dna based on the frequencies of haplogroups in modern populations north america and australia are based on the pre colonial indigenous populations and thus creates a pre colonial image of the spread of human genes mt dna http worldfamilies net migration map wfn gif y dna http jewsandjoes com images ftdna migration map jpg it is this dna evidence that makes it impossible to conclude that anatomically modern homo sapiens evolved independantly from different regional archaic homo sapiens groups as some of the answers that you have received have implied  Race Single-origin hypothesis Species Homo (genus) Milford H.

do you think eventually this planet will be of one homogeneous human race if were still around by then i hope not variety is cool besides there are genetic benefits for the species to having a diverse population i think we will see a lot more mixing of races in the future but we will never be all one race there are still too many primitive cultures that are more or less cut off from the modern world and even though as people become more open minded about interacial relationships even though there have always been people attracted to the exotic there will also always be people who are attracted to the familiar want to be with people who look like them hopefully it won't be too many more generations before xenophobic racists are bred out of our culture but there will still always be people who are just plain more attracted to members of their own race it will be nice when that day comes where such choices are made out of personal preference not out of hate or fear  Biodiversity Race Sexual orientation Species The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sexual attraction Black (people) Domestication Human Physical attractiveness Culture Multiracial Validity of human races Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Plant breeding Eugenics Extinction Xindi Caucasian race Chicken Science fiction film Franz Boas Heterosexuality Diversity Sigmund Freud Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) Traveller (role-playing game) Demographics of Japan Ecology Human nature Drow Pioneer Fund Insect Race (historical definitions) Sex Immigration Green Day Racism Genetic engineering Extraterrestrial life Guns, Germs, and Steel Prime Directive Sociocultural evolution Dog Exosquad characters Social psychology Asian fetish Xenophobia Reality Primate W.

when did the grey wolf's dog association with man begin some years ago i electrical engineer with grad degrees in comp sci worked with a group of biologists archeologists paleontoligists geologists mds on a project we'd meet at a local tavern on friday after work discuss subjects of interest one of these was when the grey wolf began the association with homo sapien if it was also associated with neanderthal or homo erectus because the grey wolf is not found in africa we decided the association began in the mid east spread through out the world from there this would put the association at about yrs ago the idea that the grey wolf human association appeared among differing groups about yrs ago was rejected as improbable statistically however all the current anthropology links i find tend to trumpet the more recent date we rejected the neanderthal association due to lack of supporting evidence but the wolf would have been the perfect hunting companion for a pure carnivore any links samas the dog is but a domesticated grey wolf genetically that toy poodle is a wolf because every human culture in existance has or has had dogs the association with the wolf had to have begun in the very distant past some time later the humans began to selectively breed these wolves rod thanks for the links the australian dingo once a domestic dog now displays the lack of ability to interpret human wants gestures on the same plane as wolves i enjoyed the link on east asian origin makes sense russian experiments with the artic fox indicate that canids related critters evolve toward domestication far faster than we'd predicted as they obtained domestication far more mutations than they'd predicted within a few s of generations at what point one would have considered the wolf to reach the classification of dog is probably an unresolvable question i'd still suspect a long association with the semi domesticated wolf but am at a loss as to how i'd determine facts either way cowboy doc yes we've also found evidence of canabalism in prehistoric fires bone pits i suspect some ate dogs as a food of last resort others developed a taste for dog meat caveman dna tests to date have found the grey wolf to be the sole ancestor of all domestic dogs if any other canid produced the domestic dog we've missed it therefore we have to dismiss the african wild dog the etheopian wolf as ancestors for lack of evidence fromafar sorry if i gave you the opinion that i thought no changes had taken place russians that produced the domestic artic fox did note the increased decreased production of some hormones that appeared in the domestic fox they selected kits that would play with humans rejected those that didn't we do not reclassify humans as was done with the wolf dog australian dingo canis lupus dingo when some degree of behaivior modification takes place humans have chromosomes vs the chimp has chuckle regardless of the fact that chromosome is but a fusion of chimp chromosommes humans have chromosomes vs the chimp has chuckle regardless of the fact that chromosome is but a fusion of chimp chromosomes http www whozoo org mammals carnivors canid phylogeny htm http www whozoo org mammals carnivors canid phylogeny htm sorry the link to canid phylogeny failed i can't seem to get the answers edit function to work sam rod constellation caveman fromafar thank you for bothering to answer my question i'd love to find credible evidence of a longer association between the dog sapien or one of the other lines of homonoids but other than some slim genetic information it simply doesn't exist science is like that the evidence is just what it is never what you'd like it to be i file these links answers away in hopes of eventually developing a credible hypothesis once in a great while they spawn a line of research for others to follow coop yep everyone seems to agree that the dog was the st animal domesticated by homo sapien little wonder there because due to the enhanced smell hearing it was an invaluable camp guard hunting companion all evidence seems to indicate prehistory settlers of north america brought dogs with them some interbreeding with wolves obviously happened on the journey http www pbs org evolution library i html currently scientists are having problems distinguishing definitively between wolves dogs robert k wayne colleagues are investigating this topic test on both nuclear mtdna are required depending on ancestry an animal appearing to be dog or wolf may test to be either unless an in depth analysis on all dna is done some dogs in the western hemisphere carolina dog or american dingo have a genetic trail to asian wolves others to eurasian wolves the carolina dog australian dingo are closely related one hypothesis the wolf humans domesticated each other by following hunters scavenging from the kills of the other they developed a symbiotic relationship of semi domestic association to k yrs ago dogs are not basically domesticated wolves they are genetically different dogs canis lupus familiaris were domesticated from grey wolves canis lupus i have included some links to scientific abstracts and papers demonstrating this phenomenon and will very briefly sum up some important parts first it appears that this domestication occurred in asia before human migrations to north america some genetic evidence suggests that the division may have occurred as much as years ago but archaeological evidence for man dog relationships is only from about bc and was part of the neolithic revolution one of the most interesting points and something indicating the very real difference between dogs and wolves is that domestic puppies have a better grasp of what people are doing than wolves even if the wolf has lived with people its whole life many native american groups had domesticated dogs and in some cases there is evidence that they had different kinds some for hunting guarding pets and some for eating this has been suggested for prehistoric populations in what is now new york state based on the fact that dogs buried in cemeteries are morphologically different from dogs found in trash pits dogs are also known from prehistoric sites across asia and europe beyond eurasia and the americas my knowledge is a little weak so i'll leave this here  Young Earth creationism The Descent

will humans eventually all be the same by this i mean with global travel so easy thus promoting a lot more gene flow between populations then in the past is it possible that we could just breed out all of these ethnic differences that seem to cause so much tension and become one genetically homogeneous race ok let s start from the beginning of our evolution from homo heidlebergensis evolving into the first homo sapiens this speciation would have occurred in an isolated population the group would likely have been small but still large enough to have had enough variance to maintain its health by not having too many detrimental double recessive alignments in their offspring as of such even this first group of homo sapiens would not have been homogeneous albeit they were much less heterogeneous then the human population became at it's height at pre colonial times to best describe how our modern population has experienced such a magnificent gene diversity it would be best to display a couple of diagrams which show the spread and change of our mt dna matrilineal http worldfamilies net migration map wfn gif and y dna patrilineal http jewsandjoes com images ftdna migration map jpg throughout the globe here is another diagram that shows the settling of the y dna frequencies after this initial spread http notavalidname files wordpress com w map gif i would have liked to have found you a diagram showing mt dna frequencies as well but the internet was not forth giving needless to say as the spread diagrams resemble each other the resulting frequency diagrams would be similar as well in other words the majority of the men and the women were migrating together in groups which makes sense given the cultural nature of homo sapiens as you can see from the phenotypic expression of y dna in the frequency pie charts the geographic demarcations closely resemble the racial distinctions to which i believe that you were referring to in your question and although the y dna and mt dna frequencies resemble the racial distinctions that some people like to make in fact the vast vast majority of the human genome is identical when looked at based on geographical averages and as of such the term race is actually a highly flawed term and inappropriate for describing population differences within the human race our human race is one besides this flaw in our application of the term race the human species does still exhibit phenotypic diversity that results in differential morphological expression which follows these geographic distinctions that are clearly seen in the diagrams which i have put forth of course these diagrams are pre colonial or else there would be a large arrow pointing from europe and a slightly lesser one from africa representing the genealogical flooding of europeans and their slaves into the americas as well as these european arrows pointing into australia and new zealand these post colonial arrows would be the beginning of the blending period that we will discuss later on if we were to update the y dna frequency chart to represent the modern inhabitants it would have predominantly red pie charts in the americas australia and new zealand so now to the discussion of whether the human species could experience a blending of these pie charts such that we have increased homogeneous phenotypic expression in consideration of this this is already happening to a degree while looking either at y dna mt dna on the micro scale on an individual basis or on the macro scale on the basis of overall society's y dna mt dna frequencies by micro i am referring to immigrant populations adding to the y dna and mt dna blending via the few incidences of inter ethnicity marriages resulting in offspring with blended pie charts so to speak many humans do still seek their own type in matrimony but still it only takes one inter ethnic matrimonial combination to stir up the pie chart of their offspring and their offspring's offspring etc unless it is bred out by reproducing with one predominant frequency set for many generations on the human macro scale you have societies who already represent extremely blended pie charts like those in the middle east south eastern europe and central russia on the y dna frequency diagram please look at the pie charts labeled pe uz kt and ge all of which are examples of blended y dna frequency such that the predominant y dna gene combinations from all over the globe seem to have representation within these pie charts so a blending has occurred in the middle east and central eurasia being that this area represents the major migratory corridor in our evolutionary history since a continuation of this blending is occurring globally via immigration and cross cultural marriages we will continually experience a general trend towards a more homogenous blending in our human genome although much like the original group of adam s and eve's that emerged from heidlebergensis we will never truly be homogenous no matter how blended the pie chart were to become here is an example of what a blended mt dna pie chart would appear if the human species were to become near homogeneous http www familytreedna com mtpie html but even if so much inter ethnic reproduction occurred to converge on this near homogenous case very few individuals would actually even have these exact proportions  Evidence of evolution Genetics Validity of human races Indigenous peoples Franz Boas Extinction Prehistoric Britain Molecular evolution Creationism Human migration

evolution believers if humankind evolved from apes why apes didn't continue evolving i mean if evolution is a process of time why can't we find somebody that is in the middle of the process like a man that looks like an ape because that's the thing that i don't understand you are getting confused because whilst you recognise that evolution is a process you still have a beginning a middle and an end in your question and in your thinking apes the beginning man the end you're looking for the middle the process of evolution means there is no beginning middle and end well ok there was a beginning of life but that's all the word process describes that life is always moving always changing a previous respondant answered much regarding how we split so i don't have to here just know that life is not as neatly organised as you might see in a textbook it was not that one day australopithecus gave birth to homo habilis who in turn one day gave birth to homo erectus who gave birth to homo sapiens there were a million different mutations in between from one generation to the next over a million year timespan so that eventually one individual was different enough from his age old ancestors to classify him as a different species life is a process continually changing there is no final form as a creationist might believe and now we as humans too are changing and will be if we are still around very different in years than we are now  Human Human evolution Cradle of Humanity Evolution Ape Homo erectus Homo (genus) Olduwan Homo habilis Hominidae Species Stone Age Extinction Neanderthal Homo floresiensis Australopithecus afarensis Biology Primate Created kind Anthropology Linnaean taxonomy Lower Paleolithic History of evolutionary thought The Origin of Species The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Paranthropus Race Teleological argument Walking with Cavemen Origin belief Evolutionism Meaning of life Intelligent design Nephilim Single-origin hypothesis Creationism Allan Wilson Evolutionary creationism Multiregional hypothesis God History of creationism Macroevolution Biodiversity Scientific classification Creation science Prehistoric Europe Mary Leakey Homo heidelbergensis Incertae sedis Paranthropus boisei Spiritual evolution Pak Protector Teach the Controversy Franz Boas Human migration Culture Chimpanzee Meme Creation-evolution controversy Senescence Punctuated equilibrium Human skin color Fermi paradox Anthroposophy Sociobiology Religion Thumb Stellar evolution Milford H.

did human flaccidus come before human erectus did homo flaccidus come before hom erectus no that is a common misconception due to the extreme osteological deformities found in some homo habilis groups because of excessively geographic isolation and reduced population numbers that caused excessive inbreeding and a high frequency of their stooped over appearance from a congenital disorder originally classified as homo flaccidus they are now correctly classified as homo habilis some of the earliest theories regarding this group was that because of their increased association with stone tool culture that they may have been overexerting in the construction of these stone tools but dna evidence has since shed light to these deformities being the result of an early and extreme version similar to ankylosing spondylitis in these early homo it constantly resulted in this stooped over posture and it is this that originally invigorated this incorrect naming  Homo habilis Homo erectus Cradle of Humanity Stone Age Neanderthal Olduwan Homo floresiensis Prehistoric Britain Race Single-origin hypothesis Lower Paleolithic Homo (genus) Multiregional hypothesis Paranthropus Human Origin of language Acne Species Cephalic disorder Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Ankylosing spondylitis Evolution Created kind South Africa Hominidae Prehistoric Spain Pre-historic art Welding Australopithecine Language Homo heidelbergensis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Parkinson's disease DNA repair Ape Scientific classification Milford H.

where neandrethels an early form of humans neanderthals are cousins to humans they broke off as a seperate branch not long ago relatively speaking the earliest neanderthals forms as of the latest publications looked closer to modern humans but as generations passed they began to have a much more pronounced browridge it has been hypothesized that this was an adaptation to the glare off the glaciers in the areas they lived in there was about a year period when they lived in the same regions possibly at the same time as modern humans there has been to conclusive evidence so far that i have seen that suggests that they interbred with modern humans and as they developed as contempories of homo sapien sapiens it is unlikely they were an early form there has been a lot of evidence showing neanderthals had culture they buried their dead left funerary offerings and took care of injured members of their group  Neanderthal Human evolution Prehistoric Britain Stone Age Human Homo (genus) Single-origin hypothesis Funeral Prehistoric Spain Prehistoric Europe Race Cro-Magnon man Homo erectus Homo floresiensis Multiregional hypothesis Hunter-gatherer Erik Trinkaus Upper Paleolithic Species Human extinction Homo heidelbergensis Hominidae Pre-historic art Olduwan Nephilim Human migration Extinction Created kind Indo-Aryan migration Orc Cradle of Humanity Primate Europe Autism Scientific classification History of ancient Israel and Judah Origin of language Acheulean Celt Allan Wilson Timeline of Portuguese history (Pre-Roman) Shanidar Cro Life expectancy Ice age Subspecies Bigfoot Creationism Linnaean taxonomy Ancient history History of the World Opportunity rover Ape Basque people Magneto (comics) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Day-Age Creationism Homo habilis Mutant (fictional) Meme History of Europe Death Archaeology Lower Paleolithic History of Africa Contra Costa County, California Zecharia Sitchin Mount St. Helens Prehistoric music History of China Clothing Human genome Milford H.

real archaeologists how is it really being one i know the pay isnt wonderful unless your a curator or professor but ive read all the google information but hows it really whats the most interestign thing you've found i work as a crm archaeologist in the private sector like some ninety percent of archaeologists in the us i'm on the bottom rung too alas it's huh it's intense i technically still live at my mom's house because i travel so much there's no point in getting an apartment i'll be at maybe for a month or two each year i usually live in hotels and not often in the best areas we're usually out in the boonies you're thrown into a situation where you basically live work and socialize with a fairly small group of people for a few weeks or months and then you leave them all to go elsewhere it's kinda like really short college in that way you are also almost never sure where you'll be in a week or a month which can get stressful as for work well it's nothing like what you see on tv it's days and days of not finding much at all toiling in the hot sun or freezing in the wind and snow or rain there's also a lot of paperwork that's the bad the good is that you're going to be around people with similar interests all the time you do get to see a lot of the country especially if you're willing to drive around a bit on your days off the pay isn't great but it's not dire either you work outside you do actual physical labor a plus for me but not for everyone and you meet some real characters you get instant cool points whenever you tell anyone what you do for a living although you then have to explain to them that you don't find dinosaur bones you also sometimes get those sites that make all the tedium well worth it and we get to play with fun expensive surveying equipment and do sciency stuff dealing with people if you like science hard work and people it's awesome i worked on a paleo site once where we were pulling up year old tools that was pretty kick ss i'm still looking for my jewel encrusted monkey skull or whatever the north american equivalent will be ooh bad archaeologist i messed this one up archaic site year old tools see you don't even have to be particularly smart heh  Archaeology Social rule Unemployment Theory of conduct Treehouse of Horror V Written Cantonese Rich Mullins Neanderthal Beavis and Butt-head Cruising (maritime) Archaeological field survey Avalanche Steel Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Satchel Paige Gross domestic product Pitaten True Crime: Streets of LA Education in the People's Republic of China Blood (computer game) Climate of the United Kingdom Blood on the Tracks Land use forecasting 2000 Australian Grand Prix Naruto jutsu Mountaineering Microeconomics Kodocha Law of value Discworld gods Prehistoric Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Saved by the Bell Futurama (TV series - season 2) Education in Romania Dinosaur Cro Humphrey Bogart Sant Thakar Singh Make money fast W.

what would happen if we discovered a homo sapiens fossil that was million years old first off we'd have to verify the dates scientists aren't perfect so if anyone got a date that old the first assumption would be that something got messed up along the way if you did the tests again and got them verified there'd probably be a lot of arguing it happened with meadowcroft a site in pennsylvania that pushed back the earliest human settlement dates in the us the archaeologist who dug up that was super careful and took a lot more samples than necessary because the dates he got were too old for then current theories even now there are those who will continue to argue that his dates are wrong however due to the care with which samples were pulled and due to other sites that also have early dates most scientists accept that meadowcroft was settled a thousand or two years earlier than previously thought possible so then the next step would be to get some more samples one million year old h sapiens skeleton is startling but you're still going to get people arguing with you because you can't take human error out completely two or three skeletons or fragments of skeletons and you've really got something and somewhere starting around you publishing your million year old skeleton people are going to start having to rethink human evolution theory this is probably not going to destroy evolution theory as a whole the flu bug still changes every year and the descent for other animals hasn't changed but we'd have to completely revamp how we think about the ways in which humans evolved and the rapidity with which we did so it'd be interesting and give lots of grad students plenty of things to write papers on  Human Homo floresiensis Neanderthal Evolution Human evolution Age of the Earth Archaeology Cradle of Humanity Race Creation science Neolithic Europe Human migration Dinosaur Fermi paradox Homo erectus Creation-evolution controversy Olduwan Scientific method Creationism Anthropology Debugging Death Intelligent design End of civilization Species Origin of life Stone Age Prehistoric Britain Biodiversity Human extinction Macroevolution History of evolutionary thought Evolutionism Prehistoric Europe Science Extraterrestrial life Origin of language Allan Wilson Theory of conduct Meaning of life Religion Doomsday argument Darwin from Orchids to Variation Extreme Programming Marvel Universe Supernatural Exploration of Mars Spanish flu Young Earth creationism Atomism Karl Popper RuneScape quests Teleological argument Sociocultural evolution Multiregional hypothesis Tetrapod Mathematics Human skin color Culture Single-origin hypothesis Hominidae Civilization Milford H.

why won't the evolutionist recognized the creation as god handed work the old theory was that the first and oldest species in our family tree homo habilis evolved into homo erectus which then became us homo sapiens but those two earlier species lived side by side about million years ago in parts of kenya for at least half a million years leakey and colleagues report in a paper published in thursday s issue of the journal nature well its not new we should have expect that but did not get clear evidences it was the case actually even dinosaurs evolved side by side for millions of years before being overun by the largest dino actually its not really individuals that are evolving but whole population group so it is quite normal that overlapse between different species happens in the case of habilis and erectus it happens that they were sharing a common ancestor a third unidentified specie that would have give birth to habilis in first place and erectus in second place which is kinds of odd as we are still looking for this one evolution still have a lot of secrets to uncover and science don t claim to know it all but in so far it answers many things and its much better than thinking magic as it doesn t make intelligent peoples to think that everything happen because a superior being has decided it it would be like admiting that our race don t need to think as somebody higher will do in our places this is kind of silly for me  Human evolution Homo habilis Human Species Origin of language Stone Age Extinction Neanderthal Evolution Paranthropus Single-origin hypothesis Homo (genus) Dinosaur Mary Leakey Multiregional hypothesis The Origin of Species Creation science Intelligent design Ape Created kind The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Milford H.

so evolution theory wasn't so correct after all http news yahoo com s ap ap on sc human evolution i meant that there are flaws like we didn't descend from them but we homo sapiens were around at the same time for ed the article said shows that two species of early human ancestors lived at the same time in kenya that pokes holes in the chief theory of man's early evolution that one of those species evolved from the other it is most unlikely that human ancestors existed in a vacuum most likely there were many other v similar species like monkeys today quite possible is that sub species split apart from each by eco niche and area and then even have remerged when again thrust into contact with eacah other their genetics had not diverged enough to make offspring sterile  Human evolution Extinction Human Species Evolution Ape Single-origin hypothesis Primate Race Homo erectus Origin of language The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Origin of Species Human extinction Neanderthal Hominidae Natural selection Mammal Mitochondrial Eve Multiregional hypothesis Evidence of evolution Biology Homo (genus) Homo floresiensis Olduwan Milford H.

would you be interested in meeting your direct ancestor let's say same gender as you but years older you meet each other in a time machine and are both the same age language differences translator present what would you think would happen i think most people would be interested in meeting their ancestor the real interesting question is what would you ask them if you only had a limited time since you meet in a time machine each does not get to see the world the other lives in say you had hours to talk to your ancestor from years ago in an area completely separate from the world either of you know i being an anthropologist would want to know as much about subsistence patterns material culture and religious concepts i would try to share the same types of information with them they would not know of the world in the same way i do i would try to explain how small the world had gotten how we can and do travel great distances in very small amounts of time the immense variety of languages cultures religions governments etc i would tell them of the ghastly errors we humans have made in our relations with each other and that i hope the information can change things but i doubt it would do any good i would also share one of my favorite quotes with my ancestor but we were born of risen apes not fallen angels and the apes were armed killers besides and so what shall we wonder at our murders and massacres and missiles and our irreconcilable regiments or our treaties whatever they may be worth our symphonies however seldom they may be played our peaceful acres however frequently they may be converted into battlefields our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished the miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen we are known among the stars by our poems not our corpses robert ardrey  Animism Anthropology Supernatural Human Religion Wealth A Course In Miracles Franz Boas Native Americans in the United States Evolutionism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Human evolution Culture Sexual orientation Culture of Lithuania Robert Ardrey Reality War Olduwan Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Family Hominidae Evolution Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Bigfoot God Anarcho-primitivism African American Vernacular English Rudolf Hermann Lotze Labor theory of value Second language acquisition Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Theory of conduct Serial killer Scientology beliefs and practices Economic anthropology Meme Feminism Flood geology Creationism Race Biblical inerrancy Chimpanzee Jacob Neusner Stone Age Charles Darwin Scenes from a Memory Science fiction film The Second Renaissance Leadership Creation-evolution controversy Sociology Patriotism Civil rights Historical materialism Origin belief Intellectual property Law of value Walter J.

informal and formal political systemss can someone describe both form of systems and give some comparison thanks informal tribe formal state informal political systems lack codified codes of law and government examples would be present in band and tribe level societies these groups are usually kin based and represent extended families band and gatherings of extended families usually linked by inter marriage tribes in these societies decisions are made by consensus or by an informal leader who only retains the right to lead as long as they continue to provide the services needed by the group often times for men this is a hunt leader he has the right to determine when hunting expeditions will go out what they will hunt where the hunts take place and who goes he retains this right as long a he provides meat for the group should he fail to do this or should the other hunters lose faith in him he will lose this he will lose his position and be replaced by someone who is believed more capable formal political systems are the ones most people today are more familiar with governmental structures and institutions bureaucracy offices and officers these systems have codified laws and regulated methods of conduct including the appointment election of officials these systems are present in chiefdom and state level societies examples include monarchy democracy despotism communism etc even societies such as the kung san of africa or the yanomami of south america which have informal political systems fall under formal systems of the state or states in which they live and usually have adopted at least some aspects of formal political systems to deal with the nation states  Constitution Democracy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Anarchism and society Constitution of the United Kingdom Law Election Separation of church and state Consensus decision-making Republic Federation Politics of the United States Head of state Order of succession Politics of New Zealand Direct democracy Common law President of Germany Monarchy in Canada Politics of Japan President Federal government of the United States Government of Maryland Politics of Canada Constitution of India United States Code Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) Corporate governance Politics of the People's Republic of China Leadership Parliament of Canada Liberal Democrats (UK) Marriage Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe United States House of Representatives Bah__'__ administration Politics of Hong Kong Football (soccer) Patriotism Demarchy Communist Party of China Elections in the United States Canadian and American politics compared Governor General of Canada Republicanism Fiji Public policy Law of the People's Republic of China Trade union Governor Government of Australia Bureaucracy Same-sex marriage History of British nationality law Caste Politics of Uzbekistan Politics Religious Society of Friends Prime Minister United States Constitution Commune in France Classified information Morality Politics of Italy Politics of Iraq Political subdivisions of New York State Objective-C Ethics Constitution of Ireland Copyright Workplace democracy Civil service Constitution of Iraq Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Politics of Russia History of democracy Greek military junta of 1967-1974 Kuomintang Euroscepticism Human rights Westminster System Government Military rank Political party Judicial review British nationality law Sortition Article One of the United States Constitution

do you think man is the climax of creation original opinions would be great thanks impossible what would you say if we were comparing life form humans to sexual gametes where would be the climax of creations if those sexual gametes were fertilizing each others to make a whole new complexe lifeform i guess it will be at the fertilizing stage well same on earth creations help life to conquer new areas and so far we only know one place in our universe where life exist so we may think that life on earth don t only seek to remain enclosed on the earth and as every living being seek to multiply and to multiply life needs sexual gametes strong enough to plant life on another planet we may be those sexual gametes as we look like the only specie on this planet to be capable of spreading life in a hostile environment but does that means we are the climax i don t think so i think the whole planet as a huge symbiotic system is the climax of creation and we are only its ''organ'' capable to spread life  Reproduction Meiosis Sex Sexual reproduction Gaia theory (science) Chlorophyta Flowering plant Flower Gamete Biological life cycle Created kind Cell (biology) Species Evolutionism Abortion debate Alien races in the Stargate universe Chromosome Gaia philosophy Human Sexual orientation Spore Sexual intercourse Ecology Creationism Earth Extraterrestrial life Alternative biochemistry Ploidy Goa'uld Soil life Extinction Panspermia Transformers series Fertilisation Alternation of generations Fern Xenomorph The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Intelligent design Fungus Gene Fermi paradox Flood geology Orgasm Terraforming Soils retrogression and degradation Marathon (computer game) Embryophyte Sex organ Biology Vulcan (Star Trek) Origin of life Ishmael (novel) Marine biology Three Laws of Robotics Birth control Colonisation Pollinator Human sexuality Solar system Evolution Day-Age Creationism Origin belief Coral Grey goo Creation-evolution controversy Biodiversity Douglas Adams Tyranid Original sin Cellular differentiation Global warming Plant Copulation Technology in the Stargate universe Xel'Naga Chimera (genetics) Borg Carpel Young Earth creationism Star Trek planet classifications The Origin of Species Sewage treatment Space colonization End of civilization Irreducible complexity Hermaphrodite Planet Vagina Desert Simone Weil Vorlon Bah__'__ Faith and Science Biology and sexual orientation The Culture Sponge Meaning of life Biogeochemical cycle

after generations of humans strength training will we eventually become naturally stronger since human evolve to be stronger when we require strength from other tough physical work would our bodies know the difference and evolve to become stronger naturally this only applies to the people who strength train and their kids strength train and on and on etc your example is not how evolution operates first of all when someone's muscles become larger due to being subjected to physically demanding circumstances this is not evolution this individual already has the traits to build muscle and the influence of weight lifting or intense physical labour is not actually enhancing these traits such that they experience a selective advantage in terms of reproductive success even if their children and grandchildren etc etc all continue this physical regime that promotes their own musculature development their is still no selective pressure that is causing a reproductive success and natural selection towards an increased strength in subsequent generations after many generations of such activities if one generation neglected to continue this physical regime then their muscles and skeletal robustness would only develop to their natural level of activity so all the work of their ancestors would have no residual effect towards them being stronger naturally now how does evolution work to actually achieve what you are asking about well within the human population there is already a natural variance where some people are toned with very little activity and others can weight train endlessly but experience only nominal gains an evolution towards a natural strength in our human offspring would not actually require any strength training but would only require that these naturally toned individuals who are able to build muscle quickly are able to achieve a heightened reproductive success and that those who tend to be physically weaker do not experience as high a reproductive success there are a few ways that this could happen the first would be a change in our human selective environment where a natural strength or a denser body type would become preferential to our species reproductive success lets say for instance that our planet shifted into a lengthy ice age and somehow our cultural structure disintegrated such that we had to deal with this environment in terms of our physiques morphological expression dense strong body types are much more successful in colder environments so if this became our selective environment then weaker skinnier individuals would experience more frostbite and muscle seizures such that they would not look as desirable to potential mates and or become physically disabled or dead because of this environment so that they were not as reproductively successful in this environment after even a few generations of such a differential reproductive rate the natural frequency of genes that promoted this dense strong body type would be selected for and as more distinct genes which promote this body type matched up from separate parents well their offspring would then stand the chance of acquiring two separate genes which promote this characteristic and be even more prone to a natural strength then their parents another way that this same selective pressure could occur is because of sexual selection some might jump on this quickly and say of course many women prefer a well toned man but to just look at it from this perspective is to miss half of the equation for a natural strength to be selected for over many generations then you would also need sexual selection in the other direction as well you would need a continued preference not only towards men of a dense strong musculature but these same men would have to be attracted to women of a dense strong musculature then this couple and those like them would have to produce more offspring then the average and their children would also have to be attracted to similar body types to continue this sexual selection over many generations as it turns out in the majority of people who have the required body type to perpetuate such a sexual selection are not typically choosing mate choices that would cause such a change by either combining genetic traits or in increasing their frequency within the overall gene pool by having more children the least frequent type of evolutionary change is that of mutation but it should also be addressed in the terms of your question since natural strength is not being overly selected for in either our selective environment or through mate choice then if a mutation that caused a greater natural strength were to occur then it would also not be selected for or against and would only maintain a nominal frequency in the population if this gene which increases natural strength however also had another characteristic that allowed those who carried it to experience a greater reproductive success then depending on how preferential to the reproductive success of it's carriers that this other characteristic was it would permit this gene to increase in frequency either be gradually or quite rapidly now usually the genes expression would be related so lets say that the gene acted as a pain suppressant such that muscle mass could build more readily because those who carried this gene were able to do more reps more frequently then those who did not carry this gene perhaps this natural pain suppression also made the pregnancy process more comfortable in those women who carried this gene and because pregnancy is less physically and psychologically demanding these women are able to have lower ibr's inter birth ratios and thus have the ability to have a higher reproductive success in their lifetime anyways the importance of what i'm getting at is that a mutated gene that only promotes natural strength is not enough it would also have to give some other secondary characteristic which would allow a greater reproductive success  Autism Molecular evolution Transsexuality Sociocultural evolution Human sexual behavior Explosive material Water (molecule) Genetic algorithm Urinary

a question about cro magnon and hunter gatherer tribes if cro magnon became the modern man because of the transition from hunter gatherer to farmer then why arent the tribes that stayed hunter gatherers still cro magnon or something similar dukefenton well they were bigger alot stronger and there heads were bigger and a different shape cro magnon is just a name that was applied to one group of european homo sapiens but they are homo sapiens none the less and there is absolutely no physical distinction between hunter gathering homo sapiens to pastoral or agricultural homo sapiens that is why when comparing modern hunter gatherers to modern pastoral or agricultural societies that there is absolutely no significant difference either cro magnon homo sapiens were no bulkier or stronger then homo sapiens are today but this suggestion that they were somehow different which they were not seems to have guided your second answerer astray into somehow concluding that their was some kind of physical advantage to being a cro magnon it seems to me however that he is confusing cro magnon with homo neanderthalensis which cro magnon definitely was not neanderthal was a completely separate hunter gathering species which was competing with the cro magnon european homo sapiens and this competition resulted in these bulkier stronger neanderthals eventually becoming extinct as to why neanderthal was out competed is a completely different topic anyways prehistoric hunter gatherers were homo sapiens and modern hunter gatherers are also homo sapiens some homo sapiens became pastoralists and agriculturalists but they are all still the same homo sapiens  Neanderthal Human Homo (genus) Prehistoric Britain Homo erectus Homo floresiensis Species Hunter-gatherer Stone Age Hominidae Homo heidelbergensis Race Cro-Magnon man Neolithic Europe Human migration Extinction Single-origin hypothesis Scientific classification Olduwan Mutant (fictional) Nephilim Bigfoot Indo-Aryan migration Multiregional hypothesis Origin of language Prehistoric Spain Human extinction Homo habilis Homophobia Anthropology South Africa Carolus Linnaeus Gender The Neanderthal Parallax Created kind Gender-neutral language Ape Cradle of Humanity Linnaean taxonomy History of Africa Mixed martial arts Subspecies Guns, Germs, and Steel Primate Fermi paradox Neolithic Revolution Free trade Anthroposophy Tetrapod Working animal Autism Human sexual behavior Pre-historic art Nietzschean History of the World Sexual selection Australopithecine Homo economicus Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Physics Orc Race (historical definitions) History of South Africa Archaeology Sexual dimorphism Croatia Known Space Heterosexuality Homosexuality and transgender Indigenous peoples Robert A.

who can brief me about axumite civilization the kingdom of aksum or axum was an important trading nation in northeastern africa growing from the proto aksumite period ca th century bc to achieve prominence by the st century ad history located in northern ethiopia and eritrea aksum was deeply involved in the trade from india and the east to the mediterranean aksum is mentioned in the st century ce periplus of the erythraean sea as an important market place for ivory which was exported throughout the ancient world from that place to the city of the people called auxumites there is a five days' journey more to that place all the ivory is brought from the country beyond the nile through the district called cyeneum and thence to adulis periplus of the erythraean sea chap according to the periplus the ruler of aksum in the st century ce was zoscales who besides ruling in aksum also held under his sway two habours on the red sea adulis near massawa and avalites assab he is also said to have been familiar with greek litterature these places from the calf eaters to the other berber country are governed by zoscales who is miserly in his ways and always striving for more but otherwise upright and acquainted with greek literature periplus of the erythraean sea chap in the rd century aksum began interfering in south arabian affairs controlling at times the western tihama region among other areas by the late rd century it had begun minting its own currency and was named by mani as one of the four great powers of his time along with persia rome and china it converted to christianity in or under king ezana and was the first state ever to use the image of the cross on its coins at its height aksum controlled northern ethiopia eritrea northern sudan southern egypt djibouti western somaliland yemen and southern saudi arabia totalling million km aksum was in important participant to international trade from the st century ce periplus of the erythraean sea it was a quasi ally of byzantium against the persian empire of the day and declined after the th century due to unknown reasons but informed speculation suggests the rise of islam heavily impacted its ability to trade with the far east in the era when shipping was limited to coastal navigation as well as cut it off from its principal markets in alexandria byzantium and southern europe after a second golden age in the early th century the kingdom began to decline eventually ceasing its production of coins in the early th century it finally dissolved with the invasion of the pagan or jewish queen gudit in the th or th century resulting in a dark age about which little is known until the rise of the zagwe dynasty origins aksum was previously thought to have been founded by semitic speaking sabaeans who crossed the red sea from south arabia modern yemen on the basis of conti rossini's theories and prolific work on ethiopian history but most scholars now agree that it was an indigenous development scholars like stuart munro hay point to the existence of an older d mt or da'amot kingdom prior to any sabaean migration ca th or th c bc as well as to evidence of sabaean immigrants having resided in ethiopia for little more than a few decades furthermore ge'ez the ancient semitic language of ethiopia is now known to not have derived from sabaean and there is evidence of a semitic speaking presence in ethiopia and eritrea at least as early as bc sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor limited to a few localities and disappearing after a few decades or a century perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the ethiopian civilization of d mt or some proto aksumite state adding more to the confusion there existed an ethiopian city called saba in the ancient period that does not seem to have been a sabaean settlement geography the kingdom of aksum at its height extended across portions of present day eritrea northern ethiopia yemen southern saudi arabia northern somalia djibouti and northern sudan the capital city of the kingdom was aksum now in northern ethiopia other important

why does archeological items sites are buried under the ground this is for my homework many sites and often those best preserved are located near a lake or river sedimentation occurs readily at these sites the artifacts are covered by mu and soil and are this preserved from being scattered or weathered all sites are not covered those that are not are subjected to scavengers which move bones around so they are difficult if not impossible to reconnect wind rain flooding sand etc will damage and destroy artifacts left on the surface therefore the answer is not that all archaeological sites are buried but that those that are covered have the best chance of preservation  Archaeology Desert Archaeological site Erosion Flood geology Burial Opportunity rover Olduwan Irrigation Severe weather terminology (United States) Plain of Jars Mount Pinatubo Geography of Albania River Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Great Lakes Lake Soil Natural disaster Glacier Sedimentary rock Sewage treatment Disaster Avalanche Evidence of evolution Oxyrhynchus Carnivorous plant Mummy Trace fossil 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Pompeii Tank Sediment Collecting fossils National Weather Service Soil science Campfire Flood Swiss plateau Anchor Shipwreck Weather lore Dune Roswell UFO incident Tropical cyclone Clothing Death Valley National Park Land mine Olympic National Park 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Deluge (mythology) Dromornithidae Dallas, Texas Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Eutrophication Dartmoor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Eolian Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Flood plain Geography of India Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Zion National Park Balikpapan Dam New Madrid Seismic Zone Tulkarm Decomposition Pok__mon Abilities Indian Ocean Thar Desert Indus Valley Civilization Hohokam Titan (moon) Albedo Archaeological field survey Grand Teton National Park Climate of Salt Lake City Stalag Luft III Sutherland Shire Tornado Yosemite National Park Florida Keys Weather satellite Drainage Geography of Egypt Stone Age Great Flood of 1993 Metal detector Artifact (archaeology) Mount Mazama Desertification Great Pyramid of Giza Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Weathering Nile Radar Noah's Ark

why are many people so bad at looking after themselves animals in fact are better at it and many claim we are superior to animals granted we tend to live longer than animals but that's biology perhaps it's because if an animal doesn't look after itself then an infection could lead to their untimely death or living a life of pain where as humans have the luxury of hospital facilities or dental facilities in the event that we overly neglect our bodies i'm not saying that this is intentional but more of a subconscious realization that if our bad habits of ignoring our bodies health and dental hygine is pushed to the limit that we as an intelligent species do have alternatives for dealing with the consequences  Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine Ebola Goodness and value theory Human Nicomachean Ethics Motivation Vitamin C Extinction Chronic fatigue syndrome Tooth AIDS reappraisal Utilitarianism Animal testing Dentistry Peter Singer Ranma __ characters Rocky Mountain spotted fever Herpes simplex virus Tooth enamel Sleep Chiropractic Zoophilia Abortion debate Human nature Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Yoga Sutras of Patanjali University of Indonesia Fermi paradox Infantilism Intelligent design Theory of conduct Raw food diet Evolutionism Theodicy Publicly funded medicine Meme Babe Ruth Creationism Psychology Guinea pig Non-native pronunciations of English Ecology Iraq and weapons of mass destruction The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Soul Tsetse fly Person 28 Days Later Biodiversity Economics Childbirth Extraterrestrial life Mobile phone radiation and health Evolutionary creationism Summa Theologiae Creation-evolution controversy Teleological argument Endocarditis Animal rights Sexual orientation Health science Dog Medicare (Canada) Thermoregulation Life expectancy Speciesism Malaria Cat Female genital cutting Ferret Methamphetamine Rabies Capital punishment Health insurance Whale Religion Self-harm Psychiatric hospital Brain Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle AIDS Cancer Daredevil Ethics New Age Kain (Legacy of Kain) Terri Schiavo Immortality Gray Wolf Original sin Insurance Intravenous therapy Sociobiology Macroevolution Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Marine biology

what is the best explanation for the kind of work done by the louis and mary leakey this is for my summer project and i would like a good answer please it would be easy to simply say that the leakey's were archaeologists but let me give you the inside scoop as a person who has actually worked in their family's domain and knows about the family's political meddling this should make your summer project much more interesting the work done by the leakey family is that of impeding research in east african archaeology many external archaeologists scientists don't even want to step foot in east african archaeology because it is well understood that the leakeys own the political backing of hominid research in east africa and as of such if a non leakey affiliated archaeologist were to find anything hominid then they are expected to report it immediately and evacuate the dig site so that the leakey's crew may then come in and take over the site on top of this the leakeys have also blocked other activities that sought to increase archaeological knowledge such as the suggestion that was made last year that national museums of kenya nmk should be allowed to circulate their archaeology collections so that other archaeologists scientists could have better access to it in better equipped laboratories and that such a relationship may reinvigorate other archaeologists to do more research in east africa once they are more familiar with the collections nmk's collections include the olduvai artifacts as the leakey's carried all of this material out of tanzania as it turned out the leakeys pretended that this would detract from tourism which is rubbish as i hardly think that other archaeologists make up the bulk of kenyan tourists also since the collections which are on display are actually just casts as regular tourists don't know the difference greater tourism is really not affected at all in fact if other archaeologists became interested in the collections if anything this process of circulating the collections would not just provide nmk more revenue to improve their own labs and facilities but it would also attract a nominal increase in tourism because of the few archaeologist who may in fact want to stand up to the leakey monopoly and try and make a footing for themselves in east african archaeology the valuable hominid collections of nmk are currently kept in a secure vault where few ever enter these days thus stymieing a continued research on these collections these vaults are not accessible to tourists so besides the rare hi jacked archaeological dig or university lectures at affiliated universities what do the leakey's do their largest contribution is playing political games that stagnate east african archaeological research concerning hominid remains the majority of external archaeologists working in kenya are instead studying the artifacts left by hominids such as stone tools cut marked bones and evidence of fire pits as to stumble upon an actual hominid remain promises to ruin their expedition and wreck the continuity of the data with which they were collecting when the leakey's crew barges in ps i will add that the political era of the leakey family truly began with their son richard leakey who even worked completely outside of archaeology at times and was even a major part of president moi's dream team for rehabilitating kenyan political structures and paristatals hence the families residual political influence meave who married richard to join into the leakey family is not bad and keeps her nose clean but their daughter louise leakey is a complete terror she and her father richard were the ones who blocked the idea of circulating the collections she also has a venomous relationship with jack harris who is the primary contending archaeologist in the koobi fora region and leads the koobi fora field school which is what gives him most of his clout in the area because of the field school's relationship with the department of home affairs and nmk which conveniently pays some nice salaries to some kenyans involved with the field school and thus affords jack a fraction of the political influence that the leakeys possess on a separate note louise is despised by the pastoralist indigenous populations of northern kenya their migratory routes frequently bring them to the edge or even slightly into sibiloi national park and it are not beyond louise to buzz their livestock in her plane causing the livestock to stampede out of the park frequently injuring themselves charging through the rough terrain of that area since livestock is the primary economy of these people you can imagine how hurting or even causing the death of their livestock tends to be quite inflammatory some of the dasenech which i met said that they are not reluctant to purposely shooting at her plane in the hopes of a lucky hit the politics of east african archaeology is insane  Archaeology Plame affair

question for evolutionists if we came from monkeys why dont we still i mean i dont see monkeys carrying around babys i dont mean to be offinsive im just looking for out side oppinions the first concept to understand in this discussion is that humans did not evolve from contemporary apes or monkeys our evolutionary precursor was what is called a common ancestor who was ape but not recognizable as a modern ape the next step in answering your question is to understand what evolution is evolution is conditional on variability within a population and how this variation is selected for within the environment via reproductive success this is the primary aspect of evolution important to this discussion now not only are modern apes not our common ancestor but they have also followed their own separate evolutionary paths since our divergence from our common ancestor our closest relatives chimpanzees and bonobos have continued to evolve during their million years of separate evolution to their distinct environments of course seeing as their generational spacing is large like it is with humans this evolution is more difficult to see within a small time frame as well evolution however is based primarily on reproductive success whereby the most fit individuals within given environments will produce the most offspring and the characteristics which provided that success will spread amongst the group let me give you some examples of evolution occurring within chimpanzees and bonobos these two primate species diverged from our common ancestor around mya and then consequently split from their shared common ancestor mya in this time an array of distinct differences have evolved that make these two species very distinguishable from one another and these differences are clearly from environmental pressures the bonobos for instance practice bipedalism much more frequently then chimpanzees and also have a drastically different means of conflict resolution where as chimpanzees are much more quadrepedal aggressive and competitive so why have these characteristics sprung up in the mere my since these two groups were isolated from each other because of the changing flow of a river which geographically split their common ancestor into two groups well the bonobos were restricted into a more swamp like arboreal environment which was confined in space where as the chimpanzees were left in a savanna arboreal mixed environment which was expansive the swampy aspect of the bonobo habitat forced them to practice bipedalism frequently because their terrain was not fully traversable without adapting to this strategy periodically those individuals who were better adapted became better foragers in providing access to resources and removing these same food resources from swampy areas and this characteristic has been selected for over generations chimpanzees meanwhile have found great success in being primarily quadrapedal because the mixed arboreal savanna environment has no selective advantage towards being bipedal much to the chagrin of contemporary anthropology i wish that they could look at the primates that have adapted more bipedalism proboscis for traversing mangrove forests crab eating macaques when carrying their shellfish to shore japanese macaques when bathing in the hot springs before jumping to their foolish mixed hypothesis conclusion the other differential traits between bonobos and chimpanzees that are very apparent are in how they deal with conflict resolution bonobos who live in a confined environment rarely result in full out conflict they have a culture of threat displays and sexual resolution techniques that are fully employed before conflict arises this includes running bipedaly while dragging sticks to penis fencing to female genital genital rubbing they appear to be bi sexual at first but upon further observation it becomes obvious that these rituals are all about relieving stress and combativeness in a controlled manner and they are not actually sex crazy primates as some have portrayed them quite honestly because of their confined space this group of primates can not afford to fight aggressively because conflicts would be too frequent and too costly to the group so other means of conflict resolution have formed to adapt to this confined environment chimpanzees alternatively do not have this confined environment and are an ultra competitive group of primates who tend to use physical dominance to acquire a higher ranking thus hopefully attaining more reproductive opportunities chimpanzees have also been observed to conduct warfare and will murder males from neighbouring groups and they have clearly defined territories if bonobos were to live like this they would no longer exist today because their troops show much more overlap between one another and conflicts and murders would have become far to commonplace if they lived like chimpanzees research at yerkes primate research center has utilized interactive and educational tools to determine the cognitive abilities of both of these primate species and as would be expected and corroborates what field observations would predict bonobos are much better communicators where as chimpanzees are much better tool makers so evolution has continued in our closest relatives since our divergence with them yet they have not become much more like us over that period as you can see all primates including humans are in a constant state of evolution if an environment on a macro scale is no longer very influential like is seen with humans especially then there is little reason for any noticeable phenotypic expression that might cause noticeable morphological changes undoubtedly however the environment on a micro scale is much more active due to the extremely short generational cycle of micro organisms and as of such this rapidly changing micro environment is constantly being adapted to and evolution at this level is very apparent within all primates clearly evolution has not stopped in any primate species human or other but considering that evolution is from a common ancestor and not from any contemporary species then there is a questions that is equivalent to yours which may put yours into perspective if evolution is true and chimpanzees have evolved from humans then why do we not see humans carrying around chimpanzee babies after all both of these species are equidistant from our common ancestor so the coin may be flipped evolution is not progressive simply adaptive and chimpanzees are just as well adapted to their environment as humans are at modifying our own environments instead of adapting to them when you pretend that modern species are equivalent to a common ancestor then the coin can be flipped and it starts to sound pretty ridiculous i hope that this clarifies your question for you  Culture Psychology Science Many-worlds interpretation Human skin color

possible reasons for the decline and fall of the indus civilization discuss some of the possible reasons for the decline and fall of the indus civilization include any environmental reasons climate change is the most accepted reason the area became drier and hotter water sources began to disappear the soil became more sandy and as a result regular flood patterns turned to flash flood events carrying away what soil nutrients were left it becomes a viscous cycle similarities can be seen in maya civilization changes in weather patterns caused flooding and erosion until complex society read city was no longer sustainable at this point the birth rate plummets population declines and disperses as disease becomes harder to resist in dense population due to poor nutrition warfare is another likely result though the evidence of this is more difficult to see as it is likely small roving gangs but the main cause is climate weather changes  Indus Valley Civilization Effects of global warming Global warming and agriculture Shifting cultivation Climate change Sea level rise Erosion Deforestation Geography of India Desert Severe weather terminology (United States) Desertification Neolithic Revolution El Ni__o Agriculture Eutrophication Water Soil pH Solar variation Lake Soil science Climate of the United Kingdom Flood geology River Energy development Oceanic trench Carnivorous plant Airport Geography of Brazil Vegetation Global climate model Geography of Pakistan Wetland Dam Civilization Leaf Climate of Salt Lake City Organic farming Irrigation Nutrient Ionizing radiation Soils retrogression and degradation Green Revolution Earth Surtsey Stream Puberty Coral reef Simone Weil National Weather Service Population history of American indigenous peoples Disaster Permian-Triassic extinction event Alfalfa Death Valley National Park Shrimp farm Opportunity rover Bangladesh Urban heat island Terminal ballistics Urban planning Geography of Turkey Geography of South Korea Overpopulation Ghaggar-Hakra River Surveillance Jet engine Geography of China Gaia theory (science) Democracy Manawatu-Wanganui Easter Island Soil Renewable energy Digital photography Drought Famine Ozone depletion Glacier Vegetarianism Dry cleaning DNA repair Nile Hydroponics Stone Age Organic food Meteorology History of India Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Zambezi Global cooling Sustainable agriculture Florida Keys DDT

should i just go ahead and get my b a in anthropology or not so here's the deal i majored in anthropology with a minor in criminology hoping to go into forensics or something along those lines apparently i didn't do enough research and after talking to someone i found out that maybe if i wanted to go into forensics i probably should have majored in biology instead of anthropology but the problem is that i am only a couple semesters away from graduation and i really don't have the money or the time to start over and major in biology so should i just get my degree in anthropology and specialize when i go to graduate school or what i know that anthropology is a broad field and there is a lot i can do i know that i probably need to talk with my advisors but i am curious if anyone has been in this situation and might have any advice and to be honest i am not so sure anymore if i want to go into forensics i am still thinking about that sorry if this question is confusing i just got my degree in anthropology and i am in graduate school studying forensics yes you do need a biology background however you can obtain that in grad school like i am doing since you are so close to getting your degree i would go for it it is such an amazing experience to graduate with your b a or b s also don't let people tell you that you can't find jobs in anthropology i had jobs lined up in anthropology before i graduated good luck to you in whatever you choose  Graduate school Psychology Ethics Medicine Science Anthropology Sexual orientation Forensics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Criminology Dentistry Education in the United States Margaret Mead Education in Portugal Lawyer Georgetown University Education in Germany Psychiatry Economics American University Education in Romania Gary Snyder Education in the People's Republic of China Physician Simon Fraser University Chinese University of Hong Kong Milton H.

i believe in the possibility of evolution however since all primates share a common ancestor is it possible that human evolution did not follow the paths of the apes and chimps before it branched into the line that eventually became human but followed a more direct path of evolution just an american it would be all well in good if i knew which species is what as i don't speak latin bravazoloo sp i'm not going back that far so you're asking if the human lineage branched from the ancestral primate line before that line branched into the apes sounds like the monkeys lemurs and tarsiers http news bbc co uk olmedia images primate info gif the lineage or evolutionary history of any species is reflected in its genes we share so much of our genome with the apes because we are apes we are anthropoid primates in the family hominidae african apes and humans subfamily homininae humans genus homo and all our extinct bipedal predecessors and cousins the human genome varies less than or from the rest of our evolutionary cousins the hominids apes if our line had branched earlier the evidence would be in our genes  Hominidae Human evolution Evolution Human Chimpanzee Incertae sedis Haplorrhini Scientific classification Aquatic ape hypothesis Lemur Chimpanzee Genome Project Mammal Race Biology Australopithecus afarensis Common Chimpanzee Neanderthal Homo (genus) Evidence of evolution Biped Olduwan Homo habilis Species Linnaean taxonomy Gene Lemuridae Multiregional hypothesis Hair Ape extinction Y chromosome Cladistics Anthropology Human extinction Bigfoot Human genome Whale Single-origin hypothesis Ramapithecus Paranthropus Sociocultural evolution Homo erectus Richard Owen Galago Cradle of Humanity Race (historical definitions) Evolutionary psychology Junk DNA Bioinformatics Lorisidae Polyploidy Human Genome Project Senescence Mycoplasma Mountain Gorilla Murinae Dinosaur Democratic Republic of the Congo Stone Age Dog Cryptozoology Indo-Aryan migration Old World monkey HIV Orangutan Transposon Homology (biology) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Gibbon Terence McKenna Bonobo Philippine Tarsier Extinction Brain Indridae Barbary Macaque The Origin of Species Banana Jeffrey H.

can anthropologists fall in love with their informant or will their ethnography be considered invalid since non objective yeah why not dodatz that's what i am talkin' bout britanny this is a question in the anthropology department not in the hello anybody's home department tjb i always got in trouble with other fellow anthropologists for my weird sense of humor he i even got in bigger trouble when i maintained that i consider an ethnography by an anthropologist in love of even greater value than the one done by a dry toast anthropo just kiddin' tonight's is no fun people are so serious anyway thank you tjb and keep up the good work as an anthropologist who has fallen in love i can categorically state yes as to the additional comments huh dam all you had to do was say you were an anthropologist too and all would have been clear there is a big difference in a joke between two anthropologists and some random nut ball as opposed to an anthropological nut ball making some random statement keep on confusing the masses and the anthropologists too  Anthropology Cultural relativism Franz Boas Sexual orientation Late Night with Conan O'Brien Bayesian probability Culture Mojave people Clown I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Whose Line Is It Anyway?
